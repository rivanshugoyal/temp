0,21-1-20,Social experiment gone awry,"Because of CAA, even the NRC exercise gets debunked. This gives a further jolt to ethnonationalist identities, who take CAA to be a bigger threat than illegal immigration

Do those among the linguistic and religious minorities of Assam, who have failed the test of citizenship in the recently-concluded updation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), become the soft target of the heightened cry for protection of indigenous identity in Assam and North-east India? With the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), one section of those left out of the NRC now gets an opportunity to be citizens, solely on the basis of religion, while another section remains ignored. Does such a contrived outcome make anyone happy in Assam?

Assam’s Bengali-origin religious minorities, popularly called Miyas or Bhatiyas in Brahmaputra Valley and Bangals in Barak Valley face the biggest threat of proving their credentials after being left out of the NRC. Those excluded will now have to prepare for a complicated legal battle to prove their citizenship through the Foreigners’ Tribunals. These tribunals are supposed to decide the fate of an estimated five lakh presumed illegals and how many would succeed in such a trial is anyone’s guess. The tribunals, governed by the Foreigners’ Act, 1946, place the “onus of proof” on the suspect and not on the prosecution, making it difficult for a “suspect” to get natural justice. As citizenship is considered the most basic right to have or not to have all other rights, the shifting of the “onus of proof” makes it extremely difficult for anyone to prove credentials. Worse is the case when the tribunals at random ex-parte declare too many people foreigners. Many of those people have been put in inhumane detention camps in six places, numbering around a thousand, of which 23 have already died in custody.

The protest against the CAA remains silent on this humanitarian crisis and the ignominy of effacing these unfortunate excluded people from public discourse. With the coming of CAA, a section of these excluded people now wait for some redemption, while another section silently prepares for a long and uncertain legal battle that lies ahead. Both the sections, however, face another cultural test of proving their antecedents, which could be satisfied only by accepting the dominant language of the State.

Any democratic movement, such as one currently against the CAA, should have taken into account the plight of these people. But they are looked upon as “foreigners” and “illegal immigrants” whose very presence threatens indigenous language and culture. This is how, much of the protesters favour the NRC to weed them out while they reject the CAA. The CAA bears the signature of sheltering “persecuted religious minorities from three neighbouring countries” and thereby changes the rules of the game with which the NRC was carried out. Because of CAA, even the NRC exercise gets automatically debunked. This gives a further jolt to ethnonationalist identities, who take CAA to be a bigger threat than illegal immigration. The layered and nuanced ideas of citizenship as indigenity stand in contrast to granting citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants on the basis of religion. In effect, old faultlines between indigenous ethnic identity and non-indigenous Indian citizens is reinvoked, turning both the CAA and NRC exercise as detrimental to the language, land and culture of ethnic groups. The question is no longer just saving the indigenous habitats of North-east from illegals but it is also a question of “protective discrimination” for the native and the indigenous from non-indigenous Indian citizens. The land policy of the Government of Assam stated clearly why non-indigenous citizens, being settlers cannot buy/own land.

CAA’s exclusion of the Sixth Schedule tribal States from its ambit created a sense of heightened anxiety in Assam and Tripura for being forced to accept those non-indigenous settler immigrants who would be legalised by the CAA. The possible demographic impact and squeeze on language and culture has reinvoked the fear of getting outnumbered. To rein in such a majoritarian impact of the CAA, there are rising demands for introduction of an Inner Line Permit (ILP) system to physically restrict the movement of other citizens from outside the State.

In a sense, the CAA meets its toughest resistance from such demands of protective discrimination, as it would further alienate the North-east and its people from the mainstream while ensuring their specific rights. Certainly this would negatively impact economic transaction between the North-east and the rest of India and as a corollary break the idea of seamless economic connections with South and South-east Asian countries, as mooted in the Act East Policy of the Centre.

The governance structure of States in the North-east seemingly is not able to face the implosion of sentiments of ethnic and indigenous groups against the CAA and is also unable to contain the fight against the CAA from relapsing into a full fight against the State and the Government. In an Assam-specific way, a slew of measures like amendment to Article 345, 347 and Article 371B to ensure protection of Ahomia as the State language, culture and identity of the people of Assam has been announced by the State Government to neutralise the anti-CAA protests, but social organisations are not convinced of some measures. They argued that if protective measures had preceded CAA, probably it would not have become such a big protest. The shift of focus in the protest from illegal immigrants to strict measures of protection in Assam and Tripura not only created an alternative political discourse of pre-colonial identity assertion and securing of homelands, but it also harmed those who are supposed to benefit from the CAA, notably the Hindu Bengalis. This change into community affirmation rigidly redraws several boundaries, creates a reverse discrimination towards the beneficiaries of the CAA by uniting everyone else.

The announcement of the National Population Register (NPR) at the national level and much of the resistance to the idea that the NPR and National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC) are the same arose from transmission of Northeastern reactions to the mainland due to greater visibility of protests in the North-east. After the first wave of protests in the North-east, major Indian cities witnessed a stir against the NPR and NRC exercise that are supposed to supplement CAA by separating the infiltrators from persecuted religious minorities. This inherently differentiating tenor of CAA made a nationwide resurgence of demands for a caste census and rejection of any test of citizenship. The dystopic Assam experience occupied much of the national imagination in calling for a boycott of NPR cum NRIC, especially when CAA makes it clearer for whom the bell will toll.

The fear and anxiety surrounding the new entries relating to father’s birthplace and date of birth in the NPR format and dropping of all Muslim festivals from the list of holidays, as suggested in the NPR, create a bigger sense of discrimination. The sense of protection generated out of fear of being outnumbered in the North-east feeds this fear of discrimination at the national level and vice-versa. Although fear transmits easily, yet the cause and purpose of anti-CAA protests also remain different between North-east and the rest of India. The question of defending the Constitution, an essential part of the pan-Indian discourse of resistance to CAA finds very little speck in the North-east where the it is more about protection from the non-indigenous and the illegals. The convergences and the divergences are both ingenuous as they promise to set up new equations and alliances between social identities. The beauty of such disjointed resistance to the CAA is that it gives rise to a new form of federal relations. How the Government manages it will decide the future course of politics in India.

It is also worth nothing the debates centering around some of the States opposing implementation of the CAA and their moves by filing cases against it in the Supreme Court. Interestingly enough, Arunachal Pradesh, being a State with ILP is exempted from CAA, yet it has decided to file a petition in the apex court opposing any procedure to grant citizenship to Chakma and Hajong refugees. It is also widely contended that the CAA might lead to exodus of tribal refugees from CAA-exempted tribal States of the North-east to Tripura and Assam, where they can apply for citizenship through CAA. The case of Bengali Hindu refugees in Bodoland Territorial Council of Assam is even more dismal, as they have to move out of areas falling under the council and resettle in a neighbouring district within Assam to become eligible to apply under CAA. While these anomalies continue, the lived reality of “illegal immigrants” continues to be difficult, as they try to survive through double-edged laws granting benefit and withholding them at the same time.

4,21-1-20,TFL to produce 1.27-MMTPA neem-coated urea,"The coal gasification-based urea plant of the Talcher Fertilizers Ltd (TFL), which is set to be commissioned by 2023, would have an output of 1.27 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA) of neem-coated urea.

The plant would ensure easy availability of urea in Odisha and adjoining States, informed Secretary, Department of Fertilisers Chhabilendra Roul at a Press meet here on Monday.

The TFL, a joint venture of GAIL, CIL and RCF, would implement the revival of the FCIL Talcher.

The plant would promote alternative use of abundantly available domestic coal in an environment friendly manner. It would produce 2.38 million metric standard cubic meter per day (MMSCMD) natural gas equivalent synthesis gas (syngas) from coal leading to reduction in import bill of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

The ammonia urea complex being set up at Talcher would have a design capacity of 2,200 tonne per day (TPD) of ammonia and 3,850 TPD of urea. The plant would produce around 100 TPD of sulphur flakes as a saleable byproduct.

The gasification process to be adopted at Talcher unit will emit negligible amount of sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides and free particle emissions as compared to directly coal fired processes. Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas which is emitted from coal, would be partially captured in closed loop process and recycled for production of urea.

The project is expected to significantly improve the quality of life and socio-economic status of the people in the area as it will generate opportunities in the form of direct and indirect employment in the region.

Up to 10,000 people are expected to be employed during the construction period and over 4,000 direct/indirect employment opportunities once the plant comes under operation.

Commitment of more than Rs 8,000 crore has already been made so far by the TFL under various awarded contracts.

The TFL has been allotted captive coal mine in the Talcher region to run the plant. Mine development activity has commenced.

Environment clearance and CCEA approval for RCF equity contribution have been received. An MoU has been signed with the IOCL for supply of pet coke to the plant.

The Wuhuan, which has been awarded the job for coal gasification and ammonia/urea package, has prepared the basic design (BDP) and an detailed engineering is underway. Site mobilisation is expected by end of the current financial year.

Pre-project activities like site grading and construction of power and water supply systems are near completion and another major job related to construction of roads, culverts, drains etc is underway.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tfl-to-produce-1-27-mmtpa-neem-coated-urea.html
5,21-1-20,Rare shark fish caught off Puri coast,"A very rare fish was sold at a throwaway price after being caught with a net off the sea coast here on Monday.

The fish weighing 20-25 kg was said to be a White Shark or Carcharodon Carcharias.

Locals said this species of shark fish are caught in fishing nets frequently in the sea here. But as fishermen are unaware about the identity of the species, they sell them to traders at Rs 3,000 a kg while the traders then sell them at more than Rs 30,000 in other States.

Local fishermen sell this species of fish to traders at low prices considering it to be of normal saltwater category.

A forest official said, “Fishing of such species of shark is illegal and attracts punishment as equivalent to poaching a tiger in forest. Such species of shark is usually found in sea off Puri.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rare-shark-fish-caught-off-puri-coast.html

8,21-1-20,A new lurking danger,"The three-day Ijtema organised by the Tablighi Jamaat last year points towards a larger trend of home-grown radicalism within the country. Radicalisation of the vulnerable must end

Few would have missed the videos of children (under 10 years of age) chanting azadi and abusing the Prime Minister and Home Minister for alleged animosity and evil intent towards one community. Since one cannot expect children of such tender age to have knowledge or understanding of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR), it is safe to conclude that family elders tutored them to express such visceral anger towards the Government.

A dangerous radicalisation of the Muslim community is being fostered — with deliberate intent — the consequences of which are yet to unravel. Barring perhaps Saudi Arabia, it is doubtful if even Islamic countries make girls of such tender age wear full abaya (head and neck covering). Certainly, it has not been seen in India before. This points to deep indoctrination of every family within a targetted area and does not bode well for the future.

On the one hand, it will intensify the ghetto mentality within the community. On the other, it will make other citizens wary of dealing with those who wish to leave or avoid the ghetto. This is a double-edged sword that can only harm the Muslim community in the long and short run.

Doubtless, a powerful section of the community is behind the radicalisation agenda, for reasons unknown. The first indication of this phenomenon came during the three-day Ijtema (religious gathering) organised by Tablighi Jamaat (November 30 to December 2, 2018), when 15 lakh Muslims gathered at Bulandshahr, Uttar Pradesh, though permission was given for only two lakh people. Many guests came from abroad.

The proceedings of this gathering are not known. It attracted national attention when some cows were killed in a village on the road to Bulandshahr. Police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh died in the violence that followed but managed to contain the situation within the affected village. The Ijtema concluded peacefully but analysts said such a large gathering should not have been permitted in such a sensitive State and by such an orthodox body. Tablighi Jamaat exhorts Muslims to strictly follow practices adhered to during the lifetime of the Prophet, especially in matters of dress and ritual. All traces of non-Islamic (syncretic) behaviour are to be erased.

This converges with a larger trend of home-grown radicalism within the country. After the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the Indian Mujahideen (IM) were banned, the Kerala-based Popular Front of India (PFI) emerged as the successor militant body and spread to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar.

Experts expect the Islamic State (IS) to formally tie up with the PFI to entrench itself in India and reach Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Sri Lanka has already been radicalised by people who visited southern India before the Easter blasts in 2019. Several youth from Kerala have travelled to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to join the IS; others have been caught doing online propaganda for it. Intelligence agencies are aware that the IS is attracting youth in India and in May 2019, it announced a new “Wilayah of Hind” (Hind Province) without specifying its geographical limits.

The Counterterrorism Group (CTG) Analysis & Intelligence Report (November 2019) states that after being driven out of Syria and the Middle East, the IS asked its leaders to move to South-east Asia as almost every country in this region has deep ties to the Middle East. Its focus is on female domestic workers in Hong Kong and Singapore, who are vulnerable on various counts; Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines are next.

Female migrant workers are chosen because of their low (but stable) incomes, familiarity with English and wide network of international connections. Typically, they earn around $1.00 to $1.50 per hour and are often in need of financial help, for which they agree to join the Caliphate. English-speaking workers help the IS reach other demographics and regions. They help it acquire resources and intelligence from areas its members normally don’t frequent.

Migrant workers are easy to manipulate as they are poorly educated, live in an alien environment and are lonely. Radicalisation usually begins after a traumatic event such as divorce, financial hardship or culture shock. The recruiter contacts the most vulnerable and offers a secure, romantic, and loving relationship; soon the migrant is invited for training via online chat rooms. Often migrants are recruited by fellow workers at a prayer group or social gathering on their day off. Some workers have been known to reach out to militants; they are quickly inducted into radical groups and groomed to become militants.

In a survey of radicalised domestic workers, the Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC) found that at least 50 Indonesian women working overseas as maids, nannies and caretakers for the elderly were radicalised by the IS and its affiliates. A study between 2013 and 2018 found that around 800 domestic workers from South-east Asia tried to enter Syria or Iraq to join the IS after being radicalised abroad. This shows the efficacy of the IS’ recruitment methods. IPAC has asked Governments to create mandatory training modules to educate migrant workers about the signs of exploitation and to help exploited victims.

In September 2019, Singapore arrested three Indonesian women domestic workers who promoted the IS online in their spare time, donated money to militants overseas and became so committed that at least one was ready to die as a suicide bomber in Syria. One Indonesian maid revealed that she listened to Salafi podcasts while working and an Indonesian butcher she met online encouraged her to go to Syria to join the IS. However, the Singapore authorities discovered her plans and deported her back to Indonesia in 2017.

Zachary Abuza, expert on IS in South-east Asia at the National War College, Washington, says the real stuff happens in dedicated chat rooms on encrypted apps — from bomb designs to active coordination. The female recruits serve as financiers, recruiters and coordinators; they collect funds from radicalised maids and send them to domestic jihadist groups. India is sitting on a tinderbox. When elementary school children chant obnoxious slogans against the nation and its top leadership, the masterminds behind the scenes should ponder what poison harvest they will reap from these toxic seeds. Azadi cannot hide behind the tiranga; India will never submit to further loss of territory.

9,21-1-20,Centre must not lose the vision,"Nobody would like solar and wind power generators also to turn into NPAs with the key parameters being compromised

The national vision of infrastructure services, which raises the quality of life and ease of living in India to global standards, sets the context of the recently-unveiled National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) for the next five years. Projects in energy, roads, railways, urban, rural and social infrastructure constitute the NIP. Of the `102 lakh crore outlay of the NIP, energy takes the lion’s share at 24 per cent of the total investment. Within the energy sector, the share of conventional power, renewable and nuclear energy is 48 per cent, 38 per cent and six per cent respectively. About 42 per cent of the projects are already under implementation whereas 19 per cent are under development and 31 per cent are in the conceptual stage. In both the latter categories, key projects are in the renewable energy sector. According to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the Central and State Governments would have an equal share of 39 per cent each in the NIP. The private sector, on the other hand, would have a 22 per cent share, which the Government expects to increase to 30 per cent by 2025.

Elaborating on the energy sector vision 2025, the NIP Task Force envisages an increase in the total installed capacity from the present 356 GW to 619 GW. Furthermore, it expects the share of thermal power to come down from 66 per cent to 50 per cent while the share of renewables rises from 22 per cent to 39 per cent in 2025. Indeed, renewable energy’s share in consumption is envisioned to reach 19 per cent from the present nine per cent. The continued thrust on energy transition is certainly encouraging. Interestingly, unlike the conventional power sector where only six per cent of the NIP is implemented by the private sector, in the renewable energy sector, 100 per cent of implementation would be by the private sector.

Without going into the merits of the projected capacity of 619 GW in a decelerating economy at a time when the existing capacity is either severely underutilised or stressed, the private sector’s appetite to reach 241 GW in five years has to be viewed critically. Reasons for slippages in the 12th Five Year Plan outlined in India’s National Electricity Plan, 2018 include problems in acquisition of land; issues in timely completion of power evacuation systems plus capacity of the transmission system and issues in availability of adequate finances from banks and financial institutions.

In fact, even now, the challenges pertaining to land availability, transmission infrastructure/connectivity, inordinate payment delays, and discoms’ disinclination to sign Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for renewable energy continue to act as roadblocks to the sector’s growth. On top of it is the tendency of some discoms to renegotiate the existing PPAs because of an excessive obsession with low tariffs elsewhere, without understanding the dynamics of renewable energy technologies. All these factors ultimately have put a dampener on the sentiments of private players. The spate of tender cancellations or multiple rounds of re-bidding is a testimony to this troubling trend.

This in turn has resulted in a perception of political peril among the renewable energy industry, something that would have been unimaginable earlier. Couple it with the risk-averse approach of financial institutions on one hand and a general lack of appetite for new investments by the private sector on the other, and we have a scenario not exactly conducive to implementation of renewable energy projects.

While several Government initiatives such as reverse auctions and ultra-mega solar parks successfully catapulted this sector to commendable heights, it is time for the Government to provide another push by working proactively to remove already well-recognised bottlenecks. A consistent policy regime with long-term visibility is a prerequisite to encourage private sector investments, whether domestic or foreign. Unfortunately, even at the Central level, lack of clarity on various aspects such as applicable GST and safeguard duty did actually disrupt the pace that the industry had gathered. As electricity is a concurrent subject between the Centre and States it adds another layer of complexity. A conducive policy environment at the Centre alone is not sufficient unless it is backed by an equally supportive State-level policy framework. Discoms being the primary buyers of renewable electricity, whether from large plants or from distributed solar energy, their financial health and willingness to purchase renewable electricity play a crucial role. Curtailment from renewable energy generators, overdue payments and reluctance in adopting solar energy are not only indicators of archaic mindsets but are roadblocks. This reinforces the urgent need for reforms in the power sector — much more fundamental and structural than the ones undertaken so far, backed by strong political will. It is equally important to recognise the risks associated with unviable tariffs. No one would like solar and wind power generators also to turn into NPAs with the key parameters being compromised for the sake of artificially created tariff caps. Against this background, it would be crucial for the Centre to seize the initiative to take along the States, bringing them on board for effective delivery through the infrastructure pipeline.

10,21-1-20,BJP’s new chief,"J P Nadda is being considered a proxy for Shah but has organisational strengths of his own. Will he be allowed to rise?

When LK Advani was the BJP president and clearly the more “seen” face of a resurgent Right, having steered the Rathyatra and the temple campaign in Ayodhya, he stepped back and proposed the name of the moderate and avuncular Atal Bihari Vajpayee as the party’s prime ministerial candidate. That was in 1995 and Advani’s wisdom lay in understanding why governance needed a softer, inclusive and acceptable face and a broader alliance with other parties. He had the foresight to set the foundation upon which a winning formula could be built. In that sense, the BJP president’s post became important in carving out a legitimate space for the Right within the coalition template of the times and ensuring that it emerged as a sound electoral alternative to the Left of Centre Congress-dominated narrative. That was a tough time of building and managing the party, positing all that the Congress was fast-losing — a credible organisational decorum, regular elections, fair processes and an inner-party democracy. To that extent, the party president’s post was originally intended to be sacred. The arrival of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah clearly changed all that, the two building the BJP’s base not so much by processes but the weight of their persona. While Modi concentrated on building a pan-India image as a trusted leader, deputy Shah took up backroom mathematics and personally weighed in on even the microscopic, unit-level decisions of the party. During his tenure of over five-and-a-half years, Shah’s focussed aggression strengthened the BJP’s matrix and ensured its political conversion as the party’s best ever electoral performance. Barring a few setbacks in State polls, the party has managed to become the single-largest in the Lok Sabha. That gave him more than stature; the cadres held him in awe. And he revelled in the arrogance of that absolutism, pushing most contentious issues in the BJP manifesto as Home Minister in the Government, a man in a hurry to prove his heft in the party than in people’s minds. And now that he is the Home Minister, he is duty-bound to honour the party’s “one person, one post” formula and has handed over its reins to Jagat Prakash Nadda, a loyalist and a low-key worker of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJP’s ideological anchor that, at this point of time, has complete hold of policies and deliverance, and cares not much about realpolitik. In many ways, therefore, Nadda is being considered a proxy for Shah, who would like to be remembered as the usherer of Right wing legacies and a neo-cultural revolution, one that seeks to overturn liberalism as an imposition and Hindu theocracy as the natural evolution of history — the Ram temple, the abrogation of Article 370 and the review of citizenship based on ancestry. Shah wouldn’t want to relinquish this helmsmanship of BJP’s transitional moment. The ascension of Nadda, therefore, seems to be about ticking off the right boxes. Besides, it also allows Shah to escape the heat arising from the citizenship row at the moment. Seen as the architect of the otherisation politics in the country and linking the party’s agenda to Government policy, the delegation of party responsibilities to Nadda is an attempt to seemingly dilute this autocracy.

Nadda may be following Shah’s footsteps but in the end will have to be the media face and explain the BJP’s most difficult phase — keeping the faith of the Lok Sabha verdict and presiding over the social unrest over citizenship. The extent of civil society protests proves that it is fast losing hope in the BJP as a “party with a difference.” If the States the BJP lost after the general election are any indication, then the people now want it to account for its non-performance on the economy and jobs crisis and subversion of social equilibrium through religious polemics. Nadda, while continuing the existing party’s agenda, can do so subtly and use his newness to soothe anxieties through sensible outreach programmes. There are parts to Nadda that the BJP can use smartly to change perceptions before the next round of general elections. A student leader, who has plodded his way up the ranks, he has a grasp on grassroots, having been in-charge of the BJP’s Lok Sabha campaign in Uttar Pradesh and the Maharashtra polls.

11,21-1-20,"Let religion lead to peace, prosperity","Religious leaders and theologians from across the country should come together to review the different faiths from the perspective of pluralism and social justice

Religion has emerged as a major source of conflict across the globe. Ideological strife has now given place to the “clash of civilisations” and it is felt that in the foreseeable future, religion will be a major source of conflict within and among nations. The possibilities of conflict are greater in countries such as India where different cultures and religions meet. However, such clashes can be prevented if appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented at an early stage so as to ensure religious harmony.

The United Nations (UN) designates the first week of February every year as the World Interfaith Harmony Week. All religions lead to the same God and differences among them are not essential. Indeed, the goal of every religion is the same. The spirit of the founders of the different religions was the same though rituals differ. All religions proclaim similar principles.

Mahatma Gandhi, who devoted a large part of his life to the study of religion and discussions with religious leaders of all faiths, affirmed that every scripture should be treated equally, that there is no justification for the claim of supremacy of any one religion and that we are all children of the same God.

He said, “What is needed is a living friendly contact among the followers of the religions of the world and not a clash among them in the fruitless attempt on the part of each community to show the supremacy of its faith over the rest.”

Swami Vivekananda asserted that all religions preach ethics, virtues and good character. Yet, all major religions, instead of uniting people often divide them due to the lack of understanding of the purpose of religion by their followers.

India has the largest number of religions and religious people in the world. In our country, we have millions of Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists. There are also Parsees and Jews. We have eight religions in India, the maximum number of religions and religious people anywhere in the world. Communal harmony is essential for peace and stability in the country.

Article 51A of the Constitution affirms that it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to promote harmony among the people of the nation transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities. Respect for religious diversity and interfaith dialogue are an essential and urgent need.

Some years ago, I decided to study the issues that affect inter-religious peace and harmony in the country. In this connection, I visited several States and held meetings with leaders and organisations of different religions. I spent the whole of September 2004 in the villages of Odisha, in the districts of Kandhamal and Mayurbanj, where Graham Staines and his two sons were killed some years earlier.

The purpose of my visit was to study and understand the open confrontation that has existed for long in that State between Christian and Hindu missionaries for conversion and re-conversion (ghar vapsi) respectively. I informed Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik of what I had observed in those areas and he promised to take necessary action. Mainline Christian theologians see both the Sangh Parivar’s Hindutva ideology and Christian campaigns for evangelisation as having a fundamentalist attitude and an aggressive methodology to achieve their respective goals.

Proselytism is opposed on several grounds; it attacks other religious beliefs and practices and asserts that its own religion is the only way to moksha (salvation). It is often supported by financial resources and marketing techniques that make local religious activities seem shabby.

The Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences (FABC) articulates its theological vision thus, “Asia is the womb of the great world religions. All great scriptural religions were born on Asian soil. The Church has to be in constant dialogue with the religions of Asia and to embark on this with great seriousness… There may be more truth about God and life than is made known to us through the Church. As such, Christians who take Jesus Christ’s injunction seriously must search for this truth in the various religions of the world.”

On the question of proselytism, the FABC says, “A phenomenon which continues to awaken the most resentment among the peoples of Asia is that of proselytism and conversion. In the minds of Asians, the Church’s primary objective seems to be to convert as many people as she can so as to increase her little flock. The Church’s expansion is also seen as a Western extension. The increase in the number of Church movements engaged in aggressive evangelisation (understood in the very narrow sense of the word) is certainly a cause for concern for our brothers and sisters of other faiths. Perhaps, it might be good to be reminded of the golden rule which nearly all religions speak of: Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.”

The traditional way of teaching religion puts emphasis on theology and rituals ignoring the social dimension, namely the need for interaction and tolerance among the followers of different religions. Religious leaders and theologians from across the country should come together to review the different religions from the perspective of pluralism and social justice.

The following steps ought to be taken to ensure peace and harmony in India: Organised drives for conversion and reconversion should stop. They violate the Constitution. The Government should promote an agreement among the religious heads of all the major faiths in the country to stop proselytism. Given the positive mindset of theologians belonging to different religions, this is possible.

Combat all forms of expression which incite sectarian hatred and take action against dissemination of such material in the media.

Adequate training and awareness programmes about religion and religious harmony for young leaders at all levels and Government officials, particularly the police and other law enforcement agencies, judges, teachers and social workers must be held.

Introduce inter-religious education in schools as part of the curriculum so as to promote communal harmony.

Assure all victims of religious intolerance adequate support and speedy administrative and judicial remedies.

Provide effective access to all citizens, including religious minorities, to the decision-making process in society.

Counter social exclusion and marginalisation in particular by providing adequate access to all to education, health and employment. Pay specific attention to development of vulnerable groups such as tribals and other weaker sections and those who suffer discrimination on different grounds.

With this we will ensure peace that fosters inclusive development.

12,21-1-20,Flying kites,"The Government may be testing waters with silly proposals. But this points to a lack of creativity in policy-making

The bureaucrat, who thought about the preposterous suggestion to limit duty-free alcohol purchases to a single bottle, will one day head the entire department. And that frankly is more worrying than the proposal itself because such ideas can come only from the heads of narrow-minded individuals with a puritanical sense of morality. Of course, one is not encouraging alcoholism or smoking. It remains unlikely that the Government will ever go down the route of prohibition, although given some previous illogical decisions taken by it and the fact that the ruling BJP is an ally of arch-prohibitionist Nitish Kumar, nothing can ever be ruled out. That said, drinkers and smokers are a rich source of funds for the Government and Bihar is still reeling from the after effects of Kumar’s bizarre decision. In addition, the Commerce and Industry Ministry led by Piyush Goyal wants to restrict the volume of goods Indians can bring into the country while coming back. The derision that these decisions have been met by is completely justified. But what boggles one’s mind is that the Government is looking at such minor issues when it should be thinking about ways and means of reviving the economy. If the thinking is that Indians will suddenly quit their Scotch whisky and start buying the shudh desi molasses-derived liquid that masquerades as “whisky”, then one can safely assure the powers that be that it won’t happen. Such thinking will only take us back to the command and control economy of Indira Gandhi when smuggling and bootlegging ruled. Ironic then that the BJP is trying to highlight Indira’s links with Mumbai’s most notorious smuggler of that era, Karim Lala.

The simple fact is that to get the economy going again, the Government needs a whole new thinking, the concept of wealth transfer from the very rich being impractical. The Modi Government, despite such schemes as Digital India and Start-up India, hasn’t been able to spur entrepreneurial growth. Job creation is at its lowest and India risks turning its demographic dividend into a time bomb. The greatest advantage this country has is being squandered with a pliant Opposition, which has sought to focus on issues that do not have large-scale appeal. But the Government is more keen on looking at silly minutiae than the bigger picture. At the end of the day, a masterpiece not only has fabulous details but looks appealing overall. This Government is concentrating on trying hard to choose the colour for a dull, monochromatic image of modern India.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/flying-kites-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/flying-kites.html

22,21-1-20,POLL ISSUES: Voters seek MLA’s report card,"The Rama Krishna (RK Puram) Assembly Constituency is one of the crucial seats among the 70 Assembly Constituencies (ACs) in the national Capital. Street lights, poor roads beset with perennial water logging and potholes, parking space and cleanliness are among wide range of issues on which people want to seek answers from their representative.

RK Puram is primarily a group of colonies housing Central Government servants. There are five Jhuggi Jhopri (JJ) clusters with thousands of people living in subhuman conditions. A mixed bag of voters, the constituency also accommodates people from varied background from elite to upper middle class, middle class and people from Below the Poverty Line (BPL) segment.

""I will vote on the basis of work done in the city including my area. In the last five years, we heard and seen the work done for the welfare and betterment of the people and the society.

R K Puram seat was won by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress both but traditionally it has been Congress seat with the party winning it thrice in 1998, 2003, 2008. However, in 2013 BJP MLA Anil Sharma won the seat. Parmila Tokas the current Aam Aadmi Party MLA wrested the seat from BJP in 2015. Tokas who is a local, has been once again fielded by the AAP.

""Nothing has changed in Munirka Village. The streets and the roads here are very congested. Rather, improving roads, infrastructure facilities for the pedestrians and providing clean water, employment and shelter for the needy people, the AAP government is giving everything free by making the people lazier. It gave subsidy in electricity but people living in rent accommodations are still suffering because of the tenants being charge Rs 10-12 per unit. The entire bill is zero but tenants have to pay huge amount and this issue needs to addressed. If we request landlords not to charge, they will throw us out. Though AAP government has passed a law in this regard but nobody is willing to accept it,"" said Ranjit Kumar, a furniture shopkeeper.

23,21-1-20,"Mineral theft, smuggling continue unabated","Mineral thefts in Keonjhar district are still taking place.

Recently, the Barbil police arrested a gang of six miscreants while they were smuggling 26 metric ton of iron ore worth Rs 5 lakh by a truck near Kasia village. Similarly the Rugudi police also seized two trucks carrying theft iron ore of 30 metric ton worth more than Rs 6 lakh this week. Three thieves were arrested in this case.

Regularly vehicles carrying illegal manganese and iron ore are seized by police and forest staff which shows that mineral smuggling has not stopped in the area.

The present system only tracks mineral transportation from operating mines through i3MS and GPS. But mineral theft and smuggling from the abandoned mines, crushers and non leased forest areas continue by mining mafias to neighboring Jharkhand in many unguarded village and forest roads along the State border inspite of laws for prevention of mineral theft.

Since the lease period for most mines is about to expire, mineral production and transportation is in full swing using all means. With the hike in price of iron and manganese, the smugglers find it profitable to use four wheelers to transport minerals safely in small quantities without being noticed. Even transport through railways also creates scope for transport of excess materials to destinations by manipulating the weight in wagons.

Neither the Shah Commission nor the Government agencies have probed into the massive illegal mining outside lease areas and transport of theft minerals through railways. The iron and steel industries are the only end users of these minerals. Hence,a backward verification of minerals quantity purchased by iron and steel industries from mines and exporters including quantity of minerals transported through road, rail and ship will unearth huge scams in the ongoing illegal mineral trade, a mining expert remarked.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mineral-theft--smuggling-continue-unabated.html

29,21-1-20,State urged to release Rs 100 crore for NINL,"The Odisha Government has been requested to release ad-hoc payment of Rs 100 crore immediately in favour of the Neelachal Ispat Nigam Limited (NINL) to run the plant and avoid its shutdown.

MMTC CMD Ved Prakash has made this request to the State administration as the steelmaker is facing tough time due to paucity of funds.

While the NINL is regularly requesting MMTC to release funds for the plant, now MMTC has approached the State Government to provide fiscal cushioning for the steelmaker.

Source said the MMTC has infused Rs 470 crore in the NINL during the last one year.

Earlier, NINL Managing Director SS Mohanty had also written to the State Government requesting to release Rs 250 crore as the plant is facing labour unrest for pending dues.

Currently, the NINL is facing hardship in paying the bills for power port and other statutory charges like bank charges to avoid NPA. Railway freight charges are needed to be paid in time to avoid stoppage of coal movement. Similarly, funds are also needed for operation of iron ore mines.

In the meantime, the NMDC has provided Rs 60 crore.

It is now expected that the Odisha Government, which is a shareholder, will release an ad hoc payment to ease fiscal stalemate.

While the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has accorded approval for strategic disinvestment in the NINL, the company, according to the Governments, has got wide scope for 1-MTPC to 10-MTPA with infusion of funds.

The Centre has decided to disinvest the shares of MMTC, NMDC, BHEL, MECON, OMC and IPICOL in NINL.

Now, the shareholders are to infuse funds to run the plant so that it will fetch high value during disinvestment and keep alive the plant, said an industry expert.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/state-urged-to-release-rs-100-crore-for-ninl.html

34,21-1-20,Edu must teach children to serve others: Justice Ghose,"Education is not about earning degrees but about the values and life lessons a person imbibes in the process of learning, said Lokpal of India Justice Pinaki Chandra Ghose here on Monday.

“Education is a holistic process. We learn not to get a job but illuminate our own self with what we have learned,” he said while delivering the 2nd SOA Lecture at the Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan University here.

Education, he said, is about hands on learning, about gaining practical knowledge and it should equip a person to use intelligence and capabilities to face real-life situations, he said.

University Protem Vice-Chancellor presided over the programme.

Stating that perfection or divinity in man is nothing but a result of education, Justice Ghose, quoting Swami Vivekananda, said, “Education is manifestation of perfection in man.”

An educated person should be unselfish which is not the case in present world. “It is actually the parents who infuse selfishness in the children who are directed not to share their study notes with fellow students as they thought the other children might secure better marks than their own. They don’t understand that by sharing, the children would learn more,” he said.

He said education which does not help the common mass to equip themselves for the struggle for life, bring out the strength of character, imbibe a spirit of philanthropy and courage, would not help.

Narrating an anecdote, Justice Ghose said a father brought two fruits for his two children at home giving one to each. The elder child straightaway headed towards his room with the fruit, relished it and then came out. The other one took the fruit, found it good and went straight to his friends in the courtyard and shared it with all of them.

Though the first child was intelligent, his intelligence turned into mere cleverness as he was self-centered. But the second child had grown into a person and had spiritually expanded so as to think of others, care for others and had developed the spirit of service. Between the two children, who was the truly educated one, he asked.

He said a teacher is a social architect who has a great role to play to shape the life of his students.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/edu-must-teach-children-to-serve-others--justice-ghose.html

Fee of imported Holstein Friesian (HF) or Jersey semen has been reduced from Rs 200 to Rs 50 and fee for semen of imported bulls and bulls born through embryo transfer technology (ETT) with imported embryos has been reduced from Rs 150 to Rs 35. The rates of conventional semen (non-ETT, non-imported or unsexed) have been reduced from Rs 75 to Rs 25.

“The dairy farmers should get benefit from this facility as on very nominal rates have been implemented across the State. This would also provide Rs 10 crore annual relief to the dairy farmers for improving the quality of livestock,” said the Minister.

Apart from this, the state’s Animal Husbandry Department, under the ‘National AI Programme’ of the Central Government has launched a campaign to provide free breeding to 20,000 livestock of 300 villages in every district.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-reduces-livestock-semen-rates-by-four-times.html

Accompanied by Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and state party affairs’ in-charge Asha Kumari, Capt Amarinder discussed a slew of issues with the party chief during an hour-long meeting.

Even as the Chief Minister and other leaders chose to maintain a strategic silence over what transpired in the meeting, it has been learnt that the Chief Minister expressed his utter displeasure over the stance adopted by the party’s Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, his known detractor.

Notably, a war of words had erupted between Capt Amarinder and Bajwa past week after the latter launched a series of scathing attacks on the Congress Government for its failure to fulfil its pre-poll promises while maintaining that he would not support the Patiala Royal for another term.

Bajwa, who had headed the state Congress unit and enjoys close proximity with Rahul Gandhi, has reportedly met Sonia Gandhi a few days back.

Sources informed The Pioneer that the issue of state leaders and legislators’ going public against the State Government also came up for discussion during the meeting.

Notably, several party MLAs and leaders has been airing their grievances in open against the state government’s functioning, besides criticizing the babudom. Apart from that, the leaders have all along been reminding the Government for its promises, made to the people ahead 2017 elections, to act against those guilty of sacrilege incidents, cancelling power purchase agreements (PPAs) with private thermal plants and reducing power tariff, checking mafia raj, mobile phones, eliminating drugs, among others.

They have been arguing that the people question them on these promises, and with what face they would go back to them to seek votes in another two years’ time.

In fact, a few days ago, Capt Amarinder’s loyalist Jakhar had lashed out at the state Advocate-General for allegedly not watching the state’s interests in legal matters, besides seeking a strong action in the case of PPAs to give relief to the consumers.

The Monday’s meeting also assumes significance as the Chief Minister had made clear its stand of approaching the Supreme Court to challenge the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

During the meeting, the Chief Minister shared his plans of approaching the Supreme Court over the CAA.

Only past week, the Punjab Vidhan Sabha has passed a resolution seeking repealing of the controversial CAA and amendments in the documentation required for the National Population Register (NPR).

“I have sworn on the Constitution and I will continue to fulfil my duty as a loyal soldier. Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji had said, ‘Na koi Hindu, Na Mussalman’ (no one is a Hindu or Muslim) and, it is in this spirit, Punjab Vidhan Sabha passed the resolution to appeal to central government to repeal CAA for India’s interest,” Capt Amarinder had posted on Twitter after the Vidhan Sabha passed the resolution.

Capt Amarinder had also declared that Punjab will join Kerala in challenging the newly-amended law in the Apex Court. “Like Kerala, the Government will also approach the Supreme Court on the issue,” Capt Amarinder had stated while talking with the media after the conclusion of the two-day special assembly session.

He had stated said that the Centre would have to make the necessary amendments to CAA if it had to be implemented in Punjab and other states opposing the legislation.

During the meeting, the impending Cabinet reshuffle was also discussed. With just one cabinet berth lying pending after cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu resigned in protest of change in his portfolio, there is possibility of change in portfolios of at least four Ministers. Besides, it has been learnt that two Ministers may lose their Cabinet berth.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-cm-meets-sonia.html

In a special session of the state Assembly, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar moved an official resolution in the House to ratify the Constitution (126th Amendment) Bill 2019 extending reservation for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities in Lok Sabha and state assemblies by another 10 years.

The House unanimously passed the resolution. The Assembly session had been specially convened to ratify the bill passed by the parliament recently. It was adjourned soon after the Bill was passed.

The provision giving reservation to SC and ST communities for the past 70 years in Lok Sabha and state assemblies was due to expire on January 25, 2020. The Parliament recently passed a constitution amendment bill in this regard and it has to be ratified by at least 50 per cent of the assemblies before it becomes a law.

TRIBUTES PAID TO DEPARTED LEADERS

Members paid tributes to former Union minister I D Swami, veteran Congress leader Shamsher Singh Surjewala, senior journalist and former BJP MP Ashwini Kumar Chopra among others from the state who passed away.

The House also condoled the deaths of security forces hailing from the state, who had laid down their lives while on duty. Tributes were paid to those who passed away between the end of the previous session and the beginning of the current session.

Khattar, who is also the Leader of the House, paid tribute to the departed souls and read out the obituary resolutions. Leader of Opposition and Congress leader Bhupinder Singh Hooda also read obituary resolutions on behalf of his party and paid tributes to the departed souls.

Paying tributes to Swami, the chief minister said the country has lost a seasoned parliamentarian and an able administrator. Both Khattar and Hooda described Surjewala, a former Haryana minister as an able and experienced leader.

Paying his tributes, Hooda said, “Surjewala was a five-time MLA and one time Rajya Sabha member. He was president of Haryana Krishak Samaj. He made great contribution for the Congress party. He served as Haryana Congress president and also served as Leader of Opposition and a CLP leader.”

Honouring Chopra, who died last week following prolonged illness, Khattar said the senior journalist was a committed social worker and had great love for sports. “In his death, the country has lost an able parliamentarian,” he added. Hooda said Chopra came from a prominent family of freedom fighters.

Earlier, the sitting began with Haryana Governor Satyadeo Narain Arya making a brief address to the members.

While extending New Year greetings to the members, the governor informed the House that since it was a special session to ratify the Constitution amendment Bill, he would deliver the full address during the Assembly's budget session, which was likely to be held next month.

HOODA MIFFED ON ABSENCE OF QUESTION HOUR

Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda termed the duration of the special session as inadequate. After the session, Hooda said that during the session there were many issues on which the government had to give a reply. But this could not happen. “If the special session of the Legislative Assembly had been of long duration, all the legislators would have had an opportunity to raise problems of their respective constituencies. At the same time, many burning issues would also be discussed which would solve people's problems,” he said

Former Education Minister and Congress leader Gita Bhukkal said, “This was the third session of the newly constituted Vidhan Sabha which was held without a question hour and a zero hour. In the first session, MLAs were administered oath of office while the second was a special session to mark Constitution Day. I wanted to raise crucial questions of my constituency as well as issues related to people of the State like sugarcane purchase, crime against women, lack of irrigation and an ailing hospital among others. Legislators of other parties would also have raised the issues of their constituency.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/haryana-assembly-ratifies-sc--st-bill--pays-tributes-to-leaders.html
54,21-1-20,"SAD demands murder case be filed against Minister Kangar, MLA Dhillon","Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Monday demanded that Punjab Revenue Minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar and Faridkot legislator Kushaldeep Singh Kiki Dhillon be booked for murder of the former Sarpanch of Behbal Kalan following disclosures by the victim’s family that the Congress leaders had caused the death of the prime witness in the Behbal Kalan police firing case.

“The family of former Sarpanch Surjit Singh has made it clear that the two Congress leaders were responsible for the death of the Sarpanch and that they misused the police as well as the Electricity Department to force him not to give witness against police personnel who fired and killed innocent Sikhs protesters at Behbal Kalan in Faridkot district in 2015,” said SAD spokesperson Parambans Singh Romana.

The party demanded an independent probe into Surjit Singh’s death and prompt dismissal of the police personnel who threatened and harassed him besides registration of a criminal case against both Kangar and Dhillon.

“Gurpreet Kangar should be thrown out of the State ministry also for conspiring to eliminate the lone witness in the Behbal Kalan firing case,” he said.

Condemning the heinous conduct of both Kangar and Dhillon, which he also termed as inhuman, Romana asked the Congress led Punjab Government to act immediately and register a case under Section 302 Code of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) against both of them.

The two Congress leaders should also be arrested and interrogated to expose the conspiracy behind Surjit’s death, he added.

Romana said that Gurpreet Kangar, who then held the Power portfolio, was accused by the victim family with sending repeated teams to Surjit’s house to check his electricity load and imposing an unjust fine of Rs 55,000 on the family.

He said that Kangar’s complicity in the conspiracy to silence Surjit could also be seen from the fact that when Surjit approached the Minister, he threw him out of his office. “Kushaldeep Dhillon’s men also continued to harass Surjit and appeals to the Faridkot SSP fell on deaf ears due to pressure being wielded on the officer by the two Congress leaders,” he added.

SAD leader said that at the village level, Bargari police station in-charge threatened Surjit’s wife with physical harm when she protested against the injustice being meted out to her husband. “All this proves that the Congress leaders were trying to protect the police personnel responsible for firing on innocent Sikhs,” he said.

He said that Surjit’s plight was such that an hour before his death he told his wife that his decision to give witness against police personnel had ruined his family.

“The recent events have proved SAD’s contention that the Congress party is only interested in doing politics on the issue of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. It is now clear that the Congress is least interested in exposing and bringing the culprits behind this heinous crime to book,” he said.

SAD demands an inquiry by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court to fulfill the Sikh community’s quest for justice in the case, he demanded.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad-demands-murder-case-be-filed-against-minister-kangar--mla-dhillon.html

61,21-1-20,Cultivators expect bumper apple yield due to snowfall this season,"The winter has been good in Uttarakhand this year with snowfall and rain being experienced over an extended period in considerable quantities even in areas where it was not experienced for some years now.

One such place is Nainital, where some of the regions received snowfall after a gap of about 15 years. This has brought smiles on the faces of farmers, especially those involved in horticulture and fruit cultivation. The orchard owners are now busy preparing their orchards for a better yield.

The snowfall experienced on December 13, 14 last year and on January 8 and later this year is being considered beneficial for the apple cultivation carried out in Mukteshwar, Ramgarh and Dhanachuli areas of the Nainital district.

According to cultivators, due to the snowfall this season, the production of apples this year will be more. Apple is a crop which requires considerable care and attention.

The apple tastes sweeter and also has better form if the tree experiences cold temperatures for about three months. Apart from the apples, the snowfall experienced this season is expected to bring better yield in Nainital’s fruit belts where peaches, apricots and kiwi are also cultivated.

It is after a gap of about 15 years that snowfall was experienced in some of the regions of Nainital. Mukteshwar and Ramgarh received about one feet of snow which also eliminated the pests. On the other hand, when the snowfall is less, it has a detrimental effect on the apple crop. Not only apples, the snowfall is considered good for other crops and vegetables too. After snowfall, moisture remains in the soil for many days.

Apart from Nainital, other areas, including Harshil, Ranikhet, Munsyari, Chakrata, Tehri, Dhanaulti and Joshimath, and received good snowfall this season. The snowfall is expected to benefit the apple production the most because now the trees will be less susceptible to disease and will also flower on time.

Cultivator Jagat Singh said if there is no hail, there will be a bumper crop of apple and other crops.

Another horticulturist of the area, Harendra Singh Bisht said that the snowfall in this region will prove quite beneficial to the apples. While cultivators were not being able to benefit from the climate for some time now, the snowfall this season will ensure that the apple trees remain free of disease and produce better quality fruit.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cultivators-expect-bumper-apple-yield-due-to-snowfall-this-season.html

Receiving the award, Balkrishna said, “We are happy that Patanjali Yogpeeth, led by Swami Ramdev, with the tireless efforts of many karmayogis, dedicated volunteers and teachers, has revived and established the tradition of yoga and Ayurveda of our sages. Great effort has been made. This has been possible only with the cooperation and efforts of all those involved in this initiative.

At the same time, the work of conservation of manuscripts and their publication is also being guided by him.

63,21-1-20,Locals protest at UEPPCB against Sheeshambada plant,"Residents of Sheeshambada area protested at Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) regional office against the solid waste management and recycling plant which has been operating for five months without No Objection Certificate (NOC).

The protestors entered gheraoed the UEPPCB regional officer and questioned him about how the corporation was still dumping garbage at the plant which was functioning without an NOC for months now.

They also told regional officer Amit Pokhriyal that they are suffering for the past three years due to the mismanagement of the waste management plant in the area and they will not leave unless they are assured in writing that NOC will not be renewed for the plant.

The regional officer did not provide any such assurance but on their insistence, he gave them a copy of the plant’s inspection report prepared by the UEPPCB.

The report states that during the inspection there was no arrangement for the leachate generated from landfill site which was flowing through the drain from one side of the site and getting accumulated on the other side during rain.

There was no storage facility for the different kinds of waste material and all were decanted together. It is also mentioned in the report that Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) was not operational during the inspection and had not been operating since last 15 days as per the project in charge.

The issue of foul-smell is also mentioned in the report.

One of the protesters Sunny Sundriyal alleged, “Every department is involved in this mess. How the MCD is still running the plant even after such a clear report is questionable.”

Geeta Devi, one of the residents of Sheeshambada said, “I protested near solid waste management and recycling plant for one week and I have got skin allergy all over the body. It is not just me, other women have also developed skin allergies. Moreover, our kids are getting sick every week too, we cannot keep visiting the doctor regularly because of this plant. Is this waste management plant more important than human lives?”

Usha Chetri, one of the protestors said, “The noise of machine never stops at the plant. It is always working which makes it difficult for children to focus on their studies or get proper sleep. Every type of garbage is dumped whether it is wet, dry or dead animals like cows, dogs, cats in our neighbourhood due to which we can’t even open our windows.”

“Initially we were told that there would be one layer of waste and one layer of soil which will help in the decomposition of garbage without any issue, but everything is dumped together due to which the whole area smells horrible. Even the guests have stopped coming to our house due to the unbearable stench that lingers there day and night,” added Rajesh Sharma.

Municipal Commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey had recently rejected the claims of the protesting locals. According to him, there is no foul smell and disease-causing germs on the site. Enzymes are sprayed six times a day to sterilise the place.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/locals-protest-at-ueppcb-against-sheeshambada-plant.html

65,21-1-20,Mayor inaugurates Gau Sadan in Selaqui,"Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ inaugurated the Gau Sadan of the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun at Selaqui on Monday. This facility will be used to shelter stray cattle of the city.

The stray cattle are a big issue in the city that not only hamper smooth flow of traffic but also end up sustaining injuries in accidents and even die due to consumption of plastic while foraging garbage dumps for food. The issue was also raised by many councillors in the last board meeting of the MCD. However, till now the MCD only had one Kanji House for sheltering stray cattle.

This Kanji House in Kedarpuram area has the capacity for holding about 70-75 cattle at a time whereas the population of stray cattle in the city is estimated to be in the thousands. Last year, the MCD officials had visited Mathura in Uttar Pradesh to study the model of the Gau Sadan there.

The facility in Dehradun was to be developed in two phases with a detailed project report of works amounting to Rs 77 lakh made for the first phase. Now with the opening of the MCD’s Gau Sadan on about 80 bigha land in Selaqui, the lot of stray cattle is expected to improve. The MCD will not impound stray cattle and keep them in the Kanji House for three days for the owner to show up and pay the fine to release the cattle. If no one comes forward then the cattle will be shifted to the Gau Sadan in Selaqui.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mayor-inaugurates-gau-sadan-in-selaqui.html
66,21-1-20,HJM opposes film shooting in Haridwar,"Shooting of the movie Haseen Dilruba, which casts Taapsee Pannu and Vikrant Messi began recently in Haridwar. However, it has elicited opposition from some persons here. The Hindu Jagran Manch has alleged that the film title does not match the sacred spirit of Haridwar.

On Monday, a delegation of the Hindu Jagran Manch met city magistrate Jagdish Lal and submitted a memorandum asking that the shooting of the film be stopped in Haridwar. The Hindu Jagran Manch district president Manish Chauhan told this correspondent that the the film title and poster is vulgar. The production house is stating that the movie is a murder mystery. If it is so, the movie can be shot elsewhere too out of Haridwar. Chauhan says that the group had submitted a memorandum to the city magistrate, adding that if the authorities do not take any action then the Hindu Jagran Manch will take some action.

According to Atul Painuli, director of the Impression Line Production, the movie Haseen Dilruba is a murder mystery. There is no vulgarity in the movie. The Chief Minister and State Government are encouraging shooting of films in the state. He further said that the government had officially allowed the production house to shoot the movie in the state. Stating that there is nothing illegal or objectionable in shooting the movie here, he said that such a protest will send the wrong kind of message to the film industry in Mumbai. One film project provides employment to many and results in income generation for the locals too, he added.

Meanwhile, the superintendent of police (City) Kamlesh Upadhyay said that if the production house has valid permission to shoot the movie, there is not point in trying to stop the same. If anyone has any objections, one should express the same through the valid official process. No one will be allowed to disturb law and order on this issue, she stressed.

The city magistrate Jagdish Lal told this correspondent that permission for filming the movie here had been granted from the state government level.

After a long wait of more than two-and-half years, Pritam Singh had suspended the old PCC last month. It was expected that he would declare new PCC shortly after suspension of old one but internal squabbles of the State unit of the Congress party has ensured delay.

The PCC president has teamed up with LoP Indira Hridayesh to create a formidable camp in the Congress party.

73,21-1-20,"JP Nadda, quintessential organisation man from HP","Jagat Prakash Nadda, who took charge as BJP President on Monday, always maintained a low profile before coming close to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Born on December 2, 1960 at Patna, Bihar and son of Dr Narain Lal and Krishna Nadda, he is married to Mallika Nadda. He got his earlier education at St. Xaviers School, Patna and did his graduation from Patna University and later a Law degree from HP University Shimla.

Nadda enterned the political arena in the year 1975 during the on going Sampurna Kranti movement launched by Jayaprakash Narayan against the autocratic and dictatorial rule of the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.

He later joined ABVP, the student wing of as a student in Patna University where his father was a Vice Chancellor. He won several elections as a student union leader and remained at various top positions in ABVP. He became politically active as a youth leader during his college days.

In 1989, he was assigned a major responsibility as election-in-charge of the BJP Youth Wing when he was just 29 years old. He also remained in Jail for 45 days for organizing Rashtriya Sangharsh Morcha. In 1991 he was made the National President of the BJP Yuva Morcha, at 31.

74,21-1-20,Fissures in SAD-BJP ties on Delhi elections,"Almost seven-year-old alliance between the Akalis and the BJP in the national capital on Monday virtually came to an end over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) declared its decision to stay away from the forthcoming assembly elections in Delhi over the issue after it was asked by the saffron party to change its stance on the controversial law.

After the day-long hectic development that culminated late in the evening, the Akali Dal refused to compromise on minority interest, adding that it would rather stay away from Delhi poll than support CAA, and NRC — signaling at a rift with its NDA ally BJP.

The development came with just a day left for filing the nominations for the February 8 Delhi assembly elections.

Announcing the decision in Delhi, MLA and the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president Manjinder Singh Sirsa and SAD’s Delhi unit president Harmit Singh Kalka said that the party also reiterated its demand for including Muslims in CAA.

Elaborating, the party said that it would rather not contest elections in Delhi than sacrifice the interests of the minorities or compromise on the secular principles taught by the great “Guru Sahiban”. As such, it would stay away from the electoral process in the forthcoming assembly poll in Delhi.

Earlier, it was believed that the SAD may contest polls alone after the BJP gave it a snub while deciding the seat-sharing. Despite a series of meetings and rounds of talks, the SAD and BJP could not reach a consensus over the seat-sharing.

While SAD wanted to contest polls on four seats on its own party symbol — weighing scales, the BJP wanted it to contest elections on its symbol — lotus.

Moreover, the saffron party preferred Janata Dal (United) and the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) as its allies for the Delhi election giving no mention to the Akali Dal. Notably, both JD (U) and LJP are BJP’s important allies in Bihar, which will go for the elections later this year.

Sirsa and Kalka, addressing the media, said: “India is a secular country with rich religious, cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity. This diversity is the strength of our unity. We cannot compromise on this vision of India for which ancestors have made supreme sacrifices.

They said that there were strong ideological differences between the two parties on the issue of the Citizens Amendment Bill, as SAD wanted the Muslims to be included in the Act. Referring to NRC, it said that the SAD firmly opposed it and could never support it.

SAD said that the differences on the sensitive and critical issues came to the fore during the debate on the issue of Citizenship Amendment Bill passed in the Parliament. “The party president Sukhbir Badal took a principled stand on the issue during the debate. He stood by the minorities and upheld the principles of secularism in the spirit of ‘Sarbat da Bhala’. The same stand was repeated by SAD Rajya Sabha MP Balwinder Singh Bhunder,” they pointed.

The party further added that it was firm that all minorities, including the Muslims, along with the Sikhs, Hindus, Christians, Jains, Parsis, Buddhist facing persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh were required to be protected. The Muslim community should not be left out of the CAA process as it would go against the basic principles of the party and the teachings of the Gurus.

As a representative of the minorities in general and of the Khalsa Panth in particular, the SAD said that it followed the footsteps of the Gurus on secular and humanitarian equality. The party truly understood the pain, anguish and sufferings of other minorities and could not compromise on their interests.

A press statement issued by the party added that during past several rounds of meetings with BJP, its leaders were pressing upon the SAD to change their stand on CAA vis-à-vis the minority Muslim community.

The party position was categorical that it would stand by each and every word it said in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and thereafter in Punjab Vidhan Sabha on the inclusion of the Muslim community in the CAA process along with others of the minority.

90,21-1-20,Police reject any rise of extremism in State,"State police discounted and dispelled any fear of rise of extremism in the State. Sources said common people have begun to tell that extremism will rear its head again in Jharkhand and fear extortion calls coming over to their cell phones. State BJP has charged three week old Govt with rise in extremism in the State.

State police spokesperson Saket Kumar Singh cum DIG STF said, “There were definitely incidents of arson by naxals in the months of November and December but police curbed and contained them and this last 15 days there has been all quiet on this front.”

He said, “Police have information that naxals have gone into a kind of hibernation for a month or so now but for us there is never any room for relaxing nor for any complacency either.”

Reminded that for incidents of extremism there is no place & time fixed but can happen most abruptly to which he said, “Nothing can be predicted in such a matter but what I want to drive my point home is that naxals went for arson for a couple of reasons.”

Explaining the reasons he said, “Forests remain too dense up to December.Then starts leaf fall. Once leaf falls the jungles start getting bare visible and naxals again turn to jungles to set up their hide outs.”

Singh said, “Winter nights keep naxals notorious as long nights give them a feeling that they can go about their sinister design.”

Asked as to which crime apart from extremism Jharkhand police find tough and challenging to which Singh said “It is the cyber crime. It is erupting all over the country. It will be the biggest threat that is coming to Jharkhand police and police of other states as well.”

What Saket K Singh said appears to be true as Jharkhand’s Jamtara which is the hub of cyber crime has even forced a Bollywood director Soumendra Padhi to make a Hindi movie on Jamtara which deals with the story of phishing scam!

On urban naxals Singh said, “Naxalism has no dictionary either of urban or rural. If one is naxal one is no matter where he resides or from where he operates.”

Again asked that people who hold left wing ideologies or stand by it are easily dubbed as urban naxals to which he said ,“I do not subscribe to such opinion. Urban naxal is the most misunderstood thing.”

He added “ To me if one uses arms, ammunition, spends time in forests and again comes to town, lives here for some period and then again sneaks in to his hide outs in forest then that man is straight way a naxal and there is no need to compartmentalize his identity by rusticity or urbaneness either.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/police-reject-any-rise-of-extremism-in-state.html

Sources said central leadership this time is going to make a president who apart from having mass appeal too is vocal with good oratorical skills. A senior BJP leader requesting anonymity said, “The appointment of new BJP president depends upon joining of JVM Chief Babulal Marandi in BJP. If Marandi merges his party with BJP, either he will be made new tate president or leader of opposition in house. In this case any of either post will be given to non-tribals.”

Sources said that among the non-tribal leaders the names of Ranchi MP Sanjay Seth, Anant Ojha, Sunil Singh, Deepak Prakash and others are doing the rounds. Seth and Anant Ojha, apart from having long experience in party, have good oratory skills. Sunil Singh has good rapport in BJP’s Delhi Durbar as he is close to many BJP leaders. Deepak Prakash is also considered as strong contender for BJP president post as he is close to Nadda, sources said.

However, party state spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo said, “The party will go for such leader who will rejuvenate the party and is acceptable to all.” Sources said that after the appointment of new president, the BJP central leadership will also make new State working committee appointing new office bearers which includes vice presidents, general secretary, secretaries, spokespersons and presidents of different cells and district presidents.

106,21-1-20,Shah to address pro-CAA rally in Lko today,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah will address a public rally in Lucknow on Tuesday to dispel doubts over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The rally is part of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s countrywide campaign in support of the CAA. All leaders of the party have been asked to organise rallies, meetings and discussions on the CAA and clear the doubts that have been created by the opposition parties.

MP from Lucknow and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will also hold a pro-CAA rally in Meerut on Wednesday, where maximum number of casualties took place during the anti-CAA protests. BJP chief JP Nadda is slated to address a rally in Agra the following day.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has already kicked off the BJP’s 10-day door-to-door campaign to spread awareness about the new citizenship law, aiming to reach out to nearly 30 million families and enlighten them on the real purpose of the CAA.

UP ministers and legislators are also undertaking similar exercise in their constituencies.

Shah has said time and again that opposition parties and elements with vested interests are trying to misguide the minorities in the country.

However, the opposition continues to label the CAA as a violation of secular principles enshrined in the Constitution of India, apart from being discriminatory towards Muslims.

The CAA has witnessed widespread protests as it allows Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Christian, Buddhist and Jain immigrants, excluding Muslims, to obtain Indian citizenship if they arrived in India on or before December 31, 2014.

More than 2,000 people have been arrested and nearly 5,000 others detained during protests against the CAA across the country.

Considering the fact that Shah’s rally will be attended by a huge crowd, Smriti Upvan has been selected as the venue.

Banners and hoardings related to the CAA are being put up on the route from Amausi airport to the rally site.

Sources said that a large number of people from Muslim community have also been invited to the rally to listen to Shah and “clear their misconceptions” about the new citizenship law.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shah-to-address--pro-caa-rally--in-lko-today.html
107,21-1-20,Guv creates row over ‘appointment of elderly politicians as Governors’,"Chhattisgarh Governor Anusuia Uikey here on Monday triggered a row over appointment of elderly politicians as Governors and sought a fixed age limit for the top constitutional post in States.

Uikey remarked this during an event organised by Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYK) in Madhya Pradesh Capital Bhopal on Monday. Besides, she even suggested that NYKs be renamed as Swami Vivekanand Kendra across the country.

While talking to media persons, after the event, Chhattisgrh Governor said that she did spoke on age factor of Governors saying she had also discussed this issue with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi as she was considered for Governorship in the past.

“I told him that till now mostly people in the age group of 65 to 75 years plus have been appointed as Governor and I was not even 65 plus now so she was being considered,” Uikey told, adding that she had also enquired about this from PM Modi.

Quoting the PM, Uikey said he wanted to break the trend and set up a precedent of active people taking over the mantle in Raj Bhawans. “He said he wanted active people of all age groups to get appointments as Governors so that they are limited to Raj Bhawan only and play constructive role in addressing social issues through their field visits.”

Uikey was appointed Governor of Chhattisgarh in July 2019 and had been highly active in addressing issues of tribal population in the state since then.

Meanwhile the Governor, a native of Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, went on to suggest that NYKs should be renamed as Swami Vivekanand Kendras.

“It is known fact that Pt Jawaharlal Nehru had been country’s Prime Minister but I wanted to convey a message that Swami Vivekanand had been a source of inspiration for the youth so renaming these centres (NYK) would be a good thing,” added that Governor.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/guv-creates-row-over----appointment-of-elderly-politicians-as-governors---.html

110,21-1-20,BSP leader joins SP along with 200 supporters,"Bahujan Samaj Party leader Ram Prasad Chaudhary from Basti joined the Samajwadi Party along with his supporters on Monday.

Along with Chaudhary, 200 leaders, including three former MLAs and six district panchayat members also took membership of the SP.

On November 23, BSP chief Mayawati had expelled Chaudhary from the party for indiscipline, after which there was speculations that he could join the SP.

Chaudhary reached the SP state office with a convoy of around 2,000 vehicles from Basti and also deposited the toll tax at the toll plaza.

A former cabinet minister of UP, Chaudhary was a known face of the BSP in Basti division and was elected to the Assembly five times from Kaptanganj in Basti.

In the last Lok Sabha election, he was fielded by the BSP but lost to the Bharatiya Janata Party candidate.

111,21-1-20,Pratishodh Ki Aag performed at Rangashri Little Ballet Troupe,"A dance drama “Pratishodh Ki Aag” was held at Rangashri Little Ballet Troupe here on Monday, marking the conclusion of three-day theatre festival.

The drama tells the story of Abhimanyu. It is written by Rajesh Joshi and was directed by Prabhat Ganguly.

It was first performed by Ballet on November 9, 1987 at Ravindra Bhavan. In this dance drama, Padma Sonkar, Shruti Kirti Barik, Pratap Mohanto are artists who are still connected, Shruti Kirti has been playing Draupadi continuously since 1987. The story is written by Rajesh Joshi and choreographed by Prabhat Ganguly. 20 artists participated in the dance drama.

The feeling of revenge was the main reason for Mahabharata.

The play was based on the scene of Abhimanyu being killed. It was told that there was fire of revenge in everyone, hence Mahabharata happened. The play shows how Chakravyuh was created to kill Abhimanyu.

Music has special significance in ballet. Ballet depends on a music in which music has special significance. The play was mythological. The play was renamed in 2017 as Pratishodh Ki Aag before the play was titled Chakravyuh. The ballet centres around the revenge that fuelled the fight between Kauravas and Pandavas in Mahabharat. It beautifully depicted the revenge harboured by Dronacharya for being let down by friend king Drupad, revenge in the heart of Karna for being slighted as Sutaputra by Draupadi at her swayamvar, and also revenge in the heart of Draupadi when she has to undergo ‘Cheer Haran’ after being lost by the Pandavas in the game of dice. It is the determination of many such slighted hearts nursing revenge that eventually results in the Mahabharat. Through eight scenes, the ballet presented a compact story of Abhimanyu, how the secret of breaching a Chakravyuh is revealed to him while he is in his mother’s womb, how he succeeds in replicating it as a young lad in the Mahabharat and eventually his death at the hands of the senior warriors fighting the war.

It was a mass treat for the audience to watch the epic story on stage. The theatre lovers of the city were mesmerized to have witnessed such a wondrous performance.

Further, the lighting effect was such that explains the expression of the scene. The use of red, green and blue light effect strengthened their performance.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pratishodh-ki-aag-performed-at-rangashri-little-ballet-troupe.html
112,21-1-20,"Akhilesh Yadav pitches for caste census; criticises NPR, NRC","Terming the Centre’s plans on NPR and NRC as “anti-poor”, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav has pitched for caste census as done in the past.

The SP chief’s demand came days after the Odisha cabinet adopted a resolution seeking revelation of caste details in the next national Census.

Akhilesh was addressing party workers at an event in Lucknow to welcome new members to the SP, including leaders of block panchayat level and those who have contested elections in the past.

Referring to an earlier Census, the SP chief said, “We all wanted a caste census but the Congress did not let that happen and the numbers did not come out.”

“The Census will be conducted soon but again we are not going to be counted. The reason is that the day it happens, Hindu-Muslim conflict will come to an end,” the SP chief added.

Criticising the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, Yadav said it had created a rift in that state.

Lakhs of people in Assam found themselves excluded from the NRC at the end of the exercise to weed out illegal migrants, he said.

In an apparent reference to the recent criticism of NRC and National Population Register (NPR), Akhilesh said that the poor would find it difficult to get their date of birth certificates.

“Earlier there were no calendars and birthdays of most people in villages were based on festivals,” he said.

Yadav said the inconvenience people would face due to the CAA and the NPR would be similar to what people went through when the Narendra Modi government demonetised high value currency notes.

“The Bharatiya Janata Party created a rift between the rich and poor through demonetisation and every one was made to stand in queues. Tell me how many farmers benefited. What about the dream of ‘eradicating’ corruption and terrorism through the exercise, what happened to it?” the SP chief sought to know.

Hitting out at the BJP government in UP, the former chief minister claimed that the state had now become “number one in cyber crime, crime against women and children, poor quality midday meals, fake encounters, unemployment and farmer suicides”.

Yadav claimed that the laptops given by the previous SP government to meritorious children were still working, while the toilets provided by the BJP government had stopped functioning.

“Farmers were promised that their income would be doubled and they voted the BJP to power in the state and at the Centre. But what have poor people and farmers got in return? The BJP stole the SP principle of taking everyone along, by coining the Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas slogan,” the SP chief said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh-yadav-pitches-for-caste--census--criticises-npr--nrc.html

On this occasion, Bhopal Chairman of IIID Manoj Choubey said that the designers of India have many things like our heritage, civilisation. Our country is very prosperous and all we need is to design it better.

He said that the real identity of a good architect is his design, wherever he goes he must see the heritage and understand it deeply and then prepare its design. Manoj Choubey told further about the latest trend of interior designing saying “Now time has changed, earlier we used to copy the design by taking idea from outside countries. But now it is not so as nowadays people use construction materials available locally, construction techniques and also the old monuments and heritage in design, instead of using outside technology and designs.”

While addressing the gathering, Romano opined that today’s young generation is really smart, it knows very well how to use advanced technology within few time. “But I would like suggest that they should not go for excess use of technology like instead of copying any design from Google, make it on paper by yourself.

Male and female members perform this dance to please the goddess “Kansari” (goddess of paddy or grain), Dhartari (earth goddess), Gavatari (cattle goddess) and Narayana Dev (god Narayana). All the male members dance in a circular movement by putting a lamp and grains in the center. An interesting story lies behind the dance.

The story is as follows - a twelve-year-long severe drought that once befell the inhabitants of this earth. All water bodies dried, the cattle began to die and man survived on forest produces like mokha leaves, wild roots and honey. The villagers decided to propitiate the god and goddess through Kambdi Dance. However they were very weak and hardly able to get the rhythm right.

They perform the dance by nodding the head and clapping only. Then, their god and goddess were pleased with their sincere efforts and blessed them with rain.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/housing-construction-and-demonstrations-workshop-held.html

On Monday, the protesters demanded that Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who will visit Lucknow on Tuesday to address a pro-CAA rally, visit the Clock Tower and tell the women about the benefits of the CAA.

However, after reports of police allegedly snatching blankets and food for protesters on Friday night, Saturday and Sunday nights passed off peacefully without any incident.

The Lucknow Police have however denied the allegation.

Meanwhile, large quantity of food items, including fruits and others things, were brought by several people to be distributed among the women sitting on dharna with around 50 volunteers, mostly school girls, managing the crowd.

On Monday, the protesters continued their protest by waving national flag and placards and raising patriotic slogans.

A dispute arose when a woman suddenly started chanting ‘Yogi Adityanath zindabad’. It was vehemently objected to by others.

She was immediately removed from the protest site even as she reasoned that their demands could only be met by the chief minister and hence she raised the slogan in support of Yogi Adityanath.

On Saturday too, two women had raised pro-Pakistani slogans and were promptly chased away from the venue.

Police personnel have been deployed to prevent any untoward incident but the protesters are being prevented from lighting up bonfires.

A senior police officer said on Monday that any violation of law by the protesters would be dealt with sternly.

A protester and Samajwadi Party activist Pooja Shukla told the media on Monday that Union Home Minister Amit Shah during his Lucknow visit on Tuesday should visit the protest site to clarify and clear apprehensions of Muslim women on the CAA.

Another activist Seema Rana said that the protest was spontaneous and a large number of women along with their children had joined the dharna against the CAA.

“We are making arrangements of food and other essentials including medicines for them,” she added.

A protester claimed that lights were switched off and public toilets in the area were locked, yet people kept coming with blankets and food and offered their toilets for use.

She further said, “People of different political ideologies are here, it is a people’s movement where a new leadership will emerge. The protesters feel that the CAA has been brought to ‘attack’ Muslim religious sentiments and National Register of Citizens will again bring the people in queues. This law is

an effort to break the cordial relationship between Hindu and Muslim”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/women---s-protest-against--caa-continues-in-lko.html

123,21-1-20,Yechury slams Govt on economy slowdown,"Citing slowdown in economy, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday slammed the Government saying this was not just “mismanagement” but “destruction of lives”. Reacting to reports that the Government’s tax collection is likely to fall short of its estimate by Rs 2.5 lakh crore or 1.2 per cent of GDP in 2019-20, Yechury said that the Centre will be made accountable.

“This is not mere mismanagement of the economy. It is the destruction of lives and livelihoods of millions of Indians, while Modi’s rich cronies continue to benefit and fund the BJP. The people on the streets have taken note, accountability will be fixed,” he tweeted.

Quoting an Oxfam study which said that India’s richest one per cent hold more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up for the bottom 70 per cent of the country’s population,

while the total wealth of all Indian billionaires is more than the full-year budget, Yechury said that this is the reason Prime Minister Narendra Modi doesn’t want people to know who funds the BJP.

“The whole electoral bond scheme is opaque and points to a collusion between the BJP and those who have become richer as a majority of Indians become poorer,” he claimed.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/yechury-slams-govt-on-economy-slowdown.html
124,21-1-20,"Modi extracts wealth from poor, gives it to capitalist friends: Rahul","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi extracts wealth from India’s poor and gives it to his “crony capitalist friends” and the big power brokers he is dependent on.

Rahul Gandhi’s attack on the prime minister came over an Oxfam report which claimed that India’s richest 1 per cent hold more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up for the bottom 70 per cent of the country’s population.

“Modi extracts wealth from India’s poor and gives it to his crony capitalist friends & the big power brokers he’s dependent on. 1% of India’s super rich, now own 4 times more wealth than 1 billion of India’s poor,” the former Congress president said in a tweet.

The total wealth of all Indian billionaires is more than the full-year budget, said the study titled ‘Time to Care’ which was tagged by Rahul Gandhi Oxfam also said the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 per cent of the planet’s population.

The Gandhi scion has often used the term Rs crony capitalism’ to attack Modi.

He first used the term post demonetization when he alleged that Prime Minister’s demonetisation decision was a “huge scam” and its objective was to rob from the common people of India to benefit his crony capitalist friends. He again used the same terminology during the Rafale scam controversy.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-extracts-wealth-from-poor--gives-it-to-capitalist-friends--rahul.html
125,21-1-20,POLNET 2.0 armed with multi-media facility launched,"Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai on Monday inaugurated revamped police communication services — POLNET 2.0. The new platform is armed with a robust multi-media facility and is a captive satellite-based network that provides video, audio and data connectivity across the country, especially in times of disasters when regular communication either gets jammed or crashes.

“The operationalisation of POLNET 2.0 is a big achievement for the country and the DCPW is to be complimented for rendering this task. This system will work in any weather,” Rai said while launching the facility at Vigyan Bhawan here.

The Directorate of Coordination Police Wireless (DCPW) that operates POLNET or the police network services in the country has brought out an enhanced communication platform for police and security forces to communicate better during law and order problems and disasters, including linkup from remote border and coastal areas. The DCPW was set up in 1946 and it was placed under the Ministry of Home Affairs in 1950 with the primary mandate of coordination between state and central police and security agencies for radio communication and frequency allocation. It has been operating POLNET since 2006.

The new platform is named POLNET 2.0 and for the first time it will provide video-conferencing facility to four entities sitting at different locations in the country with Internet-enabled multimedia services,

a senior official said. From its control room in Delhi, it can host 40 people talking at one point of time, the official added. POLNET 2.0 will also have a phone calling facility for personnel of police and paramilitary forces deployed in remote areas to talk to their families.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/polnet-2-0-armed-with-multi-media-facility-launched.html
126,21-1-20,"""Make uniform code of pharma marketing practices mandatory""","Amid the controversy over pharma firms allegedly ‘bribing’ medical professionals, the Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Healthcare (ADEH), a network of doctors from across the country has demanded that the Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) framed five years ago be made mandatory.

“Presently, even after five years the code remains voluntary. This is despite the fact that several medical organisations have demanded this repeatedly from the Government. The global experience also shows that voluntary code does not work”, said Dr GS Grewal, one of the ADEH members and former president- Punjab Medical Council, Ludhiana.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as published in a section of the media has warned pharmaceutical companies not to indulge in unethical practices and stop giving freebies to the doctors with a purpose to procure business. However, that any such deliberations occurred in the meeting with the Prime Minister has been denied by the pharmaceutical companies, said Dr Grewal.

He alleged that the companies spend crores of rupees through associations by sponsoring the medical conferences. “They spend huge amount on travel, accommodation and other expenditures on the doctors for lavish arrangements of the conferences.”

As per the clause 7.2 of the UCPMP “companies or their associations/representatives shall not extend any hospitality like hotel accommodation to healthcare practitioners and their family members under any pretext”.

The implied meaning of this is that even extending benefits to the doctors through associations is unethical. But this is being flouted with impunity, alleged Dr Arun Mitra, ENT specialist and former Chairperson, Ethics Committee of the PMC, Ludhiana.

It is also equally important that the any freebies from the pharmaceutical companies be made taxable. These were taxable earlier but the decision was reversed later by the Pune Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, said the doctor.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/-make-uniform-code-of-pharma-marketing-practices-mandatory-.html
127,21-1-20,Study reveals sepsis linked to 1 in 5 deaths worldwide,"Though preventable and treatable, sepsis — a life threatening complication of an infection— claimed about 11 million lives worldwide in 2017, almost twice as high as previously estimated.

According to a study published in the latest edition of The Lancet, among the victims are a disproportionately high number of children in poor areas. Sepsis is caused by the body’s defense system (immune system) working overtime to fight infection. The large number of chemicals released into the blood during this process triggers widespread inflammation.

Blood clotting during sepsis reduces blood flow to limbs and internal organs.

This deprives them of nutrients and oxygen. In severe cases, one or more organs

may fail.

India too is facing tremendous sepsis burden. At least, 34 per cent of sepsis patients died in the intensive care unit (ICU) in 2016, as per another study.

The Lancet study, which is led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and University of Washington schools of medicine, revealed 48.9 million global cases of sepsis in 2017 and 11 million deaths, representing 1 in 5 deaths worldwide.

The large majority of sepsis cases - 85 per cent in 2017 - occurred in low- or middle-income countries, higher among females than males. By age, the incidence of sepsis peaks in early childhood, with more than 40 per cent of all cases occurring in children under 5.

“I’ve worked in rural Uganda, and sepsis is what we saw every single day. Watching a baby die of a disease that could have been prevented with basic public health measures really sticks with you,” said lead author Kristina E Rudd, assistant professor in Pitt’s Department of Critical Care Medicine.

For their analysis, Rudd and colleagues leveraged the Global Burden of Disease Study, a comprehensive epidemiological analysis coordinated by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

The study findings are unprecedented as they represent mortality both in and out of the hospital.

“We are alarmed to find sepsis deaths are much higher than previously estimated, especially as the condition is both preventable and treatable,” said senior author Mohsen Naghavi, professor of health metrics sciences at IHME at the University of Washington School of Medicine. “We need renewed focus on sepsis prevention among newborns and on tackling antimicrobial resistance, an important driver of the condition.”

The study authors analyzed annual sepsis incidence and mortality trends from 1990 through 2017 and found rates are improving.

In 1990, there were an estimated 60.2 million sepsis cases and 15.7 million deaths; by 2017, incidence had dropped by 19 per cent to 48.9 million cases and deaths by 30 per cent to 11.0 million.

“So what is the solution? Well, to start with its basic public health infrastructure. Vaccines, making sure everyone has access to a toilet and clean drinking water, adequate nutrition for children and maternal health care would address a lot of these cases,” said Rudd.

The research was funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health Pitt, the British Columbia Children’s Hospital Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Fleming Fund.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/study-reveals-sepsis-linked-to-1-in-5-deaths-worldwide.html

134,21-1-20,PM interacts with students at ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’,"nA technology-free room in the house and keeping oneself away from gadgets for some time everyday were the two big takeaways for the students from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ on Monday.

Modi used examples from cricket to the Chandrayaan 2 mission besides experiences of his personal life to reach out to the students, teachers and parents on a range of issues, including exam stress and time management.

Through the third edition of the programme in the national Capital, while Modi asked the examinees not to get demotivated by temporary setbacks, he also urged over 10 crore audiences across 28 countries not to become slaves of technology.

But the most talked about topic among the students after the two-hour-session was his idea of keeping away from the technological conveniences like smart phones, computers and televisions daily for some time besides a technology-free room.

“Good marks in exams are not everything. We have to come out of the thinking that exams are everything,” Modi said.

In the event organised by HRD Ministry for which preparations went on for a month, was telecast and streamed live, Modi said everyone should keep abreast of the latest technology but stressed that it should not be allowed to govern lives.

“Technological trends are changing quickly. It is essential to stay updated with these trends. Fear of technology is not good. Technology is a friend. Mere knowledge of technology isn’t enough. Its application is as important,” he said.

“We should have the strength to keep technology under our control and ensure it does not waste our time. One room in our homes should be technology free. Whoever enters will not carry any gadgets,” he said. The Prime Minister asked students to spend their spare time with the elderly.

The Prime Minister appealed to students to not be demotivated if they face temporary setbacks and take failures in their stride. “We can add enthusiasm to every aspect of life. A temporary setback doesn’t mean success is not waiting. In fact, a setback may mean the best is yet to come. Motivation, demotivation are very common. Everyone goes through these feelings,” he said.

“In this regard, I can never forget my visit to ISRO during Chandrayaan and the time spent with our hardworking scientists. I was told I shouldn’t attend Chandrayaan landing as there was no guarantee of success but I needed to be there,” he added, recalling the failed landing of the Chandrayaan-2 mission’s Vikram lander.

The PM sought to speak to the students in their own language and said his conversations with them will be “hashtag without filter”.

During the freewheeling course, the PM also asked students to remember the India-Australia test series in 2001 to emphasise his message about positive thinking.”Our cricket team was facing setbacks. The mood was not very good. But in those moments can we ever forget what Rahul Dravid and V V S Laxman did? They turned the match around. Similarly, who can forget Anil Kumble bowling with an injury. This is the power of motivation and positive thinking,” he said to the much interest of the youngsters at the jampacked Talkatora Stadium.

The Prime Minister also highlighted the importance of taking on extra-curricular activities and said there is a growing tendency among parents to push their children into activities considered “glamorous” which they can discuss in their conversations with their friends. “Parents should instead take time out to find out what their children want to do,” he said.

Asserting that children should be “pursued not pressured into studies”, he recommended that students read his book “Exam Warriors” to get over the stress of appearing for exams. He urged students to be confident about their own preparation.

Students who got to ask questions to the Prime Minister were short-listed on the basis of essays submitted on five subjects — Gratitude is Great, Your Future Depends on Your Aspirations, Examining Exams, Our Duties, Your Take, and Balance is Beneficial.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pm-interacts-with-students-at----pariksha-pe-charcha---.html

140,21-1-20,AP introduces Bill to give shape to 3 capitals plan,"The YS Jagan Mohan Reddy Government on Monday introduced a Bill in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly to give shape to its plan of having three capitals for the state, with the executive capital in Visakhapatnam, Legislative capital in Amaravati and judicial capital in Kurnool.

The AP Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, also provides for dividing the State into various zones and establishing zonal planning and development boards.The village and (municipal) ward secretariats system that the Government brought in in October last year now gets statutory backing as it has been made part of the new Bill.

Moving the Bill in the Assembly on the first day of the extended winter session, Finance and Legislative

Affairs Minister Buggana Rajendranath said the government decided to enact a new legislation for decentralisation and inclusive development of all regions in the state for ensuring “balanced and inclusive growth” of AP.

“Regional imbalances, absence of equitable growth have caused an acute sense of deprivation among various sections of the state population, leading to disturbances.

“The logical solution would be to lay emphasis on distributed development and decentralised administration to ensure fruits of socio-economic progress are enjoyed equally by people of various regions,” the Minister said, quoting the recommendations of the High-Power Committee of ministers and bureaucrats, which formed the basis of the new legislation.

The TDP members raised objection to the introduction of the Bill and stormed the Speakers podium. Amid the din, the Government also moved another Bill to repeal the AP Capital Region Development Authority Act, 2014. The Government said it intended to constitute a new Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Area under the provisions of AP Metropolitan Region and Urban Development Authorities Act, 2016.

The CRDA Act was enacted on December 22, 2014 for the development of the state capital post-bifurcation with a specific area demarcated as the Capital region.

Now that the YSR Congress government has decided to have three capitals for the state, the CRDA Act is proposed to be repealed.Earlier in the day, the Cabinet met under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy and cleared the draft Bills. The Cabinet also approved the recommendations of the HPC on the capitals issue.

But the government could face hurdles in getting the Bills cleared in the Legislative Council, which sits from tomorrow, as the ruling party does not have majority.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/ap-introduces-bill-to-give-shape-to-3-capitals-plan.html

144,21-1-20,Mamata to pass anti-CAA resolution in House,"After Kerala and Punjab it is Bengal’s turn to pass resolution rejecting the Citizenship Amendment Act. Accusing the BJP of playing a “dangerous game” by forcibly imposing CAA and National Population Register Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday said the Trinamool Congress too will pass a resolution against the CAA soon. The move is a sharp departure from the stand taken by her Government a few days ago.

Moments before leaving for North Bengal where he subsequently told an audience that her Government would never allow either CAA or NPR to take place in Bengal, Banerjee said “the NPR is a very dangerous game … it is National Citizenship Register in disguise and is being pushed through in the name of NPR. We condemn the Centre’s move for NPR.”

Accusing BJP for trying to squeeze out absurd information from the citizens in the name of NPR so as to use it against them in future Banerjee said CAA, NRC and NPR are multiple sides of the same act adding her Government would soon pass a resolution rejecting CAA.

“We passed a resolution against NRC and CAB —which was only a bill then — a few months ago. Now as it has become a law will pass a

resolution against CAA and demand its withdrawal,” Banerjee said adding the resolution will be passed within 4-5 days.

The Left and the Congress immediately lashed out at the Chief Minister for “making volte-face too often.” Opposition Leader Abdul Mannan and Left Legislature Party Leader Sujan Chakrabarty said: “only a few days we had brought the proposal in the State Assembly but the government stopped the Congress and the Left from bringing a resolution against the CAA like Kerala and Punjab … now finding that the public opinion is going against her she has hurriedly decided to pass the resolution.”

On NPR Banerjee said, “I have come to know from media reports that they are demanding absurd information about the parents of a person in the NPR format. There is a column seeking information about parents, their birth place and birth certificate. How can anyone provide such information…

“They say that the column is optional. Have you seen any blank column in the mark sheet when you appear for an examination. This is a mischievous column. I want to know that if this column is not mandatory then why they have put it there? Again where is a guarantee that if you do not provide the information your name will not be marked for future reference in NRC or things like that? We have passed a resolution against NPR and request all the States including the BJP-ruled states of the North East to follow suit.”

State BJP leader JP Majumdar said such resolutions are of little value in the face of a parliamentary law.

In a public meeting at Darjeeling, she said, “Even I will not be able to provide these documents,” adding how the other parties were acting hypocritically by making loud comments in the media against the CAA but joining the meeting in Delhi on NPR.

When asked as to whether she would like to call a meeting of opposition leaders in order to unite them Banerjee said she might invite the Chief Ministers particularly of the north-eastern States to take a decision on the issue.

“I have no problem in hosting a meeting of the Chief Ministers in Kolkata if they are interested to join it,” she said appealing to all the Chief Ministers and Governments of the North East like Tripura, Assam and elsewhere to oppose, CAA, NRC and NPR.

Meanwhile, BJP leader Chandra Bose on Monday wondered whether imposing any law on the people without their consent was the right way of doing things. The grand nephew of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose said, “you cannot impose a law. You cannot threaten the people to follow some law. This is not fare in democracy.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/mamata-to-pass-anti-caa-resolution-in-house.html

Yadav has made the suggestion in the past as well. His demand now comes days after the Odisha Cabinet adopted a resolution seeking revelation of caste details in the next Census.

Referring to an earlier Census, he said,” We all wanted a caste census but the Congress did not let that happen and the numbers did not come out.”

He said the Census is going to take place again. “But again we are not going to be counted.”

“The reason is that the day the caste census takes place, the Hindu- Muslim conflict will come to an end,” he said without elaborating. He added that once this happens “nobody will be upset with Yadav brothers”. Yadav was addressing party workers at an event here to welcome new members to the SP. They included leaders at the block panchayat level and those who had fought elections in the past.

Criticising the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, he claimed it had created a rift in that state.

Lakhs of people in Assam had found themselves excluded from the NRC at the end of the exercise to weed out illegal migrants. The SP chief claimed that the NRC and the recently enacted Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) are “anti-poor” . In an apparent reference to the recent criticism of the NRC and the National Population Register (NPR), he said the poor will find it difficult to get their date of birth certificates.

“Earlier there were no calendars and the birthdays of most people in villages were based on festivals,” he said. He compared this to the inconvenience people went through when the Narendra Modi government demonetised high-value currency notes.

“The BJP created a rift between the rich and poor through demonetisation. All of us stood in queues. Tell me how many farmers benefitted. And the dream that corruption and terrorism will be eradicated, what happened to it?” he said.

Hitting out at the BJP Government in Uttar Pradesh, the former chief minister claimed that the state has now become “number one in cybercrime, crime against women and children, bad quality midday meals, fake encounters, unemployment and farmer suicides.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/akhilesh-pitches-for-caste-census--criticises-nrc--npr.html

The letter, made available to the media on Monday, stated that the Government has characterised the ongoing protests across in the country as being organised by “mischievous elements” whereas the “reaction of thousands of people has earned the sympathy of all right thinking sections of the society”.

“It is quite possible that there may have been certain excesses, as mentioned in some press reports, and these are to be deplored but the public discontent and unrest can hardly be dismissed as wilful violence, as is being currently done by the Government,” the letter said.

150,21-1-20,"Satisfied with CM’s assurance, villagers call off stir","A fierce controversy over Pathri village in Parbhani district being declared as birthplace of Saibaba blew over on Monday, after Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray withdrew his earlier statement and said that Pathri would be developed as a pilgrim centre and not as the birth place of the 19th century saint.

The people of Shirdi and 30 neighbouring villages — who had on an agitation for the past few days in protest against the chief minister’s recent statement that Pathri would be developed as Saibaba’s birthplace — called off their indefinite agitation after a delegation of their leaders, Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust (SSST) CEO, local elected representatives met Uddhav, his Cabinet colleagues Ajit Pawar, Congress Balasaheb Thorat and Aditya Thackeray.

At the meeting, Uddhav told the aggrieved villagers that he was withdrawing his earlier statement describing Pathri as the birthplace of Sababa. He said that Pathri village in Parbhani district of Marathwada region would be developed as pilgrim centre at a cost of Rs 100 crore and not as the birthplace of Saibaba.

The people of Shirdi and neighbouring had opposed the chief minister’s reference to Pathri as the birthplace of Saibaba so much so that they had observed a total bandh in the temple town on Sunday, causing considerable inconvenience to thousands of devotees visiting the place for a darshan of the presiding deity at the temple there.

During his meeting with the delegation from Shirdi, the chief minister said: “I do not know if Pathri is the birthplace of Saibaba or not. I am not a researcher. Based on the information that I had received, I had made a mention of Pathri being the birthplace of Saibaba.”

“You should have taken me into confidence before resorting to a bandh in Shirdi... Let’s not have a controversy over Saibaba’s birthplace. The state government will allocate funds to Pathri village as a pilgrim centre. As the Chief Minister, all the people are equal to me. Let’s all of us pray before Saikaba,” Uddhav told the delegation of villagers that met him. In all, there were 40 representatives in the delegation. The delegates from Shirdi and neighbouring villages told the chief minister that they had no objection whatsoever in Patri village being developed as a pilgrim centre and not as the birthplace of Saibaba.

Shiv Sena MP from Shirdi Sadashiv Lokhande, local BJP MLA Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil and SSST’s CEO Deepak Muglikar were prominent among others who were present at the meeting.

The controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba had arisen after a delegation of people from Pathri village met the chief minister, during the latter’s recent tour of Marathwada. They had claimed that Pathri was the birthplace of the 19th century saint and urged the chief minister to make financial allocation for developing the place into a pilgrim centre.

On his part, the chief minister had announced that Pathri would be developed as as a birthplace of Saibaba, that the state government had prepared a development plan for the purpose and that it would soon perform a bhoomi pooja for developing a pilgrim centre there.

Following the announcement, the people of Shirdi and neighbouring villages were up in arms against the State Government’s Pathri development move. What has surprised many as to how the claim of Pathri being the birthplace of Saibaba has come up all of a sudden.

There is no concrete evidence as to the date or place of birth of Saibaha. However there is evidence to suggest that Saibaba came to Shirdi when he was about 16 years’ old in 1858 and he remained there till his death in 1918.

Three months ahead of his death on October 15, 1918, Saibaba told his devotees he would soon be “leaving his mortal body” (dying). By the end of September 1918, he had high fever and stopped eating. As his condition deteriorated, he asked his disciples to recite holy texts to him and continued to meet visitors. On October 15, 1918 which happened to Vijayadashami, he breathed his last.

His mortal remains were interred at “Buti Wada” in Shirdi, after which it has now become place of worship known today as Shree Samadhi Mandir or Shirdi Sai Baba Temple.

The claim that Saibaba was born in Pathri village in Parbhani district of Marathwada region is based on a reference made in the eighth edition of “Sai Charitra” (history of Saibaba), a Hindi publication brought by the Sai Sansthan between 1972 and 76. So far, the Sai Sansthan has brought out 36 editions of “Sai Charitra”.

Incidentally, the eighth edition of “Sai Charitra” in which a mention of Saibaba’s birthplace has been made has gone missing. The Shirdi temple authorities have ordered an inquiry into the missing publication which can no way be considered as an authenticated document.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/satisfied-with-cm---s-assurance--villagers-call-off-stir.html

He said it is the duty of the country as a whole and the Kashmiri people in particular to see that the “sons of the soil, who were driven out due to killings and terror instigated by India's neighbour, are provided safety and security upon their return.”

In a series of tweets, Naidu said it is the rightful demand of the Kashmiri Pundits and other displaced persons that they should be facilitated to return to their place of birth.

“I feel that it is quite natural for the Kashmiri Pundits to expect the governments and society to understand their sufferings and take steps for their rehabilitation,” he said.

Paswan also claimed that it was at his instance that the Union Home Ministry agreed to “amend” the NPR forms wherein columns like those pertaining to places of birth of parents had triggered fears that the exercise might be a precursor to the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “Even I do not know my date of birth. Do I cease to become a citizen on that account? I had told the Home Ministry that these things will cause confusion. Now the Ministry has amended the forms”, he told reporters here.

Notably, the Union Home Ministry had recently stated that people could “skip” the aforementioned columns after a request to the effect was made by many states, not ruled by the BJP, that these be “dropped”. The Union Minister, who holds Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution System portfolio, however sought to allay fears that people not possessing required documents could lose their citizenship and Muslims whom the CAA allegedly discriminates against would suffer the most.

“No Government can dare to snatch away any persons citizenship. It will lead to an upheaval. Any regime which seeks to do so will be torn apart by the media. This is simply not possible”, he said. However, he added “we owe our rise in politics to the 1974 students movement. Now, students, the youth have their own sentiments. We cannot do much about that.

In November, Pakistan and India separately inaugurated the historic Kartarpur corridor on their sides of the border to facilitate the visa-free entry of Indian Sikh pilgrims to celebrate the 550th birth anniversary of founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev. The corridor provides the shortest route for Indian Sikh pilgrims to the revered Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur area of Pakistan's Narowal district, where Guru Nanak spent last 18 years of his life.

Leader of Hindu Community Peshawar Haroon Sarab Diyal said on Sunday that in view of the positive impact of the Kartarpur corridor, the provincial and federal governments should also develop the religious sites of Hindus in Khyber Patkahunkhwa.

It will promote religious tourism and put Pakistan's economy on track, he said.

Diyal said if the government agreed to develop Hindus' religious sites, they would attract many pilgrims from the across the world.

There are over 65 religious sites in Swabi district, and 154 in Nowshera district of Khyber Patkahunkhwa (KPK), he said.

The court in Bangladesh’s southeastern port city of Chattagram handed down the verdict on Monday after the completion of the defence’s argument. As many as 53 witnesses testified in the court over the attack on the current Prime Minister Hasina’s convoy.

“They will be hanged by neck until they are dead,” pronounced Chattogram District and Sessions Judge Md Ismail Hossain, as four of the five convicts were present in the crowded courtroom while the fifth convict, a former police inspector, was tried in absentia as a fugitive. On January 24, 1988, police opened fire on a procession which was escorting the motorcade of Hasina while she was going to address a rally in the port city against regime of then military dictator HM Ershad.

Hasina narrowly escaped the attack in which her 24 supporters were killed. Attack was seen by Awami League leaders as an “attempt to assassinate” Hasina. Prosecution said Hasina was visibly the target but she escaped the shooting as her supporters formed a human shield to protect her. The shooting was dubbed as “Chattagram massacre” when police cremated the bodies at a Hindu crematorium regardless of the victims’ religious identities, giving their families no chance to see them.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/5-former-police-officials-sentenced-to-death--over-attack-on-hasina---s-motorcade-in-1988.html
172,21-1-20,May pull out of N treaty over Europe dispute: Iran,"Iran said on Monday it will consider withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) if a dispute over its atomic programme goes before the UN Security Council.

Britain, France and Germany launched a process last week charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, a move that could eventually see the Security Council reimpose international sanctions on the country.

Iran has accused the three EU member states of inaction over sanctions the United States reimposed on it after unilaterally withdrawing from the landmark accord in 2018.

The European move “has no legal basis” and if they take further measures “Iran’s withdrawal from the NPT will be considered,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying by the Iranian parliament’s website.

The landmark 2015 deal reached with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. Since the US pullout, Iran has progressively rolled back its commitments to the accord —the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — in retaliation.

It has hit out at the three European nations that remain party to the JCPOA for failing to live up to their promises to ease the impact of US sanctions on its oil-based economy.

“If the Europeans return to the commitments, Iran will also stop reducing its commitments, but if the Europeans continue as they have been... We have different options,” said Zarif.

The foreign minister said Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani had warned former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini about such consequences in three letters sent in 2018.

“It was stated in the president’s letter that if this issue is referred to the Security Council, Iran’s withdrawal from the NPT will be discussed but before that we can consider other (options),” he said. European officials have made it clear that the decision to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism was made in a bid to bring Iran back into compliance and save the accord.

But Iran’s foreign ministry on Monday warned more measures could be taken in retaliation for the European move.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/may-pull-out-of-n-treaty-over-europe-dispute--iran.html

174,21-1-20,"India among top 10 FDI recipients, attracts $49 bn inflows in 2019, says UN report","India was among the top 10 recipients of Foreign Direct Investment in 2019, attracting $49 billion in inflows, a 16 per cent increase from the previous year, driving the FDI growth in South Asia, according to a UN report released on Monday.

The Global Investment Trend Monitor report compiled by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) states that the global foreign direct investment remained flat in 2019 at $1.39 trillion, a 1 per cent decline from a revised $1.41 trillion in 2018.

This is against the backdrop of weaker macroeconomic performance and policy uncertainty for investors, including trade tensions, it said.

Developing economies continue to absorb more than half of global FDI flows. South Asia recorded a 10 per cent increase in FDI to $60 billion and “this growth was driven by India, with a 16 per cent increase in inflows to an estimated $49 billion. The majority went into services industries, including information technology,” the report said.

India attracted an estimated 49 billion dollars of FDI in 2019, a 16 per cent increase from the 42 billion dollars recorded in 2018, it said.

The FDI flows to developed countries remained at a historically low level, decreasing by a further 6 per cent to an estimated $643 billion.

The FDI to the European Union (EU) fell by 15 per cent to $305 billion, while there was zero-growth of flows to United States, which received $251 billion FDI in 2019, as compared to $254 billion in 2018, the report said.

Despite this, the United States remained the largest recipient of FDI, followed by China with flows of $140 billion and Singapore with USD 110 billion. China also saw zero-growth in FDI inflows. Its FDI inflows in 2018 were $139 billion and stood at $140 billion in 2019. The FDI in the UK was down 6 per cent as Brexit unfolded.

The report added that cross-border M&As decreased by 40 per cent in 2019 to USD 490 billion — the lowest level since 2014.

Slowed down by sluggish Eurozone growth and Brexit, European M&A sales halved to $190 billion. Deals targeting United States companies remained significant — accounting for 31 per cent of total M&As.

The fall in global cross-border M&As sales was deepest in the services sector (a 56 per cent decline to $207 billion), followed by manufacturing (a 19 per cent decline to $249 billion) and primary sector (14 per cent decline to $34 billion), the report said.

In particular, sales of assets related to financial and insurance activities and chemicals fell sharply. The decline in M&A values was driven also by a lower number of megadeals. In 2019, there were 30 megadeals above $5 billion compared to 39 in 2018, it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/india-among-top-10-fdi-recipients--attracts--49-bn-inflows-in-2019--says-un-report.html

She said the Government does not want a law that could treat every business house with suspicion.

“My first attempt and also an earnest attempt which continues today is to decriminalise everything to do with Companies law or related laws. The very point Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) keeps talking,” she said.

“I had gone through this with a tooth comb. Decriminalising Companies Law ensuring no other act of Government whether it is Income Tax or your PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) will have such an impact.

177,21-1-20,IMF cuts India’s growth forecast to 4.8%,"The IMF on Monday lowered India’s economic growth estimate for the current fiscal to 4.8 per cent and listed, the country’s much lower-than-expected GDP numbers as the single biggest drag on its global growth forecast for two years.

In October, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had pegged India economic growth at 6.1 per cent for 2019.

Listing decline in rural demand growth and an overall credit sluggishness for lowering of India forecasts, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath however said the growth momentum should improve next year due to factors like positive impact of corporate tax rate reduction.

“Global growth, estimated at 2.9 per cent in 2019, is projected to increase to 3.3 per cent in 2020 and inch up further to 3.4 per cent in 2021,” the IMF said while releasing an update to its World Economic Outlook (WEO).

Compared to the October WEO forecast, the estimate for 2019 and the projection for 2020 represent 0.1 percentage point reductions for each year while that for 2021 is 0.2 percentage point lower.

“A more subdued growth forecast for India... Accounts for the lion’s share of the downward revisions,” the IMF said ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit here.

India-born IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said growth in India slowed sharply owing to stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth.

The country’s growth is estimated at 4.8 per cent in 2019, projected to improve to 5.8 per cent in 2020 and 6.5 percent in 2021 (1.2 and 0.9 percentage point lower than in the October WEO), supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices, it added.

2019 refers to fiscal year 2019-20.

India’s economy grew just 4.5 per cent in July-September 2019 period --- the weakest pace in nearly six years. The Indian government has been taking various measures to bolster growth.

For the emerging market and developing economy group, the IMF said growth is expected to increase to 4.4 per cent in 2020 and 4.6 per cent in 2021 (0.2 percentage point lower for both years than in the October WEO) from an estimated 3.7 per cent in 2019.

“The growth profile for the group reflects a combination of projected recovery from deep downturns for stressed and underperforming emerging market economies and an ongoing structural slowdown in China,” it noted.

Gopinath also said the pickup in global growth for 2020 remains highly uncertain as it relies on improved growth outcomes for stressed economies like Argentina, Iran and Turkey, and for underperforming emerging and developing economies such as Brazil, India and Mexico.

Further, the IMF said the balance of risks to the global outlook remains on the downside, but less skewed toward adverse outcomes than in the October WEO.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/imf-cuts-india---s-growth-forecast-to-4-8--2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/imf-cuts-india---s-growth-forecast-to-4-8-.html
178,21-1-20,"Vodafone, Bharti Airtel to be affected as SC rejects AGR review plea: Fitch Ratings","With the Supreme Court rejecting a review of its order that put Rs 1.47 lakh crore liability of past dues on telecom firms, the two incumbents -- Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel -- would be particulary affected, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.

The apex court's ruling will also have significant repercussions for India's banking sector as well as the country's broader economic outlook, it added.

""The Indian Supreme Court's rejection on 16 January of a review petition against its earlier ruling in a long-running telecommunications sector tax case, is credit negative for the industry. Two incumbents, Vodafone Idea Limited and Bharti Airtel Limited (BBB-/Rating Watch Negative), will be particularly affected,"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement.

The Supreme Court last week dismissed review petitions filed by telecom companies against its October 24, 2019 order that asked for inclusion of non-telecom revenues for calculating statutory dues such as license fee and spectrum usage charge.

""The court's rulings in this case could also have significant repercussions for India's banking sector, as well as the country's broader economic outlook,"" the rating agency said.

The apex court's decision to reject the review petition is likely to lead the Department of Telecommunications (DOT) to demand that telcos pay unpaid dues on licence fees and spectrum usage charges by January 23, Fitch Ratings said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/vodafone--bharti-airtel-to-be-affected-as-sc-rejects-agr-review-plea--fitch-ratings-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/vodafone--bharti-airtel-to-be-affected-as-sc-rejects-agr-review-plea--fitch-ratings.html
179,21-1-20,Zomato acquires Uber Eats business in India,"Zomato on Tuesday said it has acquired the Indian business of Uber Eats in an all-stock deal that will give Uber 9.99 per cent stake in the Indian food delivery and restaurant discovery platform.

Uber Eats in India will discontinue operations and direct restaurants, delivery partners, and users of the Uber Eats apps to the Zomato platform, effective Tuesday, a statement said.

In a regulatory filing to BSE, Info Edge (India) - a shareholder in Zomato - said its shareholding in Zomato will stand reduced to about 22.71 per cent on fully converted and diluted basis upon closing of the transaction.

The deal comes days after Zomato had raised USD 150 million in funding from existing investor Ant Financial, an Alibaba affiliate, at a USD 3 billion valuation.

""We are proud to have pioneered restaurant discovery and to have created a leading food delivery business across more than 500 cities in India. This acquisition significantly strengthens our position in the category,"" Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal said.

Uber Eats, which entered India in 2017, has about 26,000 restuarants listed on its platform from 41 cities.

Zomato's restaurant discovery and food delivery platform has information for over 1.5 million restaurants across 24 countries and serves more than 70 million users every month.

Discussions between Zomato and Uber have been on for months. Facing stiff competition from Zomato and Swiggy, Uber Eats had been making losses.

Uber had projected an operating loss of Rs 2,197 crore in its food delivery business for the five months through December 2019, according to a valuation report prepared by KPMG affiliate BSR and was part of regulatory filings.

According to sources, Uber Eats India business contributed three per cent of the global gross bookings but accounted for over 25 per cent of adjusted EBIDTA losses for the first three quarters of 2019.

With the sale of the food business in India, Uber can now focus on the rides business and driving it towards profitability, one of the persons said.

""India remains an exceptionally important market to Uber and we will continue to invest in growing our local Rides business, which is already the clear category leader. We have been very impressed by Zomato's ability to grow rapidly in a capital-efficient manner and we wish them continued success,"" Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber, said in the statement.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zomato-acquires-uber-eats-business-in-india-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/zomato-acquires-uber-eats-business-in-india.html

181,21-1-20,‘Filmmakers not valued enough’,"Actor Kangana Ranaut says being an actor is the most privileged job in our country while filmmakers are not as valued as they should be.

Kangana’s observation came while she was commenting on the controversy that erupted when she took over the directorial reigns of her 2019 release, Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi. She was in the capital to promote her forthcoming film Panga, directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari.

“There was no panga. The director left the film and I completed it. It was just that. If I helped my producer and studio, toh us cheez ke liye mera sammaan hona chahiye (I should be revered for that). People should see I am so responsible. I got many brickbats and I am shocked,” she said.

She then added: “I think being an actor on set is the most privileged job. (Being) a director, I am sorry to say, and even Ashwiny will agree with me, is not as valued as it should be. Filmmakers in our country, unlike America, are literally de-valued. This industry is of the actors.”

Kangana also said that she wants to pursue her moviemaking ambitions. “There is a part of me that wants to pursue my filmmaking ambitions but if you ask me, it is a privilege to be an actor on the set — especially if your director is sorted,” she added.

Panga also features Neena Gupta, Richa Chadha and Jassie Gill. The film, slated to hit screens on January 24, revolves around a kabaddi player, played by Kangana, who wants to make a comeback in the game after marriage and motherhood.

182,21-1-20,A confluence of ideas,"Artists from India and Bangladesh, through a range of printmaking creations, argue why the project needs to be promoted through education, experimentation and patronage. By Team Viva

A mere survival of the art is not the aim. The mission is to promote artists and their various art forms for the years to come and make them popular among the global audience.

Confluence: Celebrating India-Bangladesh Printmaking, organised by The Art Route, features a group of printmakers from both the nations who aim to promote the medium of creative expression, which has survived the test of time even after current technological advancement.

Lubna Sen, co-curator and organiser, says, “It has always been our endeavour to promote art forms which deserve a broader platform of recognition. The value of this art needs to be promoted through a framework of education, experimentation and patronage. Confluence was born out of this mission to create something collectively for printmaking to promote a deeper appreciation amongst the collectors and to extend its scope.”

Artist Ananda Moy Banerji says that the artists will present a confluence of body, mind and soul. “Art, culture and sports are the three major wings of a great flight between any two borders and our “confluence” of prints will certainly open up a pragmatic and broader perspective.”

Another main objective of the exhibition is to educate and inform connoisseurs and the public in general about printmaking. The term ‘print’ provides limited understanding for a generation, which is mostly used to the concept of digital prints. The team wants to educate art collectors on the merit of buying prints as an accessible way to start a collection of mature and talented artists.

Nisar Hossain, dean, faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka and co-curator, talks about printmaking in Bangladesh, “It is marked by the contribution of several globally-acclaimed Bangladeshi artists who have brought in the aesthetics from countries like Spain, Greece, Germany, and Japan. The development is further getting deepened now by the commitment of several talented young artists. The show will give the viewers an opportunity to witness the contribution of this eclectic mix of artists.”

The artworks showcased in the exhibition will include various techniques of printmaking — intaglio, relief, serigraphy, mix media — and will also stretch the traditional boundaries of printmaking into the realm of further experimentation.

Rafique Nabi, Bangladeshi artist, explains his area of expertise in printmaking. He says, “Wood has some interesting visual qualities on the surface which help the object of print. I take advantage of its potential to enrich the design. I keep drawings and broken forms for wood-cut to depict the subject of the design while keeping the wood’s fibres and textures to give it a more meaningful look.”

At the end of the festival, the team hopes to have generated appropriate value to the fine art of printmaking through a framework of experimentation, promotion and patronage. There will be a display of portfolio prints, history of printmaking in India. Participants will also organise curated walks of the show, workshops and camps on printmaking, research presentations on printmaking through seminars by senior art practitioners.

The Visual Art Gallery is set to exhibit works of 24 contemporary artists from India and Bangladesh who established a niche of their own with their virtuosity and commitment to the medium. Artists from India are Ajit Seal, Ananda Moy Banerji, Anant Nikam, Dattatreya Apte, Kavita Nayar, Moti Zharotia, Salil Sahni, Sukhvinder Singh, Surender K Mishra, Sushanta Guha, Vijay Bagodi and Walter D Souza. Artists from Bangladesh are Abul Barq Alvi, Anisuzzaman, Mahmudul Haque, Monirul Islam, Nagarbasi Barman, Rafiqun Nabi, Rashid Amin, Rokeya Sultana, SM Roknuzzaman, Saidul Haque Juise, Shahid Kabir and Wakilur Rahman.

184,21-1-20,Novak survives tough Struff,"Novak Djokovic survived a scare to join Roger Federer and Serena Williams in the Australian Open second round as heavy downpours caused chaos on Monday, forcing organisers to postpone a swathe of matches.

Defending champion Djokovic was made to sweat before beating Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff in four sets on the first day, when fears over air pollution were replaced by disruption caused by rain.

While play continued at the three stadiums with retractable roofs, half of the 64 scheduled matches were postponed, ensuring a big backlog for Tuesday.

Wet conditions are unusual for the Australian Open, which is more used to extreme heat and was plagued by smog from bushfires during qualifying, when players suffered coughing fits and breathing problems.

Air quality was rated ‘good’ as the first round started on Monday but about four hours later play was suspended on outside courts when the heavens opened in Melbourne.

World number three Federer was briefly hauled off court while the roof was closed on Rod Laver Arena before returning to complete a routine 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over American Steve Johnson.

Williams, on the hunt for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, won the first set against Anastasia Potapova in just 19 minutes as she cruised to a 6-0, 6-3 win in less than an hour.

“I feel like I can still improve and get better throughout this tournament, for sure. This is a good stepping stone for right now,” Williams said.

However, Williams' elder sister Venus was ousted in stunning fashion by 15-year-old Coco Gauff, who won 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in a repeat of her first-round upset at Wimbledon last year.

In the late match, defending champion Djokovic dropped his first set since 2006 in the opening round before recovering to beat Jan-Lennard Struff 7-6 (7/5), 6-2, 2-6, 6-1.

“There is a lot of pressure and a lot of different emotions involved. I definitely try to remind myself to stay present and really enjoy,” said the seven-time Melbourne winner, who brought up his 900th Tour-level victory.

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens was the biggest women’s casualty on day one when she crashed out in three sets to Zhang Shuai of China — her fourth first-round exit in Melbourne.

Shapovalov racquet row

Defending champion Naomi Osaka was done well before the downpour as she dismissed Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-4 in 80 minutes, smashing one powerful serve that broke a net fastening.

""It was really tough for me trying to control my nerves,"" said Osaka. ""It's tough to play someone you've never played before in the first round of a Grand Slam.""

Later on the covered centre court, Australian world number one Ashleigh Barty recovered strongly from a set down to beat Lesia Tsurenko 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.

In the men's draw, Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Federer en route to last year's semis, crushed Salvatore Caruso 6-0, 6-2, 6-3.

Player anger over smog dominated the final days before the tournament, which is taking place after bushfires ravaged large parts of Australia, destroying thousands of homes and killing 29 people.

Tournament officials are closely monitoring pollution and will halt play and close the three main stadiums' roofs if particulate matter suspended in the air hits PM2.5 200.

In other results, Canadian 13th seed Denis Shapovalov argued furiously with the umpire over a code violation for throwing his racquet as he lost in four sets to Marton Fucsovics.

Croatian 25th seed Borna Coric was another first-round loser as he went down to experienced American Sam Querrey, while Australia’s Sam Stosur bombed out against Caty McNally.

But former champion Caroline Wozniacki, playing her last tournament before retiring, safely reached the second round as she beat Kristie Ahn 6-1, 6-3.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/novak-survives-tough-struff.html
185,21-1-20,PSG see off plucky Lorient to reach French Cup last 16,"Pablo Sarabia put Paris Saint-Germain into the last 16 of the French Cup on Sunday with the late winner in a tight 1-0 win over spirited Lorient.

Spaniard Sarabia headed home the only goal with 10 minutes remaining to put Thomas Tuchel’s much-changed side into the next round after struggling to break Ligue 2 leaders Lorient down in an underwhelming contest.

They have been rewarded with a tie at third-tier Pau, who knocked out Ligue 1 side Bordeaux on Thursday.

PSG came into the match missing a host of injured stars including Edinson Cavani, Marco Verratti, Juan Bernat and Marquinhos, and with both Neymar and Kylian Mbappe on the bench the away side lacked creative spark despite the presence of in-form striker Mauro Icardi.

The French champions were lucky to go into the break level after Yoane Wissa somehow managed to head Jimmy Cabot’s pinpoint cross wide from just a couple of yards out.

The second half continued to lack clear chances for either side, with Paul Nardi doing well to charge down Icardi's close range header in the 68th minute before pushing Pablo Sarabia’s shot wide 11 minutes later.

However the 25-year-old could do nothing about Sarabia’s header seconds later, the Spaniard beautifully guiding home Thiago Silva’s cross to squeeze the top flight outfit into the next round.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/psg-see-off-plucky-lorient-to-reach-french-cup-last-16.html
186,21-1-20,CR 7 in a row,"Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice as Juventus beat Parma 2-1 to pull four points clear of Inter Milan at the top of the Serie A table.

Inter’s title push hit another stumbling block after a 1-1 draw at lowly Lecce on Sunday while Ante Rebic fired city rivals AC Milan to a last gasp 3-2 win over Udinese.

Ronaldo broke through just before the break, to score in a seventh consecutive league game, and almost set up a second just after for Aaron Ramsey, but the Welsh international rattled the post.

Andreas Cornelius scored with a towering header to get seventh-placed Parma back level ten minutes after the break.

But the visitors hardly had time to celebrate when Ronaldo broke through again after latching onto a Paulo Dybala cross for his 11th goal in seven games to bring his league tally this season to 16.

The eight-time reigning champions have a four-point cushion on Inter, who have won only two of their last six league games, and are now also under threat from Lazio, who are just two points behind with a game in hand after hammering Sampdoria 5-1 on Saturday.

Antonio Conte’s side had looked set to take maximum points from his hometown team, where he started his footballing career in the 1980s, when Alessandro Bastoni headed the away side in front with 18 minutes remaining.

But Marco Mancosu grabbed a precious point for the southerners five minutes after going behind.

Ibra boost

Croatian forward Rebic hit a brace, including the stoppage time winner, against Udinese that snatched a dramatic win that gave troubled AC Milan back-to-back league victories and moved them up to eighth, two points from the Europa League spots.

Star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic got his first start at the San Siro after scoring last weekend at Cagliari.

The 38-year-old Swede did not get to celebrate in front of the home crowd but he has provided a confidence-boost for the seven-time European champions, who have taken seven points in three matches since his return.

“The arrival of Ibrahimovic has given us even more depth and conviction, which has helped us,” said coach Stefano Pioli.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/cr-7-in-a-row.html
187,21-1-20,Get Setien Go,"Quique Setien may want a different Barcelona but he needed the same old Lionel Messi on Sunday as the Argentinian gave his new coach a winning start by scoring in a 1-0 victory over Granada.

Messi’s strike in the 76th minute decided a cagey contest at the Camp Nou and prevented the much-anticipated launch of Setien’s new era becoming something of a damp squib.

Victory also sends Barca back to the top of La Liga on goal difference, after Madrid had briefly claimed first place following their win over Sevilla on Saturday.

I already saw some of them against Atletico (last weekend) because Barca has been doing great things for many years.” It would have been different if Granada’s Yan Eteki hadn’t struck the post with just over 20 minutes left or their central defender German Sanchez not been sent off for a needless second yellow card soon after.

The extra man was the boost Barca needed and Messi duly poked home his 17th goal in 21 games this season following good work by Arturo Vidal, Antoine Griezmann and the 20-year-old Riqui Puig.

All three had reasons to impress, particularly Puig, whose inclusion on the bench was an early indication of Setien’s belief in youth. Puig's contribution after coming on should mean more opportunities are to come.

Setien said last week that if he could make one guarantee, it was that Barca would play good football while he is in charge and although few could argue this was a transformative display following the sacking of Ernesto Valverde, there were certainly some encouraging signs.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/get-setien-go.html

189,21-1-20,"Crimes? Prosecutors, defence lay out arguments","US President Donald Trump’s defence team and the prosecutors of his impeachment are laying out their arguments over whether his conduct toward Ukraine warrants his removal from office.

Trump’s lawyers on Sunday previewed their impeachment defence with the questionable assertion that the charges against him are invalid, adopting a position rejected by Democrats as “nonsense.”

The trial resumes on Tuesday with what could be a fight over the ground rules. By then, both sides will have submitted briefs and four Democratic presidential candidates will have been forced back to Washington from the early nominating states to join every other senator in silence, sans phones, on the Senate floor.

What they’re likely to hear in this extraordinary setting is the House Democrats’ impeachment articles that charge Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress over his pressure on Ukraine for political help. From the White House, the senator-jurors are expected to hear that Trump committed no crime, the impeachment articles are invalid and he’s the victim of Democrats who want to overturn his election.

“Criminal-like conduct is required,” said Alan Dershowitz, a constitutional lawyer on Trump’s defense team. Dershowitz said he will be making the same argument to the Senate and if it prevails, there will be “no need” to pursue the witness testimony or documents that Democrats are demanding.

But the “no crime, no impeachment” approach has been roundly dismissed by scholars and Democrats, who were fresh off a trial brief that called Trump’s behaviour the “worst nightmare” of the country’s founders. In their view, the standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” is vague and open-ended in the Constitution and meant to encompass abuses of power that aren’t necessarily illegal.

The White House is pushing an “absurdist position,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the lead Democratic prosecutor of the impeachment case. “That’s the argument I suppose you have to make if the facts are so dead set against you.” Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., another impeachment prosecutor, called it “arrant nonsense” and said evidence of Trump’s misconduct is overwhelming.

The back-and-forth came as all concerned agitated for the Senate to get on with the third impeachment trial in the nation’s history. Behind the scenes. the seven House managers were shoring up which prosecutor will handle which parts of the case and doing a walk-through of the Senate.

No senators were more eager to get going than the four Democratic presidential candidates facing the prospect of being marooned in the Senate ahead of kickoff nominating votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.

“I’d rather be here,” said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on New Hampshire Public Radio while campaigning Sunday in Concord.

During the trial, Sanders and other senators are required to sit for perhaps six grueling hours of proceedings daily — except Sundays, per Senate rules — in pursuit of the “impartial justice” they pledged to pursue. But there was scant evidence that anyone’s mind was really open about whether Trump earned vindication or ouster.

Mystery, however, abounded over the trial’s ground rules. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., shed no light on how the proceedings will follow — and differ from — the precedent of President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999.

“The President deserves a fair trial. The American people deserve a fair trial. So let’s have that fair trial,” said Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, one of the seven impeachment prosecutors.

Whatever happens in the Senate, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said, Trump will “be impeached forever.” Members of Trump’s team countered that if they win a vindication for Trump, it means “there will be an acquittal forever as well,” Trump attorney Robert Ray said. “That is the task ahead.”

But what’s fair is as vigorously disputed as the basic question of whether Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to help him politically merits a Senate conviction and removal from office. The stakes are enormous, with historic influence on the fate of Trump’s presidency, the 2020 presidential and congressional elections and the future of any presidential impeachments.

For all of the suspense over the trial’s structure and nature, some clues on what’s to come sharpened on Sunday.

The president’s lawyers bore down on the suggestion that House impeachment is invalid unless the accused violated U.S. law. Dershowitz’s argument, backed up by Ray, refers to an 1868 speech by Benjamin Curtis, who after serving as a Supreme Court justice acted as the chief lawyer for Andrew Johnson at his Senate impeachment trial.

Johnson was ultimately acquitted by the Senate.

“The core of the impeachment parameters allege that crimes have been committed, treason, bribery, and things like that, in other words, other high crimes and misdemeanors,” Ray said Sunday.

Republicans have long signaled the strategy, which has, in turn, been disputed by other scholars.

“Rubbish,” said Frank Bowman, a University of Missouri law professor and author of his own book about the history of impeachment for the Trump era.

“It’s comically bad. Dershowitz either knows better or should,” said Bowman, who said he had been Dershowitz’s student as a law professor at Harvard.

Even as he made the case for Trump’s acquittal, Dershowitz on Sunday distanced himself from the rest of Trump’s defense team and said he would merely speak about the Constitution at the trial. He refused to endorse the strategy pursued by other members of that team or defend Trump’s conduct and said he didn’t sign onto the White House left brief filed Saturday, which called impeachment a “brazen” attempt to overturn the 2016 election.

“I’m a liberal Democrat ... I’m here as a constitutional lawyer,” Dershowitz said. “I’m here to lend my expertise on that issue and that issue alone.”

Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing for witnesses and documents that weren’t part of the House proceedings. A few Republicans said they want to know more before deciding. It’s relevant because new information from Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, is being incorporated in the House case. At the same time, Senate Democrats want to call John Bolton, the former national security adviser, among other potential eyewitnesses, after the White House blocked officials from appearing in the House.

With Republicans controlling the Senate 53-47, they can set the trial rules — or any four Republicans could join with Democrats to change course.

Off-camera and during commercials, the stars at the 26th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards got to rub shoulders, give congratulatory kisses, and meet for the first or the 50th time. Here are some of the more memorable moments from the Sunday night’s ceremony

Party time for Parasite

The Parasite table was one of the happier places in the Shrine ballroom — and that was before its cast won the night’s biggest award. Song Kang Ho and the film’s other stars got whoops, whistles and a standing ovation from much of the room of mostly American actors early in the show, when they took the stage to present their nominated film. That was followed by a full-blown ovation at the end, when theirs became the first foreign-language film to win the best ensemble SAG Award. In between the two hours, the gleeful cast and director Bong Joon Ho, savoured their moment in the Hollywood spotlight, taking group selfies during every commercial break. They greeted a steady stream of fellow-actor fans, including Steve Buscemi. “I’m a little embarrassed,” cast member Lee Sun Kyun said after the show through a translator. “We’re feeling a little like the parasites of Hollywood now.”

Some SAG stars loom larger than others

TV and film screens tend to obscure actors’ heights, but when they’re all in a room together it’s very clear who looms over whom. The winners of the show’s first two awards for actresses, Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Laura Dern, both reportedly five-foot-10, made it seem like the night was going to be dominated by the tallest nominees, but the trend ended there. The win of a much shorter Joaquin Phoenix — for Joker — over a reportedly 6-foot-3 Adam Driver for best actor in a film was more typical of the night. And the tallest actor and actress in the crowd, Stephen Merchant of Jojo Rabbit, who stands about 6-foot-7, and Gwendoline Christie of Game of Thrones, who stands about 6-foot-3, never got to take the stage with their casts, over whom they towered when they stood up during commercial breaks.

Lithgow visits driver’s seat

John Lithgow is even taller than Driver, and is nearly 40 years older, but it was Lithgow doing the looking up when the two met for the first time during a commercial break. Lithgow, nominated along with the rest of the cast of Bombshell, smiled and gushed to Driver, nominated for best actor for Marriage Story, expressing his admiration for Driver’s run of recent performances. “Great to meet you Adam,” Lithgow said with enthusiasm as the SAG Awards telecast returned from commercial and Lithgow rejoined Charlize Theron, Margot Robbie and his other cast mates at the neighbouring table.

Small stars scramble for SAG selfies

You could be excused for thinking it was “Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day” for the professional actors of the SAG Awards. Actually, the wee ones running around the ballroom were acting pros, too, on a night where children abounded among the nominees. The kid actors from Big Little Lies, including brothers Cameron and Nicholas Crovetti, were all over the ballroom during commercial breaks, taking photos with stars including their cast mates Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon. Twelve-year-old Roman Griffin Davis sat proudly at his table like he utterly belonged alongside his fellow Jojo Rabbit cast members, who include Scarlett Johannson. Leonardo DiCaprio politely spoke to a steady stream of people excited to meet him during commercial breaks, but he positively beamed when his 10-year-old Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood co-star Julia Butters, in a shiny silver suit, brought three young friends to meet him. He greeted each of them with a huge grin just moments before he lost out on best actor to Phoenix.

De Niro and Streep make SAG crowd swoon

If anyone inspired more awe in the ballroom than DiCaprio it was Robert De Niro, to whom DiCaprio presented the “SAG Life Achievement Award” during the ceremony. Many major stars came to pay tribute to De Niro as he sat at a table that included his The Irishman co-stars Al Pacino and Harvey Keitel. But when Meryl Streep — his co-star in The Deer Hunter more than 40 years ago — stopped by to exchange kisses and kudos, photographers descended in droves and phone cameras came out on all sides to capture the meet-up of the pair that many regard as the greatest actor and actress of their generation.

Telling teleprompters

Virtually the entire ballroom can see the SAG Awards telecast’s teleprompters if they look over their shoulder, and can see who’s going off-script. When Ray Romano said while introducing the best ensemble nomination for The Irishman that he still couldn’t believe he played a mob lawyer opposite De Niro and Keitel, Keitel roasted him by responding “I can’t believe it either.” Romano replied, “Hey, that’s not up there,” pointing at the teleprompter. Romano was right. It wasn’t.

Rogers, Judy Garland are neighbours

Actors usually sit with their cast mates at SAG Awards tables, but sometimes the seating chart yields more novel pairings, like the adjacent placement of Tom Hanks, nominated for A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, and Renée Zellweger, nominated for Judy. The pairing made theirs a popular table for fans and cameras, and it proved prescient. They met up again onstage late in the show, when Hanks handed Zellweger the trophy for best actress in a film.

De Niro gets political as he accepts SAG Awards honour

De Niro received the “Screen Actors Guild lifetime achievement Award” to praise for his illustrious career and thunderous applause from his fellow performers, but spent much of his acceptance speech on politics.

“There’s right and there’s wrong, and there’s common sense and there’s abuse of power,” said De Niro, who received a standing ovation that lasted nearly a minute after Leonardo DiCaprio presented him with the award. About half of the room stood and applauded when the actor said it was his responsibility to speak about politics and seemingly took aim at President Donald Trump, whose name he didn’t mention. “As a citizen, I have as much right as anybody — an actor, an athlete, anybody else — to voice my opinion. And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I’m going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power,” he added.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-round-of-applause-for----2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-round-of-applause-for---.html
191,21-1-20,Trend Blazer,"Amitabh unveils first look of Jhund

Actor Amitabh Bachchan treated his fans by sharing the first official poster of his forthcoming film Jhund.

First glimpse of #Jhund,” Big B wrote on Instagram.

In the poster, Amitabh can be seen showing his back to the camera as he stares into what appears to be a dilapidated football field.

Directed by Nagraj Manjule, Jhund is reportedly based on the life of Vijay Barse, who is the founder of Slum Soccers. Amitabh plays the role of a professor who channelises the street children to build a soccer team.

The look of Big B has left his fans in awe of him.

‘I have been making films based on horror and paranormal. But this time I chose to use a subject very close to reality by showcasing the real horror of matters in daily lives. In this age of social media, everybody is vulnerable to being hacked and nobody knows about it. It would just take one clever hacker to ruin our lives.’

Actor Raveena Tandon will be writing and producing a web series on multiple personality disorder.

The web-show will be in the psychological space and is based on the concept of split-personality.

“I am really excited for the world to see a story that I have worked very hard for. This web-series is a gripping story that I have written and it will surely keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. Concept-wise, this web-series is something very different I have tried. I just hope that people love it,” Raveena said.

‘My kids are sad that I didn’t win’

Actor Charlize Theron’s children are not hopeful when it comes to her chances of winning at the 2020 Oscars.

Theron was nominated for the “Best Actress” prize for her role in Bombshell. But after already losing out at the Golden Globes and Critics’ Choice Awards, her children aren’t getting their hopes up for success. “It’s been a thrilling couple of weeks. I was nominated for a Golden Globe. I was nominated for a Critics’ Choice...Spoiler alert: I didn’t win,” she said.

She shared that her children were sad and angry when they found out that she lost at both awards shows.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-01-21.html
192,21-1-20,From grandma’s stories to canvas,"Ten works of Ganesh Pyne, which will be showcased at the India Art Fair, revolve around his memories of Kolkata in the 1940s. By Uma Nair

Recreating the anthologies written by iconic writers of Bengali literature, Kolkata-based Aakriti Art Gallery brings artist Ganesh Pyne’s 10 drawings to the year’s India Art Fair, setting a tone of ‘less is more’. He showcases the 1982 illustrations for Shotoborsher Roopkatha — 100 years of fairy tales. The authors include the Tagores to Ishwar Chandra Vidya Sagar to Sunil Gangopadhyay.

Romanticism and play of light

The 10 pen and ink works are not just about drawing but also the art of concealing rather than revealing. Pyne, the foremost exponent of the Bengal School of Art, was known for his ability to blend fantasy and romanticism along with an inventive play of light and dark. In Mone, we look at the labyrinths of the subconscious in the imagery of the young prince smelling the flowers. The expression of solitude and the narrative of simplicity both come together in the fine lithe detailing that he creates without being oppressive or overt.

Saat Bhai Champa

Pyne shapes his signature style of drawings with dulcet ease and effortlessness. The piece de resistance of the suite of works belongs to Saat Bhai Champa, the famous Bengali fairytale, which translates to Seven Champak flower brothers. Originally collected in the Thakurmar Jhuli (Grandmother’s Bag of Stories), it received a detailed update in 1944.

The King gazing at the seven flowers offers us a scent of the story and we can imagine him in his garden. The king’s robes, head dress, almond-shaped oriental eyes and the cross-hatching of the skies make us think of the sun leaning across its windows and sentient shadows nestling in its deep recesses, a spectacle of light and darkness enacted every day. As the king gazes at the seven flowers that finally become his seven sons, you can feel a hint of the radiation of a subtle magnetism. Pyne takes us back to the world of grandmother’s tales which stimulated the wide-eyed wonder of children.

Enchanting allure

Pori-ir Golpo is absolutely captivating for its compositional control and the strokes are as enchanting as the story. It makes one go back to the stories of how Pyne’s grandmother narrated tales to him on the verandah of his home during the evenings in the 1940s. Pyne’s imagination and sensitivity both come into play when you look closely at these drawings. It is said that as a result of listening to the stories, Pyne as a child artist was able to invent his own private mythology and familiar kingdom.

Questions come to our minds when we look at the drawings — What tales would a Bengali Hindu grandmother narrate in the early 1940s to her grandson? Epics, religious fables, folktales, and stories of valour and bravery and that of victory of the good over evil?

Pyne, the person

Essayist and critic Nanak Ganguly states, “Pyne’s fascination with the fables and mythology in various settings depict not only a reality but primeval values about what an artist chooses to look at and his strong and subliminal feelings about it.”

The beauty of these drawings is the fact that it gives us a window into the meticulous working of Pyne’s hand and mind as in Rajkumar Poncho and Maniraj. We are also compelled to recall that Pyne as a painter worked mostly in tempera. His paintings were rich in imagery and symbolism.

One also recalls Pyne talking about his early life in a crumbling Kolkata mansion, his evenings in smoky cafes discussing communism and Picasso with friends. “My childhood memories revolve around Kolkata. The sounds and smells of this city fill my being. I love Kolkata,” said Pyne in one of his exhibitions.

Solitude and structure

Pyne’s signature style has shaped from his own experiences of solitude, sight of sorrow, pathos of pain, heartened horror and tenderness and tranquility. At times, in these drawings, we see a minimalist resonance with poetic and lyrical annotations.

The contours and lines alternate between bold and soft, loose and controlled to give us a series that emerge in potency both in context and content. Stripped of colour, their monochromatic mood has about it an architectonic quality in the structuring of the imagery and the weaving in of the tale.

Equally enticing is the suggestion of his life’s leanings-we recall how Pyne had drawn inspiration from movies made by Fellini and Ingmar Bergman.This booth is bound to ensnare you in the ambience of nostalgia.

193,21-1-20,Revenge or money?,"Actor Asia Kate Dillon talks about the conflict between preserving an ethical centre and keeping a strong sense of identity in Billions Season 4. By Team Viva

An you give us a rundown of how things were left in season 3 and what’s new this season?

The scene where the third season left and the fourth picks up is that Taylor has left Axe capital, he is on the odds with not only Bobby but with Wendy and Ben Kim as well. The only person Taylor has on their side is the loyal Mafee, who as we know was the first person we saw Taylor with in season 2. So it’s been quite an evolution for Taylor in particular.

What motivated Taylor’s decision to pull the Axe capital?

At the beginning of season 3, Taylor was put in charge of Axe capital, while Bobby sorts out all his problems. They handle the ups and downs quite well. And we also see that Bobby becomes obsessed with saving his money and reputation. I also think Taylor gets swapped to their side because when he asks how to help Mafee, Axe tells him that they didn’t need his help right now. Hence, Taylor starts feeling left out. Taylor is too smart to not see the moves ahead more than Axe does. Moreover, once Axe stepped in and ruined Taylor’s relationship with Oscar for the sake of the business, that broke the trust and loyalty between Taylor and Axe.

It seems as if this season is about shifting loyalty. Who is loyal to Taylor? Whose loyalty did he break?

Loyalty is a huge theme in every season of Billions and particularly the fourth one. There are things from Taylor’s past that are going to come up. I don’t want to spoil anything but I think Taylor would like to be out of access line of fire.

Where do we pickup with Taylor at the beginning of this season?

At the beginning of season 4, Taylor runs his own company, dealing with the ups and downs of what it means to be in-charge of his own ship for the first time. So, during season 3 there is a scene between the two where Taylor really comes down hard on Axe about the money move that he wanted to make.

Taylor is playing a big game this season. I think he is the type of person who functions at their best when put under pressure. The pressure that comes from Axe and Axe Capital is just fuelling Taylor to work even more efficiently than ever. This time we get to see more about Taylor’s past, specifically, in relation to his family.

What do you feel about the script of the show and what excites you the most?

Working in this show was really the best. The scripts are incredible, unexpected, exciting, entertaining and socially relevant. Though I work in the show, but as its fan I would say it makes for a great drama, which is exciting and entertaining.

What is Taylor’s biggest conflict during this season?

I think Taylor’s biggest conflict during season 4 is figuring out how to maintain moral ethical centre and a really strong sense of identity.

What motivates Taylor the most in season 4?

I’m weary of naming it, but I certainly think revenge or money. Also just wanting to be the best at what he does, which is trading since he is a mathematical genius. I think that’s just the world that they live in and the only way that they know themselves.

194,21-1-20,Lost and found,"A portrait, hidden in an Italian art gallery’s walls, is now verified as Gustav Klimt’s which went missing 23 years ago

Art experts have confirmed that a painting discovered hidden inside an Italian art gallery’s walls last month is Gustav Klimt’s Portrait of a Lady, which was stolen from the gallery nearly 23 years ago.

The authentication of the painting solved one of the art world’s enduring mysteries — Where did the missing work end up? — but left several questions unanswered, including who had taken it and whether it ever left the museum’s property.

A gardener at the Ricci Oddi Modern Art Gallery in the northern city of Piacenza who was clearing away ivy noticed a small panel door on a wall outside and opened it. Inside the space, he found a plastic bag containing a painting that appeared to be the missing masterpiece. “It’s with no small emotion that I can tell you the work is authentic,” Piacenza Prosecutor Ornella Chicca said.

Portrait of a Lady depicts a young woman sensually glancing over her shoulder against a dreamy moss green background. Klimt finished the painting in 1917, the year before he died. The Ricci Oddi gallery acquired it in 1925 and reported it missing in February 1997. Since the gardener’s discovery on December 10, the canvas had been kept in a vault of a local branch of Italy’s central bank while experts used infrared radiation and other non-invasive techniques to determine if it was the original Portrait of a Lady.

Experts said the painting was in remarkably good condition. One of the few signs of damage was a scratch near the edge of the canvas that may have resulted “from a clumsy effort to remove the portrait from its frame,” said Anna Selleri, an art restorer from the National Gallery in Bologna. The experts who did the verification work found persuasive evidence in the work of their peers more than two decades ago.

An Italian high school student, preparing for her graduation exams in 1996, noticed striking similarities between the painting that would go missing a year later and an earlier Klimt work of a woman with a similar posture and gaze but wearing a hat and scarf, accessories that the artist didn’t include in Portrait of a Lady. Intrigued by the observations of the student — who went on to become an art researcher herself - experts back then examined the artwork in the Piacenza gallery’s collection and found that Klimt had painted it on top of an earlier portrait of a woman.

Those studying the work in recent weeks, with the aid of X-rays, saw the earlier portrait. Selleri said the radiation analysis revealed that while painting the later portrait, Klimt didn’t redo much of the face, but used whitish pigment from the earlier version for the skin. Portrait of a Lady was officially listed as missing on February 22, 1997 but might have been snatched from a gallery wall a few days earlier, during the exhibit preparation work.

So who stole the painting? Chicca said that police were studying some traces of organic material on the recovered canvas in hopes they might provide leads. Asked if authorities knew whether the piece had ever left the gallery’s grounds, investigators said that’s something else they hope to find out.

As for why and when the painting ended up stashed behind a wall, journalist Anne-Marie O’Connor, the author of a book about the dramatic fortunes of Klimt’s Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, has an educated theory. Before the 1990s, Klimt was largely “considered an Austrian painter, but his stature really grew at this point,” O’Connor said. When Portrait of a Lady was taken, the value of the art nouveau artist’s paintings was “soaring,” she said.

O’Connor ventured that perhaps whoever took the painting stowed it behind the gallery’s walls while waiting for news about the heist to die down but the stolen work proved “too hot to handle.” “It would have been hard to sell it to a private buyer” on the so-called gray market, O’Connor noted. Some of Klimt’s works have experienced stunning turns of fortune. O’Connor’s 2012 book The Lady In Gold chronicled the ultimately successful effort by a woman to gain back Klimt’s Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer.

That portrait was snatched from the Bloch-Bauer home in Vienna in 1941 by a Nazi officer. The woman, Bloch-Bauer’s niece, later sold the painting to cosmetics mogul Ronald Lauder in 2006 for $135 million. Another celebrity Klimt piece was a second portrait of the woman, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II. Oprah Winfrey eventually purchased that painting and reportedly sold it a few years ago for $150 million.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/lost-and-found-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/lost-and-found.html
195,21-1-20,Need to improve one-on-one tackling: Reid,"Indian men’s hockey team chief coach Graham Reid feels his wards need to improve their “one-on-one” tackling and 3D skills ahead of the FIH Pro League ties against Belgium and Australia.

The Indian team made a dream debut at the FIH Pro League, beating world number three Netherlands 5-2 in the first tie of the double header on Saturday. The hosts then came from two goals down to beat the Dutch 3-1 in shoot-out after the second game ended 3-3 in regulation time.

India garnered five points (3 from the outright win and 2 from the second game) from their opening Pro League tie.

India will next host world champions Belgium on February 8 and 9 followed by two more home ties against Australia on February 22 and 23.

“The good thing was we struggled to win this (second) match and sometimes, it’s good to struggle for a win because you learn a lot and also it is a proof that if we apply ourselves and use some aggressiveness, we can bounce back,” Reid said.

“I still feel our one-on-one tackling can improve and we have also been working on 3D (three dimensional) skills to beat players in short space.

“This can help create penalty corners and when you have a world-class dragflick battery, we can definitely make use of this.”

It was at the 2015 FIH Hockey World League Final in Raipur when India had managed to overcome a 0-2 goal deficit in the first half to draw against the Netherlands 5-5 in regulation time before prevailing in a penalty shootout to secure the bronze medal.

And dragflicker Rupiner Pal Singh, who scored a goal on Sunday, said the team has matured a lot in the last two years.

“If this probably happened to us two years ago (conceding early goals), we may not have been able to make a comeback. But I think we have now matured, players are taking responsibility and adhering to coach’s instruction of 'tackle and play forward',” he said.

“There is definitely a change in attitude on how we approach a game even when we are down,” added the dragflicker, who was adjusted man-of-the-match on Sunday.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/need-to-improve-one-on-one-tackling--reid.html
196,21-1-20,Virat confident of good show in NZ,"A series win against a strong Australia and the performance in New Zealand last year gives India a lot of confidence ahead of a fresh tour beginning on January 24, said skipper Virat Kohli whose team will be aiming to put the Black Caps under pressure from the word go.

India will be playing five T20s, three ODIs and two Tests in New Zealand. They had beaten the hosts 4-1 in ODIs before losing the T20 series 1-2.

“We are taking a lot of confidence from our performance (in NZ) last year. We were very positive in how we played, very sure of what we wanted to do. The thing about playing away is if you’re able to put the home team under pressure, you can enjoy your cricket,” Kohli said.

“You have to win at home, there’s that sort of feeling (for hosts). So if you bring out your A game, you can really put them under pressure. That’s what we did last year, squeezed them in the middle overs, picked up wickets, spinners were outstanding. Looking forward to take that same intensity into the series.”

Ahead of the New Zealand tour, Kohli said it became even more important to win the home series against Australia here on Sunday. The team leaves for New Zealand on Monday night.

“We spoke of that at the huddle, that this is the last game we’re playing in the series and if we win, you go on a tour on a happy note. If you lose, it can go under the radar, you can brush it aside as ‘oh it’s just one loss’.

“But when you win and win under pressure, the last two games were tough wins, it boosts your confidence which we’re carrying forward,” he said.

On the limited overs leg of the New Zealand tour, Kohli picked out the areas of improvement.

“Again, we want to bat well when we bat first and in case we’re defending a low total, we should be able to do that as well. We can't afford to ease into the series after two games, because then it keeps getting tougher and tougher, so we'll look to make a mark in the first game that we play,” he said.

The skipper loves playing against Australia as it brings the best out of him. He explained why he relishes the Australian challenge.

“Last year (at home) after 2-0 up, we thought we’re definitely going to win one of the three at home, but they showed us that they understand these conditions very well now (to win 3-2), having played here a lot in the IPL and so many tours over the years,” Kohli said.

“So, although they had a stronger side (with Steve Smith and David Warner back) than last time, we thought if we play good enough, we can beat this team. The only thing we needed to be wary of was our body language and intent because that’s Australia’s strongest point.

“All the teams in the world are skilled but these guys play with the intent of making things happen every over you play against them. So you can’t take your foot off the pedal at all, that’s what we’ve done in the last two games. The partnerships that I mentioned today, even the singles were taken with intent,” said Kohli.

India raced to victory in the series-deciding third ODI against Australia, courtesy fine knocks from Kohli himself and Rohit Sharma. They both could not stay till the end but the finishing touches were provided by Shreays Iyer, who remained unbeaten on 44.

And the skipper was all praise for Iyer.

“I don’t think he’s (Iyer) going to have any issues anymore because he really went after their best bowlers and got the results. It took pressure off of me as well not having to take risks and the other guy striking at 140-145. I think it was really smart how we went about it” Kohli added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virat-confident-of-good-show-in-nz-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat-confident-of-good-show-in-nz.html
197,21-1-20,Nadal opens Slam campaign with demolition,"World number one Rafael Nadal blitzed past Hugo Dellien Tuesday to launch his campaign to equal Roger Federer's record of 20 Grand Slam titles, dropping just five games in the one-sided annihilation.

The sparkling Spaniard was in imperious form to sweep past a Bolivian making his Australian Open debut 6-2 6-3 6-0 on Rod Laver Arena in barely two hours.

The Mallorcan, the first man to be world number one in three different decades, is not only seeking to match great rival Federer's Slam mark, but become the first man in the Open era to win all four Majors at least twice.

It is a big ask for the 33-year-old, who has only won the title once before at Melbourne Park, against a tearful Federer in 2009, with four runner-up finishes to his name.

""For me it is a positive start. What you want is a first round win and in three sets is even better,"" said Nadal, who clubbed 38 winners and made only 21 unforced errors.

""This court always brings me lots of positive energy.""

Nadal, in a pink sleeveless shirt and matching shoes, was in total charge against the world number 73, storming to a 5-0 lead in the opening set before Dellien held serve, then against the odds broke, before the Spaniard served out the set.

Underdog Dellien was broken in the sixth game of the second set but hit back again to break Nadal for the second time in the match before the top seed again rallied to restore control with some sizzling forehands down the line.

A flagging Dellien gave it his best shot but Nadal quickly raced 3-0 up in the third set as his physicality and power shone through and there was no way back.

""He (Dellien) has a tough first five games but he had chances to win games,"" said Nadal, who lost in last year's final to Novak Djokovic.

""He's a fighter, he's a great guy.""

Nadal next plays either Argentine Federico Delbonis or Portugal's Joao Sousa.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nadal-opens-slam-campaign-with-demolition-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/nadal-opens-slam-campaign-with-demolition.html
198,21-1-20,"India series is big, NZ need to win 2 out of 3 formats to get pass marks: Craig McMillan","New Zealand are up against a ""powerhouse"" in the visiting Indian cricket team, says former all-rounder Craig McMillan who feels the Black Caps will have to win in two out of three formats to be eligible for at least the ""pass marks"".

New Zealand will host India for five Twenty20s, three ODIs and two Tests beginning here on January 24 and the hosts will be desperate to bounce back from the recent 0-3 Test drubbing at the hands of Australia.

""It's big. This whole Indian tour is big after what happened in Australia,"" McMillan was quoted as saying by 'Radio Sport Breakfast'.

""This Indian side are a powerhouse. Doesn't matter if it's Tests, ODIs, T20s, they are the real deal so it's going to be a really intriguing tour. For New Zealand to get a pass mark for this tour they need to win two of the three series.""

The series against India will start with the T20 rubber on Friday and McMillan feels with the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled to be held later this year, it is imperative for New Zealand to win this assignment.

""Five Twenty20s to start and I know it's not everyone's favourite format of the game but we've got a T20 World Cup later in the year in October in Australia so straight away these five matches become important. Because of the performance in Australia we need to start winning again and get that support back,"" he said.

""They're still trying to find in T20 what our best side is. We've just seen the Super Smash and there's an opportunity for some young guys who performed in that to be given a chance,""McMillan added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-series-is-big--nz-need-to-win-2-out-of-3-formats-to-get-pass-marks--craig-mcmillan-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/india-series-is-big--nz-need-to-win-2-out-of-3-formats-to-get-pass-marks--craig-mcmillan.html
199,21-1-20,India beat Japan by 10 wickets in U-19 World Cup,"Defending champions India outclassed debutant Japan by 10 wickets in their second match of the ICC U-19 World Cup, here on Tuesday.

200,21-1-20,Character of pitches in New Zealand has changed: Tendulkar,"The pitches in New Zealand have become a lot more batting-friendly over the years, says iconic former batsman Sachin Tendulkar, insisting that India have the ""ammunition"" to trouble the sprightly hosts during the upcoming series.

Tendulkar, who has been on a record five New Zealand tours since 1990, feels that from seaming tracks during his early trips years, the tracks became high-scoring hard ones during his last tour back in 2009.

""Of late, the Tests in New Zealand have been high scoring and surfaces have changed,"" Tendulkar told PTI during an exclusive interview.

India will play five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Tests during the tour starting with the shortest format on January 24.

From 2002, when India played ODIs and Tests on green tops, to 2009, when India won only their second Test series in 32 years, Tendulkar has seen it all in New Zealand.

""I remember when we played in 2009, the Hamilton pitch was different compared to other pitches. Other pitches got harder (Wellington and Napier) but not Hamilton. It remained soft.

""But Napier became hard with passage of time (where Gautam Gambhir scored an epic match-saving 12-hour hundred in 2009). So, from my first tour (in 1990 till 2009), I realised pitches got harder with passage of time,"" Tendulkar said.

Tendulkar is confident that the Indian bowling attack, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah, has the ammunition to put New Zealand in trouble.

""We have a good bowling attack with quality fast bowlers as well as spinners. I believe we have the ammunition to compete in New Zealand.""

However, in Wellington, Tendulkar wants the team to be well-prepared to counter the breeze factor.

""Wellington, I have played and it makes a huge difference if you are bowling with the wind or against the wind. The batsman needs to be judicious in the choice of which end he wants to attack, it is very important,"" he said.

Tendulkar said he would prefer spinners to bowl against the breeze.

""...The seamers bowling against the strong breeze need to be smart. So I would prefer that if there is strong breeze, let the spinner bowl from that end and from the opposite end, the fast bowler bowls with the breeze behind him,"" he said.

The maestro is confident that Rohit Sharma's white ball experience will hold him in good stead in the Tests as well, an assignment that has been kept for the last leg of the trip, which begins with five T20 Internationals from January 24.

""The challenge would be to go out and open in different conditions. I think Rohit had opened in New Zealand in ODIs and has been there quite a few times, he knows the conditions well. Eventually, Test cricket is Test cricket,"" he said.

""But all depends on surfaces that they provide. If they provide green tops, then it's a challenge.""

There is no Bhuvneshwar Kumar or Deepak Chahar in limited-overs series but Tendulkar is not ready to press the panic button.

""Injuries are part and parcel of the game when you play and push your body to the limits.

""When you play for your country you need to give your best and while you give your best, you can get injured. That's okay,"" he concluded.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/character-of-pitches-in-new-zealand-has-changed--tendulkar-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/character-of-pitches-in-new-zealand-has-changed--tendulkar.html

Unless the team comprising G Sathiyan (world rank 30), veteran Sharath Kamal (WR 33) and Harmeet Desai (WR 86) play badly, India should not have a lot of difficulty in making the Olympic cut.

In the past games, Indian players have played only in individual events but now three of them being in top-100 shows the rapid strides India has taken at the highest level.

Ahead of the tournament, the squad had a camp in Chennai before it travelled to Germany to train with its national team.

Despite the lack of a head coach since the 2019 Asian Games, Indian players have been producing impressive on the professional circuit.

The men's team had ended a 60-year wait by winning a historic bronze at the Asian Games in Jakarta.

The contingent's campaign got even better Sharath and Manika Batra, who won four medals at the preceding Commonwealth Games, bagged a surprise bronze in the mixed doubles.

Nine qualifying spots are on offer at the ITTF organised event. A top-eight finish guarantees Olympic qualification.

204,21-1-20,"Kohli, Rohit consolidate top batting positions","India captain Virat Kohli and his deputy Rohit Sharma consolidated their top two positions in the batting chart, while pace ace Jasprit Bumrah continued to lead among bowlers in the ICC ODI Rankings issued on Monday.

Following their stellar performances against Australia in the just-concluded series, which India won 2-1, Kohli (No.1) and Rohit (No.2) have strengthened their positions.

With 183 runs under his belt against Australia, Kohli was the player-of-the-series while Rohit was a close second, garnering 171 runs in the rubber, including a match-winning 119 in the deciding ODI in Bengaluru on Sunday.

Kohli (886 points) and Rohit (868 points) have gained two and three ratings points, respectively to occupy the top two positions in the batting rankings.

Left-handed opener Shikhar Dhawan has also gained seven slots to reach 15th position with 170 runs in two innings, missing a chance to bat in Bengaluru after injuring his shoulder while fielding.

K L Rahul, who opened in his place in the final ODI, has gained 21 slots to reach 50th position with an aggregate of 146 runs.

Bumrah, who returned from injury in the Australia series, is atop the bowlers chart with 764 points, ahead of New Zealand left-arm pacer Trent Boult and Afghanistan’s Mujeeb Ur Rahman. South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada and Australian Pat Cummins complete the top five.

India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has moved up two slots to be 27th among bowlers after finishing with four wickets in the series.

He also scored 45 runs in two innings and has gained four places in the all-rounders' list to be ranked 10th.

Australian Steve Smith, who topped the series with an aggregate of 229 runs including a knock of 131 in the final ODI, has been rewarded with a four-place jump to 23rd position.

David Warner, a formerly top-ranked batsman in the format, has also moved up one place to sixth while captain Aaron Finch has moved up one place into 10th. Wicketkeeper Alex Carey is in 31st position after gaining two slots.

205,21-1-20,Kohli greatest ODI player of all-time: Finch,"Australian captain Aaron Finch has rated his Indian counterpart Virat Kohli as “probably” the greatest ODI player of all-time, while picking Rohit Sharma in the top-five.

Rohit (119) scored his 29th ODI hundred and Kohli made 89 off 91 balls as they shared a match-winning stand of 137 in the decisive third game against Australia here on Sunday.

For Finch, what stood out was that India overhauled the 287-run target with ease despite opener Shikhar Dhawan not coming out to bat due to a shoulder injury.

“They’ve got Virat who is probably the greatest ODI player of all-time, and Rohit who’d probably be in the top five batters of all-time. They’re exceptional, and the thing with the Indian side at the moment is their experienced players are getting the job done in the big games,” Finch said.

“Rohit’s 100, especially without Shikhar there tonight, for them to shuffle and their two most dominant players to still get majority of the runs is a sign of a really settled and really quality top-order,” said Finch.

Australia could not get the final flourish they were looking for, mustering only 63 runs in the last 10 overs at the loss of five wickets, far too many in Finch’s view.

“In the last two games we have had the bowlers batting for the majority of the last few overs. Which we saw in Rajkot the damage that KL (Rahul) could do in the back end because he was a settled batter. I think that’s an area we just missed a couple of tricks. “Just not having an in batter being in and having faced 20 or 30 balls to get us deeper and get us to the back end,” Finch said.

He also praised India’s death over bowling at the same time.

“But credit to India, their death bowling in the last few games was exceptional. (Mohammed) Shami was nailing his yorkers, (Navdeep) Saini in the last two games and (Jasprit) Bumrah. In both games they were exceptional. You can look at where we could have improved but also you’ve got to give some credit to India,” said Finch.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kohli-greatest-odi-player-of-all-time--finch.html
206,21-1-20,Eng celebrate innings win over SA,"England completed a comprehensive win by an innings and 53 runs on the fifth day of the third Test against South Africa at St George’s Park on Monday, taking an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the four-match series.

England were held up by a last wicket stand of 99 between Keshav Maharaj (71) and Dane Paterson (39 not out) and it needed a direct-hit run-out by Sam Curran from mid-on to clinch the result shortly before lunch. South Africa were bowled out for 237.

The partnership between Maharaj and Paterson was easily South Africa’s best of the match and showed up an otherwise poor batting performance by the hosts.

South Africa added 135 runs in losing their last four wickets, which seemed unlikely when Vernon Philander chipped a catch to midwicket off Stuart Broad three balls into the day.

Mark Wood and Dom Bess also took wickets but England captain Joe Root could not add to his four wickets taken on Sunday, conceding 56 runs in 10 overs on Monday to finish with four for 87.

Triumph

Maharaj hit Root for three fours and two sixes in an over which ended with four byes, costing 28 in total.

Despite the late face-saving flourish for the hosts, it was a result which was a triumph for England’s youth policy, while the way South Africa were outplayed was a devastating blow for captain Faf du Plessis and new coach Mark Boucher.

Even before Monday’s last rites there was speculation about Du Plessis' future. He has expressed his desire to lead South Africa in the T20 World Cup in Australia in October and November, by which time he will be 36.

It seems possible that the fourth Test in Johannesburg from Friday could be his last home series in charge.

It was South Africa’s seventh defeat in their last eight Tests, the only exception being their win in the first Test against England when it seemed that radical changes in the team management might have heralded a new dawn.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/eng-celebrate-innings-win-over-sa.html
207,21-1-20,Tiripano strikes early to give Zimbabwe edge,"Donald Tiripano struck early to remove Oshada Fernando and complete an excellent second day of the first Test for Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka in Harare.

The 31-year-old seamer had earlier made a handy 44 not out batting at number eight as Zimbabwe advanced from their overnight 189 for two to 358 all out.

Left-arm spinner Lasith Embuldeniya, playing in his sixth Test, was the stand-out bowler with five for 114.

When bad light stopped play for the day, Sri Lanka had reached 42 for the loss of Fernando who had his off stump flattened by Tiripano's very first delivery.

The day began with Zimbabwe Craig Ervine well set on 55 and looking for his third Test century.

The 34-year-old progressed comfortably to 85 until pace bowler Suranga Lakmal nipped one through his defence shortly before lunch.

It was the third wicket to fall during the morning as Lakmal also produced a full inswinger to have Brendan Taylor leg before for 21 and Zimbabwe captain Sean Williams edged left-arm spinner Embuldeniya to Niroshan Dickwella behind the stumps.

The left-armer spinner removed Regis Chakabva shortly after lunch but Sikandar Raza and Tiripano then both settled in.

Raza fell for a flighty 41, stumped by Dickwella as he charged at Embuldeniya, who also bowled Jarvis.

Ndlovu was brilliantly snapped up at short-leg by Kusal Mendis off Lahiru Kumara. Lakmal dismissed last man Victor Nyauchi just after the delayed break to finish with three for 53, leaving Tiripano undefeated on 44.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tiripano-strikes-early-to-give-zimbabwe-edge.html
208,21-1-20,Simmons blasts 10 sixes as WI rout Ireland,"Opening batsman Lendl Simmons blasted 10 sixes in an undefeated 91 as West Indies routed Ireland by nine wickets in the third and final Twenty20 International at Warner Park here on Sunday.

Simmons, the nephew of West Indies coach Phil Simmons, also hit five boundaries in his 40-ball blitz. It was his highest score in the format and came just five days before his 35th birthday.

Chasing a modest 139 to win, Simmons won the match in style with a six over midwicket off spinner Simi Singh whose three overs cost 41 runs.

Fellow opener Evin Lewis made 46 with four boundaries and three sixes as West Indies raced to victory with 54 balls remaining.

The three-match series ended 1-1 after Ireland edged a first-game thriller by four runs in Grenada before Saturday’s match at Warner Park was abandoned due to rain. Earlier, veteran all-rounders Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo shared six wickets as West Indies restricted Ireland to 138 all out. Captain Pollard, who produced the best bowling spell by a West Indian in T20 internationals (4-25) in Saturday’s abandoned game, claimed 3-17.

Bravo finished with 3-19 to become the West Indies’leading all-time wicket-taker in the format with 57 victims in his 69th game. That beat the previous best of 54 by leg-spinner Samuel Badree.

Put into bat, Ireland raced to 50-0 off just 3.3 overs with openers Kevin O'Brien (top scoring with 36) and Paul Stirling again getting their team off to a storming start. However, Pollard dismissed O'Brien after the Irishman hit his runs off only 18 balls with Bravo then accounting for Stirling (11).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/simmons-blasts-10-sixes-as-wi-rout-ireland.html
209,21-1-20,Ishant’s injury adds to Delhi woes as Vidarbha take complete control,"Delhi’s miserable season just got worse as premier speedster Ishant Sharma twisted his ankle after another woeful outing with the bat against defending champions Vidarbha in a Ranji Trophy group A encounter on Monday.

On a helpful track, former India U-19 seamer Aditya Thakare”s career-best 7 for 55 restricted Delhi to 163 in reply to visitors’ first innings score of 179.

By the time, play was called off due to bad light, Vidarbha were 35 for no loss as the track got easier for batting.

Vidarbha now have an overall lead of 51 but more importantly, the pitch has eased out. With a bowler short and the wily artist Wasim Jaffer longing for an easy second innings pitch, Delhi at the moment is looking down the barrel.

And it didn’t help Delhi’s cause that Ishant’s 15th delivery saw him sustain a freak injury while appealing for a leg-before against rival skipper Fazal beaten by a fuller delivery. The senior speedster twisted his ankle while back pedalling and was seen writhing in pain.

The first two sessions belonged to Vidarbha as Delhi's youngsters inept tchnique against incisive swing bowling was exposed again.

IPL specialist Nitish Rana became Thakare's fifth victim of the innings giving a catch to skipper Fazal.

Only keeper Anuj Rawat (37 off 101 balls) showed some stomach for fight adding 36 for the ninth wicket with Simarjeet Singh (23) even as Umesh Yadav (2/45) removed all-rounder Lalit Yadav (7) and Kunar Bidhuri (19).

Yadav's double ton floors Mumbai

Mumbai : Batsman-wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav’s maiden double ton propelled Uttar Pradesh to a mammoth 625/8 declared on the second day of their Elite Group B Ranji Trophy game against Mumbai on Monday.

Twenty three-year-old Yadav was the cynosure of all eyes at Wankhede Stadium as he took a listless Mumbai attack to the cleaners first in the company of Saurabh Kumar (44 off 47 balls; 8x4) and then with skipper Ankit Rajpoot (32 off 63 balls; 5x4) and Yash Dayal (41 not out).

Yadav (203 not out off 239 balls) conjured 72 runs for the seventh wicket with Saurabh to take the game away from Mumbai, and then forged a 119-run eight-wicket stand with Rajpoot, as Uttar Pradesh took complete control.

Adding to Mumbai’s woes, Yadav and Dayal put up an unbroken 131-run stand for the ninth wicket.

Yadav, who registered the highest score by a number 7 batsman against Mumbai, smashed 27 fours and one six in his 239 balls unbeaten knock.

Tiwary triple ton to put Bengal on top

Kalyani (WB) : Senior batsman Manoj Tiwary cracked his maiden first class triple century to put Bengal in the driver's seat against Hyderabad in their Ranji Trophy Group A clash here on Monday.

The 34-year-old, who has played 12 ODIs and 3 T20 Internationals, was at his sublime best, smashing 30 fours and five sixes, en route to his unbeaten 303 from 414 balls at a strike rate of 73.19. His marathon knock lasted 10 hours and 30 minutes.

His final 50 came off just 37 balls as he got to the landmark in the fourth ball of the final session of the second day, gliding part-timer Buddhi Rahul through covers boundary. Bengal immediately declared their first innings at 635 for seven.

Tiwary, who last played for India in 2015, also became the only second batsman from Bengal to hit a triple ton — after Devang Gandhi’s 323 versus Assam at Guwahati in 1998-99 season. His previous best was 267 as Bengal skipper against Madhya Pradesh in a drawn encounter in Kolkata in 2011-12 season.

After Tiwary’s sensational innings, it was time for Bengal pace duo of Akash Deep (3/46) and Mukesh Kumar (2/29) to wreak havoc as they reduced Hyderabad to 83 for five in the final session.

Ishant, on the other hand, was declared unfit for the Tests starting February 21 owing to an ankle tear sustained during a Ranji Trophy game on Monday.

""Yes, he (Dhawan) has been ruled out of the T20 series. A replacement will be announced soon"" a BCCI official told PTI.

""Ishant Sharma's MRI report shows a Grade 3 ankle tear and it is serious. He has been advised six weeks of rest and rehabilitation. It is indeed a big blow,"" said Delhi and Districts Cricket Association (DDCA) general secretary Vinod Tihara on Ishant's fitness status.

India will play five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Tests during the tour starting with the shortest format on January 24.

Dhawan's injury troubles have carried into the new year and he did not come out to open during the successful run chase against Australia on Sunday. The southpaw was taken for an X-ray after he hurt his left shoulder during fielding at the Chinnaswamy Stadim on Sunday.

K L Rahul came out to bat in his place alongside Rohit Sharma. Dhawan was seen wearing a sling on his left hand.

The 34-year-old Dhawan did not take the field for the entire duration of the Australian innings in the second ODI after a Pat Cummins bouncer hit him on the rib cage while batting. Dhawan missed the entire limited overs series against West Indies last month.

He also had to pull out of the 2019 World Cup due to a fractured thumb, an injury he suffered against Australia. In the same game, he had scored a match-winning hundred.

Ishant, playing for Delhi, had twisted his ankle on his follow through while bowling against Vidarbha on Monday. The statement on his fitness came from the Delhi and Districts Cricket Association but the Indian cricket board is yet to issue any update on his injury.

""It's a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in BCCI as we will again do his MRI to ascertain degree of tear and decide on his rehabilitation,"" a BCCI source said.

Fellow Delhi pacer Navdeep Saini is likely to replace the 96-Test veteran in the squad.

Ishant was in the middle of his second Ranji Trophy this season, having played the opening home game against Hyderabad last month.

The 31-year-old is an integral part of arguably India's best ever pace attack comprising Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-s-injury-woes--dhawan-out-of-t20s--ishant-ousted-from-tests-in-new-zealand-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/india-s-injury-woes--dhawan-out-of-t20s--ishant-ousted-from-tests-in-new-zealand.html

""Waiting to file my nomination. My token no is 45. There are many people here to file nomination papers. Am so glad so many people participating in democracy,"" Kejriwal said.

Party leaders claimed that 35 candidates within incomplete papers were insisting that they will not allow the CM to file unless their nominations are filed and saw a ""conspiracy"".

According to procedures, while nominations can be filed till 3 pm, candidates who have collected tokens to file their papers before the stipulated time are allowed to do so whenever their numbers arrive.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said no matter how much the BJP conspires they will not be able to stop Kejriwal from filing his nomination.

He also alleged that the growth figure of 4.8 per cent given by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is after some ""window dressing"" and he won't be surprised if it goes even lower.

""Reality check from IMF. Growth in 2019-20 will be BELOW 5 per cent at 4.8 per cent,"" Chidambaram said in a series of tweets.

""Even the 4.8 per cent is after some window dressing. I will not be surprised if it goes even lower,"" the former finance minister said.

IMF Chief Economist Gopinath was one of the first to denounce demonetisation, he noted.

""I suppose we must prepare ourselves for an attack by government ministers on the IMF and Dr Gita Gopinath,"" Chidambaram said.

The IMF lowered India's economic growth estimate for the current fiscal to 4.8 per cent and listed the country's much lower-than-expected GDP numbers as the single biggest drag on its global growth forecast for two years.

In October, the IMF had pegged India economic growth at 6.1 per cent for 2019.

220,21-1-20,Saibaba birthplace row uncalled for; CM can't be blamed: Sena,"The Shiv Sena on Tuesday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray should not be blamed for the ""uncalled for"" controversy over the birthplace of Saibaba as nobody can tell whether the 19th century saint was actually born in Shirdi.

Noting that the Saibaba Sansthan's assets are worth over Rs 2,600 crore out of which social works are done, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said Shirdi became ""rich"" because of the saint, and none can snatch away the richness of the town where he died.

It also said that Thackeray did not refer to Pathri in Parbhani district as Saibaba's birthplace ""on his own"", but on the basis of versions of some historians.

During a state Cabinet meeting on January 9, Thackeray said Pathri, considered the birthplace of Saibaba, would be developed as a site of religious tourism, and announced a grant of Rs 100 crore for the place.

The led to a row following which locals from Shirdi called for a bandh in the temple town on Sunday.

The bandh was, however, called off on Sunday midnight and Thackeray met some residents of Shirdi on Monday and the issue was resolved.

""The chief minister did not stoke any controversy. Pathri and Shirdikars, too, should not create it. This will lessen the glow of saints,"" the Shiv Sena said in 'Saamana'.

The ""uncalled for"" controversy was put to rest after the chief minister promptly paid attention to the matter and cleared the government's stance on the issue, it said.

The Sena said Thackeray did not refer to Pathri during the January 9 meeting ""on his own"", but on the grounds of versions of some historians.

Saibaba ""appeared"" at Shirdi in Ahmednagar district, but none can tell whether he actually was born there. When Saibaba first showed up in Shirdi, nobody knew what his name was and from where had come, the Marathi daily said.

""From where Baba came to Shirdi, whether he came from Pathri, there is a mention about this in Parbhani's government gazette that 'according to some, it (Pathri) could be the birthplace of Shirdi's saint Saibaba',"" it said.

""The chief minister has not written or published the gazette. Hence, he should not be blamed for the controversy,"" the Shiv Sena said.

The party further said Shirdi became ""rich"" because of Saibaba and none can snatch away the richness from the town where the saint breathed his last.

The Saibaba Sansthan's assets are worth Rs 2,693 crore and the temple daily gets donations in lakhs out of which social works are carried out, it noted.

""Why then the controversy over the birthplace of the fakir (an ascetic) who was a born fakir and appeared in Shirdi as a fakir? It is not going to lessen the importance of Shirdi,"" the ruling party said.

The importance of Pune's Shivneri fort, where Chhatrapati Shivaji was born, did not lessen after the Maratha warrior king died at Raigad Fort, which has now become a ""tirth kshetra"" (holy place), it added.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saibaba-birthplace-row-uncalled-for--cm-can-t-be-blamed--sena-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/saibaba-birthplace-row-uncalled-for--cm-can-t-be-blamed--sena.html

Further, he said, ""I did not say anything out of imagination or something that was not there. Lakshmanan (then Jan Sangh and now BJP leader) who took part in a dharna (in 1971) has corroborated it,"" he said.

On the 1971 rally -in which Hindu deities were allegedly taken out naked- the actor said such things that happened in the past should not be raked up again and again.

""It was not a thing that can be (easily) forgotten but a thing that must be forgotten,"" he quipped.

226,21-1-20,SAD won’t contest polls in Delhi,"Cites differences with BJP on CAA, NRC; offered less seats: Sources

Citing differences on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizen (NRC), BJP’s old ally Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) Badal, on Monday announced that the party will not contest Delhi Assembly polls. However, well placed sources in the BJP said the SAD wanted to contest elections on six seats whereas they were offered three seats.

The SAD was also not very keen to contest on BJP’s ‘lotus symbol’ as it wanted to contest on its own party symbol of “weighing scale”. BJP leaders tried to convince SAD leadership to let its candidate contest on its symbol as they have won while going with this symbol during past elections.

SAD president was not very keen to forego his party’s identity and decided not to field its candidates on the seats being offered by the BJP.

Importantly, the SAD will keep its alliance with the BJP intact and remain in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

Incidentally, SAD leader Manjinder Singh Sirsa, the sitting MLA from Rajouri Garden Assembly constituency who had won on BJP symbol, said, “the SAD and the BJP have an old relationship but SAD’s stand has been quite clear on CAA and NRC. The SAD president has welcomed the CAA which was supposed to include people from all religions but we never demanded that any one religion should be excluded from the list.”

“BJP leadership wanted us to reconsider this stand, so, we decided to not fight these polls instead of changing our stand,” Sirsa added.

Sirsa who was accompanied by Harmeet Singh Kalka, president, Delhi unit of the SAD said that they have opted out as they refused to change their stand on including Muslims in the CAA. “Our party’s stand was questioned by the alliance partner - BJP,” Sirsa said.

“We were questioned on SAD leadership’s stand on CAA and told in meetings that this was not the BJP stand. Our stand is clear that country cannot be divided on the basis of religion, the party was asked to reconsider the stand on including our Muslim brothers in the CAA. The Akali Dal does not favour the NRC also,” Sirsa said.

Pertinently, Delhi has over 10 lakh sikh voters and SAD contested elections in Delhi from the four Sikh dominated Assembly seats which are - Hari Nagar, Rajouri Garden, Tilak Nagar and Kalkaji.

Notably, SAD fought Assembly elections in 2015 while in 2017 Sirsa fought by-election from the Rajouri Garden seat which he lost to Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Jarnail Singh.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sad-won---t-contest-polls-in-delhi-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sad-won---t-contest-polls-in-delhi.html

“The idea of a professional board is to allow them to take control of the company and complete the pending projects in the interest of homebuyers,” the Bench said and indicated that the court would stop monitoring the Unitech matter once everything falls in place.

The top court ordered that existing management board of Unitech would stand superseded with the new board of directors taking charge.

A Bench comprising justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bushan and AS Bopanna said there was no ground to interfere with the Delhi High court order that rejected Pawan’s plea. The trial court had also rejected Pawan’s claim of being a juvenile.

Advocate AP Singh, appearing for Pawan, said as per his school leaving certificate he was a minor at the time of the offence and none of the courts, including trial court and High Court, ever considered his documents.

But, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, said his claim of juvenility was considered at each and every judicial forum and it will be a travesty of justice if the convict is allowed to raise the claim of juvenility repeatedly and at this point of time.

He said the convict was 19 years old at the time of offence and there is a certified copy of his birth certificate as well as school leaving certificate which was taken on record by each and every judicial forum.

Pawan had moved the apex court on Friday. He had also sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, scheduled for February 1.

231,21-1-20,Indian man indicted in US for role in international money laundering schemes,"An Indian national in the US has been indicted on charges of running various international money laundering schemes and operating unlicensed transmission businesses.

Amit Agarwal, who was arrested in the US in December last year at Newark International Airport, operated a wholesale consumer electronics business in East Hanover in New Jersey.

He, along with six Colombian nationals, has been charged with four indictments. The Colombians were arrested in Colombia, and the US government is seeking their extradition to America.

US Attorney Geoffrey Berman said the illegal drug trade depended on shadow financial networks to move drug traffickers' profits into the US banking system and across borders.

""As alleged, these defendants ran those types of networks in both the United States and Colombia,"" Berman said.

As alleged in the indictments unsealed in Manhattan federal court, from about June 2018 to 2019, the defendants were involved in schemes to launder funds from locations throughout the US to recipients in, among other places, Colombia.

The schemes intended to enable clients with cash located in the US to transfer the value of that cash to other countries, principally Colombia, without the need for physically transporting American currency across an international border or directly depositing large amounts of cash into the legitimate financial system.

As money brokers, the Colombian nationals offered and executed upon multiple contracts requiring the pick-up of funds throughout the US, and the delivery of a corresponding value of pesos to them in Colombia.

Agarwal was the chief executive officer of a consumer electronics products business based in New Jersey. His business exported consumer electronics to purchasers throughout the world, including purchasers located in Colombia.

In connection with its business activities, the Agarwal Electronics Business maintained a bank account in the US, controlled and operated by Agarwal.

Typically, as part of the scheme, the funds collected in the US were deposited in a bank account located in the country and then transferred to the Agarwal Bank Account. Agarwal understood these funds to be narcotics proceeds and sought to repatriate them to South America while avoiding the risk associated with having large quantities of cash detected at international borders, and avoiding the currency reporting requirements imposed by United States laws.

232,21-1-20,Not so sweet,"Winters can take a toll on the health of people having Diabetes. Archana Jyoti speaks with doctors to tell you what one can do to stay safe

With no let-up in the extreme cold, health experts have advised the people with Diabetes to be extra careful as bitter weather can play havoc with their well-being in many ways given their weak immune system.

They warn that fluctuating sugar levels often stemming from a weaker immune system and slower circulation during the winter months reduces the effectiveness of insulin. They can be prone to stroke, hypertension and heart-attacks. Elderly people report low blood sugar levels with disturbed gaits. Type II Diabetes is a chronic disease that can cause blood sugar (glucose) to be higher than normal.

Dr V Mohan Chairman and Chief Diabetologist from Chennai based Dr Mohan’s Diabetes Specialists Centre explains that due to the cold weather, their walking schedule is affected. “It means that their blood sugar can go out of control because the dose of medicines may not be sufficient to control their Diabetes minus their usual exercise schedule,” he tells you.

It is known that cold weather can aggravate chest pain related to heart or angina. But people with Diabetes need not have the usual symptoms of chest pain because of autonomic neuropathy which affects the nerves which produce pain.

Hence they should be careful when walking or doing excercise in cold weather specially when walking up a slope or a hill, he warns.

Besides these, extreme cold weather can lead to frostbites which in a person with Diabetes can lead to gangrene. Hence, proper footwear and gloves have to be used by people with Diabetes.

“While frigid weather by itself may not increase the blood sugar levels, during the winter people are more prone to cold cough, throat infections bronchitis and pneumonia. If they develop upper or lower respiratory infections, this can profoundly affect the blood sugar level. An increase in medicines may be required, hence more frequent sugar level check-up should be done,” Dr Mohan says.

Dr AK Jhingan, Diabetologist and chairman of Delhi Diabetes Research Center warns that sudden exposure to extreme cold can result high blood sugar due to constricted blood vessels. There are chances of getting stroke, heart attacks and accelerated hypertension, hence one should be extra careful while going out in the cold. High blood glucose levels make it hard to fight infections.

Smokers, alcohol consumers, or those sick or with asthma and elderly ones are more vulnerable.

Even just a little physical activity each day can help your glucose levels in a number of supporting ways. Also, people tend to eat more during the winter in a bid to keep themselves warm.

Besides, this is also a festive and marriage season so people tend to eat more. So “no fast and no feast” policy should be followed.

Studies have revealed that herbs and supplements have shown promise in lowering blood sugar, boosting insulin sensitivity and reducing high blood pressure and cholesterol.

For instance, there are antidiabetic herbal drugs like BGR-34, developed by the scientists from prominent research institutes like Central of Science and Industrial Research (CSIR) scientists. Formulation of time-tested herbs like gudmar, jamun, vijyasar and fenugreek have properties to enhance immunity level and lowering blood sugar level, said former senior scientist with CSIR who had helped developed the drug.

Dr Jhingan sums up saying that never leave the medicine and don’t ignore the symptoms of feeling suffocation or pain.

With some adjustments during winters, one can lead a healthy life.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-so-sweet-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/not-so-sweet.html
233,21-1-20,"Despite protests, CAA will not be withdrawn: Amit Shah","Attacking the opposition for ""misleading"" people on the Citizenship Amendment Act, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said the law will not be scrapped despite the protests over it.

Addressing a rally here in support of the CAA, Shah also declared that the construction of a Ram temple “touching the skies” in Ayodhya will begin within three months.

The minister accused the Congress of not implementing the suggestions that came from its own leaders in the past on granting citizenship to minority Hindus in Pakistan, Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and Afghanistan after Partition.

He also targeted West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, saying she is now opposing Indian citizenship for Dalit Bengalis.

At the same meeting, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath alleged that the Congress is shelling out money for “arson” and protests over the CAA.

Amit Shah said there is no provision in the amended law for taking anyone's citizenship away. “A canard is being spread against the CAA by the Congress, SP, BSP, and Trinamool Congress.”

The CAA is a law to grant citizenship, he added.

“I want to say that irrespective of the protests it will not be withdrawn,"" he added.

Shah challenged opposition leaders to hold a discussion with him on the CAA at a public forum.

He named Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav, Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee while throwing the challenge.

""If any clause of the CAA takes away the citizenship of anyone, including Muslims, they can tell me. The agitations and sit-ins, which are being organised in the country against it, are wrong,"" he said.

""The Congress has become blind due to vote bank politics,"" he said, and also blamed the party for Partition.

""Rahul baba open your ears and listen carefully. Because of the sins of your party in 1947, the country's partition on religious basis was accepted.” Mentioning figures, he said the proportion of Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains in Pakistan and Bangladesh dropped drastically after Partition.

""Where have they gone? They were either killed, converted or came to India as refugees. These blind people cannot see that atrocities were committed on crores of people,"" he said.

Shah asked opposition parties where they were when “crores of people were killed” in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh on the basis of religion.

He said five lakh Pandits were displaced from Kashmir, “but these parties did not utter a word”.

“Now, because of PM Modi, a new chapter has begun in the lives of these people,"" he said.

Shah referred to the recent Supreme Court verdict that allows the construction of a Ram temple at the disputed Ayodhya site. The crowd cheered when he said the construction will begin in three months.

Accusing the opposition of speaking the language of Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan, the BJP leader said, ""I don't know what relation they have with Khan.""

Shah claimed that Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Indira Gandhi advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan but their Congress party never implemented the suggestion.

On Mamata Banerjee, he charged, ""She was demanding citizenship for Dalit Bengalis. Now when the citizenship is being given to them, she has problems.""

Shah claimed that during the Rajasthan assembly elections, the Congress had advocated citizenship to Hindus from Pakistan.

The CAA allows easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who entered India from three neighbouring countries before 2015 after facing religious persecution. Muslim migrants don't figure on this list.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/despite-protests--caa-will-not-be-withdrawn--amit-shah-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/despite-protests--caa-will-not-be-withdrawn--amit-shah.html
234,21-1-20,Delhi court extends NRI businessman's custody by ED in PMLA case related to Robert Vadra,"A Delhi court Tuesday extended by three days the custodial interrogation of NRI businessman C C Thampi, arrested by the ED in connection with its money laundering probe against Robert Vadra in a case related to acquisition of alleged illegal assets abroad.

Special CBI Judge Arvind Kumar extended the accused's custody at the hands of the Enforcement Directorate in the case involving Vadra, son-in-law of Congress chief Sonia Gandhi.

ED's advocate Amit Mahajan said the probe was incomplete and Thampi's further custody was required to confront him with various documents and persons.

The probe agency however did not disclose the names of the persons who will be called to join the investigation.

Thampi was produced before the court on expiry of his 3-day ED custody granted earlier.

The case relates to allegations of money laundering in the purchase of a London-based property -- located at 12, Bryanston Square -- worth 1.9 million pounds, which is allegedly owned by Vadra.

Seeking his further custody, the agency told the court that his interrogation was required to unearth the larger conspiracy.

""We (ED) were not able to complete the probe in last three days. There are a lot of documents which are very essential. In the coming days we want to summon more people which we don't want to disclose,"" the agency, also represented by advocates N K Matta and Atul Tripathi, told the court.

The ED also told the court that the pre-arrest bail of the co-accsued -- Vadra and his close aide Manoj Arora -- has been challenged.

Another co accused, Sanjay Bhandari, is absconding and RCN has been against him, the agency further submitted.

Opposing the ED's application for further custody, senior advocate Raju Ramachandran said the accused has already made 16 appearances and spent more than 80 hours before the agency.

""30,000-page documents have been seized,"" he told the court.

Thampi was willing to appear before the agency, and he has medical ailments, Ramachandran said.

Thampi was arrested by the ED last week. He is stated to be ""controlling"" a Dubai-based company Sky Lite. In 2009, Bhandari's firm Santech FZE purchased a London asset from a private company which was acquired by Sky Lite.

Vadra is alleged to have acquired this London-based asset, and few purported emails between him and Bhandari, regarding renovation of the London flat, are part of the evidence in the case.

The agency claimed that Thampi met Vadra through an aide of his mother-in-law, while the latter reportedly told the ED that he only met him on board an Emirates flight some years ago.

Thampi, during his earlier grilling session with the ED, claimed that Vadra had stayed at the Bryanston Square property in London. Vadra, in his statement made to the agency, denied the claim.

The agency said that Thampi's arrest and subsequent custodial grilling will unravel the ""missing links"" in the case where the ED has charged Vadra with acquiring illegal assets abroad in coordination with Bhandari.

Thampi has been charged by the agency in the past in alleged illegal hawala dealings and land purchase case in the country in 2017 in alleged contravention of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

It had also issued a FEMA show cause notice to Thampi for alleged violation of foreign exchange laws to the tune of over Rs 1,000 crore in the purchase of vast tracts of land in Kerala.

The firms that are being investigated by the ED, as part of the two FEMA show cause notices issued against him, include Holiday City Centre Private Limited, Holiday Properties Private Limited and Holiday Bekal Resorts Private Limited.

The ED said Thampi is also under the scanner for his reported dealings with some politicians and bureaucrats.

The agency earlier told a court that it had received information about various new properties in London which belong to Vadra. These include two houses -- one worth 5 million GBP and the other valued at 4 million GBP, six other flats and more properties.

Vadra has consistently denied these charges and has said he will cooperate in the probe. He said he was being ""hounded and harassed"" to subserve political ends.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-court-extends-nri-businessman-s-custody-by-ed-in-pmla-case-related-to-robert-vadra-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-court-extends-nri-businessman-s-custody-by-ed-in-pmla-case-related-to-robert-vadra.html
235,21-1-20,Fee hike: JNUSU moves Delhi HC challenging IHA decision amending Hostel Manual,"The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) moved the Delhi High Court Tuesday challenging the Inter Hostel Administration's (IHA) decision to amend the Hostel Manual which has provisions for fee hike.

The plea, filed by JNUSU President Aishe Ghosh and other office bearers Saket Moon, Satish Chandra Yadav and Md Danish, challenged the minutes of the IHA issued on October 28, last year, jurisdiction of the High Level Committee constituted on November 24 and the recommendations made by it.

The petition, filed through advocate Abhik Chimni, has sought directions to quash the Draft Hostel Manual ""illegally approved by the IHA as the decisions taken by the IHA are malafide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the students"".

It claimed that the decisions to bring about amendments in the Hostel Manual are contrary to provisions of the JNU Act, 1966, Statutes, Ordinances and the Hostel Manual.

""The amendments include reducing JNUSU representation in IHA, increased rates as applicable to hostel residents and also brought amendments to clauses of the Hostel Manual adversely affecting reserved category students in the University,"" the plea submitted.

Earlier, the rent was Rs 10 and Rs 20 for double and single-occupancy rooms respectively.

The rent for all students, including those in the Below Poverty Line (BPL) category with Junior Research Fellowship, Senior Research Fellowship and other equivalent scholarships or fellowships, for single and double-seater rooms has been hiked to Rs 600 and Rs 300 per month.

The rent for BPL students for double and single-seater rooms has been increased to Rs 150 and Rs 300 per month.

Earlier, there was no utility and service charge, but now the university will charge BPL students Rs 500 and other students Rs 1,000 for the same.

The petition in the high court has also challenged the minutes of IHA Meeting which states that mess services sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10 per cent every academic year.

Contending that hike in the hostel fees would direct impact the future of students, the plea sought directions restraining the varsity from taking any actions which would give effect to the draft hostel manual.

It has also sought directions to restrain the university from registering students for the new term on the basis of the new fee structure through its circular for registration in Winter Semester-2020.

The Executive Council of JNU showed total ""non application of mind"" while creating a 'Below Poverty Line' students, the plea said.

""It is submitted that the criteria of 'Below Poverty Line' has not been provided in the Draft Hostel Manual. In fact, there is no clarity on the categorization required by the BPL and how the University has the requisite data to apply the BPL category to admitted students. No clarity has been even provided in the amended IHA on this issue,"" it said.

The students body said that JNUSU is a necessary invitee member of various committees set up under the JNU Act, 1966 and its representatives were entitled to be a part of the IHA Committee meeting to discuss the Draft Hostel Manual.

""JNUSU wrote a letter dated December 27, 19 to JNU Vice Chancellor to take cognizance of the situation and initiating dialogue. The Petitioners reiterated the directions of this Court and requested that a dialogue be started between the JNUSU and the VC/JNU administration regarding the Draft Hostel Manual.

The eight-member delegation submitted a memorandum of their demands, including withdrawal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, to the LG, an official said.

Thousands of people, including women and children, have been protesting for over a month at Shaheen Bagh and nearby Jamia Millia Islamia against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""Met the delegation of protestors from Shaheen Bagh. Assured them to convey their concerns to appropriate authorities. Appealed to call off their agitation in view of continued inconvenience to school children, patients, daily commuters, local residents, etc due to blockade of road,"" Baijal tweeted.

In another tweet, the LG said, ""I once again request all to maintain peace and order.""

Joint Commissioner of Police (Southern Range) Devesh Srivastava and DCP (South-east) Chimnoy Biswal were present in the meeting.

According to the LG office, the delegation assured Baijal that they would convey his message to other protestors at Shaheen Bagh.

""The LG also directed the police officers concerned to take all steps as per law to ensure peace and harmony in the area,"" officials said.

Earlier in the day, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) asked authorities to identify and arrange counselling for children seen at protests against the CAA at Shaheen Bagh.

According to the CAA, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 to escape religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

It does not include Muslims.

Those opposing the CAA have contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA along with the NRC is intended to target the Muslim community in India.

However, the central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not to take away citizenship from anyone.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/delhi-lg-meets-shaheen-bagh-protesters--asks-them-to-call-off-stir-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/delhi-lg-meets-shaheen-bagh-protesters--asks-them-to-call-off-stir.html
237,21-1-20,SC to hear pleas challenging CAA on Wednesday,"The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Wednesday a batch of pleas seeking to examine the constitutional validity of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

A bench, comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna, which had issued notice to the Centre on various pleas is likely to hear 132 petitions, including those filed by the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) and Congress leader Jairam Ramesh.

CAA seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.

Some of the petitions filed later have also sought a stay on the operation of the legislation which came into force on January 10.

The apex court had on January 9 refused to entertain a plea seeking that the CAA be declared constitutional, saying the country is going through difficult times and there is so much violence that endeavour should be for peace.

IUML said in its plea that CAA violates the fundamental Right to Equality and intends to grant citizenship to a section of illegal immigrants by making an exclusion on the basis of religion.

President Ram Nath Kovind gave assent to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on December 12, turning it into an Act.

IUML seeks an interim stay on the operation of CAA and the Foreigner Amendment (Order), 2015 and Passport (Entry Into Rules), Amendment Rules, 2015.

The petition had alleged that the government's CAA was against the basic structure of the Constitution and intended to explicitly discriminate against Muslims as the Act extended benefits only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians.

The plea filed by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh, said the Act is a ""brazen attack"" on core fundamental rights envisaged under the Constitution and treats ""equals as unequal"".

Ramesh said the substantial questions of law, including whether religion can be a factor to either acquire or deny citizenship in India, arises for consideration of the court as it is a ""patently unconstitutional"" amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955.

""The impugned Act creates two classifications, viz, classification on basis of religion and the classification on the basis of geography and both the classifications are completely unreasonable and share no rational nexus to the object of the impugned Act i.E., to provide shelter, safety and citizenship to communities who in their native country are facing persecution on grounds of religion,"" the plea has said.

Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the CAA, including by RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi. Several other petitioners include Muslim body Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, All Assam Students Union (AASU), Peace Party, CPI, NGOs 'Rihai Manch' and Citizens Against Hate, advocate M L Sharma, and law students have also approached the apex court challenging the Act.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-to-hear-pleas-challenging-caa-on-wednesday-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-to-hear-pleas-challenging-caa-on-wednesday.html
238,21-1-20,Nadda takes up BJP reins,"New chief’s first task is to galvanise party in Delhi polls next month

BJP working president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Monday took over the reins of the party from Amit Shah and is faced with several tough electoral and organisational challenges in the days ahead.

Nadda’s first task will be to galvanise the party to take on Kejriwal-led AAP Government in the next month’s Delhi Assembly polls. The AAP is seen as a clear favourite and Nadda would require all his skills to make it an even contest. His other challenges are Assembly elections of Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, all scheduled within one year or so.

The reverses faced by the party in Jharkhand and loss of power in a big State, like Maharashtra, have made Nadda’s task all the more difficult. Nadda would be required to revamp party organisation in several States and also step up the BJP’s pro-CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) campaign across the country.

Enjoying the confidence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Shah, the new head of the BJP is largely expected to continue with the course it took under Shah with Modi laying out the broader agenda.

Considered an affable and accessible politician, Nadda strikes good rapport with all top party leaders and is seen as seasoned organisation man. Nadda, with parental roots in Bihar, was associated with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) from his college days before joining the youth wing of the BJP and rising through its ranks.

Nadda has also served as a Minister in the BJP Governments in Himachal Pradesh, his home State, and at the Centre. He has also been in charge of his party’s campaigns in a number of States, including in Uttar Pradesh, during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Nadda was unanimously elected as BJP president in party headquarters here at a function in the presence of Shah and all top Central leaders, Ministers and Chief Ministers of the BJP-ruled States. The PM, who later joined party leaders in felicitating Nadda, said he is sure that the party will scale newer heights during his presidency.

The PM also praised Shah for his contribution, describing him as “an outstanding karyakarta (worker)”

“I do not think words can do justice to the rich contribution of Shah as the BJP president. During his presidency, the BJP got opportunities to serve in several parts of India,” Modi said in a series of tweets.

Wishing Nadda very best for his tenure, the PM said, “Nadda is a dedicated and disciplined karyakarta who has worked for years to strengthen the party at the grassroots. His affable nature is also known to all.”

“Be it as a young party karyakarta, MLA, Minister in Himachal Pradesh or organisational duties at the Centre, MP and Union Minister, Nadda has added value to any responsibility he has held,” Modi added.

BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh, who was the in-charge of the organisational election process, made the announcement of Nadda’s election as the party’s 11th president after he emerged as the only nominee in the fray.

Modi later arrived at the party headquarters to felicitate the elected president at a ceremony that was attended by members of the BJP Parliamentary Board, its highest body, and veterans like LK Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi.

Earlier, Shah was joined by senior party leaders, including Union Ministers Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, besides several functionaries from State units in filing nominations in support of Nadda.

BJP Chief Ministers, like Yogi Adityanath of Uttar Pradesh and Vijay Rupani of Gujarat, were also at the party headquarters. Nadda’s elevation was on expected lines since his appointment as the BJP working president last June after Shah joined the Modi Government as the Home Minister. The BJP has traditionally abided by the norm of ‘one party one post’.

BJP leaders hailed the appointment, expressing confidence that the party would achieve new successes under his leadership.

Shah congratulated Nadda and expressed confidence that under the new BJP president and the guidance of Modi, the party will scale new heights of success and grow from strength to strength. Wishing Nadda a successful tenure, Rajnath Singh said, “I am confident the party will achieve new glory and success under his leadership. Known for his organisational experience Naddaji has always been an asset to the party.”

Gadkari said the elevation of Nadda, who started as a common party worker and rose through its ranks, shows that the BJP was an organisation of workers unlike parties run by dynasties.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nadda-takes-up-bjp-reins-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/nadda-takes-up-bjp-reins.html
239,21-1-20,President Nadda is quintessential organisation man,"Soft-spoken, affable and low-key, the newly elected BJP president Jagat Prakash Nadda is a quintessential organisation man who is expected to consolidate the rapid gains the party has made under his predecessor Amit Shah.

He takes over at a time when the BJP is witnessing vigorous challenge from a united Opposition in Assembly elections amid signs that it needs to rejig its electoral strategy following a string of losses in State elections.

If a relatively inexperienced Shah in 2014 was seen as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hand-picked man to shake up the saffron organisation by easing out veterans and infusing young blood to galvanise party cadres and fuel its expansion drive, Nadda is considered a seasoned hand who will build on these gains without causing too many disruptions.

The 59-year-old Nadda, who holds a degree in law, brings decades of experience during which he served at key party posts, headed its election campaign in a host of States.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/president-nadda-is-quintessential-organisation-man.html
240,21-1-20,Exercise the pain away,"Dr Vijay Janagama is a Director, New Initiatives at SuVitas Holistic Healthcare (Bengaluru & hyderabad)

Wear and tear is a natural and inevitable damage that affects not just machines, but human beings too. As we age and constantly keep up with the activities of everyday lives, our bodies might show fatigue and degeneration. Thankfully, advances in medical sciences have helped us cope better. Human body parts can be repaired, refurbished or replaced. Knee replacement surgery is an elective clinical procedure performed to resurface a damaged knee. Metal and plastic parts along with the knee cap are used to top the ends of the knee joint bone. However, not everyone resumes to their normal pain-free lifestyle after the surgery. Pre-rehabilitation or rehabilitation before the knee replacement surgery has been a respite for many since it has been proven to bring considerable difference in patient's quality and pace of recovery.

A fit body always recovers first is a no-brainer. Yet most patients undergoing knee replacement surgery consider rehabilitation only after the procedure. After the surgery, in most cases, patient receives physical therapy sessions in the hospital for only a couple of days until discharge. Normally, physiotherapist will advise exercises which should be followed at home for up to three months to improve balance, strength and movement. However, patients who followed an active lifestyle and performed pre-rehabilitation tactics including performing of exercises for up to eight weeks until the surgery, recover faster.

Exercising before the surgery can be painful since it involves the movement of the damaged joint. Therefore only light impact exercises are recommended during this time. Activities like swimming, walking and cycling can help in keeping one to stay active without laying much stress on the knee. It is important to warm up before any exercise and only gradually move to vigorous movements.

The following set of knee exercises will help you recover to optimum function and activities soon after a knee replacement surgery.

nKnee Straightening: Place a rolled towel under the knees and another between the thighs. Squeeze the thighs inward while lifting one foot to straighten the knee. Hold for five to 10 seconds. Repeat eight to 15 times. You can do this exercise for three to five days a week.

nAnkle activities: Lie on your back keeping legs straight. Now pull your ankle up towards you and push back the opposite way. Repeat six times.

nHeel slides: Pull your knee to your chest using a towel under the thigh and slide heel towards the buttocks. Hold it for five to 10 seconds and repeat at least 10 times.

nSitting knee bend and straighten: Sitting on the edge of a chair, move your heel backward to bend the knee and forward to straighten it.

nHamstring stretch: Sitting up tall on the edge of the chair, pull your lower belly to the spine. Now bend forward from your hips until you feel the stretch at the back of the thigh.

nArm chair push ups: Strengthen the muscles under your arms called triceps through this exercise. Sit in a chair with arm rest with hands on it, elbows bent. Now try to lift your body by straightening the elbows. Hold for five to 10 seconds and repeat for at least eight to 15 times per day.

All the above are indicative and actual exercises shall be personalised based on your existing condition.

Pre-rehabilitation before knee replacement surgery comprises of several components beyond exercises including diet adjustment, pain management, counseling and lifestyle modifications. This systematic way of preparing the body for the surgery reaps significant results in the recovery.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/docyard---exercise-the-pain-away-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/docyard---exercise-the-pain-away.html
241,21-1-20,Historic Trump impeachment trial to begin in earnest,"President Donald Trump's historic impeachment trial begins in earnest Tuesday in the Senate, with Democrats calling for his removal from office and Republicans determined to acquit him -- and quickly, if possible.

Four months after the Ukraine scandal exploded and went on to overshadow the end of Trump's term, and 10 months before Americans go to the polls to decide whether to re-elect him, the 100 members of the Senate will gather at 1 PM (1800 GMT) with chief justice John Roberts presiding over the trial.

The job of these lawmakers, sworn in last week as jurors, is to decide if Trump abused his office and obstructed Congress as charged in two articles of impeachment approved last month by the House of Representatives.

They state that Trump tried to pressure Ukraine into interfering in the 2020 US election to help him win, and then tried to thwart a congressional probe of his behavior.

It will be only the third time a president has endured an impeachment trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1999.

Part of the scandal centers on a July 25 telephone call in which Trump pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, Trump's potential opponent in the November vote.

Democrats, who control the House of Representatives and led the investigation, accuse Trump of manipulating Ukraine by withholding nearly $400 million in military aid for its war against Russian-backed separatists and a White House meeting for Zelensky until the latter announced a Biden probe.

""The president did nothing wrong,"" Trump's lawyers responded in a 110-page brief submitted to the Senate on Monday.

This echoes the repeated assertions of the 73-year-old real estate magnate that the saga is a political witch hunt and a hoax, and that his phone call with the Ukrainian leader was ""perfect."" In the president's brief, his 12-man legal team contested the very idea of his impeachment.

They called the two articles of impeachment -- approved largely along party lines in the Democratic-controlled House -- the product of ""a rigged process"" and ""constitutionally deficient on their face"" because they involved no violation of established law.

That team, which has recruited high profile lawyers such as Kenneth Starr, who tried to bring down Clinton over his affair with Monica Lewinsky, said in the brief, ""The Senate should reject the Articles of Impeachment and acquit the president immediately."" ""President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,"" the House managers said Saturday in a memorandum.

They said the president's behavior ""is the Framers' worst nightmare,"" referring to the authors of the US Constitution, and that Trump deserves to be removed from office.

But Trump looks almost certain to be acquitted because of the 53-47 Republican majority in the Senate.

He will be abroad as his trial opens; Trump left late Monday for the economic forum in Davos, Switzerland.

How long the trial will last is up in the air.

The first order of business Tuesday will be to set the rules, such as how long they will hear the arguments of the House managers, or prosecutors; how long they will hear the defense; the time allotted for questions, submitted by the senators but read by Roberts; and whether they will call witnesses or seek other evidence.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell late Monday proposed rules calling for each side to have 24 hours over two days to present their arguments.

That makes for long trial days stretching late into the night but is a significantly quicker pace than in Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999. The chamber will debate and vote on the proposed rules Tuesday.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said McConnell is rushing the trial and also making it harder for witnesses and documents to be presented.

""On something as important as impeachment, Senator McConnell's resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace,"" Schumer said in a statement.

The Democrats want key Trump administration officials to testify, such as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, in the belief that they know a lot about Trump's dealings with Ukraine. Bolton has said he is willing to testify if subpoenaed.

The White House has said it expects the trial to be over in two weeks. Clinton's trial lasted five weeks.

McConnell has said he won't consider the witness issue until after the arguments and questioning take place, and his majority means he will likely prevail.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/historic-trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-in-earnest-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/historic-trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-in-earnest.html
242,21-1-20,China says virus spreading between humans as WHO set to meet,"China has confirmed cases of human-to-human transmission in the outbreak of a new SARS-like virus as the number of cases soared and the World Health Organization said it would consider declaring an international public health emergency.

The coronavirus, which has spread to three other Asian countries and infected more than 200 people in China, has caused alarm because it of its genetic similarities to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 650 people across mainland China and Hong Kong in 2002-2003.

The discovery of human-to-human transmission comes as hundreds of millions of people are criss-crossing the country in packed trains, buses and planes this week to celebrate the Lunar New Year with relatives.

Health authorities in the central city of Wuhan, where a seafood market has been identified as the centre of the outbreak, said Tuesday that an 89-year-old man became the fourth person to die from the virus and that 15 medical staff had been infected. A second case was also confirmed in Shanghai on Tuesday while five people have been diagnosed with the virus in Beijing.

Zhong Nanshan, a renowned scientist at the national health commission, confirmed that the virus was being transmitted between humans, state media reported late Monday.

The WHO had previously identified animals as the likely primary source, but had warned of ""some limited human-to-human transmission"".

Zhong told CCTV that patients can contract the virus without having visited Wuhan. He also said 14 medical staff had been infected but it was not clear if he was referring to the Wuhan cases.

In southern Guangdong province, two patients were infected by family members who visited Wuhan, he told CCTV.

The WHO said a key emergency committee would meet Wednesday to determine whether to declare an international public health emergency.

The agency has only used the rare label a handful of times, including during the H1N1 -- or swine flu -- pandemic of 2009 and the Ebola epidemic that devastated parts of West Africa from 2014 to 2016.

The Chinese government announced Tuesday it was classifying the outbreak in the same category as the SARS outbreak, meaning compulsory isolation for those diagnosed with the disease and the potential to implement quarantine measures on travel.

China's President Xi Jinping said that the virus must be ""resolutely contained"" and stressed that information must be released ""in a timely manner"", in his first public comments on the outbreak on Monday.

The Communist government was accused of covering up the SARS outbreak in 2003 but some foreign experts praised the swift release of information on the new virus.

""The speed of response is testimony to improved global preparedness,"" said Jeremy Farrar, director of British healthcare foundation Wellcome Trust.

""But we must not be complacent, there is still much to be done to ensure countries across the world are protecting people from epidemic threats of diseases known and unknown,"" he said.

Nearly 200 confirmed cases are in Wuhan, where the city announced it was enforcing stronger supervision of markets and public transportation hubs, and ""encouraged the cancellation"" of unnecessary public gatherings.

The city has set up an epidemic prevention and control headquarters.

A handful of cases have also been reported in neighbouring countries.

A 35-year-old woman who flew in from Wuhan was confirmed as the first case in South Korea on Monday. Thailand and Japan have previously confirmed a total of three cases -- all of whom had visited the Chinese city.

Special screening measures have been set up at airports in Australia, Singapore, the United States, and Thailand.

In Hong Kong, health officials said they were expanding enhanced checks on arrivals to include anyone coming in from Hubei province, not just its capital Wuhan.

Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London warned in a paper published Friday that the number of cases in Wuhan was likely to be closer to 1,700, much higher than the official figure.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-says-virus-spreading-between-humans-as-who-set-to-meet-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-says-virus-spreading-between-humans-as-who-set-to-meet.html
243,21-1-20,Prince Harry leaves UK to rejoin Meghan and Archie in Canada: reports,"Prince Harry left the UK to rejoin his wife Meghan and son Archie in Canada Monday, British media reported, as the couple start a new life after their shock exit from the royal fold.

""The Duke of Sussex is understood to have left the UK for Canada on Monday evening following one of his final official engagements as a working royal,"" Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.

Harry boarded a 5.30 pm flight to Vancouver from London's Heathrow airport, the Sun tabloid said, and is expected to be reunited with his wife and son in Canada -- where the couple are expected to make their home -- on Tuesday.

""His departure for Canada will be deemed symbolic, coming just two days after Buckingham Palace announced that it was severing all official ties with the Sussexes as they walk away from public life,"" the Telegraph said.

Earlier, Queen Elizabeth II's grandson, who remains sixth in line to the throne, attended the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London, seeming in good spirits as he met the presidents of Malawi and Mozambique, and the Moroccan prime minister.

He also had an informal 20-minute private meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who hosted the event.

Harry skipped a summit dinner for visiting African leaders at Buckingham Palace in order not to overshadow his brother William's hosting of the event, the Daily Mail reported.

Harry and his wife Meghan -- currently known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex -- are bowing out entirely from representing the British monarchy, in a crisis that has shaken the centuries-old institution.

He said on Sunday night they did not want to quit their royal duties but reluctantly accepted there was ""no other option"" if they wanted to cut loose from public funding and seek their own income in pursuit of a more independent life.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/prince-harry-leaves-uk-to-rejoin-meghan-and-archie-in-canada--reports-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/prince-harry-leaves-uk-to-rejoin-meghan-and-archie-in-canada--reports.html
244,21-1-20,Boris Johnson's Brexit bill hits last-minute hiccup,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plans hit a hurdle Monday when Parliament's upper chamber told the government to give European Union citizens living in the UK physical proof of their right to remain after the country leaves the bloc.

The House of Lords voted by 270-229 to amend the government bill that paves the way for Britain's departure from the EU on Jan 31 — the first of three votes that went against the government.

The amendment says EU citizens living in Britain should be given a document confirming their right of residence.

At present EU nationals can register online to confirm their “settled status,” but receive no physical proof.

Liberal Democrat peer Jonny Oates said the lack of a hard document could leave EU residents ""severely disadvantaged"" in dealings with landlords and other officials.

The House of Lords is debating the government's Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which sets the terms of Britain's departure from the 28-nation EU. It must be passed by both houses of Parliament before Jan 31 if the UK is to leave the EU on schedule and become the first nation ever to quit the bloc.

As well as the vote on EU citizens'rights, the Lords voted for two amendments intended to restrict government powers to ignore European court judgments after Brexit without consulting UK courts first.

Monday's defeats won't stop the bill becoming law, because the House of Commons has already approved it, and the elected lower chamber can overturn decisions by the Lords.

But it means it must return to the Commons later this week rather than automatically becoming law once it's passed by the Lords on Tuesday.

Britain voted narrowly to leave the EU in a 2016 referendum, but as the years went on UK lawmakers repeatedly defeated attempts by both Johnson and predecessor Theresa May to secure backing for their Brexit blueprints.

That changed when Johnson's Conservatives won a strong majority in a parliamentary election last month, giving the government the ability to override the objections of opposition parties.

The European Parliament also must approve the Brexit divorce deal with Britain before Jan 31. A vote is expected next week.

Despite Johnson's repeated promise to “get Brexit done” on Jan 31, the departure will only mark the start of the first stage of the country's EU exit.

Britain and the EU will then launch into negotiations on their future ties, racing to strike new relationships for trade, security and a host of other areas by the end of 2020.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/boris-johnson-s-brexit-bill-hits-last-minute-hiccup-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/boris-johnson-s-brexit-bill-hits-last-minute-hiccup.html

246,21-1-20,Global unemployment projected to rise by around 2.5 million in 2020: UN labour report,"Global unemployment is projected to increase by around 2.5 million in 2020 and almost half a billion people are working fewer paid hours than they would like or lack adequate access to paid work, according to UN's International Labour Organization report.

The World Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2020 (WESO) report, released on Monday, states that global unemployment has been roughly stable for the last nine years but slowing global economic growth means that, as the global labour force increases, not enough new jobs are being generated to absorb new entrants to the labour market.

The International Labour Organization (ILO) forecasts that unemployment will rise by about 2.5 million this year. The ILO is a UN agency whose mandate is to advance social justice and promote decent work by setting international labour standards.

""For millions of ordinary people, it's increasingly difficult to build better lives through work,"" ILO Director-General Guy Ryder said.

""Persisting and substantial work-related inequalities and exclusion are preventing them from finding decent work and better futures. That's an extremely serious finding that has profound and worrying implications for social cohesion,"" Ryder said.

The number of people unemployed around the world stands at some 188 million. In addition, 165 million people do not have enough paid work, and 120 million have either given up actively searching for work or otherwise lack access to the labour market. In total, more than 470 million people worldwide are affected, the report said.

Earlier in January, a UN report on the economy showed that developed countries are experiencing slow growth, and some African countries are stagnating.

The consequence is that not enough new jobs are being created to absorb the growing labour force as it enters the market. In addition, many African countries are experiencing a drop in real incomes and a rise in poverty, it said.

The ILO report said that moderate or extreme working poverty is expected to edge up in 2020-21 in developing countries, increasing the obstacles to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 1 on eradicating poverty everywhere by 2030.

Currently working poverty (defined as earning less than USD 3.20 per day in purchasing power parity terms) affects more than 630 million workers, or one in five of the global working population.

Inequalities related to gender, age and geographical location continue to plague the job market, with the report showing that these factors limit both individual opportunity and economic growth.

Some 267 million young people aged 15-24 are not in employment, education or training, and many more endure substandard working condition.

The rise in trade restrictions and protectionism, which could have a significant impact on employment, is seen as a potentially worrying trend, as is the significant drop in the share of national income in the form of wages, compared to other forms of production, it said.

""Labour underutilisation and poor-quality jobs mean our economies and societies are missing out on the potential benefits of a huge pool of human talent,” said the report's lead author, Stefan Kuhn.

""We will only find a sustainable, inclusive path of development if we tackle these kinds of labour market inequalities and gaps in access to decent work,"" Kuhn said.

The report's authors recommend that countries ensure that economic growth and development occurs in a way that leads to the reduction of poverty and better working conditions in low-income countries, through structural transformation, technological upgrading and diversi?cation.

The annual WESO Trends report analyses key labour market issues, including unemployment, labour underutilisation, working poverty, income inequality, labour income share and factors that exclude people from decent work.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-unemployment-projected-to-rise-by-around-2-5-million-in-2020--un-labour-report-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/global-unemployment-projected-to-rise-by-around-2-5-million-in-2020--un-labour-report.html

248,21-1-20,Be gentle with baby’s skin,"New born babies tend to develop myriad skin conditions. Therefore, it is extremely important to take extra care of the little ones, says DR AJAY RANA

A baby’s skin is much thinner and sensitive than an adult’s and needs special care and protection. Because they have a higher chance to get infected by some infection or disease. New born babies can develop many types of skin conditions shortly after their birth. A lot of these conditions last only a period of time after the birth and get cured as they grow. Babies develop a myriad of skin conditions during the first few months of life. Cradle cap, diaper rash, toxic erythema, milia, infantile acne, and others are common among them. Some of these conditions are caused by normal hormonal changes or immature pores, while others are caused by inflammation or, rarely, an infection.

Some of the common skin problems in new born babies are:

Diaper rash is one of the most common skin problems in new born babies. It is often caused by irritation to the skin due to contact with urine and stool. Sometimes it is caused by yeast infections, bacterial infections, or even due to an allergy to diaper material.

Baby acne is also common among babies and it is caused by maternal hormones called estrogens. Estrogens are involved in causing acne in adolescents also.

Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a itchy rash that occurs in response to a specific exposure or allergy of the skin. It is generally seen in children over three months of age and appears most commonly on the scalp, face, trunk, elbows and knees and even in the diaper area.

Babies have dry peeling skin in the initial period after birth. Because the infant exists in a fluid environment for several months and after birth, the skin cells start to regenerate, which results in the peeling of the old skin cells.

Cradle cap is a one of the common rash seen in newborns. These rashes are usually seen in the first month of life, starts on the scalp and has a red, waxy, and scaly appearance. Sometimes these rashes can extend to the face and neck.

Most of the healthy newborns develop milia, which are tiny white or yellow bumps about one-three mm in size. Milia is caused from blocked pores and typically develop on the face, often around the eye and nose. These bumps can appear in large numbers, and usually a roughly equal number form on each side of the face. In new born babies, milia can also develop in the mouth.

Some tips to avoid skin problems in new born babies:

Use a gentle shampoo/soap to massage the baby, which is rich in herbs.

Choose a moisturiser for children that contain olive oil and almond oil, which improves the softness of children’s skin.

In the sticky skin which becomes dry, and chapped where the skin rubs, such as wrinkles on the wrists. In such a situation, using a moisturiser such as aspirin, aquaphor, or petroleum jelly on the baby’s cheeks increases natural blockage and helps treat any already scorched skin.

The problem of red patches in the cheeks of infants due to UV rays is common. In this case, do not forget to use sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher.

Avoid products with dyes and fragrances in them because these may result in allergic reactions to babies.

Skin of new born babies is sensitive and can easily burn from sun exposure, even causing permanent damage. So it is important to avoid direct sunlight.

251,21-1-20,Heal the soul & mind,"Pages: 205

PUBLICATION: AUROPUBLICATIONS

Author: PULKIT SHARMA

A report by the World Health Organisation (WHO) revealed that 7.5 per cent of the Indians suffers from some form of mental disorder. It predicts that by 2020, roughly 20 per cent of India will suffer from mental illnesses. What is worrying is that to treat these, we only have 4,000 mental professionals. In such a scenario, the book When The Soul Heals: Explorations in Spiritual Psychology by Dr Pulkit Sharma, a practicing clinical psychologist since 2005 makes for not just an interesting read but can be of great help who are looking for self-help.

We are living in a world where we are at the peak as achievers but when it comes to peace and happiness, it is way beyond our reach. Why? The answer according to Sharma’s book lies in healing the soul which will lead to healing the mind and bring self-discovery and growth and finally help one to revamp one’s life and be happy.

In order to make it easy for the reader to understand what the author is trying to say, the issues dealt with here — stress, depression, anger, grief, anxiety, beauty obsessions, addictions and caregiver burden — start with an example of the author’s patients (names have been changed). This gives the reader a connection with the real life cases and how they felt and dealt with the situation. It then talks about present psychological understanding, treatment and how it finally had an impact on the subject.

Then there are the practice sessions — breathing exercises — that will make the person introspect and see the real cause of the problem, take a corrective route, heal the should and the mind and move forward with a positive step in life.

All this an much more forms the bases of a book that looks at psychology from a different perspective, interprets it and puts it out in a language that is easy to understand without diluting the subject matter.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/heal-the-soul---mind.html
252,21-1-20,StudyCentre,"Researchers have revealed that less active infants may accumulate more fat, which in turn may put them at risk for obesity later in life.

For the study, published in the journal Obesity, researchers tracked the physical activity levels of 506 infants using small ankle-worn accelerometers for four days per tracking period at ages three, six, nine and 12 months.

For each tracking period after three, average physical activity increased by about four per cent, in line with infants becoming generally more mobile and active over the course of their first year.

Among infants, higher physical activity measured by the accelerometer was associated with lower central adiposity, a measure of lower-torso fat accumulation, the study said.

“This is the first study to demonstrate an association over time between higher levels of objectively measured physical activity and lower central adiposity in infancy,” said study lead author Sara Benjamin-Neelon from Johns Hopkins University in US. Of this group, the research team were able to get adequate accelerometer data for 506 infants.

The researcher noted that larger, longer-term studies will be necessary to determine the sustained effect of infant physical activity, but that preventing extended periods of inactivity for infants will almost certainly be good for them.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/studycentre-studycentre-2020-01-21.html
253,21-1-20,Excess belly fat may increase risk of repeat heart attacks: Study,"Heart attack survivors who carry excess fat around their waist are at increased risk of repeat cardiac episodes, according to the largest-ever study of its kind.

Previous studies have shown that abdominal obesity is an important risk factor for having a first heart attack.

However, the association between abdominal obesity and the risk of a subsequent heart attack, or stroke was unknown till now.

""Patients are typically put on a stringent medical treatment regimen after their first attack to prevent second events -- called secondary prevention,"" said Hanieh Mohammadi from the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.

""Secondary prevention works through reducing risk factors associated with heart attack, and stroke such as high blood sugar, lipids and blood pressure,"" Mohammadi said in a statement.

The study, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, followed over 22,000 patients in Sweden after their first heart attack.

The researchers investigated the relation between abdominal obesity -- measured by waist circumference -- and the risk for repeat cardiovascular disease events.

They specifically looked at events caused by clogged arteries, such as fatal and non-fatal heart attack, and stroke. Patients were followed for a median of 3.8 years.

Most patients -- 78 per cent of men and 90 per cent of women -- had abdominal obesity, with waist circumference of 94 centimetres (cm) or above for men, and 80 cm or above for women.

Increasing abdominal obesity was independently associated with fatal and non-fatal heart attacks, and strokes, the researchers said.

This was regardless of other risk factors -- such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, blood pressure, blood lipids and body mass index (BMI), and secondary prevention treatments.

Waist circumference was a more important marker of recurrent events than overall obesity, the researchers said.

""The reason abdominal obesity is very common in patients with a first heart attack is that it is closely linked with conditions that accelerate the clogging of arteries through atherosclerosis,"" Mohammadi said.

These conditions include increased blood pressure, high blood sugar and insulin resistance (diabetes) as well as raised blood lipid levels,"" she said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/excess-belly-fat-may-increase-risk-of-repeat-heart-attacks--study-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/excess-belly-fat-may-increase-risk-of-repeat-heart-attacks--study.html
254,21-1-20,Savaari Car Rentals in 2019,"2019 was a watershed year for Savaari Car Rentals. The online aggregator, which is India’s largest intercity cab service, grew at a record pace, expanded the number of cities it serviced, launched exciting new products and significantly improved its unit economics.

Key Milestones

During the year, Savaari Car Rentals executed a total of 3.5 Lakh bookings across all three of their product categories- Outstation cabs, Hourly Rentals and Airport Transfers. Savaari’s cabs traversed a total distance of 1,750 lakh kilometres, equivalent to a mind-boggling 4,368 road trips around the earth or 46 round trips from the earth to the moon. 16,537 chauffeurs were deployed to execute these trips and were behind the wheels for 6.1 lakh trip days.

Travel Trends

Unsurprisingly, the top cities serviced through the year were Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Chennai. But there were also a few ‘upstarts’ that did astonishingly well: Coimbatore, Siliguri, Guwahati, Madurai, Amritsar and Lucknow all saw impressive growth in bookings, signalling an increase in penetration across non-metro cities. Greater interest in offbeat travel too has contributed to this growth.

Speaking of offbeat, some of the lesser known destinations that witnessed significant interest include Gahirmatha beach, Tsongmo lake, Raghurajpur art village, Orchha and Simlipal national park; while, the popular destinations across India that continued to see an evergreen demand were- Jaipur, Tirupati, Agra, Mysore and Lonavala.

New Launches

The year 2019 also marked the launch of 2 new products- Savaari Premium and CNGcabs. Savaari Premium aims at bringing a first-class, VIP experience to road trips. Premium aims to dispel the inertia that has gripped the B2C luxury segment in road travel - one that has been largely non disruptive and stagnant in service quality. While customers are willing to pay top-dollar for first-class airfare, a corresponding option is simply not available when it comes to road trips. A Savaari Premium customer is entitled to an exceptional on-the-road experience with advantages ranging from brand new vehicles, priority customer service to a hassle-free highway experience. Savaari Premium is currently available in Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad and Chennai.

Secondly, those travelling from or in Delhi and Mumbai can now book CNG cabs at a price point that is 10-15% cheaper than their diesel counterparts. Savaari has now seen successful traction with CNG taxis in these 2 cities over the last year.

Airport Transfers

‘Airport Transfers’ were launched in July 2019, providing last mile connectivity to travellers frequenting 40+ airports across India. Cabs from Bangalore Airport have seen the most demand so far, with customers booking outstation as well as local trips directly from the airport. The ability to pre-book cabs as well as Savaari’s assurance of on-time pickups and drops makes this an incredibly robust and uniquely positioned product. Pre-booking eliminates long wait times, providing much-needed convenience to travellers, while Savaari’s reputation and long-standing service record makes this a credible and reliable product. And what’s more, all this at affordable, transparent and metered rates.

Kashipath: Travelling from Bangalore to Kashi by Road

Kashipath, loosely translating to ‘the path to Kashi’, was, as the name suggests, a road trip unlike any other. Echoing the peregrinations of the great seers of history, whether Adi Shankaracharya or the more recent Swami Vivekananda, Kashipath was an ambitious itinerary cutting across the heart of India. Traversing 5 states and 21 cities in 10 days, a total distance of almost 5000 Km, the pilgrimage to Kashi was indeed grand and astonishingly beautiful. Starting in Bangalore and reaching its denouement in Varanasi, the itinerary wound its way through the eastern ghats, the grand ruins of Hampi, the Deccan Traps of Maharashtra and the dense forests of Madhya Pradesh. As travel partners for the campaign, Savaari provided the logistics and transport. Few cab services would undertake a task of this scale and with Kashipath, Savaari definitely proved its commitment to road-travel as the ideal way to explore India. Not only was the campaign novel and enriching; it caught the attention of none other than our PM, Sri Narendra Modi, who tweeted in support of the Kashipath Yatra.

Hyundai ended the last year with 17.3 per cent market share in the PV segment against 16.3 per cent in 2018.

Kim said the company also remained leader in passenger vehicle (PV) exports last year with dispatches of 1.8 lakh units to global markets.

262,21-1-20,Instagram drops IGTV button due to lack of use,"Facebook-owned Instagram has removed the IGTV shortcut button from the top right corner of the app's home screen because not enough people are interacting with it.

Instagram launched IGTV in 2018 in an effort to compete with YouTube, but then TikTok came along. Before IGTV, Instagram had only allowed people post videos that were 60 seconds or shorter.

Almost seven million of Instagram's one billion-plus users have downloaded its standalone IGTV app in the 18 months since launch. For reference, TikTok received 1.15 billion downloads in the same period since IGTV launched, TechCrunch reports.

""Very few are clicking into the IGTV icon in the top right corner of the home screen in the Instagram app... We always aim to keep Instagram as simple as possible, so we're removing this icon based on these learnings and feedback from our community,"" the report quoted a Facebook spokesperson.

Additionally, Instagram has started testing its direct messaging feature to its desktop site, meaning now one can finally keep up with their conversations from browser.

265,21-1-20,"Trump impeachment trial to begin with rules fight, long days","President Donald Trump's impeachment trial is set to unfold at the Capitol, a contentious proceeding over whether to remove him from office for pressuring Ukraine to investigate his Democratic rivals and obstructing Congress' ensuing investigation.

As the Senate reconvenes with Chief Justice John Roberts presiding, a first test will come midday Tuesday when the session gavels open to vote on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's proposed rules for debate.

More than procedure is at stake: Trump's presidency is on the line, and the nation is deeply divided just weeks before the first Democratic primary presidential contests. To complicate matters, four presidential candidates are serving as jurors in the Senate trial, which will keep them off the campaign trail.

On the eve of the trial, the Republican leader offered a compressed calendar for opening statements, just two days for each side, as Trump's lawyers argued for swift rejection of the “flimsy” charges against the president and acquittal.

“All of this is a dangerous perversion of the Constitution that the Senate should swiftly and roundly condemn,"" the president's lawyers wrote in their first full filing Monday.

“The articles should be rejected and the president should immediately be acquitted.”

Democrats — as the House prosecutors practiced opening arguments well into the night on the Senate floor — vowed to object to a speedy trial as they pressed for fresh witnesses and documents.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned of a “cover-up” with McConnell's plan that could lead to back-to-back 12-hour days.

“It's clear Sen. McConnell is hell-bent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through,” Schumer said. He called the proposed rules a “national disgrace.”

The first several days of the trial are expected to be tangled in procedural motions playing out on the Senate floor or, more likely, behind closed doors, since senators must refrain from speaking during the trial proceedings.

Senators are poised for only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. History, coming just weeks before the first primaries of the 2020 election, with four senators running for the Democratic nomination sidelined from campaigning.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, told supporters in Des Moines they're going to have to ""carry the ball"" for him while he takes his seat in Washington. The Iowa caucuses are in less than two weeks.

Trump, meanwhile, is at a global conference in Davos, Switzerland. His White House said McConnell's proposed rules protect Trump's rights to a fair trial.

White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland said the White House looks forward “to presenting a vigorous defense on the facts and the process as quickly as possible, and seeking an acquittal as swiftly as possible.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will also be away for the proceedings, leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Poland and Israel to commemorate the 75 years since the liberation of Auschwitz at the end of World War II.

She issued a statement Tuesday denouncing McConnell's proposed ground rules as a “sham” because of the compressed schedule and lack of guarantee that witnesses will be called or that evidence gathered by the House would be admitted in the Senate trial.

“The Senate GOP Leader has chosen a cover-up for the President, rather than honor his oath to the Constitution,” Pelosi said.

House Democrats impeached the Republican president last month on two charges: abuse of power by withholding US military aid to Ukraine as he pressed the country to investigate Democratic rival Joe Biden, and obstruction of Congress by refusing to cooperate with their investigation.

The Constitution gives the House the sole power to impeach a president and the Senate the final verdict by convening as the impeachment court for a trial.

The president late Monday named eight House Republicans, some of his fiercest defenders, to a special team tasked with rallying support beyond the Senate chamber in the court of public opinion.

McConnell is angling for a quick trial and acquittal, and with Republicans holding the Senate majority, the trial proposal is likely to be approved by senators in the president's party.

The Republican leader had promised to set rules similar to the last trial, of President Bill Clinton in 1999, but his resolution diverged in key ways, which may leave some senators from both parties uneasy.

After the four days of opening arguments, senators will be allowed up to 16 hours for questions to the prosecution and defense, followed by four hours of debate. Only then will there be votes on whether or not to call other witnesses.

At the end of deliberations, the Senate would then vote on each impeachment article.

Republican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah emailed his constituents that he was on board with the the resolution put forth by McConnell, even as he said the allegations against Trump are “extremely serious — did the President abuse his office for personal political gain, and did he obstruct Congress' investigation by blocking subpoenas?” Romney is among a small number of Republican senators who want to consider witness testimony and documents that weren't part of the House impeachment investigation, but the test of their votes will likely come later.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-with-rules-fight--long-days-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-impeachment-trial-to-begin-with-rules-fight--long-days.html
266,21-1-20,Trump slams 'prophets of doom' at Davos,"At the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, US President Donald Trump on Tuesday slammed the ""perennial prophets of doom"" while bragging about the US economic boom under his leadership.

Taking an oblique dig at 17-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg who was sitting among the audience, Trump in his keynote address said, ""This is a time for optimism, and we must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of apocalypse... they predicted overpopulation and the end of oil. We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy.""

The US, however, will join the one trillion trees initiative, he said. Trump also pointed out that the US now has the cleanest drinking water in the last 40 years.

Environment is the top agenda at the annual summit of WEF at the Swiss ski resort of Davos. Just ahead of Trump's speech, the WEF played a video on climate change, refugees and Middle East peace - all issues on which the US President has courted several controversies.

In his keynote address, however, the US President spent most of his time talking about how he had turned around the economy at home. The US, he said, ""is enjoying an economic boom, the likes of which has never been seen before, and America is winning like never before. Concluding the two biggest ever trade deals, prosperity has come thundering back with 7 million new jobs...we are creating the most inclusive economy ever to exist.""

Facing an impeachment trial over allegations of seeking Ukrainian influence in the 2020 presidential election back home, the US President bragged, ""This is a blue collar boom, the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before. Women now comprised a majority of the US workforce and workers' wages are rising more than managers."" 12,000 new factories have opened and big businesses have come back to the US, he added.

Trump also boasted about US trade with China under new negotiated terms and hoped to have a mutually beneficial deal with the UK under its recently-elected Prime Minister Boris Johnson.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-slams--prophets-of-doom--at-davos-2020-01-21.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-slams--prophets-of-doom--at-davos.html
267,21-1-20,"Climate change to impact India's GDP, reveals report","Climate change hazards could impact India’s Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in a “non-linear” way by 2030, a McKinsey Global Institute report has maintained. Extreme heatwave and humid conditions could potentially cause a reduction in the GDP between 2.5 and 4.5 per cent, the report stated as it highlighted the unrecognised non-linear aspects of climate change.

The report attributed the GDP reduction to lethal heatwave that would drastically bring down working hours and lead to decline in labour productivity by as much as 15 per cent during days by 2030.

The report further estimated by 2050, both the intensity and exposure to lethal heatwaves, as well as the impact on outdoor work could continue to increase in a non-linear way.

“The number of people living in areas with some likelihood of experiencing a lethal heatwave could rise from zero today to 250 million to 360 million by 2030, with a 9 per cent annual probability of occurring, and to 700 million to 1.2 billion by 2050 with a 14 per cent annual probability of occurring (under an RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) 8.5 scenario and not factoring in air conditioner penetration).

Knock-on impacts from climate hazards could affect employment, incomes, and connected sectors,” the report stated. The report warned that societies and systems most at risk are close to physical and biological thresholds. “Once thresholds are breached, impacts could be non-linear,” it stated.

The report estimated that addressing some of the risk of lethal heatwaves by 2030, using air conditioning, could cost up to $110 billion. “India will need to adapt through capacity and knowledge building, investment in adaptive technology and infrastructure, and supporting the economy’s transition away from outdoor work,” the report stated.

The report found that all 105 countries examined could experience an increase in at least one type of risk to their stock of human, physical and natural capital by 2030. The share of annual outdoor working hours lost due to extreme heat and humidity in exposed regions would double from 10 per cent today to 15 to 20 per cent by 2050.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), July 2019 was the hottest July ever recorded in the country’s history and 65.12 per cent of India’s population was exposed to temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius between May and June, 2019, the most widespread over four years. In 2016, 59.32 per cent of India’s population faced a heatwave, the number rose to 61.4 per cent in 2017 and fell to 52.94 per cent in 2018. “Global temperature records were broken during the summer of 2019, with the July temperature 1.2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial era,” it said.

A study by the Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar said India will see a four-fold rise in heatwaves if global temperature rise is restricted to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the turn of this century. “If the world fails to contain global temperature rise, India could see an eight-fold rise in heat waves,” it said.

The Lancet report 2019 stated 153 billion hours of labour were lost globally in 2017 due to heat, an increase of 62 billion hours relative to 2000. Between 2000 and 2017, the report said labour hours lost in agriculture rose from about 40,000 million hours in 2000 to about 60,000 million hours in 2017.

“Similar trends, although of smaller magnitude, affect the industrial and service sectors, where the effect of climatic conditions is reduced due to less physically strenuous work condition,” it stated.

“Overall, India lost nearly 75,000 million hours of labour in 2017, relative to about 43,000 million hours in 2000, an increase of over 30,000 million hours over two decades.
