0,10-4-20,Light at the end of tunnel,"While dealing with the Coronavirus epidemic, India must draw a fine line between reaction and response. Its measures must be thoughtful rather than emotive

It has often been said, yet it bears repeating: The Coronavirus epidemic will, in all probability, leave the world looking significantly different from the one we inhabited prior to the outbreak of the infection. The global nature of COVID-19 has ensured that this realisation is not limited to only a few but finds resonance across borders. India’s response to the outbreak has been comparatively swift. Credit, therefore, must be given to all parties, who have fought, and continue to fight the notorious virus.

While praise is well-deserved, we must ensure that our response to this novel threat is swift and decisive. We cannot afford to be reactive. This is where I would like to draw a distinction between “reaction” and “response.” For the purpose of this article, the latter refers to a well-calibrated decision, one that considers all factors and puts things into the context while also keeping in mind the consequences of the former. This should be a decision that utilises the slow thinking part of our brain. A “reaction,” on the other hand, is, as the word suggests, “reactive.” It is our first response to the problem, where what is right in front of us is the only thing we react to. Such a “reaction” is intuitive and born from the fast-thinking part of our brain. In this particular case of Coronavirus, the big thing in front of us is that it is one of the biggest pandemics of our times.

For example, our obsession with the Coronavirus and the news surrounding it is unsurprising. However, it must be put into context. Tuberculosis kills an estimated 1,200 people per day in India. Compare this with the number of Coronavirus deaths, which currently is as low as 10-30 per day. However, our “reaction” to the Coronavirus is much more severe than the one to tuberculosis. Of course, this is an oversimplification of the problem and I do not want to be misunderstood in saying that the current pandemic requires any less effort, vigilance or focus. This could be a terminal mistake for the country and we must exercise as much caution and care as suggested by our leaders and healthcare professionals. After all, any negligence could cost the lives of several other people and we owe a duty of care to each other during these difficult times.

However, the human mind is really strange. We tend to focus a lot more on things that evoke strong “reactions.” For example, terrorism and murders are immense social evils. They take up a chunk of the time of television news hours, space of newspapers and are a hot topic for social discussion. But globally, the number of people who die due to suicide in a year, is almost twice the number who die due to homicide. Yet, we do not as yet have as frequent discussions or serious debates about addressing mental health issues. Instead, we end up focussing more on the problem that evokes greater emotions. We are humans, after all.

In the fight against Coronavirus though, we cannot afford the same reaction. We must be thoughtful rather than emotive in our response. One aspect of the fight against COVID-19 is the immediate decision to impose a nationwide lockdown. There is no denying the fact that this is the only “true” way to fight this dreaded virus at this particular time. However, while implementing the lockdown, we cannot ignore the fact that cure runs the risk of causing more harm than the disease.

Over 76 per cent of Indian workers are engaged in “vulnerable employment.” This was starkly visible when millions of migrant workers from all over the country tried to make their way home on foot. While Governments and civil society groups have come forward in a commendable way to help and ensure that the workers do not die due to hunger, we cannot expect this to be a long-term solution.

A large part of the working force in our country are either daily wagers or contractual workers. While even for a short period of time, a lockdown is more palpable for salary earners and business owners, for daily wage earners, it is a daily struggle of life and death. Therefore, in my opinion, a complete lockdown will have the effect of pushing the country 25 years back. We cannot, therefore, give in to our intuition.

We must think of more novel and nuanced ways whereby this problem can be tackled. Whether it is about targetting specific hotspots through sealing drives, as being done in certain parts of the national capital by ensuring doorstep delivery of essentials, or something else, our approach cannot afford to be simplistic and carte blanche.

The other thing we must do is, carry forward this deliberative approach, going forward. What this means is that we must ensure that Governments spend more on healthcare and education rather than on statues. We must look at ways by which our spending can be better utilised and how social goals can be achieved more efficiently. Health, for example, has a close causal relationship with cleanliness. In order to enforce cleanliness, we cannot merely rely on advertisement campaigns or just be content with building a record number of toilets. Both these measures have been proven to not nudge the people to do the right thing. Instead, what has proven problematic is not the existence of toilets in many areas but the fact that they are often dirty and lack proper waste disposal measures. This dissuades the people from using the toilets even if there may be many around them.

Therefore, the focus needs to be on understanding what are the behavioural reasons behind the people who do not adopt clean habits. Only after understanding these cues can an effective strategy be implemented. One way of ensuring that we understand these social behaviour and calibrate the efficacy of our systems is by ensuring that maximum amount of accurate information is at our disposal. This cannot be done solely by the Government.

Every Government (just as every person) has an incentive to show itself in the best light. Therefore, we must encourage civil society and the media to provide ground-level feedback. Here, too, there is a chance of bias and fake news being circulated as we have seen from time to time. Thus, any supply or encouragement of fake or unsubstantiated data must be soundly punished.

In the case of Coronavirus, just as in every sphere of our lives, we have our blind spots, too. Unfortunately, for our elected leaders, there is little scope for such blind spots while dealing with a pandemic and balancing our economic interests on the same scale. We must, therefore, be unafraid of diverse views and encourage open communication. The virus does not affect just a few of us but all of us in one way or the other. Therefore, we have little option but to come together to try and ensure there is some light at the end of this long tunnel.

1,10-4-20,Form of Yatra to be finalised as per Centre's directions considering situation: Maharaj,"The Char Dham shrines will be reopened as per the schedule but the form of this pilgrimage will be finalised as per the directions of the Central Government considering the situation in India and abroad. The State’s Tourism and Culture Minister Satpal Maharaj said this while having detailed telephonic discussions with office bearers of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) regarding efforts to tackle the situation resulting from spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

The telephonic deliberations on Thursday went on for about 90 minutes during which the RSS office bearers shared their experiences and suggestions for tackling the pandemic.

It is pertinent to mention here that the Char Dham shrines are slated to be reopened later this month. However, considering the restrictions in place for containment of the spread of COVID-19, the State Government will finalise the form of this pilgrimage as per Central Government directions on the basis of the national and international situation.

Maharaj said that whenever the nation faced difficult times, the volunteers of the RSS went to the villages and homes to undertake disaster relief works without caring for their own homes and safety.

The work done by the RSS volunteers to facilitate food for the daily wagers in Uttarakhand during the lockdown is a motivational example for all.

He said, “As soon as there was a hint of COVID-19 in the nation, the Sangh displayed scientific temperament and converted its headquarters in Nagpur into a hospital.

Not only this, it also postponed its national representatives meet scheduled to be held in Bengaluru.” He appreciated the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat for deferring all programmes and celebrations of the Sangh till June. Regarding the situation in Uttarakhand, the minister said that considering the rising numbers of COVID-19 patients the district administrations will have to become more alert and active. He said that followers of all religions and members of all communities should cooperate with the state government in the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic. Maharaj, who is also the minister in charge of ensuring effective prevention and control of COVID-19 in Haridwar district said that in these difficult times, public representatives and officials should stand with the affected public.

Protection from COVID-19 is possible only by ensuring health safety and ration distribution, he said. The minister further told the RSS functionaries that Uttarakhand will not face shortage of doctors and nursing staff. Concrete efforts are underway to normalise life in the mountainous regions of the state. He also requested volunteers and organisations involved in food distribution to wear mask, gloves and maintain social distancing.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/form-of-yatra-to-be-finalised-as-per-centre-s-directions-considering-situation--maharaj.html
2,10-4-20,"Try segregating garbage at home, says Dr Joshi","The movement of sanitation workers is being regulated in the city due to the lockdown, said Dehradun’s chief municipal health officer Dr Kailash Joshi. He said that the locals should be cooperative and try to segregate their garbage at their homes.

For the past few weeks, the locals of several areas of the city have been complaining that garbage collection vehicles from the municipal corporation of Dehradun have stopped coming to pick up the garbage since the announcement of lockdown. Some even complained about the garbage dumping in their nearby locations. Talking about this, Dr Joshi said, ""The garbage gathered in some areas is being picked up by the workers. The garbage collection vehicles of the corporation are also collecting garbage from the residences of locals. However, if the garbage collection vehicle is not arriving in an area, it is probably due to the restrictions of the police."" He added that various areas where the COVID-19 patients were found are sealed by the administration, therefore the movement through such areas is not possible. ""So far, we have not sent any sanitation workers in any sealed areas.

The locals will collect their own garbage within the colonies which will be picked up later by our sanitation workers,"" said Dr Joshi. He further added that the purpose of lockdown is to minimise the movement in the city therefore the movement of sanitation workers is also regulated in Dehradun. According to him, the locals should understand the gravity of the situation in the city and try to segregate the garbage at their homes or collect it for few days if the sanitation workers are not available in their area.

Reportedly, some of the sanitation workers are stuck in the sealed areas of the city and some have refused to enter the areas in the city sealed due to the COVID-19 without the Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kit. However, deputy municipal commissioner Rohitash Sharma said that all the necessary equipments are provided to the sanitation workers. “So far, no sanitation worker has approached us for any PPE kit, but if they will do, it will surely be considered by the MCD,” said Sharma.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/try-segregating-garbage-at-home--says-dr-joshi.html
3,10-4-20,SCPCR chief directs action against schools demanding fees during lockdown,"The chairperson of State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) Usha Negi has instructed the Dehradun chief education officer to take action against the schools pressurising the parents of students to submit the school fee during the lockdown.

On Thursday, Negi received complaints from several parents who called her on the phone stating that some schools are pressurising the parents to deposit the fees of their children.

According to Negi, if any school asks for fees or pressurizes any guardian to deposit it before the situation gets normal in the State, its recognition can be cancelled. Negi also condemned the actions of those schools that run under the charitable trusts and societies but are still pressurising the parents for fee submission during the crisis. Negi has instructed the chief education officer Asha Rani Painuly to take appropriate actions against the administration of such schools.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/scpcr-chief-directs-action-against-schools-demanding-fees-during-lockdown.html
4,10-4-20,Increase COVID-19 testing facilities: PCC chief Pritam,"Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Pritam Singh has hailed the Supreme Court (SC) judgement on free testing of novel Coronavirus. In a statement, he has said that the direction of SC to the Union Government on free COVID-19 test is very good. He said that in view of ever increasing numbers of COVID-19 infected patients in Uttarakhand, there is an urgent need to open more COVID-19 testing facilities in the state. The PCC president opined that the State Government should start an extensive information campaign to inform about these testing centres both in Government and private sector so that tests of suspected patients are done on large scale. It would help in saving precious lives, he said. Singh added that at present the state has very few testing facilities of COVID-19 and under such circumstances the government should act fast and increase COVID-19 testing facilities in the state. The PCC President said that the State Government should give proper relaxation to the farmers from lock down for harvesting the Rabi crops and also release a time table for it. He added that it is necessary that the country does not face any food crisis at this critical time.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/increase-covid-19-testing-facilities--pcc-chief-pritam.html

6,10-4-20,AIIMS Rishikesh & BEL develop remote monitoring device,"With an objective to reduce the risk of health care workers, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rishikesh in collaboration with the state owned Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) has developed a state of the art health monitoring system to remotely access the health of COVID-19 patients and suspected patients of the disease. This device when in use is expected to reduce the increasing demand of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other logistics.

The director AIIMS Rishikesh, Ravikant said that the trials of the remote monitoring device are successful.

He said that faced with COVID-19 pandemic, a need to develop a solution to remotely monitor patients for limiting exposure healthcare workers was prime and urgent.

He said that based on the inputs given by AIIMS Rishikesh, BEL developed a proof of concept (POC) model of a system to measure parameters such as temperature, pulse rate, saturated oxygen level and respiration rate. The BEL has also networked these sensors for remote monitoring these critical parameters.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/aiims-rishikesh---bel-develop-remote-monitoring-device.html
7,10-4-20,IIT Roorkee start-ups tackling COVID-19 through innovative technologies,"The start-ups and entrepreneurs from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee are taking the fight against COVID-19 to the next level by developing technologies and medical devices on war footing. Incubated at TIDES Business Incubator, these products are going to be available in the market soon, covering the broad spectrum from diagnosis, treatment and safety in a pandemic situation.

“During this unprecedented time, we are committed to augmenting the government efforts to tackle COVID-19. TIDES Business Incubator plays a catalytic role in encouraging spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation. By designing equipment for diagnosis, treatment and safety, we are gearing to meet the challenges in this crisis,” said Azam Ali Khan, CEO, TIDES, IIT Roorkee.

Log9 Materials, a Sequoia & Exfinity funded startup, has come up with an innovative product named CoronaOven that makes use of UV-C light in combination with significant design parameters in order to effectively sanitise the surfaces of various products/objects of regular use in healthcare and household settings, thus preventing surface-to-human transmission of novel coronavirus. Graduated from TIDES, Log9 Materials developed this technology within two weeks, beating the lockdown challenges, and it is now ready for mass deployment.

Raven Eye, an incubated startup founded by Prof Kamal Jain of IIT Roorkee, has developed a surveillance system to fight COVID-19 through a unique tracking mobile application.

Using geo-fencing technology, the system generates alert if any individual violates quarantine. In case the network is not available, the application will send alert through SMS.

Realising the immense need for sanitisers to fight COVID-19 spread and the impending shortage, Heal Agnostics Pvt Limited developed a herbal sanitiser in the lab itself and distributed more than 2500 litres of it, free of cost within IIT Roorkee campus. The startup is mainly developing technology for fast detection of various types of cancer, but rose up to the occasion to meet a timely need.

“It is heartening to learn that our incubated companies, past and present, are coming forward to tackle COVID-19. We stand with the government at this critical juncture and I am very hopeful that our country will be successful in protecting us from widespread misery,” said IIT Roorkee director Prof Ajit K Chaturvedi.

With the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in the country, the biggest challenge is to ensure a sufficient quantity of Ventilator.

Professors Akshay Dwivedi and Arup Das, from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, along with AIIMS Rishikesh developed a low cost, portable closed-loop ventilator.

Named ‘Pran Vayu’, the ventilator has feedback that can control tidal volume and breath per minute. Some of the features of the ventilator are remote monitoring by health professionals, touch screen control of all operating parameters, moister, and temperature control for inhaled air.

The ventilator has generated extraordinary interest from the industry community with several offers for manufacturing in scale. The team has also developed face shields which can be used by health workers/ doctors while treating COVID-19 patients.

Shellios, a smart helmets startup, founded by alumnus Amit Pathak, is developing a Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR) which can be used by health workers/doctors to counter infection in the hospital premises.

They are also separately working on another model of low-cost respiratory aid.

Vyaan, a cleantech startup, led by a group of IIT Roorkee alumni, is developing a low-cost reusable mask which can be made available in mass quantity.

Test Right Solution, founded by alumnus Shubham Ratore, is developing a real time PCR and virus detection kit. This indigenously developed system is expected to be floated at 1/4th of the cost and would multiply the number of tests conducted, by enhancing the existing hospital and lab facilities available in the country. TBS Planet, a media tech start-up at IIT Roorkee, is providing free online subscription of its comics to motivate children during the lockdown period.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/iit-roorkee-start-ups-tackling-covid-19-through-innovative-technologies.html
8,10-4-20,Ear to the ground,"Ignore the politics but WHO did misread the pandemic as it evolved. India has done well to rely on its field assessment

First things first. India has no choice but to develop its own template of protecting itself from the monstrous attack of the Coronavirus. That means in a densely populated country like ours, we will need to minimise the rush of people in danger of contaminating each other. Hence a protracted spell of lockdown and a behavioural monitoring, for example, at markets. The other is harvesting available resources in a poorly developed health framework to treat the sick, which means aggressive testing in clusters and faster serology tests besides pool tests in virgin areas. In other words, a tiered approach to the problem. Then there is the larger challenge of enabling the economy at the local level through staggered permits for agriculture and production. And given Indian doctors and researchers have gone on to achieve world acclaim, it is time for us to trust home-grown experience and expertise to fight our battle, both on the medical and economic fronts. Simply because nobody else will fight it for us. Certainly not the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has bungled in estimating the extent of the Wuhan contagion and led many countries to believe that it was a local problem. US President Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the world body, saying while his nation keeps it alive, it had been guided by Chinese projections of the virus. While transactional politics should certainly not be the order of the day in this test of survival of the human race, the fact is that the WHO did mislead us by changing its own advisories and delaying the classification of the virus as a pandemic. Had we gone by all its advisories, then we could have gone under. Already the spiral, largely the result of focussed testing, shows how deeply the disease has spread in the hinterland and how an early warning system could have helped us shut down international flights at least two weeks earlier. As late as January 30, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he would not recommend travel restrictions to China. Yet on the same day, WHO’s International Health Regulations Emergency Committee raised a global alert on the need for containment, surveillance, detection, isolation and even contact tracing. India’s first advisory on avoiding non-essential travel to China came before but by then hotspots had sprung up in Europe and the US.

The Government, while taking note of the WHO advisories, has totally relied on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and in a collaborative effort is sharing the experience of several State Governments — be it Kerala, Rajasthan, Maharashtra or Uttar Pradesh. The aggressive containment, cluster isolation, aggressive testing and minute observation at hotspots is a story of learning and sharing that has made cooperative federalism the new credo. The all-party consultative meetings are back, too. The Government, alarmed by reports in the US that droplets of infected people could hang in the air for a while, made mask-wearing mandatory while stepping outdoors although the WHO argued against a directive on face covers, saying masks were needed for those who are symptomatic, health workers or caregivers. And while the WHO stuck to the “test, test, test” formula, the ICMR countered that with “isolate, isolate, isolate,” given that we cannot afford to let precious test kits go waste even as we indigenise production. In fact, some States adopted voluntary quarantine even before the national lockdown based on this advice. Simply because the airport screening was not effective in identifying carriers and spreaders. This may not entirely flatten the curve but at least won’t let it bulge and break either, considering we are yet assessing the depth of seepage at the community level. While testing is going on according to parameters, the rapid antibody tests in “areas reporting clusters and in large migration gatherings/evacuee centres” are a faster way of data collection and establishing the right graph. And though the WHO did not recommend a treatment protocol, doctors in Jaipur tried out two anti-virals — lopinavir and ritonavir — in saving patients. Doctors here also worked out a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to slow down the progress of the disease. A vaccine and cure are far away and Indian researchers are part of global trials on the disease. But till then, smart COVID management and a ground-up, felt approach will be our only saviour.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ear-to-the-ground-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/ear-to-the-ground.html
9,10-4-20,E-commerce to rescue,"With deliveries getting going once again, but now supported by physical stores, is the way India shops going to change?

There will be several societal and behavioural changes in the next few years that we will all be able to ascribe to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic. A global phenomenon of wearing masks might take off beyond East Asia where it had normalised after the SARS pandemic. Personal hygiene changes will almost certainly become a norm. Everybody will wash hands more often and carrying a small personal hand-sanitiser will become a must. But what about shopping? With major outlets closed, traditional retail has taken a hit across the world, one, which coupled with the rise of online commerce, might make it difficult for the industry to recover. But some of the changes in online commerce, especially in India in Corona times, are noteworthy. One is the support that some online chains, from Amazon to Zomato, are getting from the public authorities in deliveries, especially to quarantined zones. The other major change is the way the delivery services are working. Small kirana outlets are making local area deliveries of bread, milk and eggs as well as fresh produce like fruits and vegetables. While some parts of major cities have decent access to provisions despite the lockdown, the fact that certain hotspots are being sealed as well as the news that the lockdown might continue for several more days mean that such deliveries are becoming even more vital. In times of restricted customer mobility, a smooth functioning of such platforms can help serve high demands. But for that, it is essential for them to remain automated and mechanised, they need to ensure adequate sanitisation of personnel and products and strive to drive innovation in the last mile. These new models, which marketing experts would describe as “competitive collaboration,” might be the way forward for the growth of e-commerce in India. This is because social and physical distancing might also become a norm across huge swathes of the nation.

Of course, it is too early to predict when the nationwide lockdown will be completely lifted; it may be a month before some areas of the country are opened up. It is also impossible to predict which business models will survive the lockdown. Business as usual, as this paper has noted in the past, is over. That is also going to be the case with e-commerce. But will this collaborative model be the best way out of the lockdown rut for e-commerce companies? One will have to wait and watch.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/e-commerce-to-rescue-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/e-commerce-to-rescue.html
10,10-4-20,Locked down with a predator,"In its bid to flatten the COVID-19 curve, the Govt overlooked the need to formally integrate domestic violence/abuse into the public health preparedness and emergency response plan

In the run-up to the announcement of a nationwide lockdown starting from March 25, there were several areas where the Government failed to craft a strategy to address its possible fallout. One such aspect that was completely ignored was the way to deal with incidents of domestic violence (DV) against women and children in the country during the 21-day shut down. The checks and balances that needed to be in place for victims of DV to resort to in their hour of need were unheeded.

The term “domestic violence” (DV) is used in many countries to refer to intimate partner violence (IPV) but it also encompasses child or elder abuse, or abuse by any member of a household. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one in every three women across the globe experience physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner or sexual violence by any perpetrators in their lifetime: At least 30 per cent of all women who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner.

It has been seen that violence against women tends to increase during every type of emergency, including epidemics. So, not surprisingly it has increased globally during the lockdowns enforced by governments to combat the spread of COVID-19. It is fuelled by social distancing, economic uncertainties and anxieties caused by the Coronavirus pandemic.

For instance, countries like China, the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), Brazil, Tunisia, France, Australia and many others have reported cases of increased DV/IPV. India is also showing symmetrical trends, especially when it is infamous for being the fourth-worst country (after the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) for gender equality (ranked by perception).

According to the Crime in India Report, 2018, published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), every 1.7 minutes a crime was recorded against women in India, every 16 minutes a rape was committed and every 4.4 minutes a child is subjected to domestic violence.

Within a few days of the lockdown, the National Commission for Women (NCW) noted a rise in the number of DV/IPV complaints received via e-mails. The NCW Chairperson believes that the real figure is likely to be more since the bulk of complaints comes from women in the lower strata of society, who send their complaints by post. In March and up to April 5, the NCW received 310 grievances of DV. During this period, a total of 885 complaints were received by the NCW for other forms of violence against women (example: Bigamy/polygamy; denial of maternity benefits to women; dowry deaths; harassment of married women/dowry harassment; outraging the modesty of women/molestation; rape/attempt to rape; right to live with dignity; sexual assault and sexual harassment). Several women’s rights organisations have also been receiving numerous DV complaints since the enforcement of the lockdown.

The number of cases reported might not be proportional to the actual rise in the number of DV/sexual abuse cases. This is because the woman/child locked down with the abuser does not get access to a mobile phone or the space and time, with limited access to financial resources and social networks or even the courage when s/he could call up for help. In other words, all options of escape for the former from their situation of despair are impaired.

Thus, the intensity of the impediments s/he would normally face has been exacerbated by the pandemic and the lockdown.

While the NCW Chairperson has urged women to contact the police or reach out to State Women’s Commissions if they face DV or their children are being abused, it must be noted that there might be chances where the police are delayed in such rescues. This is because they are already handling challenges of enforcing the lockdown, ensuring delivery of essentials to vulnerable sections and in several places assisting health workers in the discharge of their duties. Further, women have felt additionally unsafe in approaching the police because they think that if their husbands are arrested, they could be harassed by in-laws, or once their husbands return, they or their children would be tortured even more.

With partners and children potentially trapped at home during the COVID-19 lockdown, the rate and intensity of abuse could get even worse and extend to child abuse. Repeated acts of physical violence, such as slapping, hitting, kicking and beating; sexual violence, including forced sexual intercourse and other forms of sexual coercion; emotional (psychological) abuse, such as insults, belittling, constant humiliation, intimidation (e.g. destroying things), threats of harm, threats to take away children; controlling behaviour, including isolating a person from family and friends; monitoring their movements; restricting access to financial resources, employment, education or medical care, often result in depression, panic attacks, other anxiety disorders and even suicides.

It often has lasting impacts on the survivors as research suggests that the memory of abuse persists long after the violence has stopped. This often results in chronic health problems and developing risks of many diseases that arise from prolonged stress.

In the critical situation of trying to combat a pandemic, an increased number of women/children are faced with the plague of DV within their households. It must not come as a surprise because DV topped in the category of violence against women/girls in 2018. As per the data, a total of 89,097 cases related to crimes against women/girls were registered across India in 2018. The figures indicate that not much has improved when compared to the figure of 86,001 cases registered under this head in 2017. The crime rate per lakh women/girl population was 58.8 in 2018 in comparison to 57.9 in 2017.

The National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4), 2015-16 highlighted that 30 per cent of women/girls in India in the age group of 15-49 experienced physical violence since the age of 15.

Among married women experiencing physical, sexual or emotional violence, an alarming 83 per cent claimed that their husbands were the main perpetrators of such forms of abuse, followed by abuse from the mothers (56 per cent), fathers (33 per cent) and siblings of the husbands (27 per cent). The major crimes reported by women in India are — cruelty by husband or relatives (32.6 per cent), assault on women with intent to outrage her modesty (25 per cent), kidnapping and abductions (19 per cent) and rape (11.5 per cent).

The above crime statistics are unable to capture the data on violence against women in its entirety. This is primarily due to the prevalence of orthodox social norms and the stigma that is placed on survivors of DV/sexual abuse which leads to such cases being grossly underreported. The report also shows that unemployment and alcoholism of the male partner are highly associated with DV/sexual abuse on women/girls.

In addition to the direct health threat posed by the Coronavirus, the pandemic and restrictions aimed at checking its spread have heightened anxieties, right from apprehensions of catching the disease, to financial worries, to social concerns. There is also a concern that DV/sexual abuse would further increase with job losses and other economic pressures. An added challenge has been the importance of intertwined negative psycho-social impact on mental health of women/girls.

In the attempt to flatten the COVID-19 curve, women’s equality and physical and mental health seem to have suffered a collateral damage. The Government overlooked the need to formally integrate DV/sexual abuse and mental health repercussions into the public health preparedness and emergency response plans against Coronavirus. In fact, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) that seeks to “eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women in the public and private spheres and to undertake reforms to give them the same rights to economic resources and access to property by 2030”, is being enormously compromised.

Members of the community must be made aware about the increased risks to women’s/girls health and life in the lockdown days. They must develop the ethos to condemn violence and shoulder the responsibility of offering all possible assistance to ensure their safety. In its efforts against COVID-19, the Government must allow civil society organisations, counsellors, mental health organisations and providers to come to the rescue of the women/girls facing DV/sexual abuse. Reaching out to women/girls in distress and the need to address the various forms of violence against them need to be classified as an “essential service” by the Government. Finally, the perpetrators of DV/IPV/sexual abuse must be brought to trial and repeat offenders must be dealt with strictly as per the provisions of law.

11,10-4-20,A Catch-22 situation,"While short lockdowns would be valid, long shutdowns would not be good for the people or the economy of the country

Should the lockdown be ended after the three-week period announced on March 24 by the Prime Minister expires on April 14, or should it be continued thereafter? This is the Catch-22 situation which the authorities in India are facing. Some States are already putting pressure on Narendra Modi to extend the lockdown while Odisha has gone ahead and extended its shutdown till April 30. The PM will take a call on extending the shut down in other States on April 11. So let’s look at the alternatives before the Government and their consequences.

The consequences of lifting the lockdown: Ending the lockdown may result in a huge surge in Coronavirus cases and many more deaths. Till now the number of infected people in India is 5,865 and we have seen -169 deaths so far. Globally, the effect of the pandemic has been felt more by the developed nations and the number of cases worldwide has touched 15,36,205 with 89,887 deaths. Nations are fighting over medicines they think can help them stop the march of the Coronavirus as it is universally accepted that as yet there is no vaccine or cure for the disease (though research is going on at a war footing worldwide). Till now the only way we know how to stop the spread of the virus in through social distancing. The 21-day lockdown in India forced people to observe social distancing and this meant that a Corona-positive person could not infect others. This enforced social distancing will end when the shutdown is lifted as people will start meeting each other in schools, factories, offices, business houses, media houses, courts, malls, restaurants, cinema halls, religious places, trains, buses and so on, thereby spreading the disease.

If there is anything that we know about the Coronavirus with certainty is the fact that it is highly infectious and spreads rapidly when social distancing is not maintained. A single person may infect half a dozen others and each one of these may infect half a dozen more and so on, till thousands of people are sick. This is like a chain reaction in an atomic bomb. So, if the Government lifts the lockdown, it will be endangering millions of people who will start going about their business as usual, because even if one or two in the crowd is a COVID-19 vector, they will set off the chain-reaction of infection, till it spreads to lakhs of people.

The biggest problem that India is facing is that there is little medical testing in the country for the Coronavirus as we simply do not have enough testing kits/equipment and so on, to meet the requirement of 1.3 billion people. Hence, it is difficult for us to plug the gaps and it is easy for persons infected with the Coronavirus to fall through the cracks as the disease is asymptomatic for the first 15 days. It is because of the fear of an explosion in Coronavirus cases that States are reluctant to lift the lockdown. While Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao is in favour of extending the shut down in his State, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh (UP), Assam, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have indicated that they would not fully lift the restrictions after April 14. In fact, in UP 15 districts have been sealed as they have emerged as COVID-19 hotspots.

The consequences of not lifting the lockdown: To continue with the shutdown may result in poor people dying of hunger in large numbers as they are deprived of food, work and money, like the immigrant workers in cities who had to trek hundreds of kilometres on foot to their villages. A whopping 80-90 per cent of Indian workers are in the unorganised sector of the economy and these are daily wage earners, having no security of tenure. The shutdown has hit these workers and their families the hardest. Reports are coming in from rural areas that farmers cannot sell their produce as there is no transport available to take it to the wholesale markets, besides the fact that no one is coming to them. Hence their produce is often perishing unsold. Also, this is harvest time but the labourers who used to work fields are not available, as they mostly used to come from towns or nearby districts, but are unable to do so because of the lockdown. Hence, farmers will suffer major harvest losses. The police force seems to have become baton-happy these days and there are reports of cops beating people found outside their homes, no matter what their reason for doing so. Consequently, people are afraid to step out of their houses. Many village shops have run out of stock as shopowners cannot replenish their goods. So people cannot buy essentials like medicines and groceries. Business houses are suffering as the economy, which was already in a bad shape prior to the lockdown, is crumbling even further. International exports have taken a steep dive. Huge infrastructure projects are at a standstill due to the lockdown. Many industries and sectors have closed down putting lakhs of workers out of jobs.

Government must strike a balance: Article 19(1)(b) of the Constitution grants citizens the right to assemble peacefully, Article 19(1)(d) grants them the right to move freely throughout India and Article 19(1(g) grants them the right to practice any profession, trade or vocation. No doubt these rights are subject to reasonable restrictions, but it is well settled that for a restriction to be valid, it must not be excessive. While short lockdowns would be valid, long shutdowns would not be good for the people or the economy. Man is a social being. Human beings cannot survive for long in isolation since we are dependent on others for our existence. Hence social distancing may be possible for short periods but not for long ones. India is thus caught in a catch-22 situation, with hard choices to make.

12,10-4-20,Big Brother is watching behind COVID mask,"We all agree that the Coronavirus crisis must be stopped by all means necessary but we should be very careful that our AI-based remedies don’t seed the next disease — a mass surveillance State

No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law,” says Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The ability of our governments to respond to the pandemic must be extolled. Some heads of States, shedding their differences, appealed to humanity to fight unitedly against the Coronavirus.

As of now, all options are open, right from the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to biotechnology to win the battle against the Coronavirus. As the world is literally in a lockdown, Governments, right from China to the US, are allowing private AI and data analytics firms to sweep through personal data on phones for locations and so on. Facial recognition technology is also deployed to search for people with Coronavirus. It is reported that companies like Tencent and Alibaba are working with the Chinese Government to deploy these technologies and Beijing is using apps to collect travel history, time spent in infected places and details of an individual’s interactions. So, in short, they know every personal detail of an individual they want to track, with the help of AI and apps.

In India, too, various Corona apps are being made popular as a screening and tracking tool.

In China, once the information is collected, algorithms assign people health codes. These yellow, red and green codes notify whether one is to be quarantined or not, whether one can use the public transport or not. Most of this data collection is not by choice of the citizen. AI reports back to the Government if the individual has given inconsistent answers or simply lied. Coercive actions follow that. The Government has superseded all privacy conventions and is freely allowing private companies to look into phones, computers, public cameras to achieve the results. The Chinese State has an extensive and often-called “Black Mirror-esque and dark” social credit system, which allows for monitoring of each action and behaviour. If the behaviour is aligned with the State, you are rewarded, otherwise you can’t even board a train.

Looking Westward, in England Sky News reports, “The Government is working with mobile network O2 to analyse anonymous smartphone location data to see whether people are following its social distancing guidelines.” Israel is using mobile surveillance to send users customised messages about whether they are infected or not. Social media firms like Facebook, Google and so on, are doing their bit, too, by giving Governments our data. So no matter where you are, the Coronavirus crisis has given “Big Brother” an excuse to watch you all the time. And remember it is for “public health and your own good.” And of course we have nothing to hide.

The stakes are getting higher as the US-China trade wars have entered a new horizon of AI-based technology. Both nations are cognisant of the enormous power of AI-based surveillance and medical technology. No friend of the Silicon Valley, US President Donald Trump now has taken assistance from a company called BlueDot to create a mass surveillance system to monitor people for COVID-19. The US Government last year had already tried to outlaw encryption and forced Facebook to give it access to WhatsApp messages. It is only a matter of time before other Silicon Valley giants like Microsoft and so on begin their dalliance with the White House to birth the most sophisticated reconnaissance systems engineered to feed the Government your per-minute heart rate. Emergency legislations are introduced across the world to expedient data collection and give the Government “war-like situation” powers. In a statement, Kamran Khan of Bluedot told the media, “We know that governments may not be relied upon to provide information in a timely fashion. This reflects the larger disbelief in governments and democratic institutions at large by this class of technocrats.”

I don’t doubt the noble intentions of our Governments and private companies in their efforts to control COVID-19 but the AI-based systems they are creating do force us to beg the question, what happens to mass surveillance-based systems after COVID-19 goes away? Will the mass surveillance, too, go away or evolve further? Can citizens of the world be certain it won’t be misused?

Coupled with 5G technology, this system will be extremely powerful and its master will be the overlord of our planet. One can only think of Abraham Lincoln’s warning that, “Nearly all men can stand adversity but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power.” What will happen to our leaders when they can pry into our lives on the touch of a button. This system will open up a Pandora’s box of control. People of the world must be very careful, for under the garb of remedies of COVID-19, lurks a far sinister danger. AI-based mass surveillance slithers into our lives with our approval. As fear reigns, neighbour has already turned against neighbour. People of Asian descent are becoming Hitler’s Jews. As news of racial hatred is rising, we are globally descending into chaos. We have to ensure the virus doesn’t aid another holocaust of hate and fear empowered by technology. From the gas chambers to the nuclear bomb, they were all cutting-edge science of their time and yet they served Satanic ends. Champions of technology and science like Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking along with other scientists, have already cautioned the world against AI. In fact Musk goes on to say that, “AI is more dangerous than nuclear weapons.” We need to curb indiscriminate use of AI-based technology, especially applications that loot our privacy and rights. Democracy, privacy and humanity are threatened by private technocratic tools like AI-based surveillance. The crisis is not an excuse to free them from regulation, we need to have a “pre-nuptial” agreement with these firms and technology.

We all agree that the Corona crisis must be stopped by all means necessary but we should be very careful that our remedies don’t seed the next disease — a mass surveillance State.

16,10-4-20,7 Covid hospitals set up,"While the Union Government and the State Governments are mulling all sorts of efforts to contain spread of deadly virus COVID-19, Odisha leads the show.

Two Tata Hospitals at Duburi in Jajpur district and at Joda in Keonjhar district are also ready for COVID-19 treatment. Hi-tech Hospital is also all prepared to treat patients at Rourkela in Sundergarh district, while ID Hospital in Puri is also ready for treatment of COVID-19 patients, an official said.

And the Odisha Government on Tuesday said it has separated novel corona virus patients from other sick persons in the State-run medical facilities. The State Government made it clear as people fear that they may get corona virus infection if they visit the hospitals.

The Government also said that doctors, nurses and other para-medical staff engaged to treat COVID-19 patients will not handle other patients.

""I assure people that there is no COVID-19 patient in any of the State-run medical colleges including SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack and other district headquarters hospitals. Therefore, people can freely visit Government and private hospitals without fear,"" said Principal Secretary Health and Family Welfare, Nikunja Bihari Dhal.

Dhal said there is no COVID patient in SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack or in any other medical college in the State. Though there is one COVID-19 negative person admitted at the Capital Hospital here, he will be discharged soon.

People should now feel safe in general hospitals, both Government and private, the Health Secretary said, adding the private hospitals have been instructed not to admit any COVID-19 patients and to refer all with flu symptoms to the special hospitals, said the Principal Secretary.

Indicating that the number of COVID-19 patients have swelled in rich countries because they did not segregate novel corona virus patients from others, Dhal said the Odisha Government was extremely careful in this regard.

He said the State has, meanwhile, developed seven special COVID-19 hospitals where confirmed and suspected patients are being treated. Therefore, people should not be afraid that they will get corona infection if they visit hospitals.

20,10-4-20,Satkosia Tiger Reserve ponds to be disinfected,"In view of an advisory by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change following reports of a tiger infected with COVID-19 in the United States, the State Forest Department is planning to disinfect ponds near human habitats in the Satkosia Tiger Reserve in Angul district as a precautionary measure against transmission of the virus from humans to animals.

Notably, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) has put all the tiger reserves in the country on high alert.

Angul RCCF Pradeep Raj Karat said the NTCA has issued an SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) for safety of wild animals in forests. As human is the only medium for spreading the virus in animals, restrictions will be imposed on free movement of people in the wildlife sanctuary. “As a preventive measure, we have directed to disinfect ponds used by both humans and animals located near villages in the premises of Satkosia Tiger Reserve.” The authorities have restricted villagers from accessing the ponds directly and to use water after collecting it from ponds.

Another sanctuary official said that there is a move to disinfect the ponds with potassium permanganate. The sanctuary houses only two Royal Bengal tigers. While one has been kept in an enclosure, the other has been released into the wild.

Adhering to the NTCA guidelines, officials have been asked to sanitise their hands and maintain social distancing while handling the tigers and other animals. All the animals in the forest would be monitored through CCTV.

Meanwhile, as per an advisory issued by the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), the Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) authorities have begun a disinfection process at a zoo in the premises of Indira Gandhi (IG) Park in the steel city.

A team headed by senior veterinary officer Dr Avijit Biswas has been assigned to disinfect the entire zoo managed by the RSP.

21,10-4-20,S'pur youths feed distressed at railway station,"Youths and residents of Fatak area of Gopalmal, Budharaja, have come forward to serve the people in distress, particularly in terms of providing food to the hungry ones.

Since the place is almost on the Sambalpur road railway station many strangers are seen here every day.

Due to closure of rail and road services, many labourers could not return their homes and have stayed put there. Mainly public places are their place of living. Temporary shades in totally shabby conditions are homes for daily labourers of outside. And now there is none to feed these people or look after here.

Most pathetic is that they don’t have any address in any part of the country. A shed (home) over their head is also a dream. And this came to the notice of the youths of the Maa Mahamaya Shop Owners’ Association, Fatak, who are both shopkeepers and residents of the Fatak area and they started a ‘charity canteen’ for these needy people.

“At the same time, we have also added the daily labourers from other parts of the States and Murshidabad district of West Bengal in particular who are passing through utter hard days for lack of food. This is time to help people in distress, we shouldn’t always depend on the overnment,” said Bikash Panda, the owner of the Tulsi Stores, Fatak and one of the key persons of this youth group.

“Labourers from Murshidabad (WB) are mainly from other religion. But we have no such negative consideration in our mind at this juncture,” added the members. “We are providing both lunch and dinner to them,” they said.

“In order to maintain social distance and follow the instructions of the Government, we are not allowing these people to sit and eat. We are packing food and distributing them to 300 people everyday of whom we have prepared a list. They are coming in very disciplined manner and taking cooked food pockets. Really, it is great pleasure for us to feed the hungry people,” said another youth Jayalal Meher, the owner of the Meher Bastralaya in Fatak.

27,10-4-20,Support to industry could come through banking system: CII,"Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) based on its assessment of the economy and the on-ground situation has submitted its recommendations on an organised re-start post the lock down to the Government.

Detailing the suggestions Chandrajit Banerjee, director general CII, said, “The Government should extend additional support to the people at the bottom of the pyramid thorough cash transfers. Support to industry could come through the banking system.”

Explaining the rationale, he added “Our estimates are that the economy would need a credit expansion of 14-15 per cent. Additionally, support through banks would allow the government a leverage of 5-6 times, mitigating the fiscal impact”.

The support should include working capital enhancement and support for payment of wages to all industry and special re-construction terms loans for MSMEs and the stressed sectors

CII recommendations also include measures on issues related to health, safety, logistics, migrant workers and coordination between centre and states.

Additional support to the lowest strata and the informal sector through cash transfers, amounting to INR 2 lakh crore account holders.

Support to enterprises through banks enhanced credit limits for working capital across the board to all industries.

Additional working capital equivalent to April - June wage bill of the borrowers, backed by a Government guarantee, at 4-5 per cent, with a refinance guarantee from RBI.

The stress in the real sector has the possibility of spreading to the financial sector. Government of India should set apart a fund of INR 30,000 crs that could be used by banks that meet certain criteria and under specified conditions to access this fund by way of issuing Tier I bonds, which will be convertible into equity at the option of the fund.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/support-to-industry-could-come-through-banking-system--cii.html
28,10-4-20,Fighting coronavirus: Mobile phone booth swab collection units come up,"East Singhbhum district administration is taking innovative measures to ensure safety and betterment of people. It is leaving no stone unturned in its fight against Covid-19 cases. The administration has come up with three dimensional sprays of disinfectants and mobile phone booth swab collection units

District civil surgeon Dr Maheshwar Prasad today informed that six vehicle mounted phone booth Covid-19 swab collection units have been purchased by the district and would be taken by two member teams including a doctor and a lab-technician for collecting samples in hot spots.

“These booths will help us to further intensify our screening process for suspected cases of coronavirus. It is protected by PPE kit. Fitted with microphone and a U-shaped table, the health staffer will direct the suspected patient to open his/her month and bring the nose closure and he will (gloved hands) collect the swabs from mouth and nose. Then the patient will be asked to seal it and the staff will collect the sample and drop it in the virus transport media (VTM) kit for transporting to the Covid-19 testing centres,” said an official.

The unit looks like a public telephone booth and will reduce manpower needed for collecting samples for coronavirus tests.

The phone booth Covid-19 sample collection centre is a unique, low-cost and portable unit. It ensures safety of health workers while collecting sample from a suspected patient,"" the official said.

Meanwhile, Jamshedpur Notified Area Committee (JNAC), the local civic body for Jamshedpur city, today started a three-dimensional spray of disinfectants (a mixture of water and sodium hypochlorite) mounted on a tractor.

“ As per directive of the deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla for regular sanitization of the market place and even residential areas we have brought hitech changes in the spraying machine. Now this can spray disinfectants in three direction, front and also on both sides. It is aimed at sanitizing maximum area in the shortest time. We will further expand it in commercial areas and urban slums,” said JNAC official.

Incidentally, JNAC is already using two shoulder mounted spray of disinfectants and other disinfectants sprayed using fire brigade machines of Jamshedpur fire station at Golmuri. Even Jusco is conducting spraying of disinfectant using fire brigade vehicles of Tata Steel to sanitise areas.

Significantly, earlier this week, the district administration had started a full-body disinfection chamber donated by the state health department for healthcare workers dedicated for the isolation wards for novel coronavirus suspected cases. The portable disinfection chamber has a mist sprayer through which sanitizers would be sprayed on throughout the body disinfecting it in nearly five minutes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/fighting-coronavirus--mobile-phone-booth-swab-collection-units-come-up.html
29,10-4-20,Each individual vulnerable to coronavirus infection: Dash,"In a tete-a-tete with The Pioneer, UNICEF Chief Field Officer of Jharkhand Prasanta Dash talks about the organization's involvement across the State during the pandemic and also the precautions that need to be taken once the lockdown is over.

What role does UNICEF Jharkhand play with the State government in the fight against Corona?

UNICEF is supporting the state government in assessing its preparedness for the treatment of Coronavirus cases. It is supporting the state in the roll out of training program for frontline workers which focus on identifying correct cases and contacts, how to protect themselves and the community and mitigating stigma. We are working to bring together all NGOs and CSOs in the state and providing them with the correct set of guidelines and information so that they can support the government in creating awareness and mobilization.

UNICEF is also supporting the COVID-19 response by working towards public awareness including digital platforms, messages on preventing infections, countering misinformation and social stigma.

Do you think the State is prepared to deal with positive cases of COVID-19?

The state has prepared itself in time to deal with potential cases. Efforts are being made to ensure availability of ration, medicines and other essential supplies. Setting up of round-the-clock control room is a good initiative. Isolation plans are good at gram panchayat level and implementation should be followed up. With a lockdown already in place, it is my hope that we will see this challenge through.

How vulnerable are our labourers, children, health workers and villagers who know little about the gravity of the situation?

Accurate information vetted by the MoHFW and agencies such as WHO and UNICEF is being widely circulated in the public domain through the print and electronic media, the internet and other modes of communication from large cities to smaller towns and villages.

We are all vulnerable to Coronavirus, which is why every single one of us must play a part in preventing the spread of the infection.

Apart from social distancing, any other preventive measures that people need to keep in mind?

Washing your hands frequently including every time you enter your house or office, after shaking hands with other people, after you cough or sneeze and also before you eat – using soap and running water for 20-30 seconds or using an alcohol-based hand rub. Cover your mouth and nose with flexed elbow, tissue or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and dispose of used tissue immediately.

One must avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and substitute handshakes with other greetings such as Namaste. Close contact with anyone with cold or flu like symptoms must be avoided.

One must also seek medical care early if you or your child has a fever, cough or difficulty in breathing.

What precautions need to be taken once the lockdown is over?

Lifting of lockdown does not mean that India is free of COVID-19. If all cases are not detected and isolated during lockdown, these cases can again start the transmission. All citizens should therefore report themselves to the health authorities if they have symptoms so that they can protect their families and communities. I would also like to point out that improved personal hygiene habits are useful not only in the case of this pandemic but they also have life-long benefits to the health of individuals. Continuing with them regardless of a lockdown will contribute towards a healthier society.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/each-individual-vulnerable-to-coronavirus-infection--dash.html
30,10-4-20,Vegetables prices all time low in Sambalpur,"The prices of all varieties of vegetables are falling sharply in Sambalpur in comparison to other parts of the State. Most importantly, the price of potato is Rs 20 only in Sambalpur whereas it is Rs 25 to Rs 28 in other parts.

A few days back at the beginning of the lockdown, the price of potato had reached Rs 40. Collector Subham Saxena, after getting a complaint, had assured of prompt action and even went to the extent of initiating legal action against the hoarders and black marketers. And that worked.

The result was that suddenly price came down to Rs 20 and it remained so since then.

Potato and onion apart, the prices of other vegetables, green vegetables in particular, are also the lowest. The reason is there is no buyer for the produce in the markets in Sambalpur and Bargarh districts due to the lockdown and fear of public to go to market freely. Hence, the farmers prefer to sell their produce to the middlemen at throw away price.

This has led to a sudden dipping in the prices of the vegetables in the ongoing summer with brinjal selling just at Rs 15, ladies finger at Rs 20-30, bitter gourd at Rs 30 and rest others at equally lower prices.

“We have no market now. It is also equally difficult to come from our villages to Sambalpur,” said roadside vendor Ratani Mirdha from Kadalimunda of Jujomura block.

Mrutyunjay Panigrahi, a leading farmer of Padiabahal, lamented that it was the farmers who had faced the jerks due to the sudden fall in prices of vegetables.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/vegetables-prices-all-time-low-in-sambalpur.html

Haryana has so far reported 156 coronavirus cases with two deaths.

Home Minister Anil Vij said everyone was together in this war against virus.“Our war heroes or corona warriors are fighting this battle with full might. We will win this battle,” he said.

It is the result of our strict vigil and management that we have cases under control despite a large number of people returning from abroad in recent times. Had there not been a spike in cases due to Tablighi Jamaat members, we would have controlled it effectively,” he said.

Health Secretary Rajeev Arora said over the next few days reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing will be carried out and in non-affected districts 125 such samples per district will be taken, while in worst affected districts like Faridabad, Gurugram, Palwal and Nuh, 450 samples will be collected. By April 14, Haryana intends to collect nearly Rs 6,500 samples, he said. Besides, rapid diagnostic kits will be used in hotspots where more than 15 cases have been reported.

Arora informed that containment zones have been declared at various places across the state, including 36 villages in Nuh, 9 in Palwal, three villages and colonies of Sonipat, 13 in Faridabad, one in Charkhi Dadri and three in Panchkula.

32,10-4-20,Punjab mulls ordinance for regulating pvt healthcare,"As the COVID-19 cases began to pile up in the State, Punjab Government is mulling the issuance of an ordinance for regulating the functioning of the private healthcare sector in the State. With this, no health facility, either in the private or public sector, will be in a position to refuse emergency medical treatment to patients unable to pay huge amounts.

Hanging fire since past over 10 years, the state Council of Ministers is expected to decide on the Clinical Establishment Bill during its meeting, scheduled for Friday, which is listed in the agenda.

Besides, the Cabinet would also review the arrangements for harvesting and procurement of wheat crop, reviewing arrangements for containment and management of COVID-19 pandemic, other than reviewing the financial position of the state and proposed action.

It has been learnt that the state government has already prepared a draft of the Clinical Establishment Bill the previous year, but the same could not be laid before the Cabinet or the Assembly amidst string opposition by a section of private doctors.

The move came amidst reports that several private healthcare establishments are backing out from providing treatment to the coronavirus infected patients. Notably, about 70 per cent of the state’s population depends on the private healthcare system.

Taking serious note of the development, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh had warned the private hospitals declaring that “deserters won’t be spared”, while terming it a “cowardly act”. The Chief Minister, along with his Cabinet, had suggested that the Health Department should cancel the licences of hospitals refusing to treat COVID-19 patients.

As per the draft of the Act, which was made available at the Health Department’s website, aimed at regulating all health establishments — government or private — to ensure minimum standards. It made it clear that no health facility — government or private — could refute emergency life-saving medical treatment and critical care to anyone over inability to pay.

As per the Act, every health centres will have to provide treatment to victims of calamities, road accidents, acid attack and rape survivors irrespective of their ability to pay for treatment at that point of time. “In case of death, the health facilities will have to ensure that there is no delay in releasing the dead body of patients to their family members due to billing or other issues,” stated the Act while giving the health establishments a right to recover the treatment cost in due course of time.

The Clinical Establishment Bill was enacted by the Centre for regulation of all clinical establishments in the country with a view to prescribe the minimum standards of facilities and services provided by them, besides regulating the private hospitals.

The Centre had then asked all the states to adopt the Centre's Clinical Establishment Act, especially after the cases of alleged medical negligence and overcharging by some private hospitals were reported.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/punjab-mulls-ordinance-for-regulating-pvt-healthcare.html
33,10-4-20,Govt mulls to cut lawmakers’ salary,"After several States announced to cut 30 per cent salarý of public representatives, including MLAs and MLCs, the Jharkhand Government too is contemplating salary cut of its MLAs in its fight against COVID 19.

The Maharashtra Cabinet headed by Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday announced to cut 30 per cent salaries of its MLAs/ MLCs including ministers and Chief Minister.

Sources said that Hemant Soren government too is planning to make salary cut of its MLAs, however the final decision in this connection is to be taken by State Cabinet. Many MLA have come forward and asked the government to make salary cut. AJSU Party MLA from Gomia Lambodar Mahto has come forward and asked the Soren Government to make salary cut of MLAs in difficult times. He said, “The Soren Govrrnment should come forward and make salary cut of MLAs in such difficult times.""

In 81-member Jharkhand Assembly the AJSU Party has only two MLAs. The ruling party JMM has 29 MLAs, while Congress has 18 MLAs. RJD which is also part of government has one MLA. The opposition BJP has 26 MLAs.

The BJP too has no problem in salary cut of MLAs. BJP Hatia MLA Navin Jaiswal said, ""The Government should announce salary cut of MLAs. The BJP is ready for salary cut in these difficult times.""

Sources said that though opposition party is ready for salary cut the ball is in the court of JMM/ Congress as many lawmakers are first timer or those who have won the election after gap and in this situation government plans to make salary cut will not be an easy task. A first timer Congress MLA said , ""We don’t have problem if government goes for salary cut of lawmakers but before this government should look for other alternative to raise fund for fighting COVID 19.""

Many MLAs in State have already announced to give large share from their MLA fund in its fight against coronavirus. Chief Minister Hemant Soren had already announced to give 25 lakh from his MLA fund. However a lot of steps are yet to be taken by Jharkhand government.

Many states including Maharashtra apart from salary cut of lawmakws has also announced to cut the salaries of government employees. As per Maharashtra government decision the salaries of class I and ll will be cut by 50 per cent while that of class lll employees will be cut by 25 percent.

However, Maharashtra has maximum number of coronavirus patients. Apart from Maharashtra Gujarat too has announced to cut salary of MLAs by 30 per cent.

Moreover last week the union cabinet promulgated an ordinance to reduce the salaries allowances and pensions of members of parliament by 39 per cent for one year. Also the cabinet has approved the temporary suspension of the MPLAD (Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme fund during 2020-21 and 2021-22).

36,10-4-20,Animal safety measures in place at Punjab’s Chhatbir Zoo,"Mahendra Chaudhary Zoological Park or Chhatbir Zoo in Punjab has put in place a series of measures for animal safety including minimizing interface between animals and humans after a tiger in a US zoo tested positive for coronavirus, officials said on Thursday.

All animals in the State''s largest zoo, which is spread over 505 acres, are healthy and are being monitored regularly, zoo officials said.

""All animals are safe, no symptoms have been found in anyone.

""Taking precaution after the American zoo incident, we have put in place series of measures to keep the animals safe,"" the Zoo''s field director, M Sudhagar told PTI.

The zoo is currently closed to public in view of the nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

He said the zoo, which has 1400 animals and birds, has also restricted the number of employees to less than one-third these days and they too are only those who are either living in the zoo colony or within the 2-km periphery.

""This is to ensure we can keep a close tab on them and who all they come into contact with. In the zoo, we have put in place two-layer sanitization. Severe screening is carried out. All vehicles are sanitized before entry.""Then we sort out the workers who directly handle the animals, they are given extra protective clothing, masks, gloves and gum boots,"" he said.Sudhagar said a dedicated person has been deputed for each animal.

""For example a single person will be working with tiger, he will not be changed in rotation.

Even while going inside the shelter, he will not touch the animal and maintain distance. In case if under any circumstances animal handling is required, it will be under supervision of an expert who will go inside with personal protection equipment,"" he said.

On rotational basis, a supervisor and a security officer has been deputed. Besides, a Quick Response Team has also been deputed.

""We are closely monitoring the animals. In case if any symptoms are found in the animals, we have the facility to quarantine and treat them. Samples will be sent for testing to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute and another lab at Hisar,"" he said.

Sudhagar informed that the zoo has six adults and three cubs of Royal Bengal tiger. The cubs are three months old, he said.

""Apart from this, we have seven lions, five leopards, one jaguar, two jungle cats, apart from other canine and omnivorous species.

""Our advantage is that the zoo''s housing design is highly protective, which helps to minimize human-animal interaction,"" he said.He said entry of animal, release of animal, separation of animals and others can be regulated from outside the animal houses.

""Whenever we require to clean the area, we can easily clean from outside and then go inside and clean after taking all protective measures,"" the zoo official said.

Asked if any change in animal behaviour has been noticed as there is no public entry these days and zoo staff too has been pruned, he said, ""Definitely, the animals are slightly less stressed, they are having full freedom. But still it is too early to arrive at any conclusion and may be around next month we will know their exact behaviour pattern"".

To boost immunity of animals, they are being given vitamin supplements and herbal tonics.

Extra precaution is being taken while handling and washing meat. Separate trays and separate vehicles are kept for carnivores.

He informed that an adult tiger consumes around 8 kg, lion around 6-7 kg, while leopard around 4 kg of meat a day.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/animal-safety-measures-in-place-at-punjab---s-chhatbir-zoo.html
37,10-4-20,Pvt dialysis centres downing shutters amid COVID-19 fear,"Many private dialysis centres in Ranchi have downed their shutters after the district administration sealed a dialysis centre where one of the COVID-19 patients underwent the medical process before testing positive. The development has caused panic among the kidney patients who undergo dialysis regularly, and cannot survive without it.

The patients, sources said, are in a catch-22 situation. On one hand, the private dialysis centres are closing, and on the other hand, the fear of contracting Coronavirus during dialysis is sending chills up their spine. ""These are difficult times especially for us. If all the dialysis centres close, then where will we go for dialysis? The Government should do something for us,"" said Neeraj Kumar, a Ranchi resident who has been undergoing the process dialysis for more than a year now.

Most of the private dialysis centres have closed due to fear, said the owner of a dialysis centre in Ranchi. The administration, he said, quarantined the doctor who monitored the dialysis of a COVID-19 patient. His 25 odd employees were also quarantined, he added.

""There are two major fears for us. One is of contracting the virus and the second is of unknowingly performing dialysis of an infected person. In the second scenario, we will also be quarantined and our centres sealed,"" he said requesting anonymity.

However, the Government has clarified that dialysis centres and chemotherapy centres have to remain open during the lockdown. ""We have not issued any directive of closing the dialysis centres. These are essential for patients and they should continue running,"" said Health Secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni.

Besides the private clinics, dialysis is also done in many private hospitals and Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS). However, there are only four dialysis machines in RIMS and too many patients across Ranchi, doctors said.

In the wake of the crisis, the Jharkhand chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA) has requested Chief Minister Hemant Soren to increase manpower in Government hospitals in order to conduct dialysis of patients. ""We need to have technicians working in shifts, and for this we need to appoint more people,"" said IMA President Dr. Pradeep

Kumar. Patients in need of dialysis are also facing problems due to the slow process of testing for Coronavirus, Kumar said. ""A patient who needs dialysis cannot be asked to wait for his Coronavirus test reports. Rapid tests should be conducted for such patients,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/pvt-dialysis-centres-downing-shutters-amid-covid-19-fear.html

He informed that 595 entities of diversified sectors are registered as Startup with Startup Odisha. They include e-commerce, agri business, art and culture, ITES, jewellery, IT products and healthcare.

While it takes around seven to10 years for a startup eco-system to evolve and show its true potential, in Odisha, it is in a nascent stage, needing proper care and grooming.

In view of COVID impact, the startups need one time help to take care of their expenses.

Any company registered between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020 should get Rs 15,000 for six months starting May 1, 2020.

Any company registered before April 1, 2019 and in ideation stage to get Rs 25,000 for six months starting May 1, 2020.

Any company registered before April 1, 2019 and in growth stage with at least 15 client and/or revenue of Rs 1 lakh per month should get Rs 50,000 for six months.

The CEO also proposed to provide soft loans to the above four categories of startups. The Government can be the guarantor for the soft loans or disburse collateral free soft loans to interested startups. The four categories of startups should get approval to get soft loans up to Rs 5,00,000, Rs 7,50,000 (both payable in two-three years ), Rs 10,00,000 and Rs 15,00,000 (both payable in three-four years), respectively.

Besides, he demanded that the Government expedite the process of approval for any pending application for financial assistance for any startup and also release of any payments towards subsidy or payment pending by any Government department.

Startups should be given priority to get Government projects apart from the existing incentives.

Thank you India and the Indian people for the decision on HCQ. Will not be forgotten! Thank you Prime Minister @NarendraModi for your strong leadership in helping not just India, but humanity, in this fight!"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday. He later described PM Modi as ""terrific"" for allowing the export of the key drug.

Trump had earlier said the US too would retaliate if India continues with its export ban.

Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro also thanked India and Modi for allowing the export of the life-saving drug being used to treat Covid-19 patients.

In his address to his nation on Wednesday, Bolsonaro thanked Modi and the people of India for the ""timely help to the people of Brazil."" He said: ""We have more good news. As an outcome of my direct conversation with Prime Minister of India, we will receive, by Saturday, raw materials to continue production of hydroxychloroquine so we can treat patients of COVID-19 as well as of lupus, malaria, and arthritis. I thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the people of India for such timely help to the people of Brazil.""

109,10-4-20,Centre asks States to look into farmers’ grievances,"Admitting that farmers are facing shortage of labourers at the time of harvesting of rabi crops, the Centre has asked the State Governments to issue necessary instructions to facilitate selling of produce by farmers at their doorsteps and also to ensure smooth inter-State and intra-State movement of machines used for harvesting and sowing, such as combine harvesters. The directive is meant to achieve two objectives - to decongest mandis in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, and to allow farmers to sell their products at remunerative prices by allowing aggregators to source it directly from them.

The ministry has also issued an order increasing procurement from 25 quintals per day per farmer to 40 quintals per day per farmers

Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar, who held a video conference with State agriculture ministers and other State officials, also informed them that the kharif national conference will be held on April 16 through video conferencing. During the discussion, various issues relating to harvest procurement, availability of inputs, credit, insurance and inter-State movement of agriculture produce came up. While some of these issues were solved immediately, other issues requiring deliberations were noted with the assurance to the States that they would be looked into and necessary action would be taken in due course.

At the meeting, states have stated theat acute scarcity of labour has posed a serious challenge to crop procurement and is threatening to leave a lasting impact on agriculture as it will delay the harvest of winter-sown crops, particularly wheat, and is delaying the planting of the next crop. Apart from procurement, planting of cotton and summer ‘moong’ pulses is a challenge for farmers in Madhya Pradesh, UP,

Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan because of concerns of labour shortage as well as availability of fertilisers and seeds.

Sources said that the Centre also the States to issue authorisation letters to companies and organisations having a nationwide supply chain of essential goods, allowing them to issue regional passes for easy movement of critical staff and workers to maintain their supply chain.

The video conference assumes importance as quick and effective policy responses are required to be taken as farmers prepare for the kharif (summer) season during the time of lockdown. Kharif sowing begins with the onset of the June-September south-west monsoon.

In a statement, the agriculture ministry said that Kharif National Conference will be held on April 16, 2020, through video conferencing.

A decision in this regard was taken after reviewing the relief measures taken for farmers with state agriculture ministers and senior officials through a video conference on Wednesday.

Normally, about 106 million hectares are planted during the kharif crop season. While the onset of monsoon kick-starts sowing in June, which continues through mid-July, harvesting of crops begins by October.

Besides holding the kharif conference, Tomar in the meeting asked State Governments to sensitise field agencies about exemptions given to the farm-related activities and allow movement of farm produce, farming products, fertilisers and farm implements and machinery.

In the meeting, the crucial issues related to farming operations and harvesting, agriculture marketing and mandi operations, procurement at minimum support price (MSP), provision of inputs (seeds and fertilisers), and issues related to logistics and movement of agriculture and horticulture produce were discussed.

Tomar also appreciated the proactive steps taken by the State Governments to ensure agriculture activities even during the challenging time of the COVID-19 pandemic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-asks-states-to-look-into-farmers----grievances.html

112,10-4-20,Govt allows makers of industrial oxygen to manufacture oxygen for medical use,"The Government has allowed makers of industrial oxygen to manufacture oxygen for medical use to help combat the scourge of Covid-19.

Subsequently, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) has directed state licensing authorities (SLAs) to urgently grant permission to manufacturers of industrial oxygen to manufacture oxygen provided they meet certain parameters.

Supplemental oxygen therapy is a part of the clinical management of COVID-19. It is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment. This also includes supplementing oxygen for low blood oxygen, carbon monoxide toxicity, cluster headaches and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), although the majority of people with COVID-19 have uncomplicated or mild illness (81%), some will develop severe illness requiring oxygen therapy (14%) and approximately 5% will require intensive care unit treatment. Of those critically ill, most will require mechanical ventilation. The most common diagnosis in severe COVID-19 patients is svere pneumonia.

The move to give nod for oxygen manufacture for therapeutic purpose followed after the All India Industrial Gases Manufacturers’ Association (AIIGMA) proposed such a request.

As per the DCGI directive issued recently, “it has been decided in public interest that the premises which are having facility to manufacture industrial oxygen should be granted manufacturing license to manufacture oxygen for medical use within 24 hours of the submission of application and fees as per the Drugs and Cosmetics (D&C) Act.

“An undertaking needs to be furnished in writing to manufacture medical oxygen in compliance with standards prescribed in Indian Pharmacopoeia and labeling requirement as per the D&C Act and Rules.

“SLAs are requested to take action in public interest to grant permission to manufacturers of industrial oxygen to manufacture oxygen for medical use in light of COVID 19,” DCGI stated.

According to health experts, oxygen therapy is likely to be the single most effective supportive measure in COVID-19 patients in critical stage. Children with emergency signs (obstructed or absent breathing, severe respiratory distress, central cyanosis, shock, coma or convulsions) should receive oxygen therapy during resuscitation.

The expert said that during the ongoing COVID19 pandemic, ventilator support will be required for about 5-8 per cent of patients with symptoms whereas a large number would require Oxygen support. The existing facilities are not adequate to cater for such large requirements.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt-allows-makers-of-industrial-oxygen-to-manufacture-oxygen-for-medical-use.html

119,10-4-20,Not a single FIR filed by CBI since March 20,"The Covid-19 lockdown has taken a toll on registration of fresh cases by the premier anti-corruption agency, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has not lodged a single FIR since March 20.

Sources said the agency is functioning from a pool of skeletal staff due to preventive measures like work from home and social distancing.

So only matters of urgency like filing of chargesheets in pressing cases before relevant courts are being taken up amid a slew of restrictions across the country to beat the spread of the pandemic, they pointed out.

In view of the restrictions that also involve checks on movement of personnel besides minimal attendance of staff at agency offices across the country, even questioning of suspects and accused are being undertaken sparingly, said an official.

On the CBI’s official website, the new FIRs were posted last on March 20 and thereafter, not a single case has been uploaded.

As per a Supreme Court directive, the new FIRs are supposed to be uploaded on the agency’s official website within 24 hours and those of secretive nature and with bearing on ongoing probe need to be posted within 72 hours.

Sources said in the given scenario it will be difficult for the agency to file chargesheets in the stipulated 90-day period in special crimes under the Indian Penal Code and within the requisite 60-day limit for filing chargesheets in anti-corruption cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

Once the lockdown and related restrictions are lifted post-containment of the viral disease that has hit almost each and every country around the globe, it will be difficult for the sleuths to wrap up probe and the agency may be bound to seek extensions from related courts to pursue the investigation, another official said.

Processing of Letters Rogatory (judicial requests) and notices under the Interpol have also been hit due to the Covid-related containment measures, leading to delays in wrapping up probe in certain cases, another official said.

As per the prevailing instructions, non-essential staff barely visit the agency headquarters here and some of them attend their offices barely once a week, added a source.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/not-a-single-fir-filed-by-cbi-since-march-20.html

Though a panel of eminent doctors on Wednesday recommended continuing the lockdown -- set to end on April 14 -- till April 30 only in hotspots like Bengaluru and Mysuru, the Cabinet did not want to take any chance by lifting the lockdown in districts not affected by the virus. ""The lockdown should continue for two more weeks to ensure that the number of coronavirus cases do not spike as was the case in some states and to prevent community spread,"" said Yediyurappa.

The panel, headed by eminent doctor Devi Shetty, and C.N. Manjunath, Nagaraj, Ravi and Sudarshan as members, was set up by the state in March to assess the pandemic and advise measures to contain its fallout across the southern state.

""The lockdown should not be lifted in the hotspots or relaxed in the districts with less or zero cases so as to contain the virus and control the situation, especially physical distancing,"" asserted the Chief Minister.

Of the 30 districts in Karnataka, 18 districts have reported corona cases, including two hotspots.

""A final decision on the lockdown will be taken on Sunday or Monday after our videoconference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday and as per his advice for the welfare of all,"" added Yediyurappa.

Modi had advised the states to suggest if the nationwide lockdown should be extended beyond April 14 or eased with curbs in areas that were free from the infection so far.

Though the 21-day lockdown was clamped on March 24 midnight across the country, nine districts of Karnataka have been under shutdown since March 14 on the panel's advice to contain the virus fallout.

127,10-4-20,Keep operational assets virus free: Navy Chief,"Against the backdrop of more than 100 sailors testing positive onboard a US aircraft carrier, Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh on Thursday asked his personnel to ensure social distancing in submarines and warships to avoid coronavirus pandemic.

The captain of the US ship had later resigned.

Asking the rank and file of the Navy to redouble current efforts to ensure that all personnel and their families are safe, the Navy Chief in a video message said the services are the last bastion and “if the care givers become care seekers it will be a big problem.” “It is going to be a long battle,” he cautioned.

Singh also said “We have to ensure that our operational assets, specifically ships and submarine, remain free from the virus. It is a very difficult task because physical distancing onboard ships and especially submarines is very tough… but physically we will maintain the required distance of six feet,” he said in a video message released to the force.

Stating that the challenge is not over yet and it is only going to intensity in days and weeks ahead, Adm Singh said, “It will require us to augment our preparedness. It can be no longer business as usual. We need to take concrete measures so that we are geared and prepared to tackle the full onslaught of this deadly virus.”

He outlined three priorities to all personnel. First is to redouble the current efforts to ensure that our personnel and our families are safe, ensure operational assets, specifically ships and submarine, remain free from the virus. Second is how can we support the overall national effort which the Navy is already contributing in a big way across all stations, he observed. He also said the spirit of innovation over the last two weeks has been very heartening referring to various developments like the hand held thermal scanner, assisted respiratory devices among others that were adapted for usage.

Looking ahead, Singh said everyone should keep our guard up and “retain our sights on being combat ready.” “Operational readiness must remain an imp priority. We should hope for the nest and plan for the worst. We need be ready for the worst case scenario. It is going to be a long battle.”

Once the lockdown is lifted, he said movement by personnel will be done in a deliberate and coordinated fashion. It might be delayed but there should be no rush, he stated.

In case situation worsens, he said the Navy should scale up facilities to handle people, facilitate cross state movement from one coastal state to another, assist local authorities in law and order, prepare make short vehicles for movement and intensity efforts for community kitchens and support groups among other measures. “All this while ensuring that perimeter security and overall security, access control, surveillance and response to asymmetric threat should never go down,” he added.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/keep-operational-assets-virus-free--navy-chief.html
128,10-4-20,TN CM warns of community transmission possibility,"Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami cautioned on Thursday there is every possibility of Tamil Nadu progressing to Stage 3 of COVID-19 from its present status of Stage 2. This means that the State faces the danger of community transmission of the virus which may force the administration to resort to extreme measures like extending the lockdown duration which was supposed to be over by April 15.

Palaniswami was addressing the media on Thursday after presiding over the meeting of the task force constituted by the State Government to monitor control and prevent the spreading of corona virus. The decision would be taken only on the basis of the severity of the spread of the pandemic.

The spread has been increasing day by day. Every other day, Corona virus spread has been on the rise, ”said the chief minister while asked about the possibility of extending the shut down.

Beela Rajesh, secretary, health and family welfare, in her daily media briefing said that the number of persons tested positive for corona virus in Tamil Nadu stood at 834 on Thursday evening.

“Thursday saw 96 persons testing positive for corona virus. Out of this, 84 are from the single source event (Tablighi Jamaat conference held in Delhi),” said Rajesh. This means that 763 out of the 834 corona virus positive cases are from single source event.

“We have details of 1480 persons from the State who attended the congregation and returned. Efforts are on to trace all of them.

As on Thursday , full-fledfged containment activities are happening in 34 districts. We have screened a population of 58 lakh till date,” said the secretary.

Alarmed over the spurt in the number of persons tested positive for corona virus, the Government has ordered the procurement of 4,00,000 rapid test kits which would give the test results in 30 minutes while the test kits in service talk a minimum of six hours. This was disclosed by the chief minister while speaking to reporters after meeting the task force committee members. Since the State is not showing any signs of reduction in the corona cases, there has been a demand from all sections in the society for the extension of the lock-down period.

While Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Telangana has asked the Centre to extend the 21-day national lock down by another fortnight, veteran medical scientist Prof B M Hegde and the DMK, Tamil Nadu’s main Opposition party demanded that the lock down period be extended by ‘at least’ one month.

Prof Hegde, a medical scientist with four FRCP degrees (Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians) from Royal Colleges of Physicians in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin said that the situation in the country because of corona virus is a serious matter of concern which could be addressed only by a total shut down. “This is an extra ordinary situation and needs an extra ordinary response. Shut down and social distancing are the best options because we do not have any medicines available to treat the COVID-19 disease,” Prof Hegde told The Pioneer.

Prof Hegde, who was honored by the President of India with Padma Bhushan is a veteran of many a medical war, notably the one against the H5N2 pandemic flu which claimed hundreds of lives in London said that it was possible to contain the corona virus with effective measures like social distancing and shut down.

Dr Gautham Sigamani, orthopaedics surgeon and member of parliament from Tamil Nadu said it was the 21-day lock down announced by the Government of India which prevented the spread of corona virus from reaching an alarming situation.

“I would like to see the national lock down extended at least by another 30 days because human lives are more important than other factors,” said Dr Sigamani.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tn-cm-warns-of-community-transmission-possibility.html

The RBI noted that the bumper rabi harvest and higher food prices during 2019-20 provided conducive conditions for the strengthening of rural demand, the transmission of past reductions in the policy rate to bank lending rates has been improving, and reductions in the tax rates and measures to boost rural and infrastructurespending were directed at boosting domestic demand more generally.

“The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered this outlook,” the report said, and added the global economy is expected to slump into recession in 2020, as post-COVID projections indicate.

The RBI added the sharp reduction in international crude oil prices, if sustained, could improve the country’s terms of trade, but the gain from this channel is not expected to offset the drag from the shutdown and loss of external demand. “COVID-19, the accompanying lockdowns and the expected contraction in global output in 2020 weigh heavily on the growth outlook. The actual outturn would depend upon the speed with which the outbreak is contained and economic activity returns to normalcy.

“Significant monetary and liquidity measures taken by the RBI and fiscal measures by the government would mitigate the adverse impact on domestic demand and help spur economic activity once normalcy is restored,” it said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rbi-hopes-monetary--fiscal-measures-to-spur-eco-activity-once-normalcy-is-restored-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/rbi-hopes-monetary--fiscal-measures-to-spur-eco-activity-once-normalcy-is-restored.html

A recent study, published in the journal Cell, had placed pangolins as a natural reservoir of coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2, the one behind the COVID-19 pandemic.

Another recent study had identified the presence of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in Malayan pangolins smuggled into China to be sold in wet markets.

In these markets, pangolins find demand both in food and traditional medicine, making them the most-commonly trafficked mammal.

""The discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible hosts in the emergence of novel coronaviruses and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission,"" said Ved Kumar, a former wildlife conservationist with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), and founder of Maaty Biodiversity Conservation & Societal Research Organisation in Uttarakhand.

146,10-4-20,"Rs recovers from record lows on forex inflows, firm stocks","The Rupee on Thursday recovered from record low levels to settle 6 paise higher at 76.28 against the US dollar tracking gains in equity markets and foreign fund inflows.

The local unit had settled at an all-time low of 76.34 against the greenback on Wednesday. Forex traders said the rupee traded in a narrow range as gains in domestic equities supported the local unit amid lingering concerns over coronavirus outbreak in the country.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened higher at 76.11, but witnessed heavy volatility and slid to its all-time intra-day low of 76.55 against the American currency. The domestic unit later recovered ground to settle at 76.28 against the greenback, up 6 paise over its previous close.

Traders said concerns over the impact of coronavirus outbreak on the domestic as well as the global economy continued to haunt investors.

“Uncertainty and fragile market sentiments over COVID-19 will continue to keep the rupee under pressure. Further pressure will come from the uptick in crude and surge in the dollar index,” said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.

Gupta added, “Also, OTC timings have been trimmed to 10AM-2PM, and it is an illiquid, pessimistic market at this point in time and won’t be surprised if 77.50 is breached next week.”

Rupee opened stronger, but pared its gains soon and made a fresh all-time low, Devarsh Vakil Head Advisory HDFC Securities Research said, adding that “dollar selling from exporters near 76.5 and foreign fund buying in domestic equities for the last two days supported rupee recovery through day and rupee managed to close near April 8 levels”.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) remained net buyers in the capital market, as they bought equity shares worth Rs 1,943.41 crore on Wednesday, according to provisional exchange data.

Meanwhile, equity benchmark Sensex rallied over 1,265 points on Thursday, led by robust buying amid hopes of a second stimulus package from the Government. The BSE barometer ended 1,265.66 points or 4.23 per cent higher at 31,159.62. The NSE Nifty soared 363.15 points, or 4.15 per cent, to 9,111.90.

147,10-4-20,"Petrol, diesel demand slumps 66 pc in April","India’s fuel consumption slumped by over 66 per cent in April as a nationwide lockdown halted economic activity and travel, which eviscerated demand.

Petrol and diesel demand is down 66 per cent in April, while aviation turbine fuel (ATF) consumption has collapsed by 90 per cent as most airlines have stopped flying, industry officials said.

India had consumed 2.4 million tonnes of petrol and 7.3 million tonnes of diesel in April 2019. As much as 6,45,000 tonnes of ATF was used in that month last year.

The collapse of demand in the world’s third-biggest consumer during April comes on the back of worst fuel sales in more than a decade recorded in March 2020. The country’s petroleum product consumption fell 17.79 per cent to 16.08 million tonnes in March as diesel, petrol and ATF demand fell, according to official data released here.

Diesel, the most consumed fuel in the country, saw demand contract by 24.23 per cent to 5.65 million tonnes. This is the biggest fall in diesel consumption the country has recorded as most trucks went off-road and railways stopped plying trains. Petrol sales dropped 16.37 per cent to 2.15 million tonnes in March as the 21-day nationwide lockdown enforced to prevent the spread of COVID-19 took most cars and two-wheelers off the road.

With flights grounded since mid-March, ATF consumption fell 32.4 per cent to 4,84,000 tonnes.

The only fuel that showed growth was LPG as households rushed to book refills for stocking during the three-week lockdown period. LPG sales rose 1.9 per cent to 2.3 million tonnes in March. This is the first estimate of total petroleum product consumption in the country. This includes sales by both public and private sector companies.

Previously, provisional numbers of the three public sector oil marketing companies — Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) — were released that also showed a 17 per cent drop in petrol and 26 per cent slump in diesel sales in March.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol--diesel-demand-slumps-66-pc-in-april.html

The UN ‘Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) 2020: Towards sustainable economies’ said that COVID-19 is having far-reaching economic and social consequences for the region, with strong cross-border spillover effects through trade, tourism and financial linkages. India’s GDP growth for the fiscal year 2019-2020 was estimated at 5 per cent and is forecast to slow down to 4.8 per cent for the current fiscal 2020-21. Economic growth for the country could stand at 5.1 per cent for fiscal year 2021-22, the report said.

The report noted that these are very preliminary forecasts based on the data and information available up to March 10. “As the COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving rapidly and showing no signs of abating as of March 31, 2020, its negative impacts on economic performance of countries and territories in Asia and the Pacific will likely be very significant,” a disclaimer accompanying the GDP chart for economies in the Asia and Pacific in the report says.

“India’s economic growth declined considerably by more than the earlier estimate (5 per cent in 2019 compared with previous estimate of 7 per cent), as uncertainties ahead of the general election and tighter credit conditions weighed on manufacturing activities and investments. Weakness in income growth and a rising unemployment rate also undermined consumer sentiment. Its exports were affected by global trade tensions as well, while extreme weather events — especially rainfall — disrupted agricultural activities,” the ESCAP report said. The report noted that COVID-19, first reported in China and subsequently globally, has significantly increased the downside risks to the Asia and Pacific region’s near-term economic outlook.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/virus-to-retard-india---s-gdp-rate-to-4-8---un.html

That confrontation in Texas came just days after the Trump administration quietly shut down the nation’s asylum system for the first time in decades in the name of public health.

“The agent told us about the virus and that we couldn’t go further, but she didn’t let us speak or anything,” said Reyes, 35, who was shuttled to a crossing March 24 in Reynosa, Mexico, a violent border city.

She tried to get home to crime-ridden Honduras despite learning her brother had been killed there and her mother and 7-year-old daughter had fled to the Nicaraguan border. But she was stuck in Mexico as the virus closed borders in Central America.

The US Government used an obscure public health law to justify one of its most aggressive border crackdowns ever.

People fleeing violence and poverty to seek refuge in the US are whisked to the nearest border crossing and returned to Mexico without a chance to apply for asylum.

155,10-4-20,Countries start thinking about easing up restrictions,"Even as coronavirus deaths mount across Europe and New York, the US and other countries are starting to contemplate an exit strategy and thinking about a staggered and carefully calibrated easing of restrictions designed to curb the scourge.

“To end the confinement, we’re not going to go from black to white; we’re going to go from black to gray,” top French epidemiologist Jean-François Delfraissy said in a radio interview.

Deaths, hospitalizations and new infections are leveling off in places like Italy and Spain, and even New York has seen encouraging signs amid the gloom. At the same time, politicians and health officials warn that the crisis is far from over and a catastrophic second wave could hit if countries let down their guard too soon.

“We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. “But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing.”

In a sharp reminder of the danger, New York state on Wednesday recorded its highest one-day increase in deaths, 779, for an overall death toll of almost 6,300.

“The bad news is actually terrible,” Cuomo lamented. Still, the governor said that hospitalizations are decreasing and that many of those now dying fell ill in the outbreak’s earlier stages.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it was issuing new guidelines for some workers who have been within 6 feet of someone with a confirmed or suspected infection to go back on the job if they have no symptoms.

156,10-4-20,Space station crew dock at ISS after virus-hit build up,"A three-man crew docked successfully at the International Space Station Thursday, leaving behind a planet overwhelmed by the coronavirus pandemic. Russian space agency Roscosmos said the Soyuz MS-16 capsule “docked successfully” in a statement on its website.

Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner of Roscosmos and NASA’s Chris Cassidy reached the ISS at 1413 GMT, just over six hours after blasting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, where COVID-19 caused changes to pre-launch protocol.

Usually the departing crew faces questions from a large press pack before being waved off by family and friends.

Neither was possible this time round because of travel restrictions imposed over the virus, although the crew did respond to emailed questions from journalists in a Wednesday press conference.

Cassidy, 50, admitted the crew had been affected by their families not being unable to be in Baikonur, Russia’s space hub in neighbouring Kazakhstan, for their blastoff to the ISS.

“But we understand that the whole world is also impacted by the same crisis,” Cassidy said. Astronauts routinely go into quarantine ahead of space missions and give a final press conference at Baikonur from behind a glass wall to protect them from infection.

That process began even earlier than usual last month as the trio and their reserve crew hunkered down in Russia’s Star City training centre outside Moscow, eschewing traditional pre-launch rituals and visits to the capital.

Rather than hoping that a vaccine will soon be available and everything will suddenly be alright, nations affected by the pandemic should continue to test widely, identify those with the disease and isolate them, while also asking the general population to continue to practice social distancing until effective treatments are available, she said in an interview to JSTOR Daily, an online publication that contextualises current events with scholarship.

158,10-4-20,16.8 mn Americans thrown out of work as economic toll rises,"The coronavirus outbreak has thrown at least 16.8 million Americans onto the unemployment rolls in just three weeks, underscoring the terrifying speed with which the crisis has brought world economies to a near standstill.

Meanwhile, world leaders and health officials are fervently warning that hard-won gains in the fight against the scourge must not be jeopardized by relaxing social distancing during the Easter holiday.

A spike in deaths in Britain and New York and surges of reported new infections in Japan and in India’s congested cities make it clear the battle is far from over.

Numbers released by the US Government on Thursday showed that 6.6 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.

That means more than 1 in 10 American workers have been forced out of a job since the crisis took hold.

The real numbers could be even higher because the surge of jobless claims has overwhelmed state unemployment offices around the country, and some people have been unable to get through by telephone or website.

And still more job cuts are expected.

Georgieva made the remarks during her address on “Confronting the Crisis: Priorities for the Global Economy” here ahead of next week’s annual Spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.

“Today, the world is confronted with a crisis like no other. COVID-19 has disrupted our social and economic order at lightning speed and on a scale that we have not seen in living memory,” she said. The virus is causing a tragic loss of life, and the lockdown needed to fight it has affected billions of people. What was normal just a few weeks ago — going to school, going to work, being with family and friends — is now a huge risk, she said.

Observing the world is faced with extraordinary uncertainty about the depth and duration of this crisis, she said it is already clear, however, global growth will turn sharply negative in 2020. “In fact, we anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,” Georgieva said.

“Just three months ago, we expected positive per capita income growth in over 160 of our member countries in 2020.

The Iran-backed Huthi rebels have not made any comment on the coalition’s declaration of a two-week pause in the five-year conflict that took effect from 0900 GMT.

If the ceasefire does hold, it would be the first breakthrough since the warring parties agreed to a UN-brokered ceasefire in the port city of Hodeida during talks in Sweden in late 2018.

The UAE, a key ally in the coalition which drew down its troops last year as the conflict became increasingly intractable, applauded the Saudi move as “wise and responsible”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/---coronavirus-ceasefire----in-yemen---s-long-conflict-begins.html

162,10-4-20,Global death toll above 92K,"The worldwide number of fatalities from the novel coronavirus pandemic rose to 92,109 on Thursday.

More than 1,555,019 declared cases have been registered in 192 countries and territories. Of these cases, at least 345,834 are now considered recovered.

America’s coronavirus epicentre of New York recorded a new single-day high of 799 COVID-19 deaths on Thursday but Governor Andrew Cuomo said the rate of hospitalisations continued to fall. Cuomo said 799 people died in the last 24 hours, outdoing the previous high of 779 announced on Wednesday, but added that the curve was flattening because of social confinement measures.

“We had a 200-net increase in hospitalizations, which you can see is the lowest number we’ve had since this nightmare started,” Cuomo told reporters, adding that intensive care admissions were also at the lowest yet.

COVID-19 has killed more than 14,800 people in the United States, and the number of confirmed cases has grown to more than 432,000, according to a running tally by Johns Hopkins University.

New York is bearing the brunt of the United States’ deadly coronavirus pandemic, accounting for around half the number of deaths across the country.

Britain announced another 881 deaths of people testing positive for coronavirus in Thursday’s daily update, bringing the country’s total toll to 7,978. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, in charge as Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in intensive care battling COVID-19, announced the figures as he warned that the country hadn’t “yet reached the peak of the virus”.

Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s health continues to improve on his fourth day in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a London hospital where he is being treated for the coronavirus, Downing Street said on Thursday. The 55-year-old was shifted to the ICU of St. Thomas’ Hospital in London on Monday night as his condition worsened over 10 days after he had tested positive for the coronavirus and went into self-isolation. He has since received “standard oxygen treatment” but has not been diagnosed with pneumonia or required a ventilator to aid his breathing.

The daily death toll from the coronavirus fell to 683 in Spain on Thursday, after rising for two days, with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urging people to keep up the fight against the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The country, one of the worst hit by the pandemic, has now recorded 15,238 coroanvirus deaths. The official daily toll was down from 757 on Wednesday. However, there has been growing speculation that the death toll may have grossly underestimated. Authorities in the Madrid region acknowledged on Wednesday that the number of deaths in retirement homes could be five times as high as that announced by health officials, who have not included almost 3,500 deaths of people who had not been tested for the virus.

The coronavirus pandemic could kill between 11,000 and 22,000 people in Canada, the Government projected on Thursday. It said the country could see between 934,000 and 1.9 million cases of COVID-19 by the time the pandemic ends, assuming Canadians observe strict social distancing and other safety measures over the next few months. These are the federal Government’s first projections on the pandemic’s possible toll in Canada. As of Thursday morning the virus had killed 476 people in Canada, according to figures provided by provincial authorities.

Iran’s Health Ministry on Thursday said 117 new deaths from the novel coronavirus took the total to 4,110 in one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic. But ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said the latest figures showed there was a downward trend in the number of new coronavirus infections. “Today we are clearly seeing a decline in the number of new cases,” Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. “We have identified 1,634 new cases, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 66,220.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/global-death-toll-above-92k.html

The move comes a day after China lifted the 76-day lockdown in Wuhan, where the pandemic originated.

China’s National Health Commission (NHC) on Thursday reported 63 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 61

imported ones taking the total to 1,104 cases.

Two more persons were killed due to the disease, taking the death toll in the country to 3,335. The overall coronavirus cases have reached 81,865 in the country.

After nearly three months of grim battle against the coronavirus, China is fast returning to normalcy with factories and business humming back to activity amid concerns over coronavirus rebound due to a steady rise of new infections, especially coming from thousands of Chinese returning from abroad.

As the 76-day lockdown of Wuhan was lifted on Wednesday, tens of thousands of people in the city, the origin point and epicentre for the coronavirus pandemic, began travelling out by road, rail and air.

164,10-4-20,One hundred Italian doctors have died of virus: Medics,"One hundred Italian doctors have died of the novel coronavirus since the pandemic reached the Mediterranean country in February, Italy’s FNOMCeO health association said on Thursday.

“The number of doctors who have died because of COVID-19 is 100 — perhaps even 101 at the moment, unfortunately,” a FNOMCeO spokesman told AFP.

The toll includes retired doctors the Government began calling in a month ago to help fight a coronavirus that has officially claimed a world-topping 17,669 lives in Italy.

Italian media reports estimate that 30 nurses and nursing assistance have also died of COVID-19.

“We can longer allow our doctors, our health workers, to be sent to fight without any protection against the virus,” FNOMCeO president Filippo Anelli said on the association’s website. “It is an unfair fight.”

165,10-4-20,A sliver of silver,"Prateep Sen and Tamojit Dutta say that the care of seniors has to change keeping the pandemic in mind

Juggling hectic work schedules with elderly care was always a question of achieving a fine balance. At times you wanted to go back home at regular intervals just to check on your elders because you were anxious. It was a tussle to make them feel independent while ensuring that they took every medicine on time. Well, all of this overthinking has come to a grinding halt as the world experiences the COVID-19 pandemic which demands a change in elderly care as it has given rise to anxieties of an altogether different kind.

Across the world senior citizens are more susceptible to the Coronavirus because their immunity is compromised which is coupled with co-morbidities and pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. A survey of the Coronavirus death has a chilling report. It says that one in every 12 elders will die from COVID-19 if aged between 70-80. This will climb up to one in seven if aged over 80.

Suffice it to say that it is not an easy time to be a senior citizen currently. It may be worthwhile to take a look at different categories of senior citizens and see how they were leading their life before the lockdown.

There are seniors in their late 60s, early 70s who enjoy an active life. They go to the local shops, watch a film at the nearest cinema hall and love going to the local market to buy vegetables and meat and hire someone to help them bring the groceries home. They have maids who cook, do the household chores and act as company. They also have relatives visiting them every now and then. They cope well and are not fully dependent on anyone, but they need help with daily activities.

Then there are seniors who are fully dependent on people and need a support system. They are not in a position to run their households by themselves. Typical cases include those that are 80 years and older, who live alone and have attendants round-the-clock who look after the household while their children live and work in another city or are abroad. Another example is of those who live with their families and need full time monitoring and physical assistance because of health issue, leaving them semi-bedridden.

It is well known that seniors are dependent on some kind of support system, whether through a personal network of care providers — care takers, neighbours, family and friends, or on a professional healthcare provider.

With the lockdown in place, the areas where they have been affected include:

Disruption of routine activities: Most of these elders depend on local shops and outlets for their daily requirements right from groceries to medicines. Access to bank accounts is difficult given the restrictions, long queues, hygiene issues and their limited knowledge in managing ATMs and online banking platforms.

Loneliness and depression: The seniors are going through stress, anxiety and isolation as a result of being under lockdown. Their recreational activities usually include morning and evening walks or a tea with an old friend. Low usage of technology by them has impacted their digital participation. They can’t even seek help from close family and friends.

Healthcare access limitations: The lockdown has affected healthcare delivery at hospitals and clinics, both for chronic and acute illnesses. Purchase of medicines, ordering blood tests at home, access to doctor consultations and elective surgeries — every aspect of healthcare has been impacted as a result of lockdown. We also need to take into account that the seniors are the biggest users of these facilities and now they have lost access to these.

However, with the pandemic hitting worldwide elderly care will change, given the need of the hour where you need to stay indoors, restrict movement and limit outside contact. Whether the lockdown lasts for four weeks or two months, it is safe to assume that the lifestyle of seniors, as well as their care, will change for good. The elderly care has witnessed a massive change as they have a higher risk of getting infected. One needs to maintain the continuity of care while protecting them from exposure to possible infection. The main goal now is to create an envelope of care by a selected group of people who can provide them all the assistance required while maintaining hygiene themselves.

Keeping these in mind, the care for elders will need to change to help them in the areas that are the most difficult, and will now have to be solved differently. Some simple initial changes in care are required:

An attendant: Having a single live-in attendant who can help with daily activities and provide physical assistance will help them in their routine activities. This will help in full-time monitoring, physical assistance and limits outside contact.

Home delivery: Home delivery of essentials is an absolute must, as it is one of the main reasons why seniors go out. They go to buy staples, food and medicines. While online delivery providers can provide the basic essentials, it is better for seniors to be able to have access to local providers who can supervise the entire delivery process and ensure sensitivity towards seniors, while maintaining hygiene.

Telephonic consultation with doctors: Seniors should consult their doctor on call for basic issues or regular health updates. It is the best way to reach out to them and make payments online, thus avoiding a physical visit.

It is also important to document all aspects that need to be covered during an emergency — ambulance numbers, choice of hospital for admission, identification documents and funds required. All of this should be planned on a structured basis. It is best to get professional help for this to avoid stress or unpreparedness at a later stage.

Most importantly, be vigilant at all times about hygiene for both seniors and those living with them — washing hands, using sanitisers and maintaining social distance, even if it is a family member.

These times will also bring a new conversation-driven change. Earlier, most of us did not have enough time to sit and chat with our elders or share a cup of tea with them in the evening. We don’t even realise the amount of care they need as they grow old. Spending time with them not only helps them feel better and fight loneliness but also helps us get an insight into the past. Right from teaching us about our past values to becoming good human beings, they help us become the best versions of ourself. Many of us would realise this now as we now have enough time to communicate and spend time with them.

However, it might be different for those who are not living with their parents or elderly loved ones. For them interactions with seniors would mean being in touch with them over the phone rather than physically meeting them. This, however, may be very cold and impersonal, and there is a huge chance of home bound seniors getting depressed, especially if they are used to an active social life where children and grandchildren visit them often. Under such circumstances, it is important to call every day and maintain contact. If they are comfortable, a Whatsapp or a Skype call, or even using Alexa to “drop in” can be helpful. It is important not to lose touch as a result of the restrictions placed on them. Making the seniors tech-friendly, even at a basic level, can go a very long way. Having conversations, introducing them to online recreational activities can actually help in combating depression and isolation.

Our elderly care platform has launched three initiatives keeping social distancing and hygiene factors in mind.

Dare to Care: a no contact grocery and medicine delivery service at home

Talk to Me: a free call service for medical and psychological support and assistance by experts.

Happy at Home: Access to recreational activities through WhatsApp groups and Zoom sessions such as crosswords, yoga, book reading, music to combat loneliness.

166,10-4-20,Gloucestershire call off Pujara deal,"Star India batsman Cheteshwar Pujara’s deal with Gloucestershire for the first six matches of the County C’ship has been cancelled due to COVID-19 pandemic.

The 32-year-old Indian, who has scored 5840 runs at an average of 48.66 in 77 Tests, was supposed to play six County C’ship matches for the club at the start of the county’s first season back in Division One.

However, Gloucestershire on Thursday said that the deal is off now given the global health crisis, which has forced the ECB to suspend all professional cricket until May 28.

167,10-4-20,ATP chief hoping for Roland Garros and clay-court season in Sept,"ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi on Thursday said he hopes the clay-court season and French Open can be played in September as tennis scrambles to salvage a season in danger of being wiped out by the coronavirus pandemic.

“If we manage to start again in August, we’ll save three Slams and six Masters 1000, otherwise the problems will increase tenfold,” Gaudenzi said in an interview with several Italian media outlets.

“We are working on the hypothesis of four weeks on clay after the US Open, with Madrid and Rome before Roland Garros.”

Tennis has been in lockdown since early last month and is not scheduled to return until July 13 at the earliest following the cancellation of Wimbledon for the first time since World War II.

The decision to axe the sport’s oldest and most prestigious Grand Slam event followed the French Open’s unilateral switch from its traditional May-June slot to September-October.

Gaudenzi said no sanctions would be taken against Roland Garros for taking the decision alone to postpone.

“Now we are working together,” Gaudenzi, who took over as ATP chief in January, told Gazzetta Dello Sport.

“Tennis needs unity, Paris acted out of fear, making a mistake. But they have recognised this.”

All this will depend on the virus which has infected over 1.5 million with the United States and Europe hit hard.

“We have made 50 versions of the calendar that we change day by day,” said Gaudenzi.

“I am confident that the season in America can begin with the August Masters 1000 in Toronto and Cincinnati and then the US Open.

“In this way three Slams and six Masters 1000 would be played (there are also Shanghai and Bercy) and the season would be 70 percent safe.

“Of course, if the whole American slot were to skip, the difficulties would increase tenfold.”

Gaudenzi said the options were being examined in conjunction with the ATP Player Council including Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic.

He stressed it was hoped to maintain the ATP Finals, scheduled for London in November 15-22.

“The 02 Arena is only available in the week already fixed. I don’t like closed doors, it’s the last resort.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/atp-chief-hoping-for-roland-garros-and-clay-court-season-in-sept.html
168,10-4-20,Rangers blast plans to end Scottish season early,"Rangers strongly criticised plans to terminate the divisions below Premiership, warning of “severe consequences for the Scottish game”.

With play halted due to the coronavirus, the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) announced proposals to determine final placings by points per game in league matches played to date by each club.

The resolution, to be voted on by clubs, also recommends the top tier remains postponed for the time being, although final placings would be determined by the same system if the SPFL’s board determines matches cannot be played.

That would see Celtic crowned champions for the ninth successive season and Hearts relegated, but the immediate impact of the plans would be relegation for Partick Thistle from the second-tier Championship and Stranraer from League One.

Steven Gerrard’s second-placed Gers, 13 points behind Celtic, said in a statement they would oppose “in the strongest possible terms” any attempt to railroad changes to existing rules.

They said they would immediately propose a member’s resolution that would release prize money to be distributed to all clubs throughout Scotland urgently.

Rangers said forcing through change “without due care and attention” would have severe consequences for the Scottish game.

Partick, bottom of the Championship, said they would not accept the proposal as it stood, adding it needed more scrutiny and debate.

Dundee United would be promoted to the Premiership if the resolution passed, while Raith Rovers would move up to the Championship and Cove Rangers would join League One.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/rangers-blast-plans-to-end-scottish-season-early.html
169,10-4-20,Boucher optimist about rebuilding strong SA side,"South Africa’s ODI series victory over Australia was the “light at the end of the tunnel” for Team Director Mark Boucher, who remains optimistic about rebuilding a strong Proteas side despite a tough summer.

The former wicketkeeper-batsman took over in mid-December ahead of the England tour which saw South Africa lose a Test and T20 series while drawing a rain-affected ODI series.

The Proteas then suffered a home T20 series defeat to Australia before a young Quinton de-Kock-led side registered a 3-0 win over Aaron Finch’s men in the ODIs.

“If I look back over the summer and reflect on the team’s performances and progress, especially against England and Australia, I think it was quite disappointing to be honest,” Boucher told Cricket South Africa.

“Especially against England, we didn’t perform like we wanted to perform. In saying that I think we, as a new coaching staff, asked some questions and I think we got some answers. Some were good and some were bad.”

The 43-year-old is delighted with the team’s performance in the shorter formats of the game but reckons the Test side needs rebuilding.

“The nice thing for me about the whole summer was the light at the end of tunnel, especially in our short formats. I think we have a lot of work to do with our Test cricket still, there’s probably a lot of rebuilding in that respect.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/boucher-optimist-about-rebuilding-strong-sa-side.html

171,10-4-20,"Tour de France racing against time, and losing","For the Tour de France, one of the last of the summer’s major sports events still standing in the face of the coronavirus pandemic, the stop-watch is ticking.

While the Tokyo Olympics, the Euros, tennis and golf majors and the Giro d’Italia have already been postponed or even cancelled, the Tour is still scheduled to start on June 27.

Christian Prudhomme, the Tour director, made clear that before the race he wants “two months of exposure for the riders.”

That means training rides and races and with most prospective competitors confined, the chances of their getting back on the road by late April look slim.

The race also needs France to end its lockdown, not just so the riders can ride but because the Tour attracts 10 to 12 million spectators who stand by the roads to watch.

Last week, when he announced the postponement of the Dauphine, an eight-day Tour warm-up stage race in the southeast of France due to start on May 31, Prudhomme said: “The most important word in Tour de France is France, and health concerns come first.”

The situation across Europe suggests that a postponement is increasingly likely.

Prudhomme is not prepared to discuss alternative plans in public, but said: “As of today, the dates of the Tour de France are maintained. But it would be a lie to say that we are not studying other hypotheses.”

Behind the scenes, it is learnt, the organisers have sounded out cycling teams as well as French politicians and broadcasters about a postponement to August.

Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu talked of banning spectators. But the idea seems to have died.

The Tour is fuelled by its fans and it would be hard to prevent people coming out of their houses when the race passes by.

Welshman Geraint Thomas, the winner in 2018, and Julian Alaphilippe, France’s hero of the 2019 Tour after wearing the leader’s jersey for 14 days, used almost identical words. “Without the fans, it wouldn’t be the Tour de France,” was how Thomas put it.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tour-de-france-racing-against-time--and-losing.html
172,10-4-20,Mid-May possibility for League clubs to resume training: EFL,"Clubs outside the Premier League cannot resume training till “May 16 at the earliest” due to the coronavirus pandemic but the season can be completed in “56 days” English Football League chairman Rick Parry informed them in a letter.

The 72 clubs have been kicking their heels since the EFL suspended the campaign in the Championship, League One and Two on March 13.

All 24 sides in the Championship still had nine matches to play.

Some clubs in League One have 12 games remaining, while in League Two, teams have either nine or 10 matches remaining to complete the regular season.

However, Parry said following a EFL board meeting on Thursday they were confident once there was a resumption the league fixtures and the promotion play-offs could be completed within two months.

“The EFL Board determined that to provide a level of certainty, clubs should not recommence any training activity with players until May 16 at the earliest,” Parry wrote.

“Whenever the decision is taken that it is safe to resume, we currently estimate that the League will require 56 days approximately to complete the outstanding matches in the season (including Play-Offs).”

Parry said it is probable the matches will be played behind closed doors due to the British Government’s social distancing measures.

“It is our working assumption at this stage that matches will be played behind closed doors when we eventually return,” he said.

His letter also suggested the delayed resumption of the present season could impact on the start of the 2020/21 campaign.

“We will ensure there is a suitable break between the two, so as to allow clubs and staff sufficient time to regroup and prepare accordingly,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mid-may-possibility-for-league-clubs-to-resume-training--efl.html

174,10-4-20,Back to basics,"Now, in an unsettling era of staying at home, revive forgotten house skills

Mending clothes. Cutting hair. Fixing a squeaky door or a dripping faucet. Baking bread.

A generation or two ago, household skills like these were common, learned at home and at school. Then it became easier to toss things out rather than fix them, quicker to call the professionals.

Now, in an unsettling era of staying at home and not knowing what will be available tomorrow, the old ways are being dusted off and relearned.

Since the Coronavirus has shuttered many small businesses that do our work and supply our things, millions of people trying to stay home are driven by necessity — or boredom — to do more cooking, cleaning, fixing, grooming and other practical skills themselves.

“It’s during uncertain times like these when we take stock of all the basic life skills we’ve forgotten or never learned in the first place, because they sure could come in handy right about now,” says Erin Bried, a magazine editor in Brooklyn and author of How to Sew a Button: And Other Nifty Things Your Grandmother Knew.

In a dark and difficult time, it can be an emotional lift to find that you’re more capable around the house than you thought. “I accomplished something real today!” Maria Kernahan, a real estate agent and children’s book author, said after installing a new thermostat herself in her Castle Park, Michigan, house. She followed online advice to figure out the wiring in the old house. Her husband, meanwhile, has begun chopping wood. “We’re making this up as we go along,” she said.

Bill Hughes, a business consultant in University Place, Washington, had to wash some shirts and didn’t want to put them away wrinkled. “When I was a graduate student, I would iron my own shirts to save some money. It was tedious and I looked forward to the day when I could afford to drop off my shirts to be cleaned,” says Hughes, 59. He added: “Since my dry cleaners is closed, I dusted off the iron and ironing board, turned on some Huey Lewis and the News and went at it.”

Janice Simonsen, who works in corporate communications in Philadelphia, helped sew masks for medical personnel, following instructions on a YouTube video. “I haven’t pulled my sewing machine out for many years. I never really had the time,” she says. “Those junior high sewing classes kicked back in.”

She plans to keep the machine out and try some projects, like pillow covers, that she’s put off for years. “It felt good to create something useful again,” says Simonsen.

Yes, you can still order takeout in most places and call the plumber or electrician. But more people are trying to do that only when absolutely needed. Hardware stores have seen high demand for home-repair and lawn tools. Social media feeds everywhere are full of posts from newbies planting vegetable gardens, giving themselves haircuts and baking bread.

Especially sourdough. Lots of sourdough. YouTube has seen a spike of more than 100 per cent in average daily views of videos with Cook with Me in the title since March 15 compared to the rest of the year, said spokeswoman Veronica Navarrete. “We’re seeing this trend across several verticals,’’ including cleaning, she said.

For her book, Bried interviewed women who had lived through the Great Depression and imparted lessons on how to make do and get by. “I feel a new, closer connection to all of their stories now,” she says and adds: “It was a difficult time, and it left its mark on all of them. I think this pandemic, too, will leave its mark on us much in the same way. It’s caused us all to halt our lives and reevaluate, maybe for the first time, what is truly important and what we’re equipped to handle.”

Jeanne Huntley, who taught high school home economics for 35 years in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, thinks society lost something important when schools phased out home economics and shop classes in favor of computer science, robotics and STEM.

“A lot of younger people have been brought up in a consumer society — ‘You don’t fix things, you replace things,”’ she says. “Parents are busy too, and there’s not a lot of time to pass on those skills. But knowing you can make things and fix things gives us a sense of confidence in ourselves.’’

This is not new for everyone. There’s always been a countercurrent of people yearning to get back to basics.

The DIY movement has blossomed in recent years, and long before the coronavirus “urban homesteaders” experimented with backyard chickens, homemade dyes, wooden toys and organic food. Concerns over climate change have kickstarted a strong movement toward buying fewer things and leaving a lighter footprint on the environment: “Reduce, reuse, recycle.’’

Now, in a time of feared shortages and limited mobility, this emphasis on self-sufficiency is going wider.

Sharon Bowers, co-author with her husband, David, of a book about life skills called The Useful Book (Workman), embraces the trend. But she cautions people to be smart — and check out books and YouTube videos before plunging in.

“I’m urging you to boldly go and try something new, but not something that you know is way outside your ability. ... You could probably wire a lamp, but don’t mess around with the circuit board in your house,” she says. “If you make a mess — assuming you don’t break something you really need — you can always call the professionals when we’re out the other side.”

Even the Bowerses, fix-it pros who live outside Dublin, Ireland, with their two teenage sons, “have a plumbing problem that’s complicated” to deal with. “And,” she says, “we’re just going to have to wait.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/back-to-basics-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/back-to-basics.html
175,10-4-20,Bhumi learns hydroponics farming,"Actor Bhumi Pednekar is an environmentally conscious actor who wants to propagate the idea of sustainable living and is an advocate for climate change. India is in lockdown mode due to the Coronavirus crisis and the actor decided to learn the science of hydroponics farming from her mom, Sumitra Pednekar. The mother-daughter duo have always wanted to build a garden to table concept of sustainable lifestyle and looks like that dream is coming to fruition.

Bhumi shares, “My mom and I always wanted to have a hydroponics garden of our own where we grow our own vegetables and can have a fully sustainable lifestyle. We wanted to have a garden to table lifestyle at home and we are both happy with the progress.”

The actor is also the brain behind her much-lauded online and offline initiative Climate Warrior through which she is raising awareness on how citizen of India can contribute to protect the climate.

She adds, “This quarantine has made me get into learning the science of hydroponics and understand the essence of what conservation of environment can truly mean. I have been working closely with my mom during this time. I’m proud that our garden can now produce food for two days of the week. I have tried to be closer to nature during the lockdown and it has made me realise that we can become completely self-sustaining as a community and do our best for its preservation.”

The science of soil-less gardening is called hydroponics. It basically involves growing healthy plants without the use of a traditional soil medium by using a nutrient like a mineral rich water solution instead. A plant just needs select nutrients, some water, and sunlight to grow. Such farming reduces the use of chemicals and is a brilliant way of cutting down soil pollution.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bhumi-learns-hydroponics-farming-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/bhumi-learns-hydroponics-farming.html
176,10-4-20,Heal thyself,"Experts suggest eating nutrient-dense foods, which can help strengthen the immune system, during self-quarantine as there is lesser physical activity. By Chahak Mittal

Instagram is evidence how experimenting with food and cooking new dishes have become most-seen household activities during self-quarantine. Amid the Coronavirus pandemic, people in their homes are not just giving a chance to themselves but also looking at healthier eating practices thanks to lockdown, which has made us forego junk. The craving is being satiated by equally delicious but healthier options.

Some chefs and food experts suggest a few mantras on cooking such meals at home, keeping in mind the availability of resources.

Cook wisely

Deepankar Arora, chef and partner at BEEP, Agra, says, “In such times, the best way to keep hunger at bay is to keep it simple. Since going out to buy stuff regularly isn’t a very viable option, a lot depends on the ingredients you already have at home. And when you’re buying, go for items like cabbage, root vegetables and winter squash, which can last longer in your fridge. So plan all meals in advance to avoid stepping out unnecessarily. Use the ingredients in a way that only small quantities get exhausted or wasted.”

He adds that since we’re all multi-tasking with our domestic chores too, “to save time, one can prepare a basic tomato and onion purée and freeze it in an ice cube tray. The cubes can be used as and when required. As the weather gets drier, one can also try experimenting with flavoured water which can be made easily by adding mint leaves, lemon or sweet lime zest or slices to a bottle of water to sip on.”

Vikas Malik, chef, Danbro, says, “The lockdown can mean scarcity of even the basic ingredients which we use while cooking. During crisis, the bottom-line is to maximise the resources we have and to innovate with the limited material available.”

Prem Kumar Pogakula, executive chef, The Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, agrees that people are making the most of their time at home by experimenting with new cuisines. However, he cautions that one of the biggest barriers with experimental food could be “the availability of necessary ingredients. Since at this moment, it’s a little hard to move out of the house frequently, we need to make sure we use what we have, wisely. We can still experiment with ingredients which match our regular recipes.”

Learn newer techniques

Deepankar suggests that if there are kids at home, it’s a great time to involve them in the kitchen and introduce them to the art of cooking. He says, “Younger ones can be educated about different types of fruits, vegetables and pulses available and the older ones can help with basic peeling and chopping under supervision.”

He suggests that one can also consider learning new cuisines and experimenting with the presentation. And one of the best ways to do it is to “try recipes from Mexican cuisine as it shares many ingredients with ours. You can try your hand at a Phulka Taco or look at Lebanese and Greek dishes for healthy food inspirations. Use your imagination to try plating the Indian food differently.”

Go the healthy way

Executive chef, Jayanandan Bhaskar, Onkourse at Karma Lakelands, Gurugram, says that while a little indulgence in snacks at home is fine, one shouldn’t be overdoing it, especially now. He says, “We should opt for healthy eating in the times like these when we are not stepping out and there is less physical activity. We should consume lots of fruits and can also be creative and make fruit jams which can be consumed with paranthas or pancakes. We should also increase the intake of raw vegetables and dry fruits soaked in water since they help boost our immunity. Including some sort of physical activity in our daily routine like skipping, yoga or anything that you like is another healthy practice.”

Vikas believes that it is also important not to be repetitive when it comes to food. He says, “It is very important to keep our palate interesting while trying to stay healthy at home. One can make new combinations of salad using different vegetables and dressings, keeping it simple and light. With ample time at hand, it gives us a great opportunity to venture into trying out new recipes and cuisines.”

Chef Lalit Mohan, director, Asian Academy of Culinary Art, suggests that we pay special attention to the diet of the elderly at this time. He says, “The diet of older people must have low-sugar and low-fat foods while including whole grains and lean proteins. This will tend to improve their digestive and overall immune system.”

Vikram Shokeen, junior sous chef, The Ashok, wants us to take a look at the larger picture. He says “It’s a hard time for all of us but look at it as a blessed time, too. It’s a chance for you to have a balanced diet and maintain it while being at home. It’s not important to eat extensively but healthy. We should cutdown on sugar, starch and excess salt, and eat more fibres and whole-grained food. It is good for digestion. Drink lots of water.”

The sustainable way — One-pot meals

Having multiple but mini meals in a day to avoid any overeating and feeling lethargic is the best way out, suggests chef Prem, and at the same time, sustainable. He says, “Since we are less active, physically, we tend to eat more and digest less. Try cooking one-pot meals at this time, which are easy to prepare at one go. You also don’t need to spend a lot of time in the kitchen preparing it. This way, we can save some water too.”

Some blends he suggests are Pasta cooked with homemade dal tadka or tossed in Bhindi fry, Roti cut into strips and mixed with noodles, Payasam with Maggi noodles.

Said Michael Twitty, food historian and author of The Cooking Gene. recently, “‘One-pot’ is an umbrella term for dishes made in a single skillet, sheet pan or roasting pan. For our ancestors, the technique was a favourite because it met essential survival needs. It saved time, water and firewood — the three most important elements to prepare food.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/heal-thyself-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/heal-thyself.html
177,10-4-20,The bar comes home,"Dubai allows home delivery for alcohol as cafes shut down amid virus fears

The Champagne corks no longer pop at Dubai’s infamous alcohol-soaked brunches. The blaring flat-screen TVs stand silent in the sheikhdom’s sports bars. And the city-state’s pubs have shrink-wrapped their now-idle beer taps.

This skyscraper-studded desert metropolis on the Arabian Peninsula has long been one of the wettest places in the Mideast in terms of alcohol consumption, its bars and licensed restaurants serving tourists, travellers and its vast population of foreign workers.

Up until the global Coronavirus pandemic, that is. With the virus now threatening a crucial source of tax and general revenue for its rulers, Dubai’s two major alcohol distributors have partnered to offer home delivery of beer, spirits and wine, yet another loosening of social mores in this Islamic city-state.

“Luxury hotels and bars have been the worse impacted within the sector and this had a direct impact on the alcohol consumption... in the UAE,” said Rabia Yasmeen, an analyst for a market research firm.

Maritime and Mercantile International, a subsidiary of the government-owned Emirates airline known as MMI, and African & Eastern, partnered to create the website offering home delivery. Its products range from a $530 bottle of Don Julio 1942 Tequila to a $4.30 bottle of Indian blended whiskey, with beers and wines in between.

Their website legalhomedelivery.com, a nod toward the online bootleggers long operating in the gray margins of Dubai, describes the service as needed “in these unprecedented times.”

Tourists, the few remaining here, can use their passports to buy the alcohol. Residents, however, need an alcohol license, a plastic red card issued by Dubai police that requires annual renewal. Only non-Muslims 21 and older can apply for a license — though bartenders across the city never check for them before pouring drinks. Text-message alerts give imbibers a predicted delivery time within a few hours. The delivery crew shows up wearing masks and disposable gloves.

“We are in the early days of the service and interest has been high already,” Mike Glen, MMI’s managing director for the UAE & Oman said. However, there are no sales statistics currently available.

A push to keep alcohol shops open during the pandemic may be surprising to some, especially as drinking is illegal in the neighbouring emirate of Sharjah and the nations of Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. But alcohol sales long have been a canary in the coal mine — or in this case, the cocktail lounge — for the wider economy of Dubai, one of seven sheikhdoms in the UAE.

There’s a 50 per cent import tax on a bottle of alcohol, as well as an additional 30 per cent tax in Dubai on buying from liquor stores. Dubai Duty Free, which is also government owned, sold nine million cans of beer, 3.1 million whiskey bottles and 1.5 million bottles of wine to those passing through airport terminals in 2019. Duty-free sales, while limited, never require an alcohol license.

Even before the pandemic, lower global energy prices, a 30 per cent drop in the city’s real estate market value and trade war fears have seen employers shed jobs. Dubai now is trying to postpone its Expo 2020, or world’s fair, to next year, another major blow.

The lower sales of alcohol affect everyone from waitresses to Dubai’s ruling Al Maktoum family, which has worked over decades to make the city a major tourist destination, home to the world’s tallest building. Also, most bars in Dubai are attached to hotels.

The home service charges 50 dirhams ($13.60) per delivery. That’s additional revenue for the stores, even as bars and restaurants remain closed. While some aid groups have sprung up to offer help to out-of-work bartenders elsewhere, there’s been no similar measure here in the UAE, whose waitstaff comes from all across the world.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-bar-comes-home-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-bar-comes-home.html
178,10-4-20,Kapil rejects Akhtar's proposal for India-Pak series,"The legendary Kapil Dev on Thursday slammed Shoaib Akhtar’s idea of a made-for-television three-match ODI series between India and Pakistan to raise funds for the COVID-19 pandemic, saying “India doesn’t need the money” and it is not worth risking lives for a cricket match.

Akhtar on Wednesday proposed a closed-door series to jointly raise funds to fight the deadly virus both in India and Pakistan. Dev said the proposal is not feasible.

“He is entitled to his opinion but we don’t need to raise the money. We have enough. For us, what is important right now is that how our authorities work together to deal with this crisis. I am still seeing a lot of blame game on television from the politicians and that needs to stop,” Dev said.

“Anyway, the BCCI has donated a hefty amount (Rs 51 crore) for the cause and is in a position to donate much more if the need arises. It doesn’t need to raise funds.

“The situation is unlikely to get normal anytime soon and organising a cricket game means putting our cricketers at risk which we don’t need to,” said the World Cup-winning former captain.

Dev said cricket should not even matter for at least the next six months.

“It is just not worth the risk. And how much money can you make from three games? In my view, you can’t even think of cricket for the next five to six months,” he said.

Dev said the focus, at the moment, should only be on saving lives and taking care of the poor who are struggling to make ends meet in a lockdown situation.

“Cricket will resume when things get normal. The game can’t be bigger than the country. The pressing issue is to look after the poor, the hospital workers, the police and all other people who are on the frontline of this war,” said the 61-year-old.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/kapil-rejects-akhtar-s-proposal-for-india-pak-series.html
179,10-4-20,Aussies were out of control well before ball-tampering scandal: Gould,"Australian cricketers had gone “out of control” and turned “pretty average people” two-three years before the ball-tampering scandal, says former ICC Elite Panel umpire Ian Gould, who was the TV official in the infamous Cape Town Test of 2018.

Gould, who retired after last year’s World Cup, relayed what had been spotted on the TV — Cameron Bancroft putting sandpaper down his trousers — to the on-field umpires.

“If you look back on it now, Australia were out of control probably two years, maybe three years, before that, but not in this sense. Maybe — behavioural, chatty, being pretty average people,” Gould told the Daily Telegraph while promoting his autobiography Gunner — My Life in Cricket.

The fallout of the Newlands Test was huge.

Then captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were slapped with a one-year international ban while Bancroft was suspended for nine months by Cricket Australia for their role in the scandal. It also prompted a cultural review into Australian cricket.

“... I didn’t realise what the repercussions would be,” Gould said.

“But when it came into my earpiece I didn’t think the prime minister of Australia was going to come tumbling down on these three guys. All I thought was — Jesus, how do I put this out to the guys on the field without making it an overreaction.

“It was a bit like on Mastermind when the light is on top of you and you’re going — oh dear, how do I talk through this?”

Ball-tampering was classed as a level two offence under the ICC Code of Conduct, but it has since been elevated to a level three category, which carries a ban of up to six Tests or 12 ODIs.

Gould admitted he couldn’t quite believe what he was seeing on TV, but said what came out of it was good for the game, especially Australian cricket.

“When the director said, ‘He’s put something down the front of his trousers,’ I started giggling, because that didn’t sound quite right. Obviously, what’s come from it is for the betterment of Australian cricket — and cricket generally,” he observed.

Gould said that he still has the balls that were used in the Newlands Test.

“If you saw the balls, you would get it completely wrong. At the end of the day, the sandpaper didn’t get on that ball.

“They were working to get the ball to be pristine. Once they’d got one side bigger and shinier, that’s when the sandpaper was coming in.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aussies-were-out-of-control-well-before-ball-tampering-scandal--gould.html
180,10-4-20,Labbadia succeeds Klinsmann at Hertha,"Bruno Labbadia will succeed Jurgen Klinsmann as head coach of Hertha Berlin, the Bundesliga club announced on Thursday, confirming earlier reports in the German media.

181,10-4-20,Ramping up testing in UP can be lifesaver: Priyanka to Yogi,"Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has called for ramping up testing facilities to check coronavirus in Uttar Pradesh, saying it can prove to be a lifesaver in the big state.

In a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, she called for steps that could win over the confidence of everyone by creating a fear-free atmosphere, while keeping aside political ideology, to ensure that people come up voluntarily for testing.

""We are with you in this fight against the pandemic. Coronavirus does not see any religion or caste and affects everyone. In this battle, there is need to take steps by keeping our political ideologies away and help bring people together and create a fear-free atmosphere,"" she said in her letter.

Stressing on the need for ramping up testing facilities, she said for a state with such a big population ""increasing testing can prove to be a lifesaver"".

She said state authorities have to conduct testing on more and more people, on ""mild to moderate high risk cases"" and treat them on a war footing so that there is less pressure on ICUs.

The Congress leader also called up creation of more isolation wards and quarantine centres soon.

She said with reports of community transmission coming from some parts and clusters in urban areas are being formed, she said there are also reports about COVID infected people hiding their disease.

""This is happening because of fear mongering in the society about this disease. Hence it is important, especially in these clusters to provide right information on a war footing in these areas and immediately stop fake news and myths about the coronavirus,"" she said in her letter.

She also called for taking such steps that people win the confidence of the government and come forward to get testing done voluntarily.

""It is important that the government takes such steps to inspire confidence of people so that they come up voluntarily for testing,"" she said, while also calling for seeking the help of NGOs and social and political organisations to unitedly fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Making a host of suggestions in her letter to UP CM, the Congress general secretary for Uttar Pradesh also called for improving sanitation facilities and provision of free ration to the poor and the marginalised.

184,10-4-20,"Govt decides to export surplus hydroxychloroquine, says there is buffer stock for India","Amid concerns over the export of hydroxychloroquine, which is being seen as a drug that may counter coronavirus, the government on Friday said India has received requests from several nations for the medicine and a decision has been taken to export the surplus drug, while keeping a sufficient buffer of stocks for the country.

Addressing a briefing, MEA Additional Secretary Dammu Ravi, who is also the COVID-19 coordinator, said that hydroxychloroquine is in high demand globally and a decision for exporting the drug to the first list of countries which put in a request has been approved.

""Several countries made requests for this particular drug. Taking into view the domestic stocks available and keeping sufficient buffer for our own requirement, a decision was taken by GoM to release some surplus medicines for export purposes. The first batch for the list of countries have been approved and the products have started to leave. I want to emphasis that the domestic requirement and necessity will be a priority for the government,"" Ravi said.

Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Health Lav Agarwal said that India has a stock of 3.28 crore tablets of hydroxychloroquine, which is three time more than the projected requirement of one crore tablets in the country for the coming week and that tie-ups have been made for additional supply of 2 to 3 crore tablets for the future need.

""Based on our projected requirement, we need one crore tablets of hydroxychloroquin for the coming one week, while we have 3.28 crore tablets with us today. So we have more than 3 times supply relative to the domestic requirement.

""Domestic requirement and production of hydroxychloroquin has been 100 per cent ensured, not even for today but for coming times as well. Also, two crore tablets have been sent to states to ensure their availability in the private sector,"" Agarwal said assuring there is no shortage of the medicine in the country.

The ICMR has recommended the use of drug as a preventive medication to healthcare workers and household contacts looking after a positive case . Besides, the Union Health Ministry has also recommended use of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin on those severely suffering from COVID-19 who require ICU management.

India has decided to partially lift the ban on export of paracetamol and anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine in sync with its global commitment to deal with the coronavirus pandemic and allowed the export of hydroxychloroquine to the US, which has emerged as the global hotspot of COVID-19, on Tuesday.

On March 25, India banned export of hydroxychloroquine in the midst of views in some quarters that the drug could be used to fight COVID-19. India is the largest exporter of the drug.

Hydroxychloroquine is an old and inexpensive drug used to treat malaria. India is the largest producer of the drug globally.

186,10-4-20,Modi govt should talk to US to prevent job losses of Indians holding H-1B visa,"The Congress on Friday urged the Modi government to talk to the Trump administration to prevent job losses of Indians holding H-1B visa due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said after compromising the ""India First"" policy in the HCQ drug climb-down, the government is again failing to secure the safety and livelihood of Indians in the US.

""Time for the prime minister to ensure that our soft power of 'Namaste Trump' converts into fair treatment of H-1B visa holders in the US,"" Surjewala said, noting that the US has put Americans on a temporary paid leave or allowed them to work for reduced hours in the wake of the pandemic.

But ""the sword of H-1B visa job terminations"" looms large over an estimated 75,000 Indians, with the United States giving them only a 60-day period to find a new job in case of a lay off, he said.

""Time for the prime minister to rise to the occasion. We demand that the Modi government ensure the extension of post-job loss limit of H-1B Visa holder Indians to 180 days,"" Surjewala said.

He said this will give them sufficient time to find another job when the situation improves.

""Modi government should also ensure that H-1B visa holders, who lost their jobs, are covered for COVID-19 and other health insurance free of cost, including extending support to their families,"" he said in a statement.

The Congress leader said the party also demands that the Modi government deliberate with Indian industry confederations like NASSCOM, CII, and FICCI to prevent further H-1B job losses.

He said there are 309,986 Indians working on H-1B visa in the US, and given the COVID-19 lockdown in the two countries, it is logistically impossible for them to return to India.

He said nearly 60,000 H-1B visas are generally granted to Indians each year which have already been on a steady decline for a few years whereas the rejection rate has gone up to as high as 53 pc for some top IT companies, who contribute 8 per cent to the GDP.

The economic slowdown is becoming ""more and more extreme"" during lockdown, he said.

Surjewala alleged that most organisations are even considering to terminate the contract unless the Modi government and the Trump administration find a solution.

This, he said, has to be taken-up on war footing as post-termination they would have 60 days to find a job, which seems bleak in these challenging times.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/modi-govt-should-talk-to-us-to-prevent-job-losses-of-indians-holding-h-1b-visa-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/modi-govt-should-talk-to-us-to-prevent-job-losses-of-indians-holding-h-1b-visa.html

188,10-4-20,"Avoid fights with Kohli to keep him quiet, not to save IPL contracts: Paine","The Australian cricket team avoids provoking “any fight” with Virat Kohli, concedes Test skipper Tim Paine but he also asserts that it’s a strategy to keep the Indian captain’s bat quiet, not a ploy to save IPL contracts, as claimed by his predecessor Michael Clarke.

Paine rejected Clarke’s claims that there was a phase in Australian cricket when the side “sucked up” to Kohli to land fat deals with IPL franchises.

“I certainly didn’t notice too many people being that nice to Virat or not trying to get him out or anything like that,” Paine told ESPNCricinfo.

“I’m not sure who was going easy on him; we certainly had a thing where we didn’t want to provoke any fight with him because we think that’s when he plays at his best,” he said.

India are scheduled to tour Australia from October, 2020 to January, 2021 to play four Tests, three ODIs and three T20 matches.

“Who knows what will happen this series and, as we saw in the documentary, there was still quite a lot of heat in some of those games. I certainly wasn’t holding back, but again the IPL’s not a huge draw for me at the moment, so I had nothing to lose,” Paine said.

“But anytime our guys go out and play a Test match for Australia, they’ll be giving their absolute all and I’m pretty sure they’re not thinking about an IPL contract when they’re running in, bowling to Virat.”

In November, 2018, Clarke had slammed attempts to improve Australian cricket’s image owing to the infamous ball-tampering scandal, saying the national team “won’t win a game” by “worrying about being liked”.

Paine said verbal wars cannot win matches unless one displays the requisite skills on the field.

“What you say on the field is irrelevant 99 per cent of the time,” Paine said. “Sometimes you can get a little inside someone’s head or something like that, but if you’re not batting well and not bowling well, all the talk in the world doesn’t mean anything,” he said.

Rejecting a one-size-fits-all kind of approach to planning, Paine said strategy has to formulated keeping the opposition’s strengths in mind.

“There’s no doubt our first focus is on executing our skill and being as good as we can possibly be in that area and then sometimes things happen on a cricket field and you’ve got to go in, you’ve got to change your tack, or you’ve got to have a few words.

“As we’ve seen the last 12 or 18 months, we still do that, we still stick up for each other, we still fight as hard as any Australian team, but we’ve probably just had to move with the times and I’ve been really proud of the way we’ve played out cricket,” he explained.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/avoid-fights-with-kohli-to-keep-him-quiet--not-to-save-ipl-contracts--paine-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/avoid-fights-with-kohli-to-keep-him-quiet--not-to-save-ipl-contracts--paine.html

AEK Athens lead Aris Thessaloniki 2-1 before their return match which had been planed for a day earlier.

A ban on sporting activities as part of a nationwide lockdown is in force until at least April 27.

Meanwhile, sports undersecretary Lefteris Avgenakis called on professional football, basketball and volleyball teams to give free season tickets to doctors and nursing staff in the public health system who are battling against the virus.

""This is a minimal sample of respect to their sacrifices in the front line of our country's fight against the coronavirus amid serious difficulties and risks, even for their lives,"" Avgenakis said.

190,10-4-20,Cummins willing to play IPL behind closed doors,"The costliest foreign player in Indian Premier League, Pat Cummins says he would be willing to play in the T20 event without fans as it would help bring a sense of normality in a world ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The IPL was originally scheduled to start on March 29 in Mumbai but it was postponed to April 15 due to the worsening pandemic which has killed more than 95,000 people worldwide.

Asked whether he would support games without fans in a BBC podcast, Cummins said, ""Of course - whatever it takes to try and get cricket up and play those big events safely.""

The 26-year-old Cummins, who became the costliest foreign player in the league after the Kolkata Knight Riders picked him up for a whooping Rs 15.5 crore last December at the auction, said he is ""super hopeful"" the league will be held though he would be ""surprised if it happened soon"".

""They scream every single ball whether it's a six or a wicket - it's the same noise every ball - so that atmosphere is something that we love about playing in India,"" he said.

""It will be missed in the short term if it can't happen, but I have no doubt it will be a great event even if it has to be played without crowds.""

The Australian pace spearhead, however, reiterated that the main priority is the health and safety of the people.

""The first priority is safety but the second one is getting back to normality, finding that balance. If that unfortunately means no crowds for a while, then that is that, but hopefully people can watch at home on TV,"" he said.

""It would have a totally different feel about it. When people ask about the difference between playing cricket in India the first thing is the crowd,"" he added.

The deadly contagion, which has infected more than 1.6 million people globally, has forced countries, including India, to go under lockdown in their bid to stop the spread of the disease.

191,10-4-20,"BCCI clears dues of contracted players, says won't let anyone suffer in tough times","The BCCI has cleared the quarterly dues of all its centrally-contracted cricketers and vowed not to let anyone suffer despite the uncertainty triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused financial blowback in other countries.

The global economy has been badly hit due to the virus, which has claimed over 95,000 lives so far. Major cricket boards like England and Australia have indicated that players will have to take pay cuts.

""Despite lockdown being announced from March 24, the BCCI was ready for any kind of eventuality. The board clears quarterly installments of central contract payments to its players,"" a BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

""Plus the match fees of all those who played for India and India A during this period, all these dues were cleared at the end of the financial year,"" he added.

The England and Australian players have admitted openly that they are bracing up for pay cuts.

The announcement of central contracts has been postponed in Australia, while England skipper Joe Root has applied for furlough along with his Yorkshire teammates.

Under the furlough scheme, the British government pays 80 per cent of wages -- up to GBP 2,500 -- per month.

A BCCI official said that the Board's financial stability helps in testing times when some of the other boards are struggling to even pay their domestic players.

""One cricket board has put its players on furlough (government assistance scheme). There are talks about pay cuts everywhere. But I believe BCCI is capable of taking good care of its players as it has been all these years.

""Neither our international nor our domestic cricketers will suffer,"" the official said.

He, however, agreed that having the IPL later this year is a necessity considering the amount of financial loss that all stakeholders will have to bear if the event does not go ahead.

""The situation is fluid right now. It can't be said that it will be September when Asia Cup and home series against England is scheduled or October, when World T20 is supposed to take place.

""If you don't know when normalcy will return, how can you say that when will IPL happen,"" he said.

Also, another issue to deal with for the BCCI would be domestic cricket scheduling.

As per rules, domestic events cannot coincide with IPL.

IPL in October and November might mean that the domestic cricket calendar will have to be shifted further.

The BCCI normally chalks out its domestic calendar in August but all depends on when the IPL is scheduled.

The majority of top football leagues and international competitions have been suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

Infantino insisted that games would not resume until it was safe.

""Our first priority, our principle, the one we will use for our competitions and encourage everyone to follow is that health comes first,"" he said in a video message.

""I cannot stress this enough. No match, no competition, no league is worth risking a single human life."" The German Bundesliga reportedly could restart behind closed doors in May, with players already back in training, while other leagues could also resume in the summer.

""It would be more than irresponsible to force competitions to resume if things are not 100% safe,"" added Infantino.

""If we have to wait a little longer we must do so. It's better to wait a little bit longer than to take any risks."" Infantino said that national football associations which are struggling financially would receive help from FIFA's emergency relief fund.

FIFA last week postponed all international matches scheduled for June. ""We are today in a very strong financial situation,"" Infantino said.

194,10-4-20,PM to interact with CMs on Saturday; extension of lockdown on agenda,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will interact with chief ministers of all states on Saturday via video, where a call would be taken on whether the 21-day lockdown to check spread of coronavirus, ending next week, should be extended.

The video conference comes amidst indications that the central government may extend the lockdown across the country beyond April 14 after several states have favoured the extension to contain the fast-spreading virus.

Addressing floor leaders of various parties who have representation in Parliament, on Wednesday, Prime Minister Modi had made it clear that the lockdown cannot be lifted in one go on April 14, asserting that the priority of his government is to ""save each and every life"".

According to an official statement, he said states, district administrations and experts have suggested extension of the lockdown to contain the spread of the virus.

Odisha has taken a lead and has extended the lockdown till April 30.

""Prime Minister Modi made it clear that lockdown is not being lifted and also that the life pre-corona and post-corona will not be same,"" Biju Janata Dal leader Pinaki Misra had told PTI after Wednesday's interaction.

This is for the second time the prime minister will interact with the chief ministers via video link after the lockdown was imposed.

During his April 2 interaction with chief ministers, Modi had pitched for a ""staggered"" exit from the ongoing lockdown.

Before the lockdown was announced on March 24, the prime minister had interacted with the chief ministers on March 20 to discuss means to check the spread of the deadly virus.

According to a Health Ministry update this morning, the death toll due to COVID-19 has risen to 199 in India. The total number of coronavirus positive cases have climbed to 6,412.

195,10-4-20,"COVID-19 cases cross 7,000 across India; Govts gear up for extending lockdown with some possible relaxations","The nationwide tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases crossed 7,000 on Friday with at least 236 deaths as several places including Delhi and Mumbai reported further spread of the deadly virus and Punjab became the second state to extend the lockdown till April 30, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi meets chief ministers to take stock of the situation.

The Union Home Ministry also sought views of state governments on the 21-day lockdown including whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials said on Friday, amidst indications of a possible two-week extension of the nationwide restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus.

The Health Ministry in the meantime maintained that no community transmission is taking place as yet in India, while the World Health Organisation also put the country in a category named 'cluster of cases' -- a notch below the community transmission stage and a classification used by the global body for cases ""clustered in time, geographic location and/or by common exposures"".

While several states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jammu & Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh reported rising number of cases, the Union Health Ministry said the rate of people testing positive was only 0.2 per cent on Thursday when more than 16,000 samples were tested. Cumulatively close to 1.5 lakh samples have been tested so far across India.

A PTI tally of numbers reported by various states as on 7 PM showed a total of 7,049 having been affected by the virus nationwide so far with at least 236 deaths. More than 650 have been cured and discharged.

However, the evening update from the Union Health Ministry put the number of confirmed infections at 6,761 and the death toll at 206.

Maharashtra has reported the maximum 1,385 cases, including close to 1,000 in Mumbai itself, while at least 97 people have died in the state. Tamil Nadu has over 900 caes, Delhi has more than 700 cases and Rajasthan has over 500, while Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have reported more than 400 positive cases each.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh, however, said most of the 27 positive cases reported in his state on Thursday -- the maximum daily increase for the state -- were those of secondary transmission and expressed apprehension that the state may be entering the community transmission stage of the outbreak.

A day after Odisha decided to extend the lockdown till April 30, Punjab also did the same on Friday, while a decision by the central government on the nationwide lockdown, which entered its 17th day, is expected after Modi's interaction with all chief ministers on Saturday.

In Tamil Nadu, an expert committee recommended to Chief Minister K Palaniswami that the lockdown be extended by two weeks beyond April 14 considering the rise in number of cases.

A review meeting was also held by the Prime Minister's Office during the day on various efforts to check the coronavirus spread, which also discussed ramping up of production of personal protective equipments (PPEs) among other issues.

The Home Ministry, separately, has sought views of state governments on the 21-day lockdown, scheduled to end on April 14, including whether more categories of people and services need to be exempted, officials said on Friday.

Some of the suggestions made by state governments include allowing construction-related activities in rural areas.

The central government, while imposing the lockdown, had announced that shops dealing in essential commodities, including the online platforms, will remain open, besides services like health, sanitation, police, media, agriculture and banking. Movements of essential and non-essential cargos were also allowed by the government, but there have been reports about disruptions in the supply chain due to lack of labourers and trucks, among other issues.

There have also been reports of depleting levels of essential goods from various parts of the country.

Some states such as Kerala have suggested phased opening of the lockdown, while other suggestions from various states include allowing liquor sale to shore up the revenues and to allow private vehicles on an odd-even basis. However, most states have suggested keeping the public road transport, rail and airline services suspended for more time. Many have also recommended keeping state borders sealed, except for goods movement.

A few states have also suggested area-specific lockdown with stricter restrictions, which are as such being followed in the places identified as hotspots of the virus spread.

In the meantime, more states including Odisha and Telangana made it mandatory for people to wear masks or face covers at public places, while enforcement was beefed up for action against those violating the lockdown conditions.

The Centre also asked states not to allow religious gatherings and processions.

Government officials also said that a decision on bringing Indians from abroad will be taken at a later stage after reviewing the COVID-19 situation.

Globally, more than 16 lakh have tested positive for this deadly virus ever since it was first noticed in China last December, while the worldwide death toll has crossed 96,000. While more than 15,000 have died in the US alone, France has also reported over 12,000 deaths.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-cases-cross-7-000-across-india--govts-gear-up-for-extending--lockdown-with-some-possible-relaxations-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/covid-19-cases-cross-7-000-across-india--govts-gear-up-for-extending--lockdown-with-some-possible-relaxations.html

198,10-4-20,Drinking green tea may help treat food allergies,"If you are a tea lover, there is good news as researchers have revealed that consuming green tea can help combat food allergies. A food allergy occurs when your immune system over reacts to a food or a substance in a food. The study, published in the journal Frontiers in Immunology, found that drinking green tea increases the abundance of gut bacteria that helps suppress allergic immune responses.

For the findings, the research team at the Shinshu University in Japan looked at green tea and the abundance of Flavonifractor plautii (FP) bacteria found in the gut. FP has been reported to be a part of the catechin metabolism in the intestines. Catechin is an antioxidant found in a variety of foods, including green tea, of which 30 to 42 per cent of its dry weight is catechin. The researchers found that oral administration of FP strongly suppresses the Th2 immune response to food allergies in vivo.

The food we eat effects the complex cocktail of different strains of bacteria in the gut, they said.

Drinking green tea increases the abundance of FP (Flavonifractor plautii) which suppresses the Th2 immune response. FP is a strain of the Clostridia family of bacteria, which is known to have effects on the immune system, notably inhibiting inflammation.

According to the study, some clostridia strains show promise of lowering blood pressure and some are known to be abundant in lean people and not in heavier people, leading researchers to believe they can be used to regulate weight. However, the researchers noted that more studies are needed to look into the safety of FP before it can be used as a probiotic to treat allergies.

200,10-4-20,"China reports 42 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, 47 asymptomatic infections","China has reported 42 new coronavirus cases, including 38 imported infections, taking the total tally to 81,907, health officials said on Friday, as the country started a new trial of re-testing the recovered COVID-19 patients amid heightened concern of a rebound of the deadly disease.

The Chinese health authority on Friday also said that 47 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, including 14 from abroad, were also reported in the mainland.

China's National Health Commission (NHC) on Friday said 42 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported, including 38 imported cases on Thursday.

Four new domestically transmitted cases were reported, with three in Guangdong Province and one in Heilongjiang Province, it said.

As the new infections continue to increase, China on Thursday unveiled a new trial protocol warranting re-testing of the recovered coronavirus patients besides intensifying the screening of asymptomatic cases as concerns grew over a second wave of the infections in the country.

The move comes a day after China lifted the 76-day lockdown in Wuhan, where the pandemic originated.

One death was reported in coronavirus epicentre Hubei Province taking the overall death toll in the country to 3,336, while the overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 81,907 by Thursday. This includes 77,455 patients who were discharged after treatment.

The NHC said 1,097 asymptomatic cases, including 349 from abroad, were still under medical observation.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat but they are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others, according to a new official notification.

By Thursday, 973 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in the Macao and 380 in Taiwan including five deaths.

The new trial protocol on recovered COVID-19 patients included return visits by doctors, re-testing and their health monitoring.

As of Thursday 77,455 patients were discharged after treatment, most of them were from Wuhan and Hubei province which bore the brunt of the virus.

According to the protocol, recovered COVID-19 patients should stay in quarantine for 14 days either at home or in an isolation centre for medical observation, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

During the isolation period, those having recovered from the disease should take their temperatures daily and be on the lookout for fever and respiratory symptoms, including cough and breathing difficulties, the protocol said.

Designated hospitals should make plans for patients' return visits and re-testing for the next two to four weeks following their discharge, it said, adding that sputum samples are more reliable and should be the first choice for re-testing.

201,10-4-20,"Coronavirus death toll crosses 16,000 in US, infected cases surge past 460,000","The coronavirus pandemic has claimed over 16,000 lives and infected over 460,000 people in the US, devastating the country's economy and rendering a record 16 million workers jobless in just three weeks.

Of this, the New York metropolitan area, comprising the adjoining New Jersey and Connecticut, alone account for more than 9,000 and 220,000 cases respectively.

Globally, over 1.5 million people have been infected so far by the coronavirus and the fatalities stands at nearly 95,000.

The United States accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the all the COVID-19 positive cases and over 17 per cent of all fatalities.

By Thursday, nearly all of America -- 97 per cent of the 220 million population -- are under stay-at-home order. President Donald Trump has notified major disaster declaration for almost all the 50 States.

In New York City, which is considered the financial capital of the world and has one of the best health facilities, more than 800 deaths were reported in one day alone, taking the fatalities to a record 7,067.

New York Governor Andrew Cumo, however, asserted that COVID-19 now appears to have reached its peak in the city, where the number of new patients to hospitals have started coming down.

Strict enforcement of mitigation measures including maintaining social distancing, he said, is having an impact nationwide.

""As such they now are projecting far less death -- around 60,000 -- due to coronavirus than earlier projections of between one and two lakhs,"" he said.

It looks like we're at the lower end of the curb in terms of death, which is a terrible word... a terrible, dark word that we've experienced like nobody's ever seen before in this country. We have numbers that are terrible, Trump told reporters during his daily White House press conference on coronavirus.

It is, in the sense of deaths, a bad week. In fact, every day there seems to be a record number of deaths compared to the day before. In fact, New York today had again another record of -- I think the city itself had about 820-plus deaths, said Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a lead member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.

At the same time as we are seeing the increase in deaths, we are seeing rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalizations like I think yesterday was something like 200 new hospitalizations and it's been as high as 1,400 at any given time. So that is going in the right direction, Fauci said.

The deadly disease, which has forced people to stay standstill, has brought the American economy to standstill.

The air flight traffic has dropped by 96 percent and in just three weeks alone 6.6 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits, a figure which reflects on the dire straight of the US economy.

The latest unemployment figures reflect that the USD 2 trillion relief package has not worked so far.

But Trump exuded confidence that the economy is going to bounce back in the coming months.

I think the economy is going to do very well... i think our country, from an economic standpoint, will end up being stronger than ever. We have tremendous stimulus. We have tremendous stimulus plans. We have things in the works that are going to really, I think, fire the country, he asserted.

What's going to happen is we're going to have a big bounce rather than a small balance. But we will be back and I think, honestly, I think our country is going to be back from an economic standpoint, he said in response to a question.

In an interview webcast by the Brookings Institute, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the country needs to have a plan nationally for reopening the economy.

We all want it to happen as quickly as possible, he said.

In an interview to CNBC, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the economy could be ready to reopen by the end of May as soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues.

We are going to be opening up weekend opening very, very, very, very soon I hope. Together our people are writing one of the most noble chapters in the proud history of our nation, Trump told reporters at the White House.

""We will only beat this epidemic together. The first signs of a slowing seen this evening are because of your good will.. and I thank you,"" he said.

But he also cautioned: ""If we can hope to have reached a plateau, it is a very high plateau and we need to stay extremely cautious.""

The new death toll meant that 412 people had died in hospital over the last 24 hours, also down from 541 the day earlier. There had been no data from nursing homes on Wednesday due to a technical fault.

The country now has a total of 86,334 confirmed cases, although officials warn many cases are not tested. A doctors' union said more than 1.6 million of France's 67 million people may have been infected with the new coronavirus to date.

France has been in lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the spread of the epidemic, with only essential trips allowed that must be justified with a signed piece of paper.

204,10-4-20,Rs 15K-cr 5-yr Central Covid plan in place’,"Funds will be divided among all States, UTs to ramp up infra

The Government on Thursday geared up for a long battle against coronavirus and put in place a five-year Rs 15,000-crore plan to ramp up its health infrastructure to deal with the crisis.

This will be 100 per cent Centrally-funded scheme to strengthen national and State-level health systems. The COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package will be implemented in three phases from January 2020 to June 2020, from July 2020 to March 2021 and from April 2021 to March 2024. This fund will be divided among all States and Union Territories.

The Central Government aims to arm States with adequate Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, isolation wards, personal protection equipment (PPE) in the first phase of the three-phase funding project from January 2020 to March 2024. The fund will be utilised for immediate COVID-19 Emergency Response (amount of Rs 7,774 crores) and rest for medium-term support (1-4 years) to be provided under mission mode approach.

“The project will be implemented with the objectives of emergency COVID-19 response, strengthening national and State systems, procurement of essential medical equipment and drugs, strengthening of surveillance including setting up of laboratories and bio-security preparedness,” the Health Ministry said in a letter to the States and UTs.

The letter stated that the Union Ministry will release the funds immediately for the implementation of the plan.

The Union Health Ministry has already disbursed Rs 4,113 crore to all the States and UTs for dealing with the emergency COVID response. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had late last month said that it will be used for treating coronavirus patients and strengthening the medical infrastructure such as rapidly ramping up the number of corona testing facilities, PPE, isolation beds, ICU beds, ventilators and other essential equipment.

On its part, the Centre on Thursday said that there were enough PPEs and Hydroxychloroquine tablets in India. Addressing the daily presser, Health Ministry’s Joint Secretary Lav Aggarwal said the fear around the dearth of PPEs was unfounded and misguided.

He said contrary to popular belief, PPE does not only mean overall covers, “It’s a mix of components. Only in high-risk areas, the whole component is used while in other places, N95 masks and gloves were sufficient.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/rs-15k-cr-5-yr-central-covid-plan-in-place----2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/rs-15k-cr-5-yr-central-covid-plan-in-place---.html
205,10-4-20,"After panic, sealed areas come to terms","Following the complete restrictions on the movement in hotspots across the national Capital to stop the COVID-19 spread, the residents in these areas found it difficult to get essential items such as milk, vegetable and other household commodities.

As the Delhi Police increased its vigil across the 21 hotspots in the city since Wednesday night, there was chaos like situation, before people could really come to terms with the fact that they are not supposed to venture out of their homes under any circumstances. However after the initial panic, it seems the people realised that this the new normal for a few days.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday announced “Operation SHIELD” in 21 containment zones and warned of strict action against those misbehaving with healthcare personnel in the city.

The CM appealed to people living in containment areas to cooperate in implementing “Operation SHIELD” and said these are strict measures but are necessary to protect them and others from COVID-19.

During the day, police teams through public announcement (PA) system urged people to stay indoors and follow the orders.

When contacted, the residents said they were looking forward to a relaxation of the lockdown next week but were taken by surprise when they came to know that their localities have been completely sealed.

Many people having pets could not even take them out for walks. Rajesh, who has a labrador, said his pet has been restless since morning. “At most, I can allow him to go till the balcony but that is not enough for him,” he said.

“People queued up outside the store inside the society to buy milk. Initially, while standing in the queue, they maintained a safe distance but later it all went for a toss. Seeing the situation, it was later announced that the essential products will be delivered at their doorstep but that too was delayed,” said a resident of Gandhi Park in Malviya Nagar.

As panic gripped, residents of apartment buildings in Mayur Vihar extension where Vardhman apartment was sealed, said they have now stocked essentials for two days but if it extends they will be not able to cope with the situation as several residents in the society complained about delay is delivery of essentials for 5 to 6 hours.

Elaborating the operation during an online briefing, Kejriwal said under the first ‘S’ of the operation, the Government seals the area immediately and its surroundings after geographical marking following positive cases there.

“In the next stage, we put people of sealed areas under home quarantine and then in the third stage, the process begins to isolate those who have symptoms of COVID-19 and trace their contacts,” he said.

About ‘E’ character of ‘Operation SHIELD’, Kejriwal explained that the Government ensures home-delivery of essential items.

“After this stage, the Government sanitises such areas where one or two positive cases have been found.

“Under ‘D’, checking of door-to-door houses is conducted to ascertain whether anybody in containment has cough or any other symptoms of COVID-19,” the Chief Minister also said.

Talking about the incident of assault on two women resident doctors of Safdarjung Hospital in Gautam Nagar area, he said the Government will not tolerate such incidents.

“These days, doctors and nurses have been putting their lives in danger by treating COVID-19 patients.

“We will take strictest action against those misbehaving with healthcare personnel,” Kejriwal said.

The warning comes a day after two women resident doctors of Safdarjung Hospital were allegedly assaulted by a 42-year-old man who accused them of “spreading” COVID-19 in Gautam Nagar area.

The CM said on Wednesday, the Government made it compulsory for people to wear masks while stepping out of their houses.

“We understand that people are facing problems, but measures taken by authorities are necessary to contain coronavirus,” he said.

The Government has also cut expenses as tax collection is almost stopped, Kejriwal said, adding that everyone will also have to cut their expenses of their level in view of the current situation.

According to him, the Delhi Government was giving free rations to 71 lakh people in the city.

Meanwhile, South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) carried out a “massive” disinfection drive at various hotspots identified in areas such as Gandhi Park, Malviya Nagar, Sangam Vihar, Shahajahanbad society, Sector-11 Dwarka, Dinpur Village, Markaz Masjid, Nizamuddin Basti, Nizzamuddin West.

A senior SDMC official said the civic body has deployed 10 tankers, eight jetting machines, two fire tenders and 50 sanitation workers are deployed for spraying the disinfectants in these areas. “Nearly 50 kilogram disinfectants solution was sprayed in these areas. All the sanitation workers with power sprayers wearing full body PPE (Hazmat suit) sanitised the identified hotspots,” he said.

“As Nizamuddin Markaz is biggest hotspot, special disinfection drives are being conducted on regular basis. The special squad of 11 sanitation workers are deputed to clean and sanitise the Markaz building and its surrounding areas,” he said, adding that the team included sweeping personal, disinfectant personal, garbage disposal squad and transportation staff.

The official said the Markaz building was also cleaned thoroughly and 200 kg of untreated garbage was collected and dispatched for incineration to waste to energy plant.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/after-panic--sealed-areas-come-to-terms-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/after-panic--sealed-areas-come-to-terms.html
206,10-4-20,Odisha 1st State to extend Covid lockdown by 16 days till April 30,"Odisha has become the first State in the country to extend the 21-day lockdown — which was scheduled to end on April 14 — till April 30 to end the Covid-19 crisis.

The Naveen Patnaik Government on Thursday announced the decision even as the Centre weighs the proposal by many States to expand the duration of the shutdown.

The CM also declared schools and other educational institutions will remain closed till June 17.

“We have decided to extend the lockdown till April 30. We will also recommend to the Government of India to extend the national lockdown up to April 30,” Patnaik said in a video message soon after the Cabinet meeting he held with five senior ministers through video-conferencing.

Odisha has recorded 44 positive cases of coronavirus so far and one death from the disease.

The CM said Odisha reported the first COVID-19 case on March 15 and the number went up to 42 till Wednesday which was not an exponential rise. It was made possible because of the discipline and sacrifice of the people of the state, he said.

Though lockdown period has been extended, Patnaik said activities related to agriculture, animal husbandry and MGNREGS will be facilitated. However, social distancing norms will be followed in all spheres.

Food security, he said, was a major priority for the state and transportation of essential supplies will continue unhindered.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/odisha-1st-state-to-extend-covid-lockdown-by-16-days-till-april-30.html
207,10-4-20,"35 workers crammed in shop, owner booked, Bengali Market sealed","The Delhi Police registered an FIR on Thursday against a pastry shop owner in Bengali Market after 35 workers were found living in “unhygienic conditions” in a small space in the shop, flouting the social distancing order.

The market thereafter was sealed by the authorities as there were fear of coronavirus outbreak among the people.

208,10-4-20,Saudi royal family afflicted with corona,"According to news reports, about 150 members of Saudi Arabia’s royal family have contracted the coronavirus.

Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Abdulziz al Saud, the Governor of Riyadh and a nephew of King Salman, was confirmed to have tested positive by two doctors, a person close to the family told The New York Times.

King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) have retreated into isolation to avoid the outbreak.

Doctors at an elite hospital that treats royals are preparing 500 more beds for an expected influx of patients.

“Directives are to be ready for VIPs from around the country,” the operators of the elite facility, the King Faisal Specialist Hospital, wrote in a “high alert” sent out electronically on Tuesday to senior doctors and later obtained by the Times.

“We don’t know how many cases we will get but high alert,” said the message, which instructed “all chronic patients to be moved out ASAP” and only “top urgent cases” will be accepted, according to the newspaper.

The alert added any infected staff members will now be treated at a less elite hospital to save room for royals.

There are thousands of Saudi princes. Many travel regularly to Europe and some are believed to have contracted the virus abroad and brought it back to Saudi Arabia, the report said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/saudi-royal-family-afflicted-with-corona-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/saudi-royal-family-afflicted-with-corona.html
209,10-4-20,Here kids invoke Dhanvantari to save mankind,"While epidemiologists and micro bacterium specialists are working round-the-clock all over the world to develop a medicine for COVID-19, Veda Patha Shalas (schools teaching Vedas and Upanishads) in Tamil Nadu villages echo with recitation of Dhanvantari mantras (shlokas invoking Lord Dhanvantari, believed to be an incarnation of Lord Mahavishnu) to ward off the disease and save mankind.

Children in the age group of 8-15, who study Vedas in Kumbakonam’s Veda Path Shala in Kathira Mangalam village, wake up early morning, finish their morning ablution and commence reciting the Dhanvantari mantra hundreds of thousands times. More than the songs of the cuckoos, what wakes up the villagers each morning is “Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya Dhanvantarye Amritakalasha Hastaya…” the recitation of the time-tested Dhanvantari mahamantra, the famous shloka from Vedic times.

The shloka is recited by the students of Vedic science and they have only one prayer to make to the Maker: “Save the world and save the lives from this pandemic.”

Not only in Veda Patha Shalas in Tamil Nadu villages but even in far away the United States of America, one can hear the chanting of Dhanvantari mantra. Dr Rekha Sreekanth, paramedical scientist, begins her day reciting the Dhanvantari mantra by joining the deeparadhana in the temple in her native place through facebook daily. “We have facebook live from our temple at deeparadhana time (doesn’t show the sanctum sanctorum) but we have that feeling of visiting the temple and then the priest chants it,” she said over telephone from Houston.

Dr R Krishnamurthi Sastry, Mahamahopadhyaya and a scholar who has been honoured by the President of India, told The Pioneer that Dhanvantari himself is the embodiment of medicine and has the power to remove all diseases. “If children in the age group of 8-15, which is the period of innocence, collectively recite this shloka, it will have the power to remove not only COVID-19 but any disease. Otherwise this ritual would not have been there. Recitation of Dhanvantari mahamantra and Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra have been around for centuries,” said the Mahamahopadhyaya, widely respected scholar in Tamil Nadu.

Yet another proof of the influence of the movement of stars and planets on the well-being of the world was pointed out by Thantric and Vedic scholar Parappanangadi Unnikrishna Panikkar. He quoted from Western publications, especially from a book authored by Barbara Tuchman, the Pulitzer prize winning historian who had found that the Bubonic Plague (1346-1353) which had claimed nearly 200 million people in Eurasia was the fallout of the conjunction of the planets Saturn, Jupiter and Mars in the house of the Aquarius.

“This is not the claim of the author but what was found out by the Medical Faculty of the University of Paris in 1348,” said Panikkar.

“In the year of 1345, on March 20, there was a conjuction of the planets Saturn, Jupiter and Mars in the house of Aquarius. The conjuction of Saturn and Jupiter portends death and disaster. The conjuction of Mars and Jupiter portends pestilence in the air. For Jupiter is warm and humid and draws up evil vapours from earth and water; Mars is hot and dry and kindles the evil into an ineffective fire. We must therefore expect a terrible calamity,” Barbara Tuchman quotes the findings of the medical faculty which probed the reasons for the pandemic in her book A Distant Mirror: The Calamitious 14th Century. The book bagged the 1980 National Book Award in History.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/here-kids-invoke-dhanvantari-to-save-mankind-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/here-kids-invoke-dhanvantari-to-save-mankind.html
210,10-4-20,"Boris Johnson moves out of ICU, 'in extremely good spirits': Govt","British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved out of intensive care as his condition improves, Downing Street said on Thursday evening.

""The Prime Minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Johnson while he is in hospital, had told reporters during the daily briefing that the Prime Minister continues to make positive steps forwards and is in good spirits .

Earlier on Thursday, Downing Street had confirmed that Johnson continues to improve after he spent a third night in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a London hospital with coronavirus.

The 55-year-old was shifted to the ICU of St Thomas' Hospital in London on Monday night as his condition worsened over 10 days after he had tested positive for coronavirus and went into self-isolation. He has since received ""standard oxygen treatment"" but has not been diagnosed with pneumonia or required a ventilator to aid his breathing.

""The Prime Minister had a good night and continues to improve in intensive care at St. Thomas' Hospital. He's in good spirits,"" a Downing Street spokesperson said, providing a health update on the UK PM.

He's stable, improving, sat up and engaged with medical staff. I've known the Prime Minister for a long time and I wish him well in this difficult time and I think things are getting better for him,"" UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said earlier on Thursday.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for the UK PM while he continues treatment for Covid-19, will chair a virtual Cobra emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss a review of the UK's coronavirus lockdown to consider whether the strict social distancing measures should be extended beyond the 21-day period initially announced by Johnson on March 23.

The measures are set to end next Monday but indications are that they would have to be extended.

Welsh health minister Vaughan Gething who will take part in the Cobra meeting said there was ""virtually zero prospect"" of government experts advising that it was safe to lift the lockdown, adding the measures would continue for ""a number of weeks"".

""I think rather than speculate about the future, I think we should focus very seriously on the here and now and the present,"" said Rishi Sunak, the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer who led the daily Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening.

The senior Indian-origin Cabinet minister, who announced a new 750-million pound fund to support frontline charities across the UK through the pandemic, stressed the importance of the British public continuing to follow the government's stay-at-home guidance especially during what is a usual holiday travel period over a long Easter weekend.

Sunak, who is the next in line in the government's chain of command after UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, also gave his own update on the UK PM's health to confirm that he was sitting up in bed and engaging with his clinical team.

""The latest from the hospital is the Prime Minister remains in intensive care where his condition is improving,"" he had said.

The Prime Minister is not only my colleague and my boss but also my friend, and my thoughts are with him and his family,"" he said, adding that the UK PM's illness is a reminder how indiscriminate this disease is .

The coronavirus death toll in the UK registered another record daily jump of 881 fatalities on Thursday to hit 7,978.

Deputy chief scientific adviser, Dame Angela McLean, had said COVID-19 cases were not ""accelerating out of control"" in the country and warned against complacency and breaking the lockdown norms.

212,10-4-20,"'The Batman' not an origin-story, says Matt Reeves","Filmmaker Matt Reeves says his take on classic DC superhero Batman will not venture into the character's roots but at the same, it will ""acknowledge his origins"".

Robert Pattinson is portraying the caped crusader in Reeves' ""The Batman"", which the director has set in the space of mystery noir. He has penned the film's screenplay with Mattson Tomlin.

Talking to Nerdist, the director explained what he is trying to achieve with the character's story in the movie.

""I wanted to do not an origin tale, but a tale that would still acknowledge his origins, in that it formed who he is. Like this guy, he's majorly struggling, and this is how he's trying to rise above that struggle,"" Reeves said.

""But that doesn't mean that he even fully understands, you know. It's that whole idea of the shadow self and what's driving you, and how much of that you can incorporate, and how much of it you're doing that you're unaware of,"" he added.

Reeves said he is trying to explore the psychological and emotional elements of the story. He added that he also wants to show corruption in a place like Gotham as the issue is quite relevant in the current times.

""There's something in there that feels very psychological, very emotional, and it felt like there was a way of exploring that along with the corruption in this place, Gotham. That feels very current. I think it always does.

""There's almost no time when you can't do a story about corruption. But today, it still seems incredibly resonant and maybe, from my perspective, maybe more so than maybe at other time,"" the director said.

""The Batman"" will features a host of stars like Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobblepot/Penguin, Paul Dano as Edward Nashton/The Riddler, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, John Turturro as Carmine Falcone, Peter Sarsgaard as District Attorney Gil Colson, and Andy Serkis as Alfred Pennyworth.

The film has a release date of June 5, 2021.

However, a PTI tally of figures reported by various states as on Thursday late evening showed at least 6,640 cases and 227 deaths.

There has been a lag in the Union Health Ministry figures, compared to the number of cases announced by different states, which officials attribute to procedural delays in assigning the cases to individual states.

217,10-4-20,4 test positive for COVID-19 in Udhampur; cases in J-K climb to 188,"Four people have been confirmed positive for COVID-19 in Udhampur district, taking the total number of cases in Jammu and Kashmir to 188, officials said on Friday.

The four are the contacts of a 61-year-old woman who died of coronavirus on Wednesday, they said.

""Ten tests were received in Udhampur. Out of these, four have turned out positive. They are known contacts of a woman who died of coronavirus at GMC Jammu,"" District Magistrate, Udhampur, Piyush Singla told PTI.

The positive cases included two grand-daughters, daughter-in-law and a neighbour of the deceased woman, he said.

The reports of the son and the husband of the woman are awaited from GMC Jammu, Singla said.

The woman's son is a PSO of a retired police officer, he said.

218,10-4-20,"UNSC meets for 1st time to discuss COVID-19, recalls need for unity, solidarity","The UN Security Council underlined the need for unity and solidarity with those affected by the COVID-19 and expressed support for the efforts of Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on the potential impact of the pandemic, as the powerful UN arm met for the first time to discuss the crisis that has engulfed the world.

The Council, under the Presidency of the Dominican Republic, held a closed video-conference session in connection with the impact of COVID-19 on the issues that fall under the Security Council's mandate.

Guterres also briefed the Council.

In Press Elements issued following the meeting, the 15-nation Council said Members expressed their support for all efforts of the Secretary-General concerning the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries and recalled the need for unity and solidarity with all those affected.

Briefing the Council, Guterres said the world faces its gravest test since the founding of the United Nations 75 years ago and there is fear that the worst is yet to come especially in the developing world and countries already battered by armed conflict.

The Council has been seen as missing in action as the coronavirus pandemic across the world has so far left over 1.6 million people infected and more than 95,000 dead.

Guterres stressed that the engagement of the Security Council will be critical to mitigate the peace and security implications of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Indeed, a signal of unity and resolve from the Council would count for a lot at this anxious time, he said.

To prevail against the pandemic today, we will need to work together. That means heightened solidarity, he said.

Guterres said while the COVID-19 pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis, it also poses a significant threat to the maintenance of international peace and security -- potentially leading to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease.

The UN Chief said he is particularly concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to further erode trust in public institutions, particularly if citizens perceive that their authorities mishandled the response or are not transparent on the scope of the crisis.

Efforts to discuss the coronavirus situation in the Council were stalled till now mainly due to the stalemate between Washington and Beijing.

The Council's two veto-wielding permanent members have been arguing over the origins of the virus and how any possible Council statement or resolution should reflect that.

Sources told PTI that there was no discussion during the meeting on a resolution on the COVID-19 situation.

US Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft said Washington reiterates the need for complete transparency and the timely sharing of public health data and information within the international community.

""The most effective way to contain this pandemic is through accurate, science-based data collection and analysis of the origins, characteristics, and spread of the virus. We cannot stress enough how important these methods are, Craft said in her remarks, appearing to make a veiled reference to China.

Craft stressed that successfully stopping the spread of this virus depends on the commitment from each one of us to work together in good faith.

China's Ambassador to the UN Zhang Jun said to overcome this global challenge, solidarity, cooperation, mutual support and assistance is what we need, while beggar-thy-neighbor or scapegoating will lead us nowhere. Any acts of stigmatization and politicization must be rejected.

UN Director at the International Crisis Group, a non-governmental organization focussed on preventing conflict, Richard Gowan told PTI the Security Council still seems unable to measure up to the scale of the COVID-19 crisis.

He said there is a sense that China and the US in particular are more keen on scoring political points against one another in New York than throwing their united weight behind common action on the crisis.

COVID-19 has laid bare the lack of trust among Council members all too acutely, he said.

We must hope that the big powers gradually grasp that such a severe global threat demands a multilateral response. Most of the elected members of the Council feel that it is essential to do more. India, preparing for its own stint on the council starting next year, should throw its weight behind the elected members' efforts to address this situation, Gowan said.

Louis Charbonneau, the United Nations Director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement to PTI that the Council has been missing in action since the coronavirus outbreak began. It's painful to watch their paralysis, though it's obviously nothing new. They're so often deadlocked these days, he said adding that many of the crisis countries on the Council's agenda such as Syria, Yemen, Libya have seen COVID-19 cases already.

Unless the world acts, it's only a matter of time before those and other situations go from bad to much, much worse, he said.

Ahead of the Council meeting, two draft resolutions had been circulated for negotiations.

One by Tunisia on behalf of the 10 non-permanent members called for ""an urgent, coordinated and united international action to curb the impact of COVID-19.

A French text focussed on Guterres' call for a global ceasefire as part of a ""humanitarian pause"" to combat the pandemic.

219,10-4-20,"Global virus death toll passes 94,000, but some signs of hope","Another horror day of the coronavirus pandemic saw the global death toll pass 94,000, although there were tentative signs of hope that the crisis was peaking in the United States and Europe.

The picture of the unfolding economic catastrophe also became clearer with the IMF warning of a Great Depression and data showing 17 million Americans lost their jobs, but a European Union financial rescue package agreement offered some relief to the barrage of bad news.

Another 1,700 people died in the United States on Thursday, while there were hundreds more deaths across Europe, driving the confirmed global toll above 94,000.

Nearly half of all pandemic fatalities have occurred over the past week.

But authorities in worst-hit Europe and the United States said a slight decline in daily deaths and infections gave reason to hope the worst could be over.

""The fire started by the pandemic is starting to come under control,"" said Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of Spain, where fatalities inched down to 683 from 757 a day before, pushing that country's total above 15,000.

""Our priority now is not to turn back, especially not to return to our starting point, not to lower our guard."" France also reported that 82 fewer people were in intensive care for COVID-19 -- the first fall since the pandemic broke out.

And Anthony Fauci, the US government's top pandemic expert, said the United States was ""going in the right direction"".

The US recorded 1,783 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University as of 0030 GMT Friday, lower than the previous day's record toll of 1,973.

The US has seen more than 16,500 confirmed deaths, the second-highest tally in the world after Italy, and more than 460,000 confirmed cases.

In New York, the epicentre of the virus in the United States, only 200 more people entered hospitals, the lowest number since the pandemic struck, even though 799 people died over the last day, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.

""We are flattening the curve by what we are doing,"" Cuomo said, adding, ""We have to keep the curve flat."" But he declined to predict how New York would fare in the coming weeks, telling reporters bluntly: ""I have no idea.""

Further lifting spirits, the health improved of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the highest profile of the 1.5 million people infected by the virus, and he ended three days of intensive care.

However, Britain announced another 881 deaths on Thursday, taking the total to nearly 8,000.

On the economic front, Europe attempted a fightback with EU finance ministers agreeing in late-night talks to a 500 billion-euro ( 550 billion) rescue package aimed at reducing pain across the 27-nation bloc, especially hardest-hit Italy and Spain.

""Europe has decided and is ready to meet the gravity of the crisis,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire tweeted after the talks.

He warned earlier in the day that France's economy was expected to shrink six percent this year, even with the country's own 100-billion-euro relief plan.

The US Federal Reserve threw its own fresh lifeline to Americans, with chairman Jerome Powell announcing a 2.3 trillion financing measure ""to provide as much relief and stability as we can during this period of constrained economic activity.""

The International Monetary Fund said 170 of its 180 members would see declines in per capita income this year -- just a few months after predictions that nearly all would enjoy growth.

""We anticipate the worst economic fallout since the Great Depression,"" said IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva, urging governments to provide lifelines to businesses and households alike.

And despite hopeful signs in Western nations as well as in China, where the virus was first detected late last year, there are fears the worst is still to come in much of the developing world.

War-torn Yemen, which has been experiencing one of the world's most acute humanitarian crises, on Friday reported its first case.

Brazilian authorities Thursday confirmed the first deaths in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro where crowding and poor sanitation have raised fears of a catastrophe.

There are similar fears in India, where hundreds of millions of poor people are becoming increasingly desperate.

""I keep hearing that the government will do this and that. No one has even come to see if we are alive or dead,"" Rajni Devi, a mother of three, told AFP in a slum on the outskirts of New Delhi.

In a move to build international solidarity over the crisis, Germany on Thursday led a videoconference session of the UN Security Council on the pandemic.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres opened the session by calling the pandemic ""the fight of a generation -- and the raison d'etre of the United Nations itself."" Guterres appealed for a global halt to conflicts to concentrate on the COVID-19 fight.

Saudi Arabia embraced the call by announcing a unilateral pause in its brutal offensive against rebels who control much of Yemen.

US President Donald Trump said he spoke Thursday to Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and thought they were near a deal to end an oil price war that has thrown further uncertainties into the global economy.

OPEC announced Friday that major oil producers except Mexico had agreed to cut output.

The Ministry of National Health Services, in an early morning update on its website, reported that four patients died of coronavirus in the last 24 hours.

The total number of patients who died due to COVID-19 has reached 66. As many as 727 have recovered while 45 were in critical condition, it said.

The government announced various measures to meet the challenge of COVID-19, including cash payments to the most needy, which already started on Thursday and would continue for about three weeks until 12 million families were paid Rs 12,000 each.

Meanwhile, Pakistan President Arif Alvi has announced that a special prayer called 'Salaat-u-Tauba' (prayer for forgiveness) will be offered on Friday at Aiwan-e-Sadr or Presidential Palace with limited gathering.

The decision was taken in a meeting of Alvif with a delegation of Council of Islamic Ideology, led by Qibla Ayaz in Islamabad on Thursday.

Friday congregation were already stopped by the government.

Sindh government announced complete lockdown from 12-3 pm in order to stop people from going to mosques to attend Friday prayer in big congregations, according to information minister Nasir Shah.

Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit Peshawar on Friday, where he will be given a detailed briefing by the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government on the precautionary steps taken to curb the spread of the virus.

Centres have been set up across the country to support and provide relief to those affected by the virus.

Pakistan is making frantic efforts to tackle the pandemic.

Khan has warned the people to follow official guidelines on self-isolation or the virus would spread further.

221,10-4-20,Italy eyes lockdown extension to May 3,"Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte was reportedly ready Friday to extend most measures of Italy's month-long lockdown until early May in order to avoid a second coronavirus wave.

Italy's main newspapers said Conte will published a decree either Friday or Saturday prohibiting people from taking walks or lounging in parks until May 3.

The reported decision followed days of consultations with government scientists and regional leaders.

Italy's death toll from the novel coronavirus has officially reached 18,279 since the end of February, the highest in the world.

But daily rises in new infections have slowed dramatically and Italy is gradually approaching a point when the number of people officially suffering from COVID-19 might begin to drop.

The Corriere della Serra newspaper said Conte will bow to growing pressure and allow a tiny number of businesses to reopen when the existing restrictions expire on April 13.

These reportedly include book and stationery stores as well as lumber companies and factories that make agricultural machinery.

The government and scientists reportedly view these as businesses with the least amount of human interaction.

It will represent ""a small, cautious, symbolic opening,"" the Corriere della Serra wrote.

""We do not have the conditions to restart thing now,"" Conte reportedly told union and business leaders during a private videoconference on Thursday.

Only grocery stores and pharmacies have been allowed to operate since a general lockdown began at the peak of the Mediterranean country's outbreak on March 12.

A study released by the Confcooperative small business lobby said the closures have left more half of Italy's 1.3 million construction workers and over a third of the 11.4 million services sector employees furloughed.

Government scientists have also been pushing for the ban on public gatherings to be extended as long as possible as a safety precaution.

But Conte was now reportedly ready to let Italians freely leave their houses for the first time time in nearly two months on May 4.

""If scientists confirm it, we might begin to relax some measures already by the end of this month,"" he told the BBC on Thursday.

224,10-4-20,Harvesting problem crops up in lockdown,"Farmers in Delhi and the neighbouring States are at their wits’ end as the lockdown and labour shortage have made it difficult for them to start harvesting the Rabi crop. Exemption for agricultural operation by the State Governments has come to their rescue in this situation.

Farmers in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said their crops are ripe to be harvested but there is shortage of labourers, harvesting machines and even there are no adathis (middlemen) in Anaj Mandi. The lockdown also led to an unprecedented exodus of workers from their places of work, to their homes in far-flung villages across the country.

The Pioneer visited villages in Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and bordering villages of Delhi, where farmers rued that the shortage of labour and the lockdown has crippled the wholesale market.

Some farmers harvested wheat in March, but most of them harvest their crops by mid-April to May first week.

Pushpender Chaudhary, the president of Kisan Shakti Sangh said despite good Rabi crop, farmers have been left in the lurch as they are facing issues while delivering harvested fruits, vegetables, milk and other food products due to lack of transportation.

“Somehow if they manage to send the produce in the market, they have to face blockades at several points which had also led to steep rise in agriculture products across the states despite being availability of products. The Government should initiate some steps to allow free passage to farmers so that they can send their products without hassle,” said Chaudhary.

“Labourers who used to harvest our fields have now returned to their homes. Who are staying back are ready to work but now issue is that man power is less and there are no tools and equipment to harvest crops available in market,” said Ravi Khatri, a villager in Haryana’s Ismaila village near Rohtak .

“If somehow both machines and laboruers manage to harvest the crop, there will be no takers as grain markets are closed. Despite being in essential services farmers have also developed fear of coronavirus and they are also avoiding going out. Same issue is with the laboruers. We are left with no other option as crop has ripened and has started to fall in fields, which is a loss to farmer,” Khatri added.

Kishan Singh of Bawana village was ruing the lockdown as he haplessly sits at his home but can’t go to his field where wheat is ready to be harvested. There are hundreds of others like him who are faced with bleak times ahead and are praying for the lockdown to be lifted by the Government.

The agriculture contributes some 16 per cent to the country’s GDP. India is one of the world’s largest producers of crops like rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, vegetables and milk. Now there are concerns that stopping farm activity will not only end up hurting farmers and labourers but also affect food security.

Expressing concern, Ajay Bhalla (Home Secretary, Government of India) has written to Chief Secretaries to all States on April 3, stating that however exceptions have been allowed for farming operation for farmers, farm workers, procurement of agricultural productions, operation of mandis, movement of harvesting and sowing related machineries but as per information received these exceptions have not been percolated at ground level.

It may be noted that the winter crop - wheat, rice and pulses -and fruits are harvested and sold during month of April and June. After that the fields are prepared for the sowing of summer rain-fed crop, comprising paddy, pulses, cotton and sugarcane.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/harvesting-problem-crops-up-in-lockdown-2020-04-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/harvesting-problem-crops-up-in-lockdown.html

237,10-4-20,Punjab extends curfew till May 1,"The Punjab government Friday extended the ongoing lockdown till May 1, amid rising number of coronavirus cases and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh apprehending the state might be moving towards the community transmission stage of the outbreak.

The decision to extend the lockdown was taken at a video-conference meeting of the council of ministers, chaired by Singh, to check the community spread of the pandemic and to prevent overcrowding at the mandis in the light of the ensuing wheat harvesting and procurement season, the government said in a statement here.

Chief Minister Singh said in a tweet, “Given the seriousness of the situation arising out of #Covid19, Cabinet has decided to extend lockdown & curfew till 1st May. These are difficult times & I appeal to all to #StayHomeStaySafe & strictly observe health safeguards as you have done so far, for which I am thankful.”

Just before him, KBS Sidhu, Punjab Special Chief Secretary had tweeted, “PUNJAB CABINET @capt_amarinder UNANIMOUSLY APPROVES EXTENSION OF PUNJAB CURFEW/ LOCKDOWN till 30 April, 2020/ 1st May, 2020. Extension by 21 days from today. Strict enforcement.”

Punjab became the second state after Odisha to extend the lockdown, even as the Centre considers proposals by several states to continue the restrictions beyond April 14, when the ongoing nationwide 21-day lockdown is slated to end.

The Punjab government statement said the Chief Minister will convey the decision of extending the lockdown to Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his conference with CMs on Saturday.

Punjab was the first state in the country that had clamped curfew on March 23 to check the spread of the coronavirus.

The state has seen a spike in the number of coronavirus cases in the past few days, pushing the total count to 151 with 11 deaths till Friday evening. On Friday, 21 fresh cases were reported from the state.

Earlier in the day, the CM told a media briefing that most of the 27 positive cases reported in Punjab on Thursday (the maximum daily increase for the state) were those of secondary transmission and expressed apprehension that the state may be entering the community transmission stage of the outbreak.

Citing the grim projections about the spread of the pandemic in the coming weeks, the CM said the curfew restrictions were essential so that the state's medical infrastructure is not burdened beyond its capabilities.

There was general consensus in the medical community that the lockdown curbs would only delay the spread of the disease, he said, hoping that some medication/cure would be found soon.

On a proposal by the CM, the council of ministers also decided to set up a multi-disciplinary task force to formulate an exit strategy for gradual relaxation of curfew/lockdown.

The task force comprising 15 members representing trade, business, industry, agriculture, civil society and healthcare professionals, will submit its report within 10 days.

The cabinet also approved establishment of a high-powered committee to suggest a roadmap for the state's economic revival in post-COVID-19 period.

An official release quoting Amarinder Singh said he will request former Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to head the committee.

The council of ministers also resolved to urge upon the Centre to establish an Advance Centre of Virology in Punjab with an anticipated investment of Rs 500 crore. The state government will offer land free of cost for the project, it decided.

For the quick upgradation of the state's health infrastructure to combat the current crisis, the cabinet set up a task force under the Principal Secretary, PWD, to look into it.

Punjab Health Systems Corporation MD will be other members of the task force, which will carry out the task of quick upgradation of health infrastructure in a time-bound manner.

The CM asked the health department to submit a detailed proposal for this.
