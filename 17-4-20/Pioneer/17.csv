0,17-4-20,Inclusivity in our time,"When the Corona crisis has blown the lid over assorted religious televangelists and godmen, who claimed to have a panacea for all ills, there are communities that have set examples

The Coronavirus crisis has inadvertently blown the lid over assorted religious televangelists, godmen and “cure-all” religious leaders, who claimed to have a panacea for all ills, both physical and even political. These religiously-loaded hucksters successfully peddled their “spirituality” for financial gratification via medicaments, groceries and “ancient formula.” This could guarantee remedy and protection from all known ills that still defied modern science. Their carefully curated garb and invocations afforded a semblance of a certain religious-cultural “type” that was rooted in a particular religious denomination. This was then harnessed via the gullible adherents of that religion/sect.

These charlatans routinely pooh-poohed modern science as a Western affliction. They went so far as suggesting an “anti-national” slant for those who spurned their ideas. In the initial days of this debilitating Coronavirus, which still defies any cure anywhere in the world, these masqueraders held forth with their cavalier attitude and ostensible “solutions.” This to beat a hasty retreat as their purported “solutions” came a cropper for sheer ineffectiveness. Across the world, the purveyors of this religious-cultural “enterprise” created a constituency and “market” that came unmistakably wrapped in legitimacy-seeking strains of religions like Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism, among others. These practitioners also did a great disservice to their parent religions as they flitted between commerce and puritanism. Along with willing politicians, they contributed significantly to polarising societies.

However, a significant part of society did remain sceptical of such divisive and commercial religiosity and, instead, preferred a more “inclusive”, “philosophical”, “cultural” and “spiritual” side of religious nuance, one that invariably always insisted on humanity, peace and consideration for the “other.” Even in countries like Pakistan that are caught in the vortex of religious extremism, there are examples like that of late Abdul Sattar Edhi, who gave his life for human dignity beyond the narrow confines of organised religion. Edhi’s purpose in life was to bathe and bury thousands of unclaimed bodies without discriminating on the basis of religion, gender or race. The noble soul said, “No religion is higher than humanity.” Such selfless acts in such turbulent times give the society and, indeed, the religion, their soul. Every religious order and nation has its own celebrated or unsung heroes, who keep the true faith and ensure that it does not get discredited due to acts of some extremist mullahs, priests, pandits or any other godmen, who preach a toxic lesson of “divide”, monopoly-on-truth and supremacism.

The Sikh community, in particular, has distinguished itself across the world with its sense of community service, piety and altruism, especially in difficult times. Be it during the devastating Australian bushfires or the horrific communal riots in Delhi, the reassuring sight of the Sikh community rising to the occasion and setting up makeshift langars, ferrying injured people to the hospitals and even helping rebuild the destroyed sites of victims is now a usual sight. Importantly, these aid initiatives of the Sikh community tend to prop up impromptu under the aegis of either the local gurudwara in the community or through a purely voluntary organisation of Sikh members in the area.

For them, the religious or racial identity of the victim is not relevant to extend support to the most vulnerable. The genesis of this culture is reposed in one of the three pillars of Guru Nanak’s teachings ie, Vand Chhako, which necessitates sharing and consuming together as a community. The extended implication is to help those who are in dire need of help.

While almost all religions have the same underlying tenets and message of universal brotherhood and compassion, a lot of the practical aspect of the same has either been twisted by zealous clergy or the message remains confined within the texts. However, as a more modern religion with a reformist agenda, Sikhism has almost internalised certain attributes of daily living that have given the modern-day community the ability to punch above its weight in terms of contribution to the society and the nation.

The revered concepts of sewa (selfless service for the benefit of others) and charhdi kala (mental state of eternal joy and optimism) have given the community a unique identity and disposition in its own eyes, one that it is almost blasphemous to not live up to that exacting standard. The famous saying of never seeing a Sikh beggar is attributable to that sense of fraternal progress and hard work that disdains success at the cost of others. Above all, a Sikh is a quintessential warrior, who is given to defend his faith with his own life — be it in Saraghari, Mesopotamia or in Kargil — the ingrained martial outlook has appropriated the finest codes of soldiering and, therefore, its noblest instincts.

The essential difference has been the ability of the Sikhs to cheerfully assimilate into multicultural milieus without reneging on their own faith and yet, integrating and enriching the diversity of the land with unmatched hard work and selfless contributions in places as far-flung as in Canada, Australia to Kenya.

Parsis are yet another community, whose contribution in nation-building, enterprise and philanthropy are unbelievable. In both cases, the genuine spirit and large-heartedness towards the “others,” as opposed to the narrow confines of their own religiosity and adherents, is what sets them apart. Gurudwaras — from New York to Delhi — are dishing out meals for the homeless and shelterless in the midst of the Coronavirus lockdown, which has left hapless citizens abandoned to their own fate. In many ways, the essential lesson of this crisis has been the need to collaborate as this virus spares no religion, gender, race or nation. In such times, mankind and religious leaders must introspect the “walls of exclusivity” that they set up or intend to build. For, no “wall” offers any meaningful protection against global crises. Religious practices and practitioners that insist on such “walls” have been rendered useless. Mankind and religion may still survive only if societies encourage and celebrate diversity and respect for each other.

1,17-4-20,WHO vs Trump,"The US withdraws funding to the world body for promoting Chinese propaganda on COVID-19. Trump has a point

Donald Trump has ripped to shreds a lot of the US-backed multilateralism that has powered the world through an era of peace and prosperity following the end of the Second World War. It nurtured the idea from the United Nations to the World Bank, and as the world enters the first truly global crisis since the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, the World Health Organisation (WHO). However, the US President has some justification for his attacks on the WHO and its leader Tedros Adhanom, whom he has accused of being a Chinese lapdog. Finally, he has stopped funding the organisation. While many anti-Trump political and social leaders as well as philatrophists backing global public health initiatives, like Microsoft founder Bill Gates, have criticised this decision, it is evident that power politics played its part in obfuscating the true face of the virus. The WHO, for all its good intentions, was swayed, failed in its duties by not taking China to task sooner and parroted the Chinese line. It bungled notoriously on the human-to-human transmissibility of the Covid-19 virus when it claimed in a tweet that it was not possible, even though Chinese doctors already knew that was the case and Taiwanese public health officials were letting the world know the same. The problem is that Taiwan, which is the Republic of China but claimed by the People's Republic of China, is not a member of the WHO. Dr Tedros, in particular, has been criticised for being far too close to the Chinese administration. The fact is the WHO has not covered itself with glory in this case. Previously, during the original SARS outbreak at the turn of the century, the WHO had been critical of Chinese decisions. This time round it did not take a critical look at China’s warnings and systems. However, that is not the fault of the WHO completely as it depends on its member states to give it more accurate information. The Chinese administration under President Xi Jinping has a carefully cultivated sense of news and only fed the WHO what it wanted it to know. No representative was really allowed to interact with Chinese medical staff without Communist Party of China officials present. Given China’s growing influence in the UN, the WHO’s reverence or kowtowing to China aren’t surprising. Its control over the WHO is the result of a much longer lobbying, one that seeks to influence global governance on its terms. Already, China is commanding the post-Covid economy, with both US and Europe dependent on its medical supplies line. Chinese infrastructure projects are already dotting southern Europe. So it will continue its diplomatic manoeuvrings.

Here, even the US has admittedly been off the ball. Trump, who has renounced a leadership role in international bodies, allowed the US seat on the WHO board to remain empty for years. Such a representative could have shared US intelligence with the WHO. For all the comical ineptitude of its President at the start of the crisis, the US did have intelligence of the Chinese virus and what was happening in Wuhan well before the rest of the wide world had an idea of the virulence of the disease. Yielding ground means letting China use its economic heft to secure its primacy instead. The world has until now done a fabulous job of messing up its response to the virus, which has wreaked havoc in southern Europe in terms of lives and hollowed out the global economy. We cannot be petulant in our response to the crisis nor lie about what we are doing. Here both China and the US have let the rest of the world down. They have to step up and act responsible, else the world will leave them both behind.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/who-vs-trump-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/who-vs-trump.html
2,17-4-20,No marital bliss,"Post-lockdown, there is a spiral in divorce pleas across cities affected by the virus

Man is a social animal and cannot live in isolation for too long. But the reverse is also true and co-existence 24X7 has not been an easy challenge. The extended periods of lockdowns around the world due to the Coronavirus have led to a rise in cases of divorce and domestic violence, with women and children being at the receiving end. China is leading the way in the spurt of divorce cases as couples emerge from the extended lockdowns enforced by the Government. In fact, Xian city, in central China and Dazhou, in Sichuan province, reported record-high numbers of divorce filings in early March, leading to long backlogs at Government offices. According to a report on a Government website in Hunan province’s Miluo, staff members didn’t even have time to drink water because too many couples lined up to file for divorce! Law firms in the UK are reporting that their offices are receiving more enquiries about divorce and child custody rules now amid the lockdown and firms in New York have seen a 50 per cent rise in filings for divorce. According to lawyers, it is not just the lower or middle class couples who have been contacting them. They expect to see a surge in high-profile cases as the net worth of HNWIs erodes and they take this chance to get out of a marriage with lower settlements than they would have had to pay earlier. In fact, such is the surge of marital discord in Japan that a company there has begun offering empty apartments to people to spend some “me time” since April 3. They have had 20 customers since then and the price tag of $57 a day also includes a free 30-minute divorce consultation with a legal official. People have not just been using the service for getting some alone time, there have been cases of women using it to escape domestic abuse. Violence at home amid the lockdown has risen around the world, including India. In Jingzhou, a city in Hubei Province, the heart of the initial Coronavirus outbreak, domestic violence cases reported to police swelled to more than triple during the lockdown in February-March, from 47 last year to 162 this year. In Brazil, the escalation in cases has been around 40-50 per cent while in France cases are up by 36 per cent and in Cyprus 30 per cent. In Italy, which has been bearing the maximum brunt of the Coronavirus after China, there was a 20 per cent surge in texts and emails to activists for help. More than 25 organisations helping domestic violence victims have reported an increase in their caseload since the start of the UK’s Coronavirus epidemic.

India, too, has seen a surge in cases of domestic violence and as per the National Commission for Women (NCW) report, a total of 885 complaints have been received by it between March 25 and April 6. The maximum complaints were reported from Uttar Pradesh (98), followed by Delhi (43) and 22 each from both Bihar and Maharashtra. However, the actual numbers may be much more as women in rural areas don’t have access to the internet and most complaints come by letters posted by them. The world is facing a larger sociological and familial problem that could implode as lockdowns get extended in the battle to defeat the pandemic. The Coronavirus is not just taking a toll of our health, economy and lives, it is killing our hallowed institutions, too. Or is it prompting us to re-evaluate our commitment to sharing our lives with others and test what can push us over the edge or hold tight?",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-marital-bliss-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-marital-bliss.html

4,17-4-20,AIDS-hit K'pada widow denied advance PDS,"In the wake of Corona virus outbreak, the State Government has been distributing PDS rations to the beneficiaries for three months in advance under NFSA (National Food Security Act) and State Food Security Scheme, but to the sorry plight of an AIDS-affected widow, she was denied the sops following her name was deleted from the beneficiaries list for being an Anganwadi Helper.

According to the 44-year-old HIV infected woman, Snehalata (name changed) from remote Laxminarayanpur village under Derabish block, she got the infection from her husband who died of the disease in 2002. She decided to work and earn like any other woman of her age and joined as a helper in local Anganwadi Centre.

Besides, she receives Madhu Babu Pension per month earmarked for AIDS patients. Her salary and pension provides her support to take care of herself and her 19-year-old son.

Even the district administration earlier sanctioned her a pucca house under IAY scheme along with enrolling her name in the State Food Security scheme. She used to collect PDS rations every month. Even, last month, she too collected her quota.

But to her surprise, while the three months ration was provided to other beneficiaries in the wake of COVID-19, she was denied the same.

As the widow woman is an Anganwadi helper and she is getting salary from government treasury under HRMS(Human Resources Management system) site, so she became ineligible beneficiary from this month, said BDO Gopabandhu Bhosagar.

7,17-4-20,Baladevjew servitors face tough time,"Due to the lockdown, servitors of the Baladevjew Temple here are now facing a tough time to earn their livelihood.

They used to eke out their living by working in bhoga shops near the temple, besides in several other ways. As the devotees are restricted to come to the temple, so it has become a difficult time for the servitors to collect bread for the family members.

The servitors used to sell the nityani bhoga to the devotees. As nobody is coming, they are forced to take the nityani bhoga of the devotees to their houses, said Nrusingha Charan Patri, a sevayat.

Though the State Government has been providing assistance to several sections of the people in the ongoing lockdown to contain the spread of corona virus, but it seems the servitors of Baladevjew temple have been ignored. As the lockdown will be in force till April 30, so several servitors are now worried as to what they would do to run their family.

8,17-4-20,Migrant woman stuck in lockdown delivers baby,"A brick kiln worker stuck due to lockdown in Subarnapur was brought to the CHC at Binka on April 10 and she gave birth to a boy child.

10,17-4-20,Online justice delivery,"Lawyers and judges are learning how videoconferencing works because a pandemic must not be allowed to stop the wheels of justice from churning

The nationwide lockdown on account of COVID-19 has forced the Indian judiciary to rely heavily on technology and the internet. The need to ensure the safety of citizens and to provide access to justice even during a pandemic has opened the doors to virtual courts. Extremely urgent cases are being heard through video-conferencing by the apex and other courts. Lawyers and judges are learning and understanding how videoconferencing works because a pandemic must not be allowed to stop the wheels of justice from churning. On April 6, the Supreme Court asked all courts to develop and determine modalities for proper operation of court proceedings through videoconferencing technology so that the overwhelming backlog of cases that India already has doesn’t grow further.

As per national judicial data grid data, a whopping 37 million cases were pending in the country till April. Once the shutdown ends and the courts return to business as usual, they will be swamped with new cases. Some of those cases might have emerged due to the lockdown itself. For instance divorce filings, domestic violence, sexual assault, breach of contracts, insolvency and so on. Thus, the courts will not only have to deal with pending cases but also fresh cases waiting for resolution. It is at this time that the importance of teleconferencing grows even further.

However, India is not the only nation relying heavily on technology to deliver justice during the times of COVID. Chief Justice Geoffrey Morawetz of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice recently said, “The court is never going to stop operating and if there is one positive that is going to come out of this crisis, it is that we have been forced to accelerate plans into electronic hearings and we cannot go back.”

Similarly, the courts in England and Wales have recorded that between March 19 and April 6, the number of audio hearings increased from 100 to 1,850 and video hearings rose from 150 to 1,100.

The big question is can we expect normalcy after COVID-19? Is this an opportunity for the Indian legal system to use more technology to deliver justice by remote and reduce case pendency?

A proactive Supreme Court: In 2005, the e-Committee of the apex court conceptualised the e-Courts Project with a vision to transform the Indian judiciary through the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Supreme Court has accomplished the gargantuan task of computerisation of 39 High Court complexes and 3,219 District Court complexes across India since then. In 2013 the e-Courts National portal was launched, thereby giving free online access to case status and cause lists and case information of about 70 million pending cases and 330 million orders. The significant achievement of the e-Courts Project includes the computerisation of courts, implementation of hardware and training of judicial officers. The project also connected court complexes with jails through desktop teleconferencing to go beyond remand and production of undertrial prisoners.

In 2019, a whopping 28,262 videoconferences were held between courts and jails through the e-Court system. This indicates that the Indian judiciary is conscious of the importance of technology, computerisation and connectivity. As a large number of judicial officers and staff are conversant with videoconferencing technology, it may not be difficult for courts to adapt to full-fledged remote hearings in appropriate cases after the pandemic is over.

Right now, as the Coronavirus ravages India, measures are being adopted by the judiciary to ensure the robust functioning of the judicial system through teleconferencing. The courts have been directed to maintain a helpline with regard to complaints of quality and audibility of the feed.

Apart from this, the Supreme Court has said that the courts should duly notify and make available the facilities of videoconferencing for such litigants who do not have the means or access to teleconferencing facilities. In appropriate cases, an amicus curiae may be appointed to assist the court.

On April 15, the apex court issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) to deal with filing and mentioning of urgent cases. The web-based videoconferencing system VI-DYO platform hosted on the servers of the national data centre of the National Informatics Centre is being used now. As the smooth functioning of video-conferencing would depend on the connectivity at the end of the remote user the guidelines recommended that all parties have a dedicated minimum of two Mbps or 4G broadband connection.

Rising to the occasion: A dedicated judiciary is working hard to facilitate justice through technology. Justice GS Patel of the Bombay High Court conducted a public access hearing on April 11. The Supreme Court, too, directed the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to ensure availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) to all health workers. Similarly, courts have taken up cases of migrant workers and also a case of advocates and clerks on the verge of starvation because of COVID.

The challenges: Understandably, there may be some who are not comfortable with working with technology. The Bar Council of Delhi expressed concerns that a majority of the advocates are not computer savvy and may be handicapped approaching the courts as they are unable to use the videoconferencing facility.

The overriding objective of using technology is to further the interest of justice and no party should be placed at a disadvantage for want of internet access or hardware such as computers. Help must be provided to lawyers, litigants and others, who may be in need of technical assistance for teleconferencing so that the system adapts and we are ready for the internet age.

Not very tech-savvy: The typewriter was a prominent feature of the Indian court system throughout most of the 20th century. Even up to the late 1990s, some lawyers continued to use typewriters for court work. Thankfully, at some point the transition from typewriters to computers enabled advance use of technology. Similarly, judicial filings were made on legal-size paper typed on one-side only. Some courts accepted only green parchment paper in legal-size. The shift from legal-size to conventional A4 size has happened only recently. Now the Supreme Court accepts A4 size paper, printed on both sides.

The apex court has also dispensed with the practice of sending letters to lawyers and now corresponds through e-mail and SMSs. The courts are moving towards dependence on the internet and technology.

The changes ahead: The court drama associated with a conventional court may be absent in virtual courts. All the guidelines clearly state that the mikes must be muted and only one person will speak at a time. Lawyers may have to develop new advocacy skills. Doubtless, they will innovate. As far as the dress code is concerned, the lawyers are required to be dressed according to court conventions.

Making a case for technology: Courts have held that the internet is a basic human right. The internet has transformed banking, travel and other industries. COVID has pushed us online and this will forever change the way courts function. Consequently, litigation lawyers will have to adapt. Video and audio hearings are here to stay. The e-Courts project has introduced new technologies in Indian courts over the last few years. India has one of the youngest populations in the world. It can build an adequate resource of tech-savvy personnel to assist with the strengthening of the use of electronic litigation. This is an opportunity for the Indian judiciary to make use of the existing infrastructure and talent developed through the e-Courts Project. The judiciary must capitalise on the existing robust infrastructure that caters to more than 3,248 court complexes all over the country and about 37 million pending cases today.

Further, online hearings will help reduce emissions and the country’s carbon footprint. On April 15, about 8,75,000 cases were adjourned in the District Courts because of COVID on April 16 about 9,34, 000 cases were again adjourned. The vexed problem of court delays in courts will worsen at this rate. Further, judicial vacancies in the High Courts are at about 36 per cent as there are 389 vacancies. This is an appropriate time for the judiciary and Government to seriously consider filling judicial vacancies and use technology efficiently to reduce pendency of litigation.

However, videoconference hearings may not be appropriate for every case. Cases involving a large number of parties, voluminous documents or complicated questions of fact may not suitable for this. Guidelines may have to be framed classifying matters that can be heard online. Courts in England are holding hearings through video and audioconferencing. The Indian judiciary may also consider using audioconferencing with appropriate safeguards as this will be easier than videoconferencing.

11,17-4-20,Use data judiciously,"Collating migrant data and finding a smart way of anonymised aggregation may be the key to prevent a future pandemic and resurgence of COVID-19

The world that we knew has pretty much rebooted and a new order is staring at most of us as we start getting back to work in set-ups we used to call workspaces. The rule book, regulations, policies, priorities, diagnosis and cure are changing by the hour around the globe as we try to make sense of the new normal.

Though India has extended its original 21-day lockdown till May 3, it has announced a graded easing of restrictions. This step has been welcomed by all, as the choice in a country like ours is not between the disease and livelihoods but between “lives and lives.” Yet, as we ease into normalcy, we know for sure things will never ever be the same again. As many corporate trainers, life coaches or leaders will tell you, this could either be the greatest catastrophic moment in India’s recent documented history or the beginning of a great tryst with prosperity and development.

The Covid-19 challenge has in a way isolated and perhaps generated rich, contextualised and most important “recent” data of nearly the entire 130 crore population in just a month, which would have been unthinkable until recently. However these data sets are siloed and sitting in tight pigeonholes of what are popularly known as “sarkari files” across hundreds of districts of the country .

Consider this. One of the most repeated and stark issues defining India’s Covid-19 crisis would be the plight of migrant workers. Thousands thronged railways stations in densely-populated Mumbai, a similar number descended on the streets of Gujarat, besides many are sleeping below bridges and flyovers in cities like Delhi. This is the second wave, post the one seen during the initial lockdown announcement which saw thousands walking along railway lines or stranded on borders of various States. A brief intervention by courts meant most State Governments put the migrant population in tight, dense chicken cages. This faceless yet key pillar of the economy is a rich data mine waiting to be harvested for greater growth. The State Governments, through their district administrations, have access to these shelter homes. It would be worthwhile for a savvy Chief Minister to quickly tabulate all information his Government has on migrant labour in an excel sheet. These spots can serve as key gateways for State welfare activities. Assuming that most of the migrant population stuck in these shelters do not have any valid Government document, a beginning could be made to start providing them with a basic set of papers which would in the long run entitle them to a host of Government spending. Basic medical insurance and provision for getting cheap ration via food coupons would generate tonnes of data on their health and migratory patterns. This is a one-time limited window opportunity for bringing nearly 50 per cent of India’s unorganised workforce into the mainstream. This requires coordinated Centre-State agility, perhaps spearheaded by the labour department. The Central Government will have to ensure close coordination with State Labour Commissioners who in turn will be aggregators of this data, as well as, key facilitators of welfare schemes. The thin line of data privacy for this faceless crowd will have to be adhered to as top priority. That itself sets a huge challenge for many moth-eaten files strewn across labour departments of the country. Collating this data and finding a smart way of anonymised aggregation for the future may be the key to prevent a future pandemic and resurgence of the current one. If you speak to any of the migrants, the first thing they will tell you is that they want to return to their villages and stay there for some time. The horrors of being without means, if not food and the emotional stress of being away from their families is a wound which will fester further, unless a visible monetary benefit is given now, together with a promise of a long-term benefit like a health insurance and income guarantee.

Next is the much talked about contact tracing app, Arogya Setu, developed or curated indigenously by the Government in its preparation for opening the floodgates of the economy. It has had a mixed response so far in terms of its downloads and use but will be a potential e-pass for future mobility. This app, collecting tonnes of data of individuals will have to be carefully protected for future questions with regard to privacy implications. This data sits at the heart of Indian authorities’ claim to data sovereignty and it can very well be the showcase of the Government’s commitment to data privacy of its citizens.

So far, this data is, to my understanding getting aggregated with only a few departments within the Government, which has limited scope of use. If this data set generated so far and the potential of it becoming the super app and aggregator needs to reach level two, many established regulatory checks and balances, including a judicial oversight and perhaps independent third-party is a given ask. As I argued in the beginning, this juncture in India’s fight against the pandemic is the potential start of a greater robust economy, if the opportunities are well-encashed and in time. The next fortnight will be full of many such eureka moments, real-time data slicing and a policy call, someone needs to dig their head deep into the mine field.

12,17-4-20,Building coalitions to eradicate TB,"India can convert this pandemic into an opportunity by meeting health challenges and establishing its position as a global leader in combatting TB

The COVID-19 pandemic has foregrounded the urgent need for infection control and strengthening of health systems to mitigate the risk of spreading all deadly diseases, not just the current pandemic. The Indian Government has been trying to stem the spread of the Coronavirus by screening those coming into the country and also those who have come in contact with people exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 infection. It has also been tackling misinformation regarding the outbreak. This is crucial, for there are many instances where misinformation has caused panic.

However, while the world has shown exceptional solidarity in coming together and collaborating for a cure and vaccine for COVID-19, we still have an ancient disease — tuberculosis (TB) — that continues to wreak havoc especially in an overpopulated and developing country like ours.

TB has claimed more lives than any other infectious disease in history and it has struck back with a vengeance killing 4,000 and infecting 30,000 people every day across the globe. In India, as many as 1,600 people perish daily because of TB and we carry 28 per cent of the global burden, the highest in the world today. Between 2006 and 2014, the direct and indirect economic impact of the disease was nearly $350 billion.

TB adversely affects the human resource development, productivity and well-being of our nation. About 70 per cent of the patients are between the age group of 15-54. The disease results in an average loss of 40 per cent of the annual household income. It disproportionately affects the poor and the marginalised, often pushing families into vicious debt traps and poverty.

Social determinants like hygiene, sanitation, under-nutrition, migration, unplanned urbanisation, haphazard proximal living spaces, social discrimination, stigma and the emergence of drug resistance TB have further aggravated its management. Despite all efforts, we fail to identify nearly one million cases every year.

The Global Coalition Against TB (GCAT) is working to raise the level of discourse by promoting dialogue between policymakers, civil society, practitioners, domain experts and other stakeholders.

Sustained advocacy has contributed enormously to policy initiatives, such as the banning of outdated serological tests, making TB a notifiable disease, establishing the a National TB Research Consortium, providing social support for patients, using of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools to track adherence, enhancing private sector engagement and conducting advocacy for mechanisms to track progress.

GCAT participated in major global conferences, recognising that the cross-pollination of ideas, sharing knowledge and learning from proven interventions and innovations promote outcomes significantly.

The Government has done phenomenal work under the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) since its inception in 1997, having treated nearly 18 million people and achieving globally-acceptable detection and treatment rates. Even though RNTCP is most likely the world’s largest anti-TB programme, the Government’s outreach has its limitations and there are large gaps in the system, since nearly 68-70 per cent of the people are treated in the private sector.

In 2018, India hosted the ‘End TB’ summit, where the Prime Minster made a commitment to the global community to end TB in 2025, five years ahead of the deadline under the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our federal Health Minister also made similar assurances during the one-day special session on TB in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in 2018.

Under the Revised National Strategic Plan, the Government also announced the allocation of $1.8 billion for the period 2017-2020 and the deployment of 1,300 advanced molecular diagnostic machines and expansion of use of ICT. The Government must continue to integrate the private sector productively and build on the models of public-private interface and successes of project ‘JEET’ (Joint Effort for Elimination of TB).

JEET is an inspiring example of collaborative effort between the Government, international agencies and diverse civil society groups working together to set-up multi-sectoral review mechanisms, improve compliance with standards of TB care besides promoting awareness and education. The Government must aim to provide adequate molecular diagnostic machines at the grassroots level that would entail tripling the existing 14,000 microscopic centres. India has the largest pool of local governments in the world (2.5 lakh) right down to the panchayat level. These institutions can be leveraged to promote awareness and educate communities to counter social discrimination and stigma associated with TB. If we have to abide by the SDGs and liberate our country from this dreadful epidemic, we have to continue to build partnerships and alliances, step up research and development, create a strategic vision backed by strong political will, promote technology, innovation and indigenous solutions and engage the local communities. We can get inspiration from success stories of smaller countries like Cambodia, Peru and Estonia. India can convert this crisis into an opportunity by meeting these challenges and positioning itself as a global leader.

14,17-4-20,Govt to districts: Take steps to help farmers,"After relaxations were announced for the agriculture sector, the State Government has directed the district authorities to take proactive steps in assisting farmers for the ongoing Rabi season and start making preparations for Kharif crops.

The Government has already appointed 30 senior officers to monitor agriculture and related activities in all the districts in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

These nodal officers have been asked to remain in constant touch with the area-level officers to ensure that problems arising in the agriculture sector are addressed promptly. Emphasis has been put on strengthening the monitoring mechanism to ensure smooth farming operations.

A roadmap has already been prepared to ensure smooth and uninterrupted farm activities. Agriculture Minister Arun Sahoo has directed that problems being faced by farmers should be addressed at the earliest.

The nodal officers would work in coordination with the Chief District Agriculture Officers, Deputy Directors of Horticulture and Project Directors of Water Division. The officers have been asked to submit reports on a daily basis through WhatsApp.

The officers have also been asked to directly coordinate with traders, wholesalers and shopkeepers to ensure sale of fruits and vegetables at markets.

The Government has stressed on extensive use of technology and WhatsApp groups for reporting purposes in the wake of the pandemic, a senior official said.

Agriculture Secretary Saurabh Garg said the officials concerned should keep a tab on the market situation across the country and take appropriate steps for the sale of agricultural produce of the State.

The farmers should make ample use of Ama Krushi helpline in the existing situation, he said, adding that necessary steps are being taken to provide information on farming and market situations through this service.

The farmers may also get themselves enrolled in “Ama Krushi” service by giving a missed call on 0674-6667171. They can also get responses to their queries by recording their questions on this number.

Stating that there is no restriction on the sale of farm produce and transportation, Garg said his department should work in a dedicated manner to help the farmers.

While the harvesting of crops, transportation of harvested produce, transportation of farm inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides have been allowed, the outlets for the sale of agricultural inputs have been permitted to remain open for a specific period of the day by maintaining social distancing, said Garg, adding that the warehousing facilities for the inputs have also been exempted from restrictions.

To facilitate the use of farm machinery the custom hiring centres have been permitted to remain open.

The Government has taken steps for procurement of rabi produce such as green gram, black gram, groundnut, sunflower for which procurement centres have been opened. The farmers have been advised to enrol their names in e-Samrudhi portal of the NAFED.

Farmers should avail the crop loan facilities for undertaking Kharif cultivation, Garg said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-districts--take-steps-to-help-farmers.html
15,17-4-20,Keonjhar excise SI action under scanner,"To put a fight against the corona pandemic, the Government has ordered for closure of the both on and off sales of foreign liquor in the State; and the Keonjhar district excise authorities went on ordering for sealing of the all licensed foreign liquor shops to implement the Government order.

But after some days, it was found that the sealing of the shops is just eyewash and some corrupt officials of the department are encouraging the dishonest foreign liquor owners to sell liquor.

This came to light on Wednesday at about 11 in the morning when Excise SI Nirakar Dehury reached Joda town to reseal a shop located near Mahaveer Square. It was alleged that the shop owner in order to indulge in illegal sale of liquor had broken the seal of the shop and then informed the concerned official that the seal had been broken by some miscreant.

Accordingly, Dehury reached the spot. As per rules, the SI should have made a stock verification of the shop, inquired into the other circumstantial evidences and lodged a complaint in the local police station. But instead of observing any such formalities, he closed the matter by just resealing the shop putting a question mark on the action of the Excise Department.

When contacted, the Keonjhar Excise Superintendent said the Champua Excise Inspector has been ordered to inquire to the matter and action would be taken against whosoever violated the law.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/keonjhar-excise-si-action-under-scanner.html

17,17-4-20,‘Teach online’ best option during lockdown,"No school student in Wuhan missed classes as they were conducted 76 days online (The Pioneer Editorial 14.04.2020). This statement sounds simple but reveals a great advancement of technology application in education by China. In the most adverse time also, the education system continued as usual, there by injected confidence among students and parents. This will immensely help in controlling panic in the society during the pandemic.

In India too, many institutions have kept their teaching online and stood firm behind the students and their future. They are making all round efforts to continue the academic year through adoption of ICT. The Dhirubhai Ambani International School at Bandra-Kurla reopened classes online for the students of Class 10 and 12. The HVB Global Academy of Mumbai drafted an online lessons policy which outlines rules to be followed by the students, teachers and parents during the classes. This is limited to the elite private academic institutions. Even a Government College located in a rural area of Burdwan under the Burdwan University started floated live e-classes for the students to help complete the syllabus. They launched a fresh website dedicated to accommodate live online classes. They also used the apps like Webex used by the IITs for live coaching classes. The IGNOU Bhubaneswar regional office successfully conducted online classes and induction programmes through ZOOM app during the lockdown period.

The use of technology in education can be broadly classified into four categories. The first one is the teacher preparation and their CPD (Continuous Professional Development). It is necessary for the teachers to receive adequate training in how to leverage technology to improve educational outcomes. The second important area where technology can have big impact is in the class room processes of teaching, learning and evaluation. The third area is the use of technology to improve access to education for disadvantaged groups including differently-abled students, girls and women and students living in remote areas. The fourth area is the planning, administration and management of the whole education system of the country.

The National Education Policy 2019 also stressed on these four areas of technology application. The irony is that there are several ICT initiatives of MHRD, UGC, Information and Library Network (INFLIBNET) and Consortium for Educational Communication (CEC)in the form of digital platforms which can be accessed by the students, teachers, researchers for broadening their knowledge horizons. The most useful ITC initiatives are SWAYAM on line courses, UG/PG MOOCs, e-PG Pathshala, e-content courseware in UG subjects, SWAYAMPRABHA DTH Channels, CEC-UGC You Tube Channel, National Digital Library, Shodhganga and eShodh-Sindhu which offer access to 15,000 core and peer reviewed journals. The MHRD and the UGC are trying to make them popular but many of the teaching fraternity are not aware of these things, forget about the students. Our Educational Satellite launched in 2004 with a life span of seven years came to an end with barely ten per cent of its capacity used. If the teachers are aware of these technologies and use them for enhancing the knowledge of their students, the fear of losing the academic years will never arise.

Recently, the MHRD initiated a campaign ‘Bharat Padhe Online’ inviting suggestions and sharing of ideas from academic fraternity including students and teachers to boost e-learning and online education in India. The suggestions and ideas can be given either twitter #BharatPadheOnline and tagging @HRD Ministry and @DrRPNishank or by sending through email at bharatpadheonline.mhrd@gmail.com This is time all the educationists, academicians, planners and other administrators to share their ideas to strengthen our online education initiatives.

There is every need to adopt the technology as nobody knows how long the lockdown will continue and we cannot sit idle waiting for its lifting. The health of the students is as important as their education and the right use of ICT can take care of both.

The pachyderm found ill at least a week ago had stopped its movement. From the tipoff of locals, Badamba Range Officer Saroj Kumar Mohanty reached the spot, found its lower jaw cracked and started treatment through a local veterinary doctor.

As per the protocol, saline, antibiotics and painkillers were given. Subsequently, when its condition deteriorated, no proactive measure was taken by the department. Nor was a doctor of OUAT consulted.

For the last seven days, no higher forest officer was seen at the site of the elephant for suggesting better treatment.

21,17-4-20,JSpur’s 100% e-office a role model in governance,"There was a compelling situation to transform all Government functions into e-office one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Offices were to be run in digital mode which is an transformation from the previous bulky paper works with sticky, torn apart dusty files etc. without any tracking on e-governance practices.

Jagatsinghpur district is perhaps the only one in the country to get the benefits of e-office to help the district administration in time of COVID-19 pandemic. The newly introduced e-office in Jagtsinghpur has proved to be a boon especially when the lockdown due to COVID-19 has put restrictions on movement of people, except emergency departments.

However, the model e-office practice introduced and executed by the district administration has proved to be a boon for people, staff and for safety reasons. Daily on an average 40-50 files are approved by the District Magistrate without any hindrance and so far more than 3,000 files have been disposed.

Jagatsinghpur district administration on April 15 became the district with 100 per cent e-office with fully paperless one starting from the top to the bottom. On this day, the district achieved absolutely 100 per cent e-office from top to the village level. It is a model of good governance, near paperless office and model of digital India and transformation under 5T using technology.

The e-office system in entire Collectorate and district level offices along with subdivision and block/tehsil level offices and further down the line upto RI etc has been fully functional. As a result, there is no physical movement of files now. The staff can process and approve the files with the help of desktop, home computer or mobile phones within no time.

Therefore, the files move from lower levels to the Collector instantly and get approved. Now people are getting the benefits even in COVID19 situations. So, all the offices such as DRDA, Municipality, NAC, ADM, Subcollector, Block, Tehsil, RWSS, RTO, all district level offices, CDVO, CDMPH, district agriculture, labour, employment exchange, Paradeep Development Authority, Subregistrar etc are run under one system. As a case in point, the Jagatsinghpur Municipality sent bills to the Collector with photos of work, signage and estimate in e-office and the Collector referring all these approved it. What can be more transparent than this? The administration always focuses on ensuring disposal of files at a quicker pace.

From February 1 the entire District Collectorate became paperless with e-office practices successfully. From February 26 all education offices in the district and from March 5 DRDA, all blocks, tehsils, agriculture, fisheries, labour and all other departments functioned as e-office system. It is a model of good governance. On April 15, the entire district became paperless which is a milestone for the State and the country. The laggards in file disposal are taken to task too.

The entire district administration toiled hard for past six months or so since I joined in office as District Magistrate in Jagatsinghpur to fulfill the goals set under 5T by the visionary Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. Mapping was done throughout the district from the office of the clerk to the Collector. Accordingly, computer systems and other gadgets of ICT were provided, training labs constituted, several rounds of handholding support and weekly follow up and review was conducted. Accordingly, the entire LAN switching was done with the help of NIC New Delhi and Bhubaneswar with regular touch and atlast we became successful.

The names of all the sanctioning officers are on display along with files attached to each of them like the note--sheet. On the right side of the file, corresponding documents can be seen to view it and pass orders. We are committed to ensure the entire district and Jagatsinghpur to have e-office with least time of disposal of files in the entire district. This is a real transformation using technology.

This will also completely prevent delay, red-tapism, gathering of dusts over files, administrative harassment to common man, corruption and venal practices in the governance. Several social security pensions such as old age and widow pensions along with stipend for divyang have been hailed all through the district. This will ensure a feeling of having people’s administration among citizens fearlessly and the later are coming forward with grievances in more numbers for redressal which was not so earlier as people had apathy and fear to approach Government agencies.

Out of each 100 workers in the district about 55% are engaged in agricultural sector. It is the second densely populated district in Odisha, despite having a smaller area. It has an international gateway as the Paradip Port with a large hinterland catering to transportation of large quantity of minerals leading to national income. Paradip, a modern deep water port has now become a hot business destination due to the large foreign direct investment. The port town of the district has already emerged as one of the country’s major investment hot spots by attracting investment in excess of the tune of Rs 3.5 lakh crores.

Several large scale industries/ public sector undertakings such as Paradeep Phosphates Limited, Paradip Plastic Park Limited, IFFCO- Fertiliser Plant, Essar Steel's Pellet plant, Indian Oil marketing terminal, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) Refinery, Goa carbon, Skol Breweries Ltd. ( Unit-East Coast Brewery), HPCL terminal and Bharat Petroleum Corp etc are located here. There are many medium scale industries with exportable items in Paradip regions which attracts thousands of workers and entrepreneurs. Many global players such as JSW Utkalare in the offing of unfolding their highest investment, have rekindled hopes. On the other, the district has witnessed infamous worst natural disasters in human history and is experiencing in recent years too. So, all these put pressure on Government to adopt a model system of administration as envisaged in 5T and Good Governance.

22,17-4-20,Capt seeks views to mop up funds to cover tax losses,"Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday send an SOS as the State is staring at the revenue losses to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore for the 2020-21 financial year, in view of the Covid-19 crisis.

Stepping in, all Cabinet Ministers have voluntarily decided not to take their salaries for the next three months and donate it to the Chief Minister’s Covid Relief Fund. At the same time, the Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh has appealed all the Government employees to take “voluntary cuts” in the wages to help the State meet the unprecedented contingency.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Finance Sub-Committee, constituted recently under the Chief Minister to take stock of the fiscal implications of the Covid-19

pandemic and the lockdown or curfew triggered by it, and find ways of generating review to compensate for the losses and meet the costs resulting from the current crisis.

Finance Minister Manpreet Badal informed the meeting that of the Rs 88,000 crore revenue receipts estimated to be raised by the State for the current fiscal, only Rs 66,000 crore would now be generated in the light of the curfew or lockdown, which had brought all business, tax receipts etc to a standstill and also resulting in lower GST collections.

“All the Ministers in the State have voluntarily decided to donate their full salaries, for the next three months, to the CM’s Covid Relief Fund,” said an official spokesperson after the meeting.

Chief Secretary, acting on the directives of the Chief Minister who was not in favour of salary cuts of employees, issued an appeal asking “all Government employees, and all employees of PSUs, local bodies, Boards and Corporations, to volunteer to contribute their pay and allowance to the Government mission to combat Covid-19”.

The Chief Secretary suggested that Grade A and B employees should contribute 30 percent, Grade C should contribute 20 percent and Grade D should contribute 10 percent of their monthly emoluments for April, May and June 2020 to the CM’s Relief Fund to strengthen the Government’s efforts to deal with the deadly pandemic and the huge losses resulting from the current crisis.

The meeting also discussed several measures to mop up revenue in the prevailing situation, due to which the State was witnessing a massive financial crunch, that was likely to continue for another couple of quarters at least.

The Chief Minister urged the committee members to look at innovative measures to tackle the crisis.

Manpreet informed the meeting that with all manufacturing or production almost completely shut, and no taxes or duties forthcoming on account of Transport, Excise or Stamp Duty etc, the State was set to lose out on Rs 22,000 crore against revenue receipts.

“With GST collections to be much lower during the year and with the Centre yet to clear a significant amount of the state’s pending GST arrears, things will continue to worsen in the coming months,” he warned while pointing out that the State is also yet to receive any special financial package towards Covid relief from the Centre.

The sub-committee will meet again in a day or two to further discuss measures to generate more revenue and cut down expenses across departments to meet the costs for Covid related medical and relief operations, in addition to the routine Government expenditure.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/capt-seeks-views-to-mop-up-funds-to-cover-tax-losses.html

Making an exception from the laid down norms, Gupta has also conferred the DGP’s Commendation Disc on a non-uniformed official of the Mandi Board, Yadwinder Singh AR, who is posted as AR in Patiala Market Committee, recognizing that he was part of the joint party of the Police and the Mandi Board.

“The promotion or awards are in recognition of the display of outstanding devotion to duty, patience in the face of provocation, courage and presence of mind of all these men, and to motivate other police officers to continue performing their duties without any fear,” he said.

Besides promoting ASI Harjeet Singh to the local rank of Sub-Inspector, his name has also been approved for inclusion in List D-II, which is a fast track route for promotion to the substantive rank of ASI (the substantive rank of Harjeet Singh is Head Constable), as laid down in the Punjab Police Rules for recognition of Police Officials of exceptional merit, said Gupta.

All the four police officers and AR Yadwinder Singh were seriously injured in the incident, wherein a white colour ISUZU DMX vehicle, carrying about 5/6 persons, on being signalled to stop outside the main gate of the Sabzi Mandi, had crashed into the main gate and also broken the Police barricades ahead.

When the joint party approached the vehicle, it was attacked by Balwinder Singh, Jagmeet Singh, Beant Singh, Nirbhai Singh and their 2/3 associates with sharp edged weapons, including swords and

‘barchas’.

Pointing out that the attack by the band of criminals was very sudden and vicious, the DGP observed that while ASI Harjeet Singh’s left hand was chopped off in the incident, SHO Bilkar Singh had to be sutured and plastered for many sharp cuts on his left arm. The other police officers also had to be hospitalized for treatment of their injuries.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/patiala-attack--asi-harjeet-singh-promoted-as-si.html

Apart from these activities, forest watering, irrigation and mining operations should also be carried out in a phased manner ensuring proper health protocols.

She said Police Department would be playing an important role in monitoring and ensuring the adherence of guidelines issued for carrying out the economic operations in a systematic manner. She directed that every deputy Commissioner should do systematic planning of carrying out these operations as per the lockdown protocol in containment zones.

Presiding over a meeting of the Crisis Coordination Committee with the nodal and officers appointed for

Covid-19, through video conferencing here, she directed that as the MNREGA labour is allowed for activities especially irrigation operations and water conservation, therefore the officers concerned should strictly ensure and closely monitor issuing of the e-Passes to everyone involved in these operations.

She directed that Deputy Commissioners should ensure that only those brick-kilns should be opened which have been given permission by the NGT.

Arora directed that the Industry Department should issue immediate directions to all the industrialists and establishments to adhere to the checklist as per Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) given by the Ministry of Home Affairs guidelines. Apart from this, a system should be kept in place for the issuing of e-Passes. She directed that the passes should be strictly issued only for going to the place of work and back to home.

She shared that the IMAs should sensitize their doctors to report the symptoms of such patients immediately and strict action would be taken against those showing negligence.

The chief secretary directed that as the General OPDs would again be starting from April 20, therefore the officers concerned should ensure that the visiting of OPDs should be done in a staggered manner so that the social distancing norm should be strictly adhered to.

25,17-4-20,Has Covid-19 cured all other diseases?,"A sudden decrease in the number of patients in all hospitals of Keonjhar district during the corona-induced lockdown has posed a question mark as to whether health services are still accessible to the common people.

According to sources, about 500 patients visit the District Headquarters Hospital (DHH) on a normal day, but the number has drastically fallen after the lockdown came into force.

This overcrowded hospital has now many vacant beds in wards while only a few patients are visiting the OPD.

This trend has also been marked in all PHCs and CHCs. Keonjher is a malaria-prone district and has high child mortality rate and maternity mortality rate and malnutrition cases. Now, question is if the coronavirus crisis has magically healed all these diseases!

The halting of all public transport system and strict action by police to keep people confined at home during the lockdown can be the reason behind many serious patients being unable to reach hospitals. The district health authorities claim to have put adequate ambulance service for patients, but it seems the service has failed to shift the patients or the patients are not able to access this service.

Most of the drug stores in the district are running with shortage of various medicines. The Health Department has focussed so much on Covid-19 that normal treatment of other deceases is at stake. The blood banks are also running out of stock.

While the district administration has begun a door-to-door survey to find out corona suspects by engaging health and Anganwadi Workers, people suffering from other diseases are bound to be neglected, view many.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/has-covid-19-cured-all-other-diseases-.html

33,17-4-20,"After being declared hotspot, UT to follow two new protocols","With Chandigarh being declared as Covid-19 hotspot (red zone) by the Central Government, the UT Administration will now follow two new protocols including testing all suspect cases and stringent measures to restrict unnecessary movement at the city’s borders.

Chandigarh, which is a joint capital of Punjab and Haryana, has been declared as Covid-19 (Coronavirus) hotspot, in a list of 170 such districts released by the Central Government.

The city has so far recorded 21 positive Coronavirus cases, out of which nine have already recovered and no death has been reported till Thursday evening. No new positive case has been reported in the past four days.

While 1738 were put in home quarantine as a precautionary measure, 1328 have completed the quarantine period.

UT Home-cum-Health Secretary Arun Kumar Gupta told The Pioneer, “Since the city has been declared a Coronavirus hotspot by the Central Government, the Administration would be following two additional protocols. Now, testing of all suspect cases would be done and strict measures will be taken to restrict movement at city’s border.”

Elaborating, Gupta said, “Earlier, testing of symptomatic cases, asymptomatic direct contacts and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case were done. Now, testing of all suspect cases will be done. If anyone is reporting influenza like illness (ILI) symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose), that person will be tested for Coronavirus within 3-4 days in the city. Though the protocol says seven days, we have decided to conduct test in such cases in 3-4 days.”

He said, “The entire city is now a containment zone, so stringent measures would be taken at city’s borders to restrict movement. We have given 50 thermal scanning devices to the UT Police to ensure thermal screening at all the city’s border areas. Besides, movement of individuals at inter-state borders will be allowed only for essential services and urgent reasons.”

“Another protocol is to conduct door to door survey for Coronavirus symptoms, which had already begun in Chandigarh. 6.85 lakh city’s population has been covered through door to door survey and screening till now,” Gupta said.

“During the ongoing survey, 3 cases were found to have Coronavirus symptoms but they have been tested negative for the disease,” he added.

A nationwide lockdown had begun from March 25 (12 am) while curfew was imposed in Chandigarh on March 24 (12 am) to ensure social distancing and combat the spread of Coronavirus.

The UT Administration has already approached Punjab and Haryana Governments to run their offices in Chandigarh with minimal staff, since the entire city has been declared as hotspot district and is under curfew. Apart from this, the UT Director General of Police has been directed to intensify checking in borders and to ensure that only the pass-holders and authorized persons are allowed to enter the capital city.

Notably, as per Centre’s guidelines, restrictions will continue to apply on Covid-19 hotspots for the next 28 days and there will be no relaxations after April 20, which will be applicable to non-hotspots in the country. A district, however, could move from the red to the green zone if it does not report any case for 28 days, and vice-versa.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/after-being-declared-hotspot--ut-to-follow-two-new-protocols.html

44,17-4-20,Social distancing norms violated by Punjab Min,"In an apparent zeal to inspect the ongoing wheat procurement process and score brownie points, Punjab Minister and lawmakers on Thursday virtually ended up violating the lockdown and social distancing norms.

Ashu, the minister in-charge, take stock of the ongoing process at state’s biggest grain market at Khanna. And in the process, he and many others neglected the social distancing. Besides the dignitaries, Ashu’s gunmen also accompanied him.

Even though they all have been seen wearing face masks, they were standing close to each other, posing for the shutterbugs.

In an irony of sorts, Ashu, while talking with the media later on, said that the social distancing norms are being enforced in the mandis in accordance with which box measuring 30 feet x 30 feet have been marked at two meters distance.

Later, Ashu also visited Mullanpur grain market along with Congress’ Ludhiana MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, senior Congress leader Capt Sandeep Singh Sandhu, and several others — flouting social distancing norms.

More than 250 people have been infected with the water-borne disease, which is a common reoccurrence in the capital city with start of summer.

This year, the jaundice outbreak has struck in a huge level, putting the state health department and the Raipur Municipal Corporation on its toes.

Meanwhile, an advocate in a letter to the city civic body, citing a verdict of PIL, has pointed out that the Raipur Municipal Corporation (RMC) has to supply potable water in tankers to the affected areas, change of pipelines and other necessary steps to mitigate the water-borne disease.

A release by the state health department said until Wednesday, 116 people with jaundice were admitted to hospitals while 33 people have recovered and discharged.

It further said that 78 people suffering from jaundice are undergoing treatment at the district hospital.

Satnam Panag, chairman of RMC water resources committee said, “The filter bed of the water filtration plant has not been cleaned since it was constructed. The filter bed is muddy and was full of worms.”

In addition, the stream from the stop-dam to the suction pump, due to low water level, and lower flow, polluted water is being sucked into the water filtration plant, Panag said.

53,17-4-20,CM launches mobile App to help migrant labourers,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren today launched a mobile application to help more than eight lakh migrant labourers of Jharkhand stuck in different parts of the country during the nationwide lockdown. Through the App not only the database of the labourers could be made but it will also help the Government to provide them with emergency funds for sustenance.

The CM said during the launch of the App that within the next one week, the State Government will provide financial assistance by identifying the workers of the State, who are stuck in different states of the country. This amount will be transferred directly to the migrant labourers through DBT in their bank account. This amount will be at least Rs 1000. The CM said that the State Government has made an effort to reach the migrant labourers with the Jharkhand Special Assistance Scheme mobile app. Through this App, financial assistance will be provided to migrant laborers.

Soren said that the goal of the government is to provide financial assistance to the migrant labourers of the State within the coming week and day through the App. He said that the government of Jharkhand has been working with limited resources since the early days of Coronavirus spread. In the first phase of the lockdown, a team of officers has been continuously coordinating with other states to provide dry ration etc to the workers of Jharkhand trapped outside the State. The team of officers is continuously working on how to help more and more people.

The CM said that in this hour of Covid-19, the present government has full sympathy with the workers, tribals, dalits, poor, helpless people of Jharkhand. In this hour of crisis, the biggest problem is the labourers and poor people. The government is most concerned about these poor people. The CM said that due to lack of employment in the State, people migrate for employment to other states, due to sudden lockdown, the laborers were stuck where they were. He said that the period of lockdown has been extended, due to which troubles have increased. The entire system of the State government is trying to get maximum assistance in this hour of disaster.

Soren expressed confidence that the mobile App will prove to be a milestone for the help of migrant labourers. The App has been specially created by the team of officials to help the labourers and other State residents trapped in various states of the country during Lockdown 2.

54,17-4-20,"Door-to-door search for suspected cases, focus on fringe areas","East Singhbhum district administration has embarked on drive to identify Covid-19 suspected cases. Teams formed under three civic bodies of Jamshedpur, Jugsalai and Mango are covering house-to-house to prepare report of people having record of travel history or having symptoms of coronavirus.

The final report will help the district surveillance in monitoring those undergoing quarantine at state centre’s or at homes.

In a massive exercise to identify everybody with travel history either from overseas or domestic, East Singhbhum district administration has also decided to touch all the houses in the district.

With help of the 2011 census, East Singhbhum has identified over 4,76,931 houses in the 11 blocks of the districts (including the urban Jamshedpur-Jugsalai block) and to reach out to each of the houses has mobilised not only the over 1700 sahiyas and anganbari sevikas but also the 1885 booth level officers (entrusted after polling booths during election), panchayat raj institutions and even thana-level community leaders.

We do not want to leave any scope in tracing out an individual who might have come from abroad or from another state or district to East Singhbhum and want to reach each of the houses in urban and rural areas of the district in a limited time span. We have decided to involve everyone entrusted with implementation of government schemes and activities in the exercise and want to complete it within a week,” said East Singhbhum deputy commissioner Ravi Shankar Shukla. Special attention is being given to the elderly, pregnant women and those with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and low immunity.

The team is distributing pamphlets on the measures to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19. They would also be informed about quarantine measures for those showing symptoms such as cold, cough and fever.

After identification of the suspected cases, they would be shifted to the isolation ward at the district headquarters hospital.

The administration is taking other steps to deal with the outbreak. A doctor has been made part of the disaster management control room round-the-clock to provide advice, and has also appealed to people not to panic.

This is apart from the screening, testing and quarantine efforts being taken by the administration.

This is an awareness-cum-surveillance drive. They are informed of the symptoms and asked if any resident has them. If there is such a person, we can move them into isolation.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/door-to-door-search-for-suspected-cases--focus-on-fringe-areas.html

He said that the farmers are facing to take their crops to the markets and are forced to sell it at throwaway prices. The PCC president said that every Congress party member is standing with the poor during this period of crisis precipitated by outbreak of novel Coronavirus. “We are making arrangements of distributing cooked meals to the poor by the means of Sonia kitchens and Indira kitchens at many places in the State.

56,17-4-20,U’khand babus maintaining distance from offices,"The State secretariat of Uttarakhand continued to wear a deserted look on Thursday even as Central Government- whose guidelines on COVID-19 are being ardently followed by Trivendra Singh Rawat Government - has directed officers above the rank of deputy secretaries and above to start working from their offices.

The State secretariat of Uttarakhand which is the epicentre of all Government activities has almost ceased all operations ever since the lockdown was enforced in the State on March 22 to break the infection cycle of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).

On the call given by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the State is under second phase of lockdown which would continue till May 3. The Union Government which has earlier allowed its officers work from home during the first phase of lockdown has asked all officers of the rank of deputy secretary and above to attend offices from Thursday. The officers of the joint secretary and above had started attending their offices from Monday (April 13).

This correspondent made a reality check of the secretariat on Thursday and found out that barring few, locks dangled on the doors of the offices of senior bureaucrats.

Though Chief Secretary, Utpal Kumar Singh, was present at his office, the additional chief secretaries (ACS), Radha Raturi and Om Prakash — who heads many important departments — were conspicuous by their absence.

Their offices seemed to have been closed for days. Interestingly enough, the all important secretary, Nitesh Jha was also not present in his office. Jha holds charge of health and home departments, the two most important departments which are playing stellar role in the fight to contain the spread of the COVID-19.

His personal secretary however was present in his office. Similarly secretary in- charge, B K Sant was also not found in his office.

The additional secretary of medical health and Mission Director (MD) of National Health Mission (NHM) was also not present in his office.

These days this officer works from his office located at state health directorate.

It was found that in the sprawling Vishwakarma building of the secretariat, the secretary (in-charge), Bhupal Singh Manral was the only senior officer who was

present in his office.

While on one hand, the senior officers of Uttarakhand spearheading different departments are continuing to maintain distance from their workplaces on the other hand their counterparts in Centre and other States have started working from offices.

Interestingly the state government has directed the administration to prepare work plan for the partial relaxations which the Government intends to provide in the districts where the cases of COVID-19 have not been reported. Similarly there is a big challenge before the government to bring the economy back on track after the lockdown is lifted.

The problems of farmers, stranded migrants and the issue of ready to be harvested Rabi crops also require deft handling and immediate decisions.

It is clear that these things cannot be done from a closed secretariat. Senior journalist, Rajendra Joshi said, “The senior officers should come to their offices so that things don’t become messy when the lockdown opens.

Moreover, secretariat is not a place which can get crowded by general public.’’",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/u---khand-babus-maintaining-distance-from-offices.html
57,17-4-20,Authorities continue psychological counselling in relief camps,"Medical counsellors and psychiatrists are providing regular counselling for people from other districts and States and currently living in relief camps of Dehradun district. Also, the suspected COVID-19 patients besides the positive tested patients in isolation are also being provided counselling by the administration.

Several people including labourers and daily wagers who got stuck in the city after the implementation of lockdown are sheltered in about 22 relief camps by the district administration.

To keep them motivated during the lockdown period, daily psychological counselling sessions are being provided to all. According to the chief medical superintendent of State Mental Health Institute, Selaqui, Dr Abhishek Gupta,"" We received directions from the State administration to form a team of medical counsellors and psychiatrists in order to carry out regular psychological counselling of the people staying in the relief camps of Dehradun."" Most of the people want to return to their homes so the team asks them to be patient, support the administration and remain positive besides maintaining their hygiene and social distancing in the camps.” He further informed that the counselling was commenced from April 1 and those in relief camps are being counselled every day.

Talking about the counselling of suspected patients in quarantine and positive patients in isolation in the hospital, Dr Gupta said that these patients are also being provided counselling.

He added that once a patient or person is first counselled, follow up counselling is also being carried out, especially through phones or online in case of infected patients, to know the status of their mental conditions.

The Dehradun Chief Development Officer (CDO) Nikita Khandelwal said that the two types of counselling are being carried out. ""In the relief camps, psychological counselling is being provided besides the means of entertainment like television, board games and sometimes a Yoga teacher teaches Yoga,” informed Khandelwal.

She further informed surveillance and counselling is being done for suspected patients in quarantine. The doctors call the patients and ask them about their health or any issues they might have which helps to understand the mental condition of patients, added the CDO.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/authorities-continue-psychological-counselling-in-relief-camps.html
58,17-4-20,Covid-19: Unlocking a battery of heinous crimes,"As the nation heads towards an extended lockdown till May 3, boredom is the least of our issues. While the pandemic has lead to an unprecedented scenario which entails the release of prisoners on bail or parole, it has also unearthed a surge in offences especially against women and children. The irksome quarantine has acted like a trigger for the depraved minds creating a grim picture of violence within the four walls. “Violence is not confined to the battlefield”, these words of the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres clearly depict the tragic status quo.

Up to one billion children aged between 2 to 17 years, have experienced physical, sexual or emotional violence or neglect in the past year as per global estimation. Childline helpline 1098- a 24x7 free, emergency phone service for children in need of help, which usually receives two lakh calls in a week has witnessed an enormous increase since March 24- the day when the lockdown was first imposed.

The data of Women and Child Development Ministry represents majority of the callers claiming abuse and the others highlighting issues like stress, physical health, child labour, missing cases, homeless and sickness and queries on coronavirus among others. Violence against children includes all forms of violence against people aged below 18 years, whether perpetrated by parents, caregivers, peers, partners or strangers.

It is not only the children but also the mothers or women in a more exhaustive sense, who face similar atrocities. Domestic violence being the leading crime against women has shown no drop in these testing times. On the contrary the complaints of sexual, physical and mental harassment have also accelerated. A crime like this which usually gets unreported due to various social challenges faced by the individual has been converted to 100 complaints via emails and over 300 complaints related to various offences during the last two weeks.

According to UN Women, a United Nations entity working for the empowerment of women, globally 243 million girls and women aged 15-49 years have been subjected to physical violence perpetuated by a known persons in the past 12 months.

The confinement has fostered an environment of tension making such victims feel more vulnerable, as they are unable to leave their houses. The inaccessibility to various support networks has made it even worse for the children or women to seek help or escape.

It is the need of the hour for the authorities to step in by taking proactive measures to protect the dignity of children and women - their fundamental right as a facet of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, while also ensuring their safety. The judiciary, Government and its law enforcement agencies must mobilise to ensure that such acts of violence are given utmost priority with no impunity to the culprit.

The measures which can be adopted should include enhanced toll free hotlines round the clock, free text message services, remote psychological support, child care cash transfers, other online tools and networks to amplify social support system and a comprehensive mechanism to reach the victims with no access to mobile phones or internet.

It is not only a moral obligation but also a constitutional duty of the government to safeguard the rights and provide protection against violence to every citizen. In consonance with the objectives enshrined in the directive principles of our State policy it is the primary duty of the State to raise the level of nutrition, render food security and bring improvement in public health which would in turn assist in care of the destitute women and children. The crimes during lockdown are not limited to just a few, as novel misdemeanours and ghastly acts have taken the centre stage.

While some of the essential services distributors and retailers are defrauding the consumers even after constant warnings by the authorities, some patients infected with the virus are attacking the doctors and nurses treating them.

Even some of the common masses after defying the lockdown are acting in contempt of the police (including the latest diabolical incident of chopping the hand of the Punjab police personnel), there is an increment in the number of cyber crimes with the sale of counterfeit health care products- masks, sanitisers and substandard personal protective equipments being the most promising venture. While criminals have been swift to seize opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modus operandi or diversifying the criminal activities, it is our window of opportunity to act as vigilant community watchdogs to debunk such offences in every possible way. Stay positive, stay civilised and remain quarantined.

61,17-4-20,Paddy difference amount to farmers soon: Congress,"nThe state Congress on Thursday said a budgetary provision for the difference in the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy has already been made by the state government and it will soon be paid to the farmers.

Replying to a demand raised by the BJP in this regard, state Congress general secretary and chairman of the communication wing Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said the state government was sensitive to the need of the farmers in this crucial time and soon the balance amount will be paid to them.

Notable, chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had announced to pay Rs 2,500 per quintal to farmers for paddy procured by the state government.

Trivedi further said that due to some bindings as per the Centre’s instructions, the state government had procured paddy from farmers in the state at the MSP prescribed by the Centre—the MSP for the common grade paddy at Rs 1,815 per quintal and for grade A crop at Rs 1,835.

“As the state government had promised that the paddy would be procured from the farmers at the rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal.

“But by doing so the Centre, due to its policy decision, was unable to take the surplus rice from the state in the central pool under the National Food Security Act, through the Food Corporation of India,” he said.

So keeping in view of the technical difficulty, the state government will now disburse the balance amount of Rs 685 per quintal in the bank accounts of the farmers in the state as the Congress government in the state had promised, he said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/paddy-difference-amount-to-farmers-soon--congress.html

63,17-4-20,Marandi missive to CM over migrant labourers’ woes,"Amid reports of migrant workers walking down to their villages due to lockdown in the Country BJP legislative party leader Babulal Marandi has urged the State Government to help them reach their villages. The BJP legislative party leader said that he is pained seeing thousands of migrant labourers stranded in various parts of cities.

“I am pained at seeing thousands of migrant labourers from the State standard at different parts of country. These people are facing difficult times as they neither have food nor accommodation. They are poor people and it is our duty to help them,"" said Marandi.

He further said, “When so many people from the State are stranded at different parts of country we can send aircrafts to get them back. Everyone wants to stay with their families during such time of crisis. We must help them and I urged the State government to take a quick action in this connection.""

The senior BJP leader in this connection has written a letter to Chief Minister Hemant Soren and State Labour resource Minister Satyanand Bhokta to airlift labourers. Marandi has also urged the State government to send different teams of senior government officials to different parts of country where migrant labourers are stranded. According to Marandi labourers from the State go to Surat, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, Jaipur, Gaziabad and other cities in search of bread and butter.

The Jharkhand government has set up control rooms, through which these labourers’ contact tracing is being done. The state government, along with several NGOs and civil societies, has tried to reach out to these labourers. Moreover public representatives such as MPs, MLAs are also receiving phone calls from migrant labourers. Marandi's letter to Chief Minister assumes importance as recently CPI-ML MLA from Bagodar Vinod Singh has tried to draw the attention of State government towards labourers woe’s. Singh targeting MPs from Bihar and Jharkhand has said that these two states have 54 MPs, but none of them have taken any initiative to help out migrant labourers. Singh giving reference from a newspaper report has highlighted that a MP from Andhra Pradesh has helped 1000 labourers in reaching homes from Varanasi.

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended the 21-day lockdown upto May 3 these migrant labourers problem is going to escalate in coming days. Sources said that as many as 75 per cent of labourers have already lost one to three weeks of work. The loss of income is proving to be catastrophic on several fronts. Most of the migrant labourers and daily wage earners fear they will run out of food before the end of lockdown on May 3. Moreover many also worry that they will not be able to find work once the lockdown ends.

68,17-4-20,Govt provides grains to 3L people with no ration cards,"The Food and Supply Department of the Delhi Government has provided grains to over 3 lakh poor who had no ration cards to help them tide over the lockdown.

The department of food and supplies is making all out efforts towards meeting the food requirements of the poor and vulnerable sections of the city. The department, in a statement, said that the distribution was started on April 7. Besides, steps were also taken to provide ration to the PDS (public distribution system) cardholders.

In Delhi, the Public Distribution System (PDS) caters to 17.50 lakh households covering 71,08,074 beneficiaries including 68,609 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) households with 2,78,926 beneficiaries. The usual monthly quota of food grains under ‘National Food Security Act’ (NFSA) is 5 kg including 4 kg of wheat and 1 kg of rice, it said.

However, recognising the need of the hour and the restrictions in mobility of people due to imposition of lockdown, the Delhi Government has provided 7.5 kgs of food grains (including 6 kgs of wheat and 1.5 kgs of rice) free of cost, it added.

The department further said that the distribution of food grains for the month of April started in advance from 28th March, 2020 onwards through network of 2017 Fair Price Shops.

“Almost 100 per cent of the entitled allocation has been delivered most of which has been distributed. This has provided much needed relief to the people particularly those from the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections,” it said.

It further said that after realising that there may be a significant number of people who may be in need of food during these difficult times and who may not be covered by the PDS, the government launched a relief initiative for providing 4 kgs of wheat and 1kg of rice to all those who are in need of food free of cost.

“The initiative is based on self selection criteria where any person in need of food can apply through an online link of Janta Samvad - ration.jantasamvad.org/ration,” it said, adding that the only document required is that the person should be in possession of an aadhaar number issued from anywhere in the country.

In order to optimally utilise available resources, 374 schools of Directorate of Education, municipal Corporations and New Delhi Municipal Council have been designated as Distribution centers under the above relief initiative. T

he programme was launched on the 7th of April and till date over 3 lakh beneficiaries have been provided food grains.

To inform and educate the targeted beneficiaries regarding their entitlements multimedia publicity through SMS, Radio Jingle, flex banners etc. is being undertaken on a regular basis.

The department is making all out efforts to ensure the smooth and timely delivery and distribution of food grains to the beneficiaries despite severe shortages of labour and availability of trucks and other logistics constrains due to the ongoing lockdown.

“Civil defence volunteers have been deployed at the Fair Price Shops to ensure social distancing norms and orderly distribution of food grains,” it said, adding that the departmental officials including assistant commissioners, food supply officers and food supply inspectors have also been deployed in the field round the clock to facilitate the distribution of food grains.

“All Department Officials and the distribution team of fair price shops and schools are working seven days a week without any weekly off. The Members of vigilance committee are actively monitoring the distribution process. The Deputy Chief Minister, Minister Food and Supplies and the area MLAs are inspecting the distribution centres to motivate the staff and to ensure smooth distribution,” it added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-provides-grains-to-3l-people-with-no-ration-cards.html

Recalling the ‘horror’ caused by communal clashes, Kumar said a “Muslim mob” of 200 people forcibly entered his building during riots and started pelting stones from my balcony. “How can I deny food to a hungry? Sometimes, there are children aged 5 to 10 year from a particular community standing in queue waiting for their turn. I am giving food to everyone who needed it at this time,” he said. “Feeding the poor and hungry is a noble cause. Thousands of people have benefitted with this initiative till now. It is a continuous process. We will keep reaching to those in need of food at this time,” he added.

We have widened and reaching out to more people to help them to tide over the crisis,” he said.

“We all were very frightened as my father was not at home when the riots had started, my little sister got scared and started crying. It was all very difficult to forget what happened when us but now even my father and family members are helping me in distributing food even for Muslim families living around the area,’ he said.

Vandana Gupta, an ASHA worker has been distributing food items to identified families in gali number 14 of Shiv Vihar.

“I always ensure that food should be distributed to needy one. I survey the area door to door and distribute it only after then.

Sources said political pressure comes on police when action against abuser of social media platform is done. Linda however said, “Palamu police go by rule of law. We do not have time to listen to any such request in regard to either give someway leeway to offenders or to give them any more chance.”

SDPO Sadar Sandip Kumar Gupta said “ We had issued an appeal in which police had given a chance to abusers of social media platform to delete all such messages either written in the past or fresh ones without sharing it anymore.”

Gupta said despite such opportunity there are ‘facebook warriors’ ( a great satire) who do not refrain from indulging in spreading communal hatred against each other.

He said a warning not to spread hate has been miked too which has been heard by all but not followed by a miniscule section of people.

SDPO Bishrampur Surjit Kumar has also appealed to people to abstain from any such activity which weakens harmony and amity.

The city in last few years has evoked awe and inspiration by emerging as the cleanest city of the country thrice in a row. A disciplined approach towards sanitation practices and self-restraint has won accolades for the city and its denizens from world over.

All of them are said to be natives of Ranipura area who had reportedly slipped from the centre from the back side where a nullah is situated, an officer from Rajendra Nagar police said.

Earlier, a suspect of Tanzim Nagar area had fled the quarantine facility and reached his home. He was later tested positive and his family too had contracted infection after he had met them.

The locals had exhibited their unruly intent when people had ventured out on streets during the janta curfew announced by PM Narendra Modi on March 22. Though the administration later dealt them with police cases but such violations become a regular feature in Indore.

Suspects had misbehaved with doctors in the city and later locals had heckled health team which was carrying out health check in Ranipura area.

A proposal has been made to establish the NDRF-type Health Disaster Management Training Centre to impart training to doctors, paramedics, nurses and health workers to face any kind of health crisis that might take place in near future, said Health and Family Welfare Minister Naba Kishore Das following an inter-Ministerial meeting here on Thursday.

“We stressed on setting up an immunity research centre to carry out study on taking preventive measures against the disease. Also, we discussed a proposal on establishing an industry to manufacture medical equipment to improve healthcare system in the State,” Das said.

He said Odisha has achieved the target in testing 1,000 samples a day for detection of virus in

people.

“A few days ago, we were testing 100 samples. Now we are testing 1,000-1,200 samples, a sharp increase in testing capacity. We have decided to expand the capacity to 2,000-3,000 samples a day,” he said.

Speaking on enhancing the sample testing capacity in western Odisha, he said that only one machine has been installed at VIMSAR in Burla to test COVID-19 samples. He has urged the NIT Director to instal two more testing machines so that 100 samples can be tested a day at the medical institution.

102,17-4-20,Govt to share info on corona steps with people,"A day after senior bureaucrats were appointed to contain COVID-19 in six hotspots in Bhubaneswar, the State Government on Thursday decided to share “vital information” including test results of suspected cases and steps being taken to tackle the crisis with the residents.

Notably, out of the 60 COVID-19 cases in the State so far, as many as 46 have been reported from the capital city.

Chief Secretary Asit Tripathy, in an order on Thursday, asked officials to use loudspeakers and create area-wise WhatsApp groups to disseminate information and communicate with local people in the six containment zones, Surya Nagar, Bomikhal, Satya Nagar, Sundarpada and Kapila Prasad.

Tripathy also asked them to contact cable channels for carrying out awareness drives in the clusters.

“The decision to disseminate information in the containment zones was taken after we found out that people were in the dark over all that is happening around them. Also, loudspeakers should be used to update information about availability of essential items,” the Chief Secretary said.

All containment zones have been barricaded, prohibiting entry and exit of persons, he said.

Once the area is sealed, teams of Andanwadi Workers, auxiliary nurse midwives and other health workers, under the guidance of community medicine and epidemiology experts, would move from one house to another to check on people. Samples of those found exhibiting flu-like symptoms would be collected at random and sent for examination to rule out chances of local transmission, he said.

Maintaining that supply of essential commodities and medicines at doorsteps remains one of the biggest challenges faced by the officials in the containment zones, Tripathy asked the Municipal Commissioner to take possible steps to ensure that people are not inconvenienced.

“People with disabilities, those living alone, pregnant women and aged persons should be given priority in these clusters,” he asserted.

104,17-4-20,"First time in 167 years, railways not ferrying passengers on its birthday","The Indian Railways turned 167 years old on Thursday and for the first time ever, its trains did not carry any passengers on its birthday and instead stood idle in the yards waiting for the nationwide lockdown to end.

On this day 167 years ago, the wheels of the first passenger train in the country from Mumbai to Thane started rolling.

In 1974, Indians experienced life without trains for the first time. In May 1974 during the strike of the railways that lasted for around three weeks, drivers, station masters, guards, track staff and many others went on 'chakka jam' demanding fixed working hours for train drivers and an across-the-board pay hike.

""I can recall those times vividly. I remember that our leader George Fernandes had almost secured a deal with the then railway minister, but it fell through when it was taken to the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,"" All India Railwaymens Federation General Secretary Shiv Gopal Mishra, who was an apprentice in the railways at that time, told PTI.

""Fernandes was arrested in Lucknow. The workers went through a lot at that time. But those were days that angry workers had refused to give in and took great risks to get their demands met,"" he said.

However, just like this time, four decades ago too freight trains carrying essential supplies were run and the unions agreed to let some passenger trains run on the trunk routes like the Kalka Mail from Howrah to Delhi.

""Never ever in its history, there has been such a long interruption of services. Not during the World Wars, not during the 1974 railway strike, or any other national calamity or natural disaster,"" a railway spokesperson said.

The first Indian Railways passenger train was flagged off on April 16, 1853, from Mumbai to nearby Thane.

On Thursday, the Railway Ministry wished the railways a happy birthday on Twitter - ""Today, 167 years ago with the zeal of 'never to stop' the wheels of the first passenger train from Mumbai to Thane started rolling. For the first time, passenger services are stopped for your safety. Stay indoors & make the nation victorious,"" it said. Railway has suspended all passenger services since March 25 till May 3 due to the coronavirus outbreak. Around 15,523 trains run by the railways have been affected including 9,000 passenger trains and 3,000 mail express services which are run daily. It caters to over 20 million passengers every day.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/first-time-in-167-years--railways-not-ferrying-passengers-on-its-birthday.html

The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has already approved the trial and it will start soon at multiple hospitals where COVID-19 infected patients are being treated.

Incidentally, the Mw, an approved immunomodulatory in India since 1998 was developed after an extensive research, carried out by Indian scientists spanning more than two decades for saving lives of critically ill patients suffering from gram-negative sepsis.

It induces a pure potent Th1 response following its administration through the intradermal route.

Airlines will now have to refund full flight ticket costs, without charging cancellation fee, to passengers who booked tickets during the lockdown period between March 25 and April 14 for travel between April 15 and May 3. However, the passengers who booked tickets before March 25, for travel between April 15 and May 3, will not be eligible for full refund.

The Ministry of Civil Aviation on Thursday issued an advisory directing all airlines to refund airfares to passengers who booked tickets during the lockdown for flights cancelled during this period.

In a notification issued on Thursday, the Ministry said,""If a passenger has booked a ticket during the first lockdown period, and the airline has received the payment for booking of air ticket during first lockdown period for travel during the second lockdown period, for both domestic and international air travel, and the passenger seeks refund on cancellation of the ticket, the airline shall refund the full amount collected without levy of cancellation charges""

The ministry said the refund must be given to passengers within a period of three weeks from the date of the request for cancellation.

Several passengers have been complaining about the non-refunds by the domestic airlines. The refunds amount to around Rs 8,000 crore, sources said adding the airlines stated they would be severely hit if they were to refund in entirety.

Hence, they started issue credit shells for future travel. But travel agents from across the country asked the Government to mandate airlines to refund cash deposits worth hundreds of crores for which no tickets were issued. India has around 50,000 travel agents of which 15-20 are big consolidators. About 75%-80% of air tickets in the country are booked via agents.

All domestic and international commercial passenger flights have been suspended during the lockdown period.

At the annual kharif conference held through video conferencing, Agriculture commissioner S K Malhotra, on Thursday recommended standard operating procedure (SOP) for farm operations to use machineries to minimise labour requirement and urged farmers that they should take bath after day’s work and wash clothes with soap and sun-dry.

According to a presentation made by Agriculture Commissioner, both rice and wheat production targets are minimally higher than the previous year.

However, the focus is on driving the growth in pulses, coarse cereals and oilseeds. The foodgrain output in the 2019-20 crop year (July-June) is estimated at an all-time high 291.95 million tonnes, as per the second advance estimates released by the ministry in February.

On maintaining restrictions, Malhotra said: “Land preparation should be done by tractor driven machineries, which needs minimum labour. Farmers should use seed cum fertilizer drills, which involve less workers.”

Farmers should sanitise seed drill, plough, tractor before use and workers should wear face masks or cover face with three layers of chunnis, gamchha or towel maintaining a distance of at least 1-2 metre during farm operations,” he said.

He said that workers should have separate utensils which should be cleaned with soap after use. For transplanting of rice and vegetables, which is highly labour intensive, farmers should wash hands, legs and with soap when coming out of field for meal and rest.

While weeding and spraying of pesticides also, farmers should follow the SOP. All equipments should be sanitised and empty packets of pesticides should be burnt or buried in soil. Bags of seeds and fertiliser, however, may be reused after sun drying them,” he said.

Union Agriculture Ministry Narender Singh Tomar said that it has been decided that all States will ensure procurement at Village/Block levels as farmers are not allowed to move out of block due lockdown position. “ In addition, all States are taking steps for Direct Marketing/purchasing of crop produce from farmers,” he said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/foodgrains-production-target-for----20-21-fixed-at-298-mn-tonnes.html

But even before he landed in Srinagar, the Pakistan Army resorted to series of ceasefire violations in frontier districts of Rajouri and Poonch.

According to Jammu based Defence PRO, Lt-Col Devender Anand, ""Pakistan army initiated ceasefire violation at about 9.45 a.m along LoC in Qasba and Kirni sectors of Poonch on Thursday using small arms"".

After a gap of two hours, ceasefire violation was also reported from Nowshera sector of Rajouri, Lt-Col Anand said adding Indian army retaliated befittingly.

In Srinagar, General Naravane was briefed by the Chinar Corps Commander at Badami Bagh Cantonment on the overall situation pertaining to the Line of Control and the hinterland. General Naravane is visiting Kashmir valley close on the heels of fresh escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan. Five soldiers, including three para commandos of the Indian Army laid down their lives in North Kashmir's Keran sector of Kupwara district on April 5 while preventing a major infiltration bid by a heavily armed group of infiltrators. All five of them were eliminated by the troops in a hand-to-hand combat.

Later, the COAS accompanied by the Northern Army Commander, Lt Gen YK Joshi and Chinar Corps Commander, Lt Gen BS Raju visited the formations and units in the hinterland to boost morale of the soldiers.

According to Col Rajesh Kalia, General Naravane directed the troops to be prepared to meet emerging security challenges effectively at all times.

Col Kalia said, ""while interacting with jawans, the COAS highlighted that it was the dawn of a new era of development, peace and prosperity in Kashmir and applauded them for their high level of morale and motivation"".

""General Naravane extolled the close coordination among all government agencies towards maintaining vigil and peace in the valley and reaching out to the people wholeheartedly to combat the spread of the Covid-19 Pandemic together"", Col Kalia said.

Later in the day, the COAS visited 92 Base Hospital, where he appreciated the excellent work and vital critical care being provided by the doctors and support staff of 92 Base Hospital.

He commended them for being the lifeline of the Valley. He also met members of the civil society later in the evening, defence spokesman said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/pakistan-violates-ceasefire-on-naravane---s-visit-to-j-k.html
124,17-4-20,"Mobiles, TVs, readymade garments to be available on e-commerce platforms from April 20","Mobile phones, televisions, readymade garments and stationery items will be allowed to be sold on e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal during the lockdown from April 20, officials said on Thursday.

The clarification from a senior home ministry official came a day after Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla issued revised guidelines for the extended lockdown period till May 3.

Electronic items like mobile phones, TVs, refrigerators, laptops will be available on e-commerce platforms from April 20, the official told PTI.

Readymade garments and stationery items for school children will also be available on the e-commerce platforms.

“Along with essential commodities like groceries and medicines, non-essential items are also allowed to be sold by the e-commerce companies,” another official said.

However, the delivery vans of the e-commerce companies will need permission from authorities to ply on roads.

According to fresh guidelines issued Wednesday, commercial and private establishments are being allowed to operate during the extended lockdown period.

“Vehicles used by e-commerce operators will be allowed to ply with necessary permissions,” the ministry said.

The previous notifications of the home ministry had specifically said that e-commerce platforms are allowed to sell only essential goods like food, pharmaceuticals and medical devices.

The new guidelines did not classify essential and non-essential items. The move is being viewed as an attempt by the government to revive industrial and commercial activities which have been stalled due to the lockdown since March 25.

A large number of people are engaged in the logistics and delivery works of such e-commerce platforms.

By opening the sector, the Government is trying to protect the interests of this large segment of employees.

The guidelines also said, “All facilities in the supply chain of essential goods, whether involved in manufacturing, wholesale or retail of such goods through local stores, large brick and mortar stores or e-commerce companies should be allowed to operate, ensuring strict social distancing without any restriction on their timing of opening and closure”.

The government has also allowed movement of all trucks and other goods/ carrier vehicles with two drivers and one helper subject to the driver carrying a valid driving license.

Empty trucks or vehicles will be allowed to ply after deliveries of goods or for pick up of goods.

Shops for truck repairs and ‘dhabas’ (eateries) on highways, with a stipulated minimum distance as prescribed by the state and union territory authorities, will be allowed to operate. The lockdown was first announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 for 21 days in a bid to combat the coronavirus endemic.

While extending the lockdown till May 3, the Prime Minister on Tuesday also declared that select necessary activities will be allowed to be opened up from April 20 in identified areas of the country.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/mobiles--tvs--readymade-garments-to-be-available-on-e-commerce-platforms-from-april-20.html

Shaking off an uncertain start, the 30-share BSE Sensex gained momentum in afternoon trade, before ending 222.80 points or 0.73 per cent higher at 30,602.61.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty climbed 67.50 points, or 0.76 per cent, to finish at 8,992.80.

NTPC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying 5.84 per cent, followed by ICICI Bank (4.52 per cent), Titan (3.87 per cent), L&T (3.65 per cent), SBI (3.46 per cent) and Sun Pharma (3.37 per cent). On the other hand, HCL Tech led the laggards’ list with a drop of 3.97 per cent, followed by Tech Mahindra, Kotak Bank, Infosys, Hero MotoCorp and HUL.

IT stocks came under selling pressure after tech major Wipro on Wednesday posted 6 per cent decline in net profit for the March quarter. It also said it will not provide revenue guidance for the current quarter due to business uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Weak macroeconomic data and unabated depreciation in the rupee also capped buying momentum, traders said.

“Markets were more circumspect today, while IT stocks were impacted due to the earnings commentary from Wipro. Wipro did not give any earnings guidance but warned of a hit on margins. The earnings for TCS will give a clearer picture on the impact on the IT sector and demand outlook from developed markets.

“Economic data from around the world remained grim and global markets also remained weak. Stock specific news and information with regards to normalisation of business is expected to drive stock and sector specific action in the markets,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE power, utilities, capital goods, oil and gas, finance and metal indices ended up to 2.85 per cent higher, while IT, teck, telecom and FMCG closed in the red.

Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices rallied up to 1.71 per cent.

Meanwhile, global equities were mixed as investors assessed the tentative steps taken by various countries to resume economic activities. Bourses in Shanghai ended on a positive note, while Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo closed in the red.

The economic growth rate during 2019-20 is estimated to come down to 4.1 per cent from 5 per cent projected by several agencies before the outbreak of deadly virus,

which affected more than 20 lakh persons around the world and took lives of over 1.3 lakh people.

In order to check the spread of Covid-19, the government has decided to extend the lockdown to May 3, with some relaxations for specified sectors.

According to the SBI Ecowrap report, the extension of the lockdown would result in economic loss of Rs 12.1 lakh crore or 6 per cent of the nominal Gross Value Added (GVA).

“With the lockdown now being extended till May 3 and simultaneously Government providing some relaxations from April 20, we estimate the overall loss for FY21 around Rs 12.1 lakh crore/6 per cent of nominal GVA taking the nominal GVA growth for entire year to be around 4.2 per cent.

“Nominal GDP for FY21 could be lower/closer to 4.2 per cent, as there is a strong possibility of subsidies outstripping tax collections.

However, taking nominal GDP growth at 4.2 per cent, the real GDP growth for FY21 would be around 1.1 per cent,” said the report.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/economic-growth-may-fall-to-1-1--this-fiscal--sbi-report.html

131,17-4-20,"Bandra: TV reporter gets bail, channel defends him","A day after he was arrested in connection with the Assembly of huge crowds in front of the Bandra railway station, Rahul Kulkarni, a correspondent with a Marathi news channel, was granted bail by a Mumbai court on Thursday.

Kulkarni, Osmanabad-based correspondent of ABP Majha news channel, was produced before a Bandra Magistrate Court which released him on a bail of Rs 15,000.

On a day when several media persons demanded that investigations be carried out arresting journalists, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut expressed his happiness that Kulkarni had been granted bail by the court.

The Bandra police on Wednesday morning registered an FIR against Rahul Kulkarni, arrested him later in the evening and brought to him for allegedly reporting “incorrect” news that trains would restart. The news report on ABP Majha is said to have been based on a letter written by a South Central Railway official on April 13 on a proposal for Jansadharan special trains.

Kulkarni has been charged under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Epidemic Diseases Act, according to Mumbai Police Spokesperson and DCP Pranaya Ashok.

Meanwhile, in a statement here on Thursday, the channel has termed reports linking the migrant gathering with its news reports as ""entirely misconceived"" and circulated *with the sole intention of baselessly maligning ABP Majha"".

The news channel claimed that it broadcast stories in public interest and that it had valid documents and information, on the basis of which it ran multiple stories on the channel. The news channel stated that after the PM's announcement on Tuesday at 10 a.m. on continuing the lockdown, announcements later from the Ministry of Railway pertaining to cancellation of trains and refunds till May 3, the channel said from 12.30-13.30 hrs it clearly announced that no trains would be running.

""There is no conceivable way in which the crowds that gathered at the Bandra West Station from around 3:45 p.m. can be linked to our stories. To insinuate that our running of the story and the updates thereafter amount to a criminal act is outrageous,"" ABP Majha said in a statement

ABP Majha expressed shock and dismay over the arrest of its reporter Rahul Kulkarni and would take immediate legal measures in this regard.

The channel contended that there was no denial of the Railway Ministry's letter of April 13 recommending running of trains to return migrants to their hometowns, but after the RM's announcement that no trains would be run till May 3, 2020, it had immediately run the story on its news bulletins.

""We would like to say that before journalists are arrested there should be due verification of all facts and circumstances,"" ABP Majha stated.

It may be recalled that the leading Marathi television channel, which based its report filed by its Osmanabad-based television journalist Rahul Kulkarni, aired story that the Railways would run special trains from various divisions coming under its jurisdiction to ferry stranded migrants to their states.

The letter written by a senior official of the South-Central Railway – on which the journalist based his report – does not actual say it had already decided to run such special “Jansadharan” trains but it asks various Sr divisional managers to submit detailed proposals giving details of originating and destination stations.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/bandra--tv-reporter-gets-bail--channel-defends-him.html

140,17-4-20,"Asia doing better than other regions, may recover faster: IMF","Asia doing better than other regions in the world in their fight against the deadly coronavirus and may recover faster, a top official from the International Monetary Fund has said.

Chang Yong Rhee, Director of the IMF’s Asia and Pacific Department also said that the impact of the deadly coronavirus on Asia will be severe, across the board, and unprecedented. “Asia is still doing better than other regions and may recover faster. Average growth in Asia is still higher than other regions,” Ree told PTI in an interview.

“We expect growth in Asia to stall at zero per cent in 2020. This is a remarkable downgrade since Asia has not experienced

zero growth in the last 60 years!” he said.

This is lower than the annual average growth rates throughout the Global Financial Crisis (4.7 per cent) or the Asian Financial Crisis (1.3 per cent). The downward revisions are substantial and across the board, with the largest revisions for Australia and New Zealand (-9ppt), Japan (-5.9ppt) China(-4.8ppt), he said.

But, since Asia was exposed to the virus before other countries, a recovery may begin earlier, and growth in 2021 is expected to rise to 7.6 percent, Rhee said.

“But not all lost growth can be made up quickly and the impact of the global economic contraction on Asia means that the level of output can be expected to remain below the

pre-pandemic level throughout 2021,” he said.

Responding to a question, Rhee noted that the IMF’s forecasts are quite uncertain.

“One of the difficulties in forecasting growth in Asia is the fact that Asian economies are at different stages of the pandemic. The final outcome will also depend on the effectiveness of the containment measures and whether or not there is a second wave of outbreaks. There is potential for surprises on both the upside and the downside,” he said.

The balance of risks is tilted to the downside, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic, he said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/asia-doing-better-than-other-regions--may-recover-faster--imf.html

It said that Pakistan’s budget deficit that in pre-COVID-19 situation had been projected at 7.3 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), may increase to 9.2 per cent. In absolute terms, the deficit will be equal to Rs 4 trillion, higher by Rs 800 billion than previous estimates, it added.

Inflation is projected to remain at 11.1 per cent this year and 8 per cent next year.

The deficit is expected to rise because of revenue shocks as the government has not yet announced any major increase in budgetary expenditure, according to finance ministry sources.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/imf-warns-pak---s-budget-deficit-may-hit-record-high-due-to-coronavirus-crisis.html
142,17-4-20,IMF chief eyes deadline extension to Brexit trade deal,"IMF head Kristalina Georgieva on Thursday suggested that Britain and the EU extend their deadline on striking a post-Brexit trade deal in the face of coronavirus uncertainty.

“My advice would be to seek ways in which this element of uncertainty is reduced in the interests of everybody, the UK, the EU, and the whole world,” Georgieva told the BBC when asked if she would advise on an extension.

“I really hope that all policymakers everywhere would be thinking about” reducing uncertainty, she added. “It is tough as it is, let’s not make it any tougher.”

IMF this week warned that the coronavirus pandemic is pushing the global economy into the deepest recession in a century, cutting world output by three percent this year, and cautioned that the crisis could get even worse.

British and European Union officials meanwhile have agreed to schedule three new rounds of post-Brexit trade talks, starting next week by video conference, after the coronavirus epidemic disrupted negotiations.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/imf-chief-eyes-deadline-extension-to-brexit-trade-deal.html

More than 2,128,751 cases have been reported from over 190 countries and territories. Of these cases, at least 5,39,000 are now considered recovered.

US: The confirmed coronavirus death toll in the United States surpassed 33,000 on Thursday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The tracker says 30,990 people have now died in the country from Covid-19 since the start of the global health crisis.

The US has the highest death toll in the world, followed by Italy with 21,645 dead although its population is just a fifth of that of the US. Spain has recorded 19,130 deaths, followed by France with 17,167.

Nearly 6,40,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the United States, which has seen a record number of deaths over the past two days. New York, the epicenter of the country’s Covid-19 epidemic, has suffered more than 14,000 deaths across the state alone.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump promised to unveil plans later Thursday to reopen the US economy, claiming his country has “passed the peak” of the coronavirus crisis despite the record daily death tolls.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo extended the state’s shutdown order Thursday until May 15, citing data showing conditions were improving but adding that “we have to continue what we are doing.” “I would like to see that infection rate get down even more,” Cuomo said at his daily briefing, reporting that 606 more people had died in the US COVID-19 epicenter, the lowest daily toll in 10 days.

The latest figures also showed the number of people in Britain to have tested positive for Covid-19 passed 1,00,000.

UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is standing in for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recuperates after testing positive for the virus, will chair a crucial meeting of the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (Cobra) on Thursday during which the Cabinet will finalise the plans for an extension.

Spain sees 551 new virus deaths

Spain’s coronavirus death toll soared past 19,000 on Thursday after another 551 people died of COVID-19, with the numbers reflecting a slowdown after nearly five weeks on lockdown. One of the worst-hit countries in the world, Spain has seen the increase in the number of deaths and infections come down over the past fortnight, with the overnight fatalities taking the toll to 19,130.

But there are growing concerns that the toll may be far higher, with regional authorities in Madrid and Catalonia insisting they each had thousands more victims than the official count.

Madrid, which by Thursday counted 6,877 deaths, has mooted a figure well above 10,000, while Catalonia, where some 3,855 have died, believes its toll to be nearly double that after changing counting method.

Of those confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus and admitted to hospital, 52,229 had been discharged after recovering, which he described as a “rising trend”. Another 3,594 patients are in critical condition.

There has been speculation abroad that the number of deaths and infections is higher than officially announced.

Italy probes suspicious care-home deaths

Italian justice officials have launched an investigation into the suspicious deaths of nearly 200 people in a Milan care home since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.

Investigators seized documents on Wednesday from the headquarters of Milan’s Lombardy regional government, media reports said. They were investigating the deaths of “around 180 people” at Milan’s Pio Albergo Trivulzio care home since Italy’s Covid-19 outbreak erupted in February, the AGI news agency said.

Italy has officially recorded 21,645 deaths from the virus — the world’s second-highest total after the United States.

144,17-4-20,Wuhan’s ‘wet markets’ struggle after virus lockdown,"At a large food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, signs forbid the selling of wild animals and live fowl, while announcements calling for “victory” over Covid-19 play on a loop from speakers.

China’s “wet markets” have been slammed internationally as the coronavirus roils the world, with the disease having seemingly emerged from stalls selling live game in Wuhan late last year. The government has since banned the sale of wildlife for food, but the reopening of markets has drawn criticism from around the world as the death toll from the pandemic continues to mount.

Shut down during the lengthy quarantine that sealed off Wuhan until April 8, the city’s markets are now fighting for survival as customers have not been rushing back.

“There’s no question, we’re doomed this year,” spice seller Yang, who runs a stall at the massive Baishazhou wholesale market, told AFP.

“There have never been so few people at our market.” Yang, whose sales have fallen by a third from before the lockdown, dismissed criticism of markets as virus hotbeds as “unnecessary panic”.

One market remains closed: The Huanan Seafood Market that sold a range of exotic wildlife and is suspected to be the cradle of the virus that jumped from animals to humans.

Wet markets are popular venues to buy fresh meat, vegetables and fish across Asia — most selling common, everyday produce to locals at affordable prices. Most don’t sell live animals, although some do. During visits to three Wuhan markets this week, AFP saw live turtles, frogs, fish and crustaceans for sale, but no fowl or mammals blamed for past diseases.

Workers at Baishazhou said they were now required to disinfect their stalls several times a day. Yang keeps multiple bottles of disinfectant in her small office, alongside a box of masks. Nevertheless, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said this week the decision to reopen wet markets was “unfathomable”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/wuhan---s----wet-markets----struggle-after-virus-lockdown.html

Two dozen doctors have died since the pandemic began in the Southeast Asian nation, and critics warn that the official death toll of 459 is way below reality in a country with some of the lowest virus testing rates in the world.

Hospitals don’t have enough basic protective gear — never mind sophisticated ventilators — leaving many poorly paid doctors to battle the virus with little more than plastic rain ponchos.

155,17-4-20,A gift to the world,"American Tacos probes a dish’s evolution across borders

You can eat one with carne asada and corn tortillas in East Los Angeles, or one with flour and pit-grilled pork known as al pastor in Dallas. Travelers can pick a few up outside of Berlin’s Schonefeld airport before boarding a flight, or grab one with albondigas and collard greens in Memphis, Tennessee.

In each place, you can taste the social and global evolution of the taco, according to José R. Ralat. Some tacos incorporate the influence of Asian or Jewish cuisine. Others do their best to stay true to traditional taco orthodoxy — although no one can agree on what that is.

Ralat, the new Taco editor at Texas Monthly (yes, that’s his title), has written a new book exploring how this simple dish with Mexican origins has spread and been transformed, from San Antonio to Tokyo, gaining fans and sparking some outrage among purists.

A lifelong project, American Tacos: A History and Guide (University of Texas Press) comes from Ralat’s travels throughout the United States and examines a dish that has come to transcend borders, barriers and bullets. “No one owns the taco,” Ralat said in an interview. “It’s a living food, and I wanted to see how it is changing as we change.”

Born in what is now Mexico, the taco is a creation of “the encounter” — the meeting of Spanish and indigenous peoples in the Americas. That meeting eventually led to the corn tortilla coming together with meats, beans and greens.

After the US-Mexico War of 1848, the United States grabbed nearly a third of Mexico’s northern territory, turning some ethnic Mexicans into Mexican Americans and creating a new southwestern border. The taco north of the line was now on its own, evolving for generations based on the available resources of its consumers.

As Los Angeles Times writer Gustavo Arellano outlined in his 2012 book, Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America, Mexican Americans in Texas were forced to use yellow cheese, giving birth to what we call Tex-Mex. Isolated New Mexico used red and green chiles in their tacos. California’s ever-changing diverse population added its own flavours.

That history is what fascinated Nuyorican-raised Ralat when he began to explore how demographic upheaval and mass migration have changed the taco. He found Indo-Mex, or Desi-Tex, tacos in Houston, with restaurants using aaloo tikki, saag paneer and curries. In Oregon and Florida, he stumbled upon K-Mex tacos, which use Asian fusion to introduce Korean fried chicken or bigeye tuna sashimi.

Ralat found kosher tacos in Los Angeles and Brooklyn made with peppery barbecue brisket pastrami charred with green salsa. “Deli-Mex” is what some called it, Ralat writes.

But of course, he found the heart of Mexican Americana holding true to and defending taco orthodoxy. “San Antonio does its best to remain what it calls authentic,” Ralat said. “And one could argue, that’s also needed.”

How could one not enjoy fajitas in a thick flour tortilla with cilantro and onions? (However, some in New Mexico might call this a burrito). Still, what’s authentic to San Antonio might not be so to the people of El Centro, California, or even Tucson, Arizona.

On social media, taco fans debate. Ralat brushes that aside, however, as a sign of limited experience. “I always hear people say, ‘well, that’s not the way my grandmother made them’,” Ralat said. “You know what? Maybe your grandmother was a bad cook.”

Steven Alvarez, an English professor at St John’s University in Queens, New York, and creator of a “Taco Literacy” course, said Ralat’s book comes as more Latinos are living across the US, from Massachusetts to Idaho. “To understand a people, you have to understand the food,” Alvarez said. “More people are coming together and so is the food.”

The food is a vehicle to make sense of new encounters. “If you are searching for the most authentic taco, you will soon find out it is a fruitless search,” Alvarez said. “You’ll never find it.” Instead, you’ll discover that the taco has moved on, Ralat said.

Today, you can enjoy an English fusion taco in London’s Latino-dominated Elephant and Castle area while listening to UK soul singer Dayo Bello belt out a love ballad. You can enjoy tacos at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where members of the Oglala Lakota Nation playfully tell visitors they are bringing the taco back to its indigenous roots. You can savor a Central American-influenced taco in East Boston with Brazilian immigrants. “The taco is Mexico’s gift to the world,” Ralat said. “And the world is responding.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-gift-to-the-world-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-gift-to-the-world.html
156,17-4-20,The kitchen tour,"Chef and author Rachael Ray tapes show from home, cooking low-budget meals

Rachael Ray had big plans for the quarantine break at her home in upstate New York. She envisioned “a Renaissance,” rereading the classics, resuming her Danish lessons and studying Italian.

“I was going to get more serious about my painting. I had all these lofty goals ... and none of that’s happening,” the popular daytime talk show host said. “We have never worked this hard in our entire lives,” said Ray, who is taping #STAYHOME With Rachael two days a week from her home.

Her husband, John Cusimano, is now the cameraman, producer, cocktail maker and musical guest. Their beloved pit bull Isaboo accounts for the entire studio audience, she jokes.

She wears sweats and no makeup, cooking low-budget meals based around pantry staples like chickpeas and pasta, offering a refreshing peek into her kitchen — she misplaces the garlic sometimes — and a comforting smile.

“This is a weird time. I can’t say there’s a silver lining ... but there are found moments every day,” she said at the start of the first at home show.

She recently announced her organisations will donate $4 million to several charities including food banks and relief funds for laid off restaurant workers, saying she wanted to “help people more than just, ‘hey, here’s three things you can do with canned tuna’.”

Half the money will go to animal rescue. The animal lover says “a lot of the shelters can’t afford to keep going, there’s no workers. Animals are in crisis too.”

“The more you earn in life, the more you owe in service and the more you owe to your community,” said a passionate Ray. “It is our absolute responsibility to take care of each other.”

That’s the answer she gives when asked why she’s donating so much — and also she’s afraid of her mother.

No, she’s not afraid that she might contract the virus, she’s “absolutely scared to death” of the 85-year-old tough Sicilian who lives across the street. “I’m scared because she’s tough,” Ray said. “She wants a daily update of what you’re doing to help the world. In detail.”

Ray grew up cleaning shrimp and helping out in her mother’s restaurant kitchen. They spent holidays alongside police and firefighters feeding hungry families. Their family celebrated the following day. “Every holiday was like that. You had to be of service.”

In rare down moments, Ray catches up with friends by phone and cooks Moroccan couscous in bone stock for her dog, garnishing it with carrot tops, mint and parsley. Her husband plays a mini banjo concert for Isaboo a few times a day.

“It feels so good to get on the phone and kibitz and share,” she said. “I just like how much we’re using the old fashion telephone.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-kitchen-tour-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-kitchen-tour.html

158,17-4-20,IPL off the clock,"The BCCI on Thursday suspended the 2020 Indian Premier League ‘till further notice’, a decision that was conveyed to the franchises a couple of days back and was expected after the lockdown to combat the COVID-19 pandemic was extended.

The Board on Thursday said that given the “evolving global health concerns” and lockdown measures implemented by the government, it had no choice but to further postpone the glitzy T20 league.

“...The IPL Governing Council of the BCCI has decided that the IPL 2020 Season will be suspended till further notice,” said BCCI secretary Jay Shah in a statement.

The IPL, which was to run till May 24 as per the original schedule, was first postponed till April 15 after the government imposed restrictions on entry of foreigners due to the surge in COVID-19 cases.

The travel bar meant that no international player could compete in the tournament if it went ahead on time.

With the situation still not conducive for any sporting activity and the country in the middle of a lockdown till May 3, the BCCI refrained from giving any estimate on when the event might be held.

“The health and safety of the nation and everyone involved in our great sport remains our top priority...The IPL 2020 season will only commence when it is safe and appropriate to do so,” Shah further stated. He maintained that India’s richest sporting body is monitoring the situation and will seek guidance from the central government as well as states before taking any decision.

“BCCI will continue to monitor and review the situation regarding a potential start date in close partnership with all of its stakeholders and will continue to take guidance from the Government of India, state governments and other state regulatory bodies,” Shah added.

IPL franchises have had a mixed view on holding the event this year. While Kings XI Punjab co-owner Ness Wadia has stated that sport cannot be priority at the time of a pandemic, Rajasthan Royals had suggested having the tournament behind closed doors some time this year.

Players — past and present — have, however, been united in saying that that the tournament should go ahead at some point given the livelihoods it sustains.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ipl-off-the-clock.html
159,17-4-20,Pick Dhoni if he’s available for T20 WC: Harbhajan,"Mahendra Singh Dhoni is too big a player to be judged by his Indian Premier League (IPL) form alone and Harbhajan Singh believes that if the team management and selectors feel he is good enough to be in the T20 World Cup team, they should pick him irrespective of what he does in the cash-rich league which has now been postponed.

“How do you judge Dhoni? Do you see his IPL form or give him respect and consider the fact that he is one of India’s greatest players and captains. The guy has done a lot for Indian cricket,” Harbhajan said.

“MS Dhoni is a big big player. He doesn’t need to be told if he is capable or not. So I don’t think you need to ponder too much about it. If you think you need Dhoni, and if he is available, you pick him,” said Harbhajan, India’s third highest wicket-taker in Test cricket.

Harbhajan is slated to play with Dhoni for Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the IPL. The decorated former India captain has not played since the 2019 World Cup semi-final where India lost to New Zealand.

Harbhajan also opined that all-rounder Hardik Pandya should be in the Indian T20 team for the World Cup scheduled to take place in October in Australia, saying even though the 26-year old has not played since September last year, he is a match winner on his day and brings a lot to the table.

Hardik last played in September in a T20 against South Africa before getting injured and undergoing surgery subsequently.

“Hardik Pandya has not played after the World Cup. But I can give you in writing that if he is fit and irrespective of whether the IPL takes place or not, when the team will be made he will be in the team because if the team needs to maintain combination, he has to be in the team. You need these kind of players. So some players cannot be judged on IPL form. It is for them who are not proven players,” the off-spinner explained.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/pick-dhoni-if-he---s-available-for-t20-wc--harbhajan.html

“Maybe 15 million tests” will be required in Africa over the next three months, John Nkengasong said.

The new initiative to dramatically accelerate testing comes as the continent of 1.3 billion people braces for its turn in the pandemic that has rolled from China to Europe and the US and now beyond. Experts have said Africa is weeks behind Europe and the U.S. but the rise in cases has looked alarmingly similar.

Zhang Wenhong, who heads the Covid-19 clinical expert team in Shanghai and leads the infectious disease department at one of the eastern metropolitan city’s top hospitals, expects that in the long term, countries will have to take a flexible approach to recurring outbreaks.

While countries around the world may be able to bring the deadly pandemic under adequate control by autumn, the coming winter may bring a “second wave” of infections in China and elsewhere, he said.

Speaking during an online live stream broadcast by popular short-video platform Kuaishou, Zhang said China’s experience with disease control means any resurgence in infections later this year will be manageable, and not require a repeat of the dramatic measures taken to curb the virus’’s initial spread. Zhang’s comments come as Chinese officials gradually eased quarantine restrictions as part of efforts to revive the country’s economy.

164,17-4-20,"Amid pandemic, debate rages in Mexico: Is beer essential?","Perhaps one of the most heated debates in Mexico during the pandemic — after disagreements about personal protective equipment and testing — is the burning issue of whether beer should be considered an “essential” item during the lockdown.

“Beer supplies should be guaranteed, because beer helps people get through quarantine on better terms,” the National Alliance of Small Business said in a press statement Tuesday.

After Mexico ordered the closure of most “non-essential” industries in late March, including the country’s major breweries, the prospect of a looming shortage of brew turned into a heated disagreement within the government.

First, on April 6, the Agriculture Department sent a letter to major breweries that could be read as inviting them to restart production.

That drew a swift rebuke from the government’s coronavirus point man, assistant health secretary Hugo López-Gatell.

“All I can say is that this was a mistake and it’s going to be corrected,” López-Gatell said of the letter. “There are general orders from health authorities suspending all work activities except the essential ones, which are clearly spelled out in the Health Council’s decree of March 31, and they do not include the production or distribution of beer.”

The very next day, the Agriculture Department issued a statement saying it had never meant to authorize re-opening the breweries. Instead, the department said, it was only trying to encourage breweries to keep buying Mexican farmers’ barley crops.

“The Agriculture Department’s role in this case, is clearly to encourage the industry to buy the crop, because farmers don’t have the capacity to store the grain,” the department said.

The beer industry chamber, while it declined to comment on the debate, is pushing the idea of home delivery of existing stocks of suds. Some breweries have taken advantage of their unused plants to produce hand-sanitizer, or have made other contributions to hospitals.

The government’s strict stance wasn’t convincing the small business chamber, which said that 40 per cent of small shops’ total sales volume is beer.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/amid-pandemic--debate-rages-in-mexico--is-beer-essential-.html
165,17-4-20,Street side pawsitivity,"Animals can be a great source of joy during lockdown. But we too need to do our bit to keep them safe, says Varda Mehrotra

The world today has come to an almost complete standstill while grappling with an unprecedented crisis. The Coronavirus pandemic has impaired world economies, left the streets deserted and minds full of chaos. Children and adults confined in their homes are experiencing an extraordinary situation. In this grim scenario, companion animals have proved to be great source of positive energy especially in these challenging times. Man’s best friend, indeed.

As we enter week three of the lockdown, there are reports of several people including children fighting depression and other mental health issues on account of being confined indoors. It is tough keeping children brimming with raw energy engaged while juggling work from home and household loads. Research tells us that even as little as 10 minutes of interaction with cats and dogs produces a significant reduction in cortisol — a major stress hormone. Animals, especially dogs and cats, can help reduce stress, anxiety, depression and ease loneliness.

However, animals are invariably bearing the brunt of the lockdown. Strays rely on dhabas or subzi-mandis (vegetable markets) for food. And they are now starving. Pedigreed animals too do not have it any better as they are dying slow deaths in locked-up pet shops. Access to medicine and care is hard to come by. Food, water and bare essentials are vanishing overnight. Hunger, unfortunately, does not discriminate. Well, the suffering of animals sadly goes unnoticed. Add to that, misinformation and rumours which worsen their plight.

NGOs working with animals are flooded with queries on feeding street animals, availability of emergency veterinarian services, abandoning of pets and functionality of animal shelters during the COVID-19 lockdown.

It was being brought to notice that animal owners were leaving their pets to stray without proper food, water or shelter due to the spread of the virus. In this regard, the WHO clarified that dogs and cats are not involved in spreading infection in the current episode of Coronavirus infection. Post this, an advisory was issued urging people to allot time to animal feeders to provide food and water for street animals and birds.

Since the government has now recognised the issue, the need for veterinary help and street feeding — all continue to be essential services permitted during the lockdown. Despite that myths and misinformation are doing rounds and animal activists are being harassed.

Here are some small daily measures which people can take to ensure health and safety of stray animals:

Place water and food bowls outside your houses.

Coordinate with other residents in your neighbourhood to ensure strays in your locality do not go hungry.

Speak to your local authorities or animal welfare organisations for assistance to animals as they will have access to the right information and aid for animals in such times.

Well, companion animals too need looking after during this challenging phase:

Guardians should closely monitor the decisions that are being taken for the safekeeping of companion animals.

Maintain hygiene of companion animals.

Ensure that housed animals are kept mentally stimulated through indoor games, if they aren’t permitted to go out for daily walks.

Keep water bowls outside their shelters.

There is a resource centre for NGOs and individuals who need support in these times to treat and feed animals. A COVID-19 response team as well as one which can offer support for any legal problems have also been formed. If you need food/medicine you can connect with other, local member organisations.

Actress Richa Chadha said that the Coronavirus pandemic is bringing out the best and the worst in people. She feels that it's the time to come together and help.

“You have people who are going out of their way to provide for needy animals and human beings, and then there are some people who are using this as an opportunity to treat the poor badly,” Richa added.

She cited the example of the 3,000 stranded migrants at Bandra station. She said, “The migrants gathered in Bandra and Surat. People are criticising them that there could be community transmission. But these people are helpless and do not have means to get home. This is the time to come together and help. I really hope people make behavioural changes now.”

167,17-4-20,‘Skill level doesn’t change with break’,"Chennai Super Kings bowling coach Lakshmipathy Balaji believes that all talks about MS Dhoni taking a sabbatical and all shouldn’t count when it comes to deciding whether the former skipper should be a part of the Indian team for the T20 World Cup.

“We shouldn’t be talking about Dhoni’s six-month break. It is no big deal. If you see Tiger Woods or Roger Federer, they miss major tournaments and then come back. The break doesn’t mean that they go off the boil. The skill level doesn’t change. It is the same with Dhoni.

“When it comes to proven performers, you need not think about their skill level. He might not be the same as he was when he was 25 or 26, but he is much better-equipped with the mental side of the game. From what I saw during the CSK training, it never looked like Dhoni was away from the game for any length of time. He didn’t look rusty even on the first day of training. That is his greatness,” Balaji told The Times of India.

The former India pacer further said that while it is on the national selectors to decide whether they wish to pick him for the World T20, he would always go with Dhoni because of his experience when it comes to big tournaments.

“It is entirely up to selectors but if you ask me, I would always go with MS for any big tournament. Beyond his finishing skills, there are a lot of things he brings to the table.

168,17-4-20,DK still has lot to offer in T20s,"Dinesh Karthik understands the reason for his exclusion from India’s ODI team after an underwhelming 2019 World Cup but what he can’t comprehend is the T20 snub as that is one format where he is still confident of making significant contributions.

Karthik, who has played 26 Tests, 94 ODIs and 32 T20s over a 15-year-career, is used to making comebacks but to make another one will be tougher than ever for the 34-year-old. And he knows that.

“My record in T20s has been good. A big tournament like the World Cup did not go exactly as per the plan. I could understand the one day bit (being dropped from ODIs) but even now I would like think that I stand a good chance in returning to the T20 side.

“I have done well even in the recent domestic games that I have played. I have no reason to doubt myself (that I can’t make another comeback),” Karthik said.

Out of the three formats, he averages best in T20s — 33.25 with a strike rate of 143.52.

Does getting dropped hurts? “It does hurt, no doubt about that. I have always had this burning desire to play for my country and it hasn’t diminished one bit.”

It was a rollercoaster ride for Karthik leading up to the World Cup as he was dropped for the home ODI series against Australia, India’s last before the showpiece event.

However, the selectors picked him in the squad over Rishabh Pant for his ‘better’ wicket-keeping skills.

Karthik failed to make an impact in two innings he got in the World Cup including the semifinal which India lost to New Zealand.

He was assigned the role of a finisher in the T20 side and his most significant knock came in the 2018 Nidahas Trophy final where he hit a last-ball six to win India the title.

Though he has slipped considerably in the pecking order, Karthik remains hopeful of another comeback.

The KKR captain, who was preparing hard for the IPL before the lockdown was announced, seems to be comfortable in his own skin.

“That is how the sport has always been for me. Full of ups and downs. It has taught me a lot of things. It (being out of the team) is not something new to me so I am comfortable in the space that I am in.

“There is a T20 World Cup round the corner and I know if I do well, I stand a good chance of making the team. I know it gets tougher every time. The team is getting stronger all the time and it is great to watch. But it is my duty to get better as a player and the rest will take care of itself,” the Tamil Nadu veteran said.

The IPL, which has been postponed indefinitely, would have been an ideal platform for Karthik to make his case for his umpteenth comeback. But considering the circumstances, the game has taken a backseat.

“With everything that has been happening, I am not able to think too much about the IPL. Before the lockdown, I was practising really hard for the IPL, just like I did it every other tournament.

“There is still a lot of hope (of playing for India again), it is always there. In fact, the entire world is living on hope right,” said Karthik, who is keep himself fit with regular workout sessions at home.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dk-still-has-lot-to-offer-in-t20s-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/dk-still-has-lot-to-offer-in-t20s.html

170,17-4-20,"No point discussing IPL in Sri Lanka right now, top BCCI official","Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) is keen to host the currently-suspended IPL but the influential voices within the BCCI feel that there is no point in discussing such a proposal in a ""closed world"" battling the COVID-19 pandemic right now.

The IPL, scheduled from March 29-May 24, has been postponed indefinitely by the BCCI in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Board will only conduct the tournament when normalcy returns.

SLC president Shammi Silva on Thursday said that Sri lanka is ready to host the mega event as the country, which has fewer positive cases, is expected to return to normalcy earlier compared to India.

""The BCCI will not be in a position to say anything when the world is closed,"" a senior Board official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.

Sri Lanka has just over 200 cases cases right now as against India's tally of more than 13,000. The death toll in India has crossed the 400-mark.

The official confirmed that currently, there is no proposal from the SLC and there is no guarantee when a meaningful discussion can take place on the subject even if it comes along.

Currently, international flights have been mostly suspended after several countries imposed lockdowns to contain the deadly virus.

""There is no proposal from SLC yet and obviously no discussion,"" the official said when asked what will be the BCCI's stand when the offer is on table.

The SLC can have the matches on three grounds -- Galle, Kandy and Premadasa Stadium -- with logistics reduced to less than half as there are no inland flights.

Having an IPL could help the SLC gain significant financial stability, more than what a short white-ball series against India (three T20Is and three ODIs) can guarantee in July.

As of now, the BCCI will be more keen on having it in India in either of the two slots between September-October and October-November.

A BCCI veteran, who was a part of the teams when IPL was shifted to South Africa in 2009 and partially to the UAE (2014) due to general elections, feels that the scenario in ICC will change once Shashank Manohar demits office as chairman at the end of May.

""Sri Lanka has been BCCI's ally at the ICC and their proposal is understandable. But what about once he (Manohar) steps down next month,"" he said.

""You could see new equations forming and there could be multiple options on table, not just Sri Lanka,"" the board veteran added.

171,17-4-20,We will take decision at appropriate time: ICC on staging T20 World Cup amidst COVID-19 crisis,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is not in a hurry to take a decision whether the T20 World Cup should be postponed in the wake of COVID-19 or staged as scheduled, saying it is ""exploring all options"" as part of its comprehensive contingency planning for all its events.

The T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in Australia from October 18 to November 15 but with all sporting events either postponed or cancelled due to the global health crisis, the fate of the tournament remains uncertain.

With Australia sealing its borders and putting restrictions on travel to contain the dreaded disease, there have been speculations that the T20 World Cup could be postponed to next year or held inside closed doors.

""We are continuing with our planning for ICC events as they are, but given the rapidly evolving situation as a prudent and responsible measure we are also undertaking a comprehensive contingency planning exercise,"" an ICC spokesperson was quoted as saying by SkySport.

""This includes exploring all options available to us based on a range of scenarios connected to the pandemic.""

The T20 World Cup is still six months away and ICC said it will take a decision after consulting all stakeholders, including the Australian government.

""We will continue to take advice from experts and authorities, including the Australian government and will take decisions at the appropriate time,"" the spokesperson said.

""We will utilise all the data and information available to us to ensure we can take well-informed, responsible decisions that are in the best interests of our sport.""

Besides, he announced a re-financing window of Rs 50,000 crore for financial institutions like Nabard, National Housing Bank and Sidbi.

He further said surplus liquidity in the banking system has increased substantially as result of central bank's actions.

176,17-4-20,Bowlers better blokes than batsmen: McGrath,"Australia’s Pat Cummins is the most complete pacer among the current crop, says the legendary Glenn McGrath, who feels fast bowlers, in general, are ‘‘better blokes’’ and more hardworking than batsmen.

McGrath was answering 25 rapid-fire questions from ESPNCricinfo on a range of subjects.

Asked to name the most complete bowler in world cricket now, McGrath replied: “Pat Cummins. I like the way he goes by.”

Cummins is currently No1 in ICC Test rankings and occupies the fourth spot in the ODI list.

One of the best fast bowlers through the ‘90s till late 2000s, McGrath also addressed the big debate of his era — who was harder to bowl at, Sachin Tendulkar or Brian Lara?

“Tough,” he said when asked to pick between the two icons.

“I would go with Lara just (a bit) from my experience. The hat-trick wish-list would be Brian Lara, Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid.”

Asked if there was any delivery which was missing from his armoury, he cheekily replied: “the 100miles per hour delivery.”

According to him, the bowlers work a lot harder than batsmen.

177,17-4-20,Played so many ODIs because of Mahi’s support: Kedar,"India batsman Kedar Jadhav on Thursday said he owes a lot to former captain MS Dhoni who backed him throughout his career and helped him play so many ODIs for the country. ODI specialist Kedar was dropped from the squad for India’s home series against South Africa.

While it looks like this is the end of the road for the 35-year old, it would be fair to say Kedar enjoyed a decent run in 50-over cricket, playing 73 ODIs.

“Growing up Sachin (Tendulkar) was my idol like every aspiring cricketer. I regret I could not play with him. But when it comes to favourite cricketer, it has to be Dhoni,” Kedar said during Chennai Super Kings’s Instagram Live chat.

“When I met Mahi bhai I thought he is India’s captain and he would be very strict. After meeting him, I don’t see any other image when it comes to favourite cricketer,” said Kedar who has made 1389 runs with two hundreds and six fifties for India since making his debut in 2014.

“I could have played 8-10 ODIs but Mahi bhai supported me and he had a calming effect on me. When I see him I get confidence and if you get that from your captain, it helps a lot,” he said.

Asked about his unique side-arm bowling action, Kedar said he tried it during the 2016 New Zealand home series and Dhoni backed him.

“I tried it at the nets. That time Anil (Kumble) bhai was the coach and he said no it’s legal. Then in the 1st ODI, I got Jimmy Neesham out (caught and bowled). That was my first wicket and then Mahi bhai gave me the confidence that I can bowl. I had not bowled much in domestic cricket also. But it was because of him that I got confidence.”

A massive Salman Khan fan, Jadhav was asked to pick between the Bollywood superstar and Dhoni.

“Because of MS Dhoni I got to play however many matches I played and also because of Mahi bhai I got to meet Salman Khan. So I can’t pick between the two. It’s like asking to choose between Mum and Dad,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/played-so-many-odis-because-of-mahi---s-support--kedar.html
178,17-4-20,Katich open to IPL outside India,"Royal Challengers Bangalore head coach Simon Katich is open to the idea of having the 2020 IPL outside India and has “no doubt” the cash-rich league will take place in some form later in the year.

“Whether it would be in Australia (or elsewhere), that’s an interesting topic of conversation. There would be a few teams — us in particular at RCB, we’d be very happy for it to be played abroad, because a number of our overseas players are Australian and South African, who really would enjoy these conditions in Australia,” Katich told SEN Radio.

“It would be interesting to see if that would eventuate but obviously it’s one of many scenarios that’s being discussed.”

The IPL took place in South Africa in 2009 owing to the general elections in India at the same time and due to the same reason, a part of the tournament was held in the UAE in 2014.

Katich had replaced Gary Kirsten as the RCB head coach after the IPL last year. The Virat Kohli-led team is yet to win the league.

The former Australian batsman said the BCCI would leave no stone unturned to stage the IPL this year.

“It’s obviously the biggest T20 tournament in the world and the people there love their cricket.

“There is a huge economic side to this in terms of what the IPL generates, not only for the Indian economy but also for the franchises as well, and for the BCCI.

“Because of the amount of eyeballs that are on the IPL in India when it’s on in April and May, it is a scenario where it is potentially still very commercially viable being played with empty stadiums, so that’s something no doubt they'll be weighing up.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/katich-open-to-ipl-outside-india.html
179,17-4-20,It would be strange to play T20 WC without fans: Carey,"Australia wicket-keeper batsman Alex Carey says playing the upcoming T20 World Cup before empty stands would be strange and it would be ideal if the tourney is delayed to allow fans into stadiums.

T20 World Cup scheduled to be played in Australia between October 18 to November 15 is under threat due to travel restrictions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

“That would probably be the ideal situation if you can put a date on it, but it’s probably hard right now to say if we postpone the World Cup then three months later it would be fine to open the gates. I trust the guys well above my head to make the right decisions,” he told ESPNcricinfo.

“I’d say it would be a strange feeling (without a crowd), no doubt. Playing over in England in the one-day World Cup, having the crowds of all different countries going crazy when they do well is something you can’t really explain.

“As a cricket player and a lover of the game, I’d do anything I could to represent my country at a WC.”

The 28-year-old Carey said cricketers thrive on the energy of their fans and they would be jobless without them but if a spectator-less event is in store, he will still definitely go out to play for his country.

“Out in the middle it’s that atmosphere you love and thrive on. Saying that, the landscape of the world has changed rapidly over the last three months and if it has to be that way I’m sure we’ll find a way to make it go ahead.

“You want your fans there, they play a very big part in our sport and without the fans we wouldn’t have a job. But I love playing cricket and if there’s no one there I’ll definitely go out and play.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/it-would-be-strange-to-play-t20-wc-without-fans--carey.html

Lee admitted his “obsession” of wanting to be better than the two-time Olympic Gold medalist and five-time world champion kept him on his toes.

“Lin Dan was constantly in my head when I got back to training after every loss. I knew if I wanted to win important tournaments, I had to beat him. I couldn’t relax,” the 37-year-old said.

182,17-4-20,RBI to use all instruments to deal with Covid-19 challenges,"Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday assured that the central bank will use all instruments to deal with the challenges posed by the outbreak of Covid-19.

He also said that this is not the last of the announcements on financial support during the crisis, stating that the central bank will come up with responses in the future in the interest of the economy based on evolving situations.

Pointing out that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is monitoring all macro parameters on a continuous basis, he said, economic activity has come to standstill during lockdown.

The impact of Covid-19 is not captured in index of industrial production (IIP) data for February, he said, adding that contraction in exports in March at 34.6 per cent was much more severe than global financial crisis of 2008-09.

He said vehicle production and sales declined sharply in March and so did electricity consumption.

Appreciating the effort of banks and other institutions in keeping the financial market operational, Das said, there was no downtime of internet or mobile banking during lockdown and banking operations were normal.

Banks, financial institutions have risen to the occasion to ensure normal functioning during the outbreak of this pandemic, he said.

Announcing other measures, he said, liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of banks have been brought down to 80 per cent from 100 per cent, and will be restored in phases by April next year.

Loans given by non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) to real estate companies will hold similar benefit as given by scheduled commercial banks, he said.

To improve liquidity for states, he said, ways and means limit has been raised to help them.

Quoting IMF an report, Das said India is expected to post a sharp turnround in 2021-22 itself.

More than two million people have now been detected as Covid-19 patients globally even as several parts of the world, including India, have taken severe lockdown measures in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/no-let-up-in-corona-assault-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/no-let-up-in-corona-assault.html
184,17-4-20,"India tests 24 for 1 +ve case, highest in world: ICMR","Amid concerns that India is not doing enough tests to diagnose Covid-19 patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Thursday said currently it tests 24 people for one positive case, which is the highest in the world. However, India remained at the bottom of countries as far testing per one million populations is concerned.

“In Japan, to find one positive case, 11.7 persons are tested. In Italy that number is 6.7, in the US it’s 5.3, in the UK it’s 3.4. Here in India, we do 24 tests for one positive case. Not all are vulnerable to the virus. Hence, one can’t say that India is testing less,” said the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR, Dr Raman R Gangakhedkar.

However, going by per million criteria, India is way behind, testing 199 persons in one million where as many other countries are testing over 20,000-30,000 per millions. The US and Spain are testing over 10,000 and 20,000 persons per million respectively and the UAE 77,000.

Switzerland, Norway, and France are also carrying out around 20,000 test per million populations. Bangladesh and Algeria are among some of the countries which are testing less than India.

The issue of testing surfaced when in a series of tweets and social media messages during the day, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said that over the last couple of months, he has been speaking to a large number of experts in India, abroad, in Government and outside Government who have a very good understanding of what is going on, so whatever he says are based on those conversations.

“Lockdown allows time and space to put in medical resources: ramp up testing abilities, prepare hospitals, get ventilators. A misconception that I want to clear is, in no way does a lockdown defeat the virus, it stops the virus for sometime,” Rahul tweeted in one message.

“Our testing rate is 199/million and if you look at all tests that have been done it’s an average of 350/district,” Rahul said.

Responding to this, Gangakhedkar, said “2,90,401 people have been tested till date, of which 30,043 (26,331 tests done at ICMR’s 176 labs and 3,712 tests at 78 private labs) were tested on Wednesday.”

Working in one shift, more than 42,400 samples can be tested per day; if we work in two shifts, we will be able to test more than 78,200 Covid-19 samples per day, said the scientist, asserting that there was enough scope for expanding its testing capacity.

He said it had received 5,00,000 testing kits, including rapid anti-body kits, from two Chinese companies with 80 per cent sensitivity and 84 per cent specificity.

Rapid antibody testing kits (first lot of 3 lakh from Guangzhou Wondfo and 2.5 lakh from Zhuhai Livzon) and RNA extraction kits (1 lakh from MGI Shenzhen) have arrived for Covid-19 patients. However, he pointed out that Rapid Covid-19 test kits procured from China were not for early diagnosis will be used for surveillance and to monitor whether coronavirus hotspots in the country are increasing or decreasing.

Regarding concern over the efficacy of the rapid antibody testing kits, he said if an antibody test of a person turns out to be positive, one cannot necessarily be sure the person would not get infected ever again. “This means, even if antibody is present, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily be effectively able to fight the virus.”

“Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for diagnosis. Hence there is no concern with respect to the testing kits being faulty, that concern was with respect to immune response alone,” Dr Gangakhedkar explained.

Earlier, the Government had announced that the rapid antibodies kits will arrive by April 8. However, there had been delays because of particular challenges considering the supply crunch and local regulations requiring registration.

Testing criteria in India were stringent so far and tests are being ramped up only now. Given the limited testing so far, it is too early to say whether India’s current trajectory will sustain, rise, or flatten in the coming days.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-tests-24-for-1--ve-case--highest-in-world--icmr.html

186,17-4-20,"Sufficient testing, not lockdown, can defeat Covid: Rahul","Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said the Government must explore ways of gradually lifting the nationwide lockdown because it can only “pause” the spread of novel coronavirus, not end it.

“Lockdown is not a solution, neither a treatment. Therefore, we must find a strategy to come out from the lockdown phase. The PM’s role should be to empower the States. The only way to do this is to increase testing and chasing the virus, and going beyond, and this is my advice to the Government — use testing,” Rahul said while addressing a Press conference online.

Also, he said this is not the time to fight even if he differs with the Prime Minister. “Instead it was time to understand and fight the crisis together.”

“When you lock people up, the disease gets locked up and when you open the door, the disease comes rushing out,” Rahul said.

Addressing the media days after the Prime Minister extended the lockdown after arriving at a consensus with the Chief Ministers, Rahul said.

He also warned of major economic crisis post-Covid-19 and urged the need for widening the social security net especially by providing free food for the needy, including the stranded migrant workers. ""Our godowns are full. The Government must provide food to all the poor,"" he said.

He found fault with the Government's approach in conducting tests. ""Currently testing levels are too low. I am proposing scaling up testing. One advice to the Government is, push testing aggressively. Maximise testing and use testing strategically, to assist States in their fight,"" Rahul said.

To a question on how the Congress leaders of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad and many senior Congress leaders and Congress CMs had supported the broad direction of the Government handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, Rahul said, ""I don't want go to go in the past. We must fight together and not get into the blame game. Instead let's use our resources carefully and give the money to states and districts.""

He predicted a ""massive financial backlash"", stating that the first wave of unemployment was already on its way.""We must ensure that in protecting lives, we don't destroy our economy completely.""

He said the PM should have a more detailed conversation with States. ""But the Prime Minister has a different style of working and we can work around that style,"" he said.

He further advised the Government on the Congress devised NYAY scheme through which give money directly to 20 per cent of the poor because they are facing difficulties. 'Use some other name (If you so like), instead of NYAY,"" he tweeted.

People are becoming unemployed and it is going to get worse. Prepare packages for SMEs who can employ people as well as packages for big companies.

""It is important to focus on the strategy after lockdown. What will be the strategy for testing? How will you prepare PHC and hospital? Because, the cases will increase after lockdown. Action should not be delayed. I am sad that the food grains in the warehouse did not reach the people. SMEs should know what is being done for them,"" Rahul said in a tweet during the day.

He also advised the Government to create two basic zones in India- a hotspot zone and a non-hotspot zone. ""Use testing to identify hotspots, so you can monitor the minute a zone becomes a hotspot and you can clamp down,"" he said.

To a different query through the video conference about his letter to PM where he talked of an India specific policy and partial lifting, Rahul there should be a strategic opening.

""So, you open particular key areas, you use testing to identify and this is where the point of ramping up testing is important. You use testing to identify dynamically which are the hotspots, and you clamp down on those hotspots, but, you create two basic zones in India- a hotspot zone and a non-hotspot zone and you use testing to identify the places, which are becoming hotspot. So, you make sure that if any zone is moving from a non-hotspot zone in terms of the disease, you immediately clamp down. So, that would be how, you would think about it. Because realise that at one level, when you lock people up, the disease gets locked up,"" he said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sufficient-testing--not-lockdown--can-defeat-covid--rahul-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sufficient-testing--not-lockdown--can-defeat-covid--rahul.html
187,17-4-20,"BJP blames Sena, Maha Govt sees plot behind Bandra chaos","The rush of thousands of migrants at Bandra Railway Terminus two days ago has created a political upheaval in the State with the ruling alliance and the BJP blaming each other for the chaos.

Several senior BJP leaders, including former Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, have repeatedly blamed the Sena-led alliance Government for mishandling the situation and asserting that it was the responsibility of the State to look after the migrant workers.

Facing all-round flak, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday came out with a conspiracy theory and said it didn’t expect the Opposition BJP to stoop so low and conduct itself in a manner that had nothing to do with either Maharashtra or its

people.

In a hard-hitting editorial published in the Sena’s official mouth-piece Saamana, the Shiv Sena hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that mere speeches by the leaders did not “fill the stomachs of the people and that people were unhappy with the relief extended to them by the Government”.

“On the morning of April 14, the country’s most popular and efficient Prime Minister Modi extends the lockdown till May 3. Moments after Modi’s speech ends, migrant labourers in Mumbai, Surat and various other cities gets restless. What we are witnessing is dangerous. Mere speeches by the leaders do not fill the stomachs of the people and that people are unhappy with the relief extended to them by the Government. It is life and battle for the migrants,” the Sena said.

“There was indeed a conspiracy behind whatever happened in front of Bandra Railway Terminus on Tuesday. The people will definitely come to know as what led to the huge crowds in front of Bandra Railway Terminus,” it said.

BJP blames Sena, Maha Govt

sees plot behind Bandra chaos

“We will bust the conspiracy. The State Government will nail the people - taking advantage of coronavirus -- who were trying to spread falsehood. It is rather unfortunate that the Opposition has chosen to stoop so low,” the Shiv Sena said.

“The Opposition does not lose even a single opportunity to land the State Government in trouble. For the purpose, it ( the Opposition) can stoop down to any level. This is like driving a wedge in the Maharashtra political culture. The Opposition is behaving as if it has nothing to do with either Maharashtra or its people. If the Opposition continues in such a manner, it will lose whatever credibility it has among the people,” the Saamana editorial said.

Maintaining that it did not agree that rumours that the Railways would run special trains to ferry north-Indian migrants based in Mumbai had triggered assembly of thousands of people, the Shiv Sena said: “We do not say they were rumours. It was indeed news. In fact there is a Press release issued by the Railway about starting special trains. That being the case, it cannot be said that because of rumours that so many migrant workers gathered in front of the Bandra Railway Station”.

“Why did the Railways started reservations of tickets after April 15? And that too at time when there was uncertainty whether the Prime Minister would lift the lockdown or not, the Railways’ to create such a confusion by doing ticket reservations of 40 lakh people is indeed a crime,” the Sena editorial said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/bjp-blames-sena--maha-govt--sees-plot-behind-bandra-chaos.html

Modi held discussions with Nirmala as the pandemic hit sectors from small industries to the aviation sector hard with millions of jobs at stake.

The meeting comes amid drastic reduction in GDP growth forecast by various multi-lateral funding agencies due to the impact of COVID-19 and consequent lockdown. As per the World Bank, India is expected to grow 1.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent.

Similarly, the IMF on Tuesday projected a GDP growth of 1.9 per cent for India in 2020, as the global economy hits the worst recession since the Great Depression in 1930s.

The pandemic and consequent lockdown have hit various sectors, including MSME, hospitality, civil aviation, agriculture and allied sector.

The Government constituted an empowered group — headed by Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty — which is entrusted with the task of suggesting measures that can bring back economy back on track quickly post the lockdown.

To ease the pain and misery, the Finance Minister last month announced a Rs 1.7 lakh crore stimulus that included free foodgrains and cooking gas to poor for three months, and cash doles to women and poor senior citizens as it looked to ease the economic impact of the nationwide lockdown.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/modi-reviews-virus-impact--2nd-stimulus--on-the-anvil.html

""The outbreak of COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the Pakistani economy,"" said Geoffrey Okamoto, the IMF's First Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair.

The domestic containment measures coupled with the global downturn are severely affecting growth and straining external financing which has created an urgent balance of payments need, he said.

""As the crisis abates, the authorities' renewed commitment to the reforms in the existing Extended Fund Facility -- in particular those related to fiscal consolidation strategy, energy sector, governance, and remaining AML/CFT deficiencies -- will be crucial to entrench resilience, boost Pakistan's growth potential, and deliver broad based benefits for all Pakistanis,"" Okamoto said.

Expeditious donor support is needed to close the remaining balance of payments gap and ease the adjustment burden, he added.

Okamoto said that in response to the crisis, the government of Pakistan has taken swift action to halt the community spread of the virus and introduced an economic stimulus package aimed at accommodating the spending needed to tackle the health emergency and supporting economic activity.

""Crucially, the authorities are increasing public health spending and strengthening social safety net programs to provide immediate relief to the most vulnerable,"" he said.

""Similarly, the State Bank of Pakistan has adopted a timely set of measures, including a lowering of the policy rate and new refinancing facilities, to support liquidity and credit conditions and safeguard financial stability. In this context, the authorities' policies should be targeted and temporary,"" Okamoto said.

The cash-strapped Pakistan government has been implementing austerity measures to improve the country's finances. In July last year, Pakistan registered a currency reserve of less than USD 8 billion -- enough to cover only 1.7 months of imports.

Pakistan has so far received billions in financial aid from friendly countries like China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE during the current fiscal year.

199,17-4-20,SKorea sees rise in second-time virus diagnoses,"South Korea says it's continuing to see a rise in patients who test positive for the coronavirus for a second time after being diagnosed as recovered. However, the risk of transmissions from such cases so far appears to be low.

Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Friday at least 163 people have tested positive again after their initial release from hospitals, accounting for more than 2% of the country's 7,829 recoveries.

She says the patients on average were 13.5 days removed from their release when they tested positive again, although the longest gap was 35 days.

Jeong says none of the patients were in serious condition although 61 of them were exhibiting mild symptoms. Officials are monitoring about 300 people who contacted the patients but have so far detected no transmissions of the virus.

While health authorities are investigating the causes of such cases, including whether they are linked to virus mutations, they have so far downplayed the possibility that people could get re-infected after making a full recovery.

They say it's more likely that infections were re-activated after remaining dormant in patients whose bodies hadn't fully developed immunity after experiencing mild symptoms.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/skorea-sees-rise-in-second-time-virus-diagnoses-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/skorea-sees-rise-in-second-time-virus-diagnoses.html

202,17-4-20,"Iran says 89 virus deaths take total to 4,958","Iran said on Friday 89 more people have died from the novel coronavirus, as the country's official fatalities remained in double figures for a fourth day.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour told a news conference that the latest deaths brought the overall toll to 4,958.

It was the sixth day that the official fatality rate has dropped in the Middle East's worst-hit country.

Jahanpour added that 1,499 new infections had been confirmed in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 79,494 from 319,879 tests.

Of those confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus and admitted to hospital, 54,064 had been discharged after recovering.

Another 3,563 were in critical condition.

Ever since the country reported its first deaths two months ago, there has been speculation abroad that the tolls are higher than officially announced.

A parliamentary report on Tuesday said the officially announced figures were based only on those hospitalised with ""severe symptoms"".

It said the death toll was estimated to be as much as 80 percent more and infections ""eight to 10 times"" higher.

The health ministry has confirmed the numbers may be higher due to limited testing.

The government of President Hassan Rouhani has struggled to contain the outbreak and keep Iran's fragile and sanctions-hit economy running.

It shut schools and universities, postponed major events and imposed a range of other restrictions, but it has stopped short of ordering lockdowns.

Iran is to allow small businesses in Tehran to reopen on Saturday, following similar measures for those outside the capital last week.

The move has faced criticism from health experts and even some authorities, but top officials argue that sanctions-hit Iran cannot afford to shut down its economy.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/iran-says-89-virus-deaths-take-total-to-4-958-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/iran-says-89-virus-deaths-take-total-to-4-958.html

204,17-4-20,"Russian virus cases top 32,000, Putin warns of 'very high' risks","Russia said Friday it had recorded 32,008 coronavirus cases, including a record 4,070 in the last 24 hours, as President Vladimir Putin warned of ""very high"" risks, particularly in the ill-equipped provinces.

Official figures showed more than half of the new cases were registered in Moscow and the surrounding region. So far 273 deaths have been recorded in Russia, including 41 in the last 24 hours.

Speaking during a televised video-conference with regional governors, Putin said that ""the risks surrounding the epidemic's spread are still very high, not just in Moscow but in many other Russian regions.""

Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin on Friday reported the completion of a 500-bed hospital built within weeks, which will start admitting patients Monday.

But Putin said every region must be equally prepared, even as several governors complained of a lack of medical equipment and specialist staff.

Vladimir region governor Vladimir Sipyagin said his region of 1.36 million only has 71 ventilators and half the needed resuscitation experts.

To this Putin responded that governors ""are sitting there in order to overcome challenges"".

Moscow, Europe's largest city with some 12 million inhabitants, has been under lockdown since the end of March, but officials have complained that many residents are flouting confinement rules.

Deputy mayor Anastasia Rakova warned the city ""will face difficult weeks"" ahead.

""The peak in morbidity should arrive in the next two to three weeks,"" she said in a video released on social media.

Under confinement rules that Muscovites have to observe until at least May 1, they are only allowed to leave their homes to go to work, walk their dogs, take out trash or visit their nearest shop.

205,17-4-20,"US trade body awards grant to accelerate India's use of natural gas, improve energy access","A federal US trade body on Thursday announced to award a grant to an Indian company to accelerate its use of natural gas and improve energy access to support economic growth.

Under the grant, the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) will fund a feasibility study to evaluate the development of a virtual pipeline that will distribute natural gas via truck, rail or ship to areas unserved by traditional gas pipeline infrastructure.

The grant, which was not specified, has been awarded to Arush Gas Technology Services LLP, the USTDA said in a press release.

According to Thomas Hardy, USTDA's Acting Director the project will improve the resilience of India's energy network, making it better able to meet increased energy demand from industry and its citizens.

It will make a critical difference in achieving a cleaner and more resilient energy supply system in India, while creating significant opportunities for U.S. industry and American workers, he said.

USTDA said the new implementation of a flexible virtual pipeline network will serve as an interim transportation solution while India's physical gas pipeline infrastructure is developed, as well as a long-term option in areas where physical pipelines are not viable.

AGTS has selected Houston-bases Galway Group to conduct the study.

The natural gas virtual pipeline project transferring LNG across the country is a long-term parallel solution for natural gas in India; pipeline gas can cover only a segment of the energy landscape, even if the physical pipeline doubles up in fifteen years, said Shreyas C. Sheth, president, Arush Gas.

We believe the experiences from the US technology and services, lessons learnt will greatly benefit India. The Government of India, through its various departments and statutory directives is supporting this energy transition very effectively, and Arush Gas is proud to be a partner in this significant transition, he said.

Based on Galway Group's experience in the small-scale LNG and virtual pipelines segment, we are pleased to be given the opportunity to participate and contribute to India's clean energy strategy and virtual pipelines developmental framework, through this USTDA initiative, said Hal Miller, Chairman & CEO of Galway Group LLC, USA.

The study supports USTDA's US Gas Infrastructure Exports Initiative and the Administration's Asia Enhancing Development and Growth through Energy (Asia EDGE) initiative goals to strengthen energy security and expand energy access in partner countries, the media release said.

206,17-4-20,"COVID-19: Record 4,591 Americans die in last 24 hours","A record number of 4,591 Americans have died in the last 24 hours due to the deadly novel coronavirus in the US, which has the highest number of COVID-19 casualties in the world.

According to the Johns Hopkins University data, by 8 pm on Thursday, as many as 4,591 Americans have died in the last 24 hours, The Wall Street Journal said.

The previous highest was 2,569 on Wednesday.

By Thursday, more than 662,000 Americans tested positive with the coronavirus.

The dreaded disease, which originated in Wuhan city in China in December last year, has so far claimed more than 144,000 lives and infected over 2.1 million people.

The virus has infected over 671,000 people and claimed more than 33,000 lives, the highest for any country in the world.

New York City and its adjoining areas, including New Jersey and Connecticut have emerged as the epicenter of the virus in the US.

New York alone accounts for 226,000 cases of infections and 16,106 deaths.

In New Jersey, as many as 3,518 people have died of the disease and 75,317 have tested positive.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, till April 14, four per cent of the Americans infected with COVID-19 were of Asian origin and nearly one-third (30 per cent) were African Americans.

US President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that experts and scientists report that his strategy to slow the spread of the virus has saved hundreds of thousands of lives.

Models predicted between 1.5 million and 2.2 million US deaths. If there was no mitigation, it could have even been higher than that and between 100,000 and 240,000 deaths with mitigation. It is looking like we will come far under even these lowest numbers, he said.

Noting that experts say the curve of the virus has flattened, and the peak in the new cases has passed, Trump said that nationwide, more than 850 counties or nearly 30 per cent of the country have reported no new cases in the last seven days.

Because of our early and aggressive action, we have avoided the tragedy of health care rationing and deadly shortfalls that have befallen in many other nations, nations which wherever possible we are helping, he said.

According to Trump, at least 35 clinical trials are already underway, including antiviral therapies, immune therapies, and blood therapies in the form of convalescent plasma. So far, more than 3.5 million tests have been carried out.

207,17-4-20,"China revises coronavirus figures in epicentre Wuhan by 50%; national death toll jumps to 4,632","China's coronavirus death toll mounted to 4,632 on Friday after it revised the fatality figures by 50 per cent in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, as Beijing faced mounting international criticism of under-reporting of the COVID-19 data.

Citing data discrepancies, the Wuhan municipal headquarters on Friday revised the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths due to the disease which originated in the central Chinese city in December last year.

As of April 16, the total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Wuhan was raised by 325 cases to 50,333 and the number of fatalities up by 1,290 to 3,869, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

The revised figure raised China's overall COVID-19 death toll to 4,632. The total number of cases also increased to 82,692.

The Wuhan municipal headquarters in a notification said the revisions were made in accordance with related laws and regulations as well as the principle of ""being responsible for history, the people and the deceased.""

The latest revision of figures came amid sharp criticism of China by the US, the UK and other countries for its alleged under-reporting of the coronavirus cases, lack of transparency and cover-up of the origin of the viral strain, which emerged in Wuhan in December last, reportedly from the local Huanan sea food market.

The way COVID-19 cases were counted in China was changed in January and February, leading to widespread confusion over the extent of the health crisis in the world's most populous country.

But China denied on Friday that it had covered up the extent of its COVID-19 outbreak.

A foreign ministry spokesman acknowledged that the virus's rapid spread had contributed to under-counting that resulted in China raising its death toll earlier in the day. However, he emphasised that ""there has never been any concealment, and we'll never allow any concealment.""

Explaining the reason for the figure revision, the Wuhan municipality on Friday said it was done to ensure that the information on the city's COVID-19 epidemic is open and transparent, and that the data are accurate.

Listing the reasons for the data discrepancies, it said the surging number of patients at the early stage of the epidemic overwhelmed medical resources and the admission capacity of medical institutions. Some patients died at home without having been treated in hospitals.

Besides, during the height of their treating efforts, hospitals were operating beyond their capacities and medical staff were preoccupied with saving and treating patients, resulting in belated, missed and mistaken reporting.

Also, due to a rapid increase of designated hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients -- including those administered by ministries, Hubei Province, Wuhan city and its districts, those affiliated to companies, as well as private hospitals and makeshift hospitals -- a few medical institutions were not linked to the epidemic information network and failed to report their data in time.

The registered information of some of the deceased patients was incomplete, and there were repetitions and mistakes in the reporting, the Wuhan authorities noted.

Citing an official of the Wuhan municipal headquarters, Xinhua reported that a group for epidemic-related big data and epidemiological investigations was established in late March.

The group used information from online systems and collected full information from all epidemic-related locations to ensure that facts about every case are accurate and every figure is objective and correct.

""What lie behind the epidemic data are the lives and health of the general public, as well as the credibility of the government,"" the official was quoted by the report.

The timely revision of the figures, among other things, shows respect for every single life, the official said.

Meanwhile, the revised cases were not included in the overall national figures released by China's National Commission (NHC) in its daily report on Friday as it reports previous day's cases.

As per the NHC data, as of Thursday the overall confirmed cases of coronavirus was 82,367, including 3,342 deaths.

As many as 1,081 patients are being treated and 77,944 people discharged after recovery, it said.

The NHC said it received reports of 26 new confirmed COVID-19 cases from the mainland on Thursday, of which 15 were imported.

The other 11 new cases were domestically transmitted, it said, noting that five cases were reported in Guangdong Province, three in Heilongjiang Province, two in Shandong Province and one in Liaoning Province.

No death was reported on Thursday on the mainland.

As of Thursday, China has a total of 1,549 imported cases, NHC said, adding that 879 were undergoing treatment with 45 in severe condition. Besides, there were 66 new asymptomatic cases, taking the tally to 1,038.

208,17-4-20,Putin postpones World War II victory parade due to virus,"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday postponed next month's Victory Day celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, citing the worsening coronavirus pandemic for putting off the lavish festivities that have dominated the Kremlin's political agenda.

In televised remarks, a grim-faced Putin said the virus makes public gatherings such as the huge parade through Red Square on May 9 too dangerous.

The risks linked to the epidemic that hasn't yet reached its peak are extremely high, and that doesn't give me the right to start preparations for the parade and other festivities, he said, adding that the celebration will be held later this year.

The postponement followed an earlier decision by Putin to put off a vote originally scheduled for April 22 on constitutional changes that would allow him to stay in office until 2036, if he desired.

The plebiscite and the Victory Day celebrations had topped Russia's political calendar for months, and the decision to delay both was clearly a painful and difficult one that followed weeks of procrastination by the Kremlin.

The May 9 date is sacred for us, but every life is priceless too, Putin said.

All Victory Day celebrations across Russia will also be postponed, he added. The festivities include gatherings of veterans and massive demonstrations dubbed the Immortal Regiment in which relatives of those who fought in the war carry their photos.

Putin himself took part in those marches, carrying a picture of his father.

The president has ordered a partial economic shutdown until April 30 and recently warned officials to prepare for the most extraordinary scenarios of the outbreak, because the number of infections in Russia has grown exponentially.

The country has registered 27,938 coronavirus cases and 232 deaths. Officials have scrambled to secure breathing machines and other essential supplies as the outbreak has worsened.

Since the Soviet era, Victory Day has been the nation's most revered holiday, reflecting the country's enormous suffering during World War II. Russian officials have put the nation's death toll at 27 million in the war, and some historians think it could be higher.

On Victory Day, we honor the heroes who defended the country and the rest of the world and sacrificed their lives to protect others, Putin said, adding that Russians still will mark the day despite the need to delay the public ceremonies. Every family will remember and honor its heroes. Chinese President Xi Jinping, French President Emmanuel Macron and other foreign dignitaries had promised to attend this year's parade, which was to involve 14,000 troops and 300 tanks and other vehicles in a massive display of military might.

Russian troops already had started rehearsing for the parade, drilling at a range outside Moscow that was configured to resemble Red Square.

The Kremlin saw Victory Day as an opportunity to underline Russia's vital role in history and showcase its international leverage. It would have been an important political coup for Russia, which has been under U.S. and European sanctions since Moscow's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula.

While a quick rollback of sanctions never seemed plausible, the Kremlin hoped that the presence of Macron and possibly other Western leaders at the parade might provide momentum for normalizing ties.

Putin vowed to organize a parade later in 2020 without setting the date. Russian media reported that festivities could be held in June to coincide with the date in 1945 when the Soviet Union staged a massive parade through Red Square to mark the victory, or on the anniversary of Japan's emperor signing surrender documents on Sept. 2, 1945.

We will face down the threat we are confronting now, Putin said. And then we will embrace our veterans.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/putin-postpones-world-war-ii-victory-parade-due-to-virus-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/putin-postpones-world-war-ii-victory-parade-due-to-virus.html
209,17-4-20,"Trump unveils guidelines to reopen America, lets governors to take call on lifting curbs in states","US President Donald Trump has unveiled a three-phase plan to reopen the world's largest economy, jolted by the COVID-19 pandemic, that allows governors to gradually ease the crippling lockdown in their states.

His announcement came on a day when the labour department said another 5.2 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week. The job losses from the COVID-19 pandemic was 22 million in March, easily the worst stretch of US job losses on record.

The International Monetary Fund this week projected that the American economy will shrink this year by 5.9 per cent amidst the pandemic that has wrecked havoc in the country.

""America wants to be open and Americans want to be open,"" he said. ""A national shutdown is not a sustainable long-term solution,"" Trump told reporters at his daily White House briefing on the coronavirus outbreak.

Asserting that a prolonged lockdown, combined with a forced economic depression, would inflict an immense and wide-ranging toll on public health, Trump told reporters on Thursday that his administration is issuing new federal guidelines that will allow governors to take a phased approach to reopening their individual states.

Trump said healthy Americans will now be able to return to work if conditions on the ground allow.

""Instead of a blanket shutdown, we will pursue a focus on sheltering the highest risk individuals, he said, adding that his administration is establishing clear scientific metric and benchmarks on testing new case growth and hospital capacity that must be met before advancing to each phase.

""If the virus returns in the fall, as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure that our country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly,"" he said.

Currently more than 95 per cent of America's 330 million population are under a stay-at-home order. More than 670,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus, and over 33,000 have lost their lives, according to latest Johns Hopkins University figures.

A record 4,591 Americans died in the last 24 hours alone due to the novel coronavirus in the US, which has the highest number of COVID-19 casualties in the world.

The 18-page guidelines were developed by top medical experts from across the government and are based on verifiable metrics regarding the situation on the ground. The guidelines empower governors to tailor the phased reopening to address the situation in their states.

The guidelines criteria set clear benchmarks on new cases, testing, and hospital resources for states to meet before proceeding toward a phased reopening.

For the first phase, the guidelines recommends that states see a downward trajectory for 14 days in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases as well as flu-like symptoms before they move to lift stay-at-home orders and other restrictions meant to curb the spread of the virus.

The second phase include asking for all vulnerable individuals to shelter in place, encourage telework, and the common areas should remain closed or be physically distant.

All nonessential travel for employees can resume, and then again special accommodations for vulnerable.

Large venues can operate but solely under moderate physical distancing, and elective surgeries can resume on an outpatient and inpatient basis,"" said Dr Deborah Brix, a member of the White House Task Force on Coronavirus.

The third phase is essentially returning to the new normal with continuing the good hygiene practices, continuing the respect for spaces between individuals because there are still issues with asymptomatic spread, she said.

The criteria also include hospitals having the resources to treat all patients without crisis care and a robust testing program for healthcare workers.

The president has argued with governors in recent days about the timing of easing restrictions and reopening businesses - but he has now conceded that his powers are limited to issuing guidelines.

During Thursday's call, Trump told the governors: ""You're going to call your own shots.""

""You're going to be running it, we're going to be helping you,"" he was quoted as saying.

At the press conference, Trump expressed confidence in reviving the US economy.

""We took the greatest economy in the history of the world, and we closed it in order to win this war, and we are in the process of winning it now. Our approach outlines three phases in restoring our economic life,"" he said.

""We are not opening all at once but one careful step at a time, and some states will be able to open up sooner than others. Some states are not in the kind of trouble that others are in, he said.

Now that the country has passed the peak on new cases, people are starting their life again. We are starting rejuvenation of our economy again in a safe and structured and very responsible fashion, he said.

Vice President Mike Pence, who is in charge of the White House taskforce against COVID-19, said that the new guidelines for opening up America again are a product of the best science and the best common sense that the president has marshalled on his team and from a broad range of advisors from all across the nation.

Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, cautioned against packed sports arena even in the phase three.

211,17-4-20,Bolsonaro fires popular Brazil health minister amid pandemic,"Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, whose dismissive stance toward the COVID-19 pandemic has angered many health experts, fired his popular health minister following a series of disagreements over the proper response to contain the virus' spread in South America's most populous country.

Luiz Henrique Mandetta, an orthopedist, had garnered support for his handling of the pandemic that included promotion of broad isolation measures enacted by state governors, even drawing comparisons to Dr. Anthony Fauci, U.S. President Donald Trump's top virus expert.

His dismissal comes as experts say the peak of the new coronavirus outbreak in Brazil is expected in the coming weeks.

You should have absolute certainty that we fought a good fight until here, Mandetta told fellow ministry workers in a televised press conference Thursday after announcing his departure.

But we're at the start of the battle. Bolsonaro, for his part, has repeatedly characterized the virus as a little flu, said shutting down the economy would cause more damage than confining only high-risk Brazilians, and touted the yet-unproven efficacy of an anti-malarial drug.

Life is priceless, but the economy and employment need to return to normality, Bolsonaro said at a press conference on Thursday. He also said he would neither condemn nor criticize Mandetta.

It was a consensual divorce because more important than me and more important than him as a minister is the health of the Brazilian people.

For Mandetta's replacement, Bolsonaro named Nelson Teich, an oncologist and senior consultant at medical services company Teich Health Care. He also has a Master's in Business Administration, according to his LinkedIn page.

Speaking alongside Bolsonaro, Teich said he didn't want to announce any changes abruptly, as little is known about the virus. He added that he and the president are completely aligned. Health and the economy are complementary, Teich said.

While Fauci isn't a politician like Mandetta, both have often made public statements about the virus that differed with those of their bosses. The White House has said this week that Fauci's job is secure. Still, Republicans close to the White House say Trump has complained about Fauci's positive media attention and sought to leave him out of task force briefings.

Bolsonaro, likewise, had convened doctors without inviting Mandetta and, in a televised interview earlier this month, said Mandetta had failed to show humility.

A few days later, on April 5, Bolsonaro told a group of supporters that he would act against officials in his government who are full of themselves.

Those comments were widely understood as signaling an end to Mandetta's tenure, so much so that the minister said the next day his subordinates had cleaned out his desk.

He survived, but questions swirled over whether Bolsonaro had indeed backed away from dismissing the man whose COVID-19 response was welcomed by many Brazilians, or if he were just biding his time while recruiting a replacement.

That uncertainty vanished on Thursday.

While rising quickly, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Brazil is still relatively low in relation to the country's massive population of 211 million, though it does have the most cases in Latin America. There have been almost 2,000 deaths. Its peak is expected in May.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Following Mandetta's announcement of his firing, people in apartment buildings in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro could be heard yelling insults at Bolsonaro from their windows. A survey earlier this month by pollster Datafolha showed three-quarters of Brazilians approved of the health ministry's handling of the crisis, versus just one-third for Bolsonaro.

At his press conference, Mandetta offered thanks to individuals with whom he had worked, and even to Bolsonaro.

I leave the health ministry with a lot of gratitude to the president for having nominated me and allowing me to nominate each of you, Mandetta said. I know I am leaving the best team. Work for the next minister like you worked for me. Don't spare any effort.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bolsonaro-fires-popular-brazil-health-minister-amid-pandemic-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/bolsonaro-fires-popular-brazil-health-minister-amid-pandemic.html
212,17-4-20,Covid taking its toll on frontline warriors,"20-odd hospitals sealed, over 600 medics affected, 3 doctors dead

As many as 68 doctors, nurses and staff of the Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital in North-West Delhi were sent on home quarantine after a 25-year-old woman patient, suspected to have had coronavirus, died on Wednesday night. The pregnant woman allegedly did not disclose that she had travelled abroad recently and had been asked to be under home quarantine.

Similarly, 39 staff members, including doctors and nurses, of the Max Hospital in Delhi’s Saket were asked to go on self-quarantine three days ago after two patients there tested positive for coronavirus.

Twenty-odd hospitals sealed or put under restrictions, over 600 health workers, including doctors and nurses, affected and as many as three doctors dead — that’s the toll the coronavirus contagion has taken on India’s healthcare system and its frontline warriors so far. And the numbers are swelling on a daily basis, with 65 staff at the King George Hospital Lucknow being quarantined last Thursday.

In a country like India with a billion plus population, over 10,000 Covid-19 positive cases and 350 deaths so far, losing even a single medical professional when they are needed the most will weaken our determined fight against the pandemic, experts cautioned against the backdrop of the death of two doctors in Indore and one in Delhi due to the pandemic.

“It means, one fewer professional in an already-strained system, another patient to care for and, potentially, a team of colleagues who need to be quarantined,” said Dr Rajan Sharma, president, Indian Medical Association, which represents private medical practitioners in the country.

This when the doctor-population ratio in India is 1:10,926 against the WHO’s recommended ratio of 1:1000.

The risk of getting infected apart, these frontline warriors also have to do with the long working hours, uncooperative patients, lack of protective equipment and personal safety network. The IMA president said that the Government should also ensure the safety of the workers so that they feel secure and work with more zeal to save the patients.

Experts do not rule out the possibility of India having an alarming number of infected people in the coming four months. While many might still recover from mild consequences, thousands will require hospitalisation. What’s more worrisome is, even among these cases, a few are thought to have been infected outside the healthcare setting.

According to the Preventive Wear Manufacturers’ Association of India (PWMAI), to deal with the influx of patients, a minimum of 5 lakh health workers - which include doctors, nurses, paramedics, maintenance and other support staff - will be required. If a requirement of three overalls is considered for each worker each day, then about 15 lakh PPE will be required daily.

India has a little over 11.57 lakh allopathic doctors registered with the State medical councils and the Medical Council of India as on January 31, 2020 and assuming 80 per cent availability, it is estimated that around 9.26 lakh doctors may be actually available for active service. And as per Indian Nursing Council (INC) records, there are around 30.4 lakh nursing personnel registered in the country as on December 31, 2018.

The instances of the medical staffers and hospitals getting affected are coming from different States. Several private super specialty hospitals in Mahrashtra like DY Patil, KB Bhabha Hospital, Breach Candy Hospital. Hinduja Hospital, Spandan, KR Bhatia Hospital, Wockhardt, Jaslok, Nanavati and YB Chavan Hospital have been sealed or put under restrictions by the municipal authorities in the past two weeks after several staff including doctors tested coronavirus positive.

Maharashtra, the most affected State in India, saw over 96 medical staff including doctors quarantined in DY Patil hospital in Pune while at Wockhardt, 56 medical staffers, including doctors, nurses and ward boys, contracted the virus. At Jaslok Hospital, 1,005 staff members were tested, of which 21 were found infected with Sars-Cov-2, at Breach Candy Hospital, one doctor and two nurses contracted the infection while at Saifee hospital, two doctors contracted the disease through close family contacts.

In the national Capital, the Delhi State Cancer Institute has been sealed while some restrictions have been imposed on Max Hospital, Ganga Ram Hospital, GTB and LNJP hospitals after doctors and medical staff found infected due to coronavirus. As many as 250 medical staff including doctors have tested Covid-19 positive and quarantined. Of them, about 30 health workers, including doctors and nurses, of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences have been quarantined. So have been the over 100 staffers at the Gangaram Hospital and 14 of RML hospital.

Indore has become a coronavirus hotspot in Madhya Pradesh. Besides the death of the two doctors on two consecutive days, several women medicos at a Government hospital in the city too have been found coronavirus positive, involved as they were in screening people for the infection in the city. Indore is coronavirus hotspot of Madhya Pradesh.

Elsewhere, over 50 healthcare workers, including doctors and paramedical staff, have been quarantined or isolated due to their exposure to positive or suspected cases of COVID-19, within a month of the pandemic in J&K, which reported the first case on March 9. In Rajasthan, at least 50 healthcare workers were tested positive for COVID-19 and a number of hospitals have also been sealed. Doctors and nurses have also tested positive for COVID-19 in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and a number of other states and cities.

To add to their woes, in several places across the country, doctors and healthcare workers have been repeatedly complaining about inadequate masks, gloves and personal protective equipment. In Patna Medical College Hospital and Jawahar Lal Nehru Medical College and Hospital, doctors are using HIV protection kits and surgical masks to protect themselves while treating patients. Doctors say that when healthcare workers are infected it creates a triple whammy threat.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-taking-its-toll--on-frontline-warriors-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/covid-taking-its-toll--on-frontline-warriors.html

214,17-4-20,Coronavirus: 80 containment zones declared in Kashmir,"Restrictions on the movement of people in Kashmir to contain the spread of coronavirus completed one month on Friday, even as the number of red zone areas in the valley has risen to 80, officials said.

They said the security forces have sealed off main roads in most places in the valley and erected barriers at several other places to check the unwanted movement of the people and to enforce the lock down.

220,17-4-20,Chris Hemsworth: Didn't know Marvel films were so popular in India,"Actor Chris Hemsworth found shooting in India ""overwhelming"" because of the positivity and enthusiasm that he experienced while filming the upcoming Netflix film ""Extraction"" in the country.

""I loved shooting in India. The people were incredible. I didn't realise how popular the Marvel films were in India. So that was, at times, overwhelming,"" Hemsworth told IANS during a special video call before the release of his Netflix movie.

""There was such positivity and enthusiasm for all of us and our crew… During shooting, we had hundreds and thousands of people on certain days lining up on the streets and up on top of bridges and in buildings, you know, after every take, cheering and applauding. I've never experienced anything like it. And as I said, I have such fond memories of India and the people there,"" he added while recounting his time in India.

Hemsworth shot for the Netflix film in India in 2018. He shot in Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The ""Thor"" star was scheduled to be in Mumbai on March 16 to promote the film that has been shot in India. The promotional tour was called off due to the global coronavirus outbreak.

Earlier in an interview to IANS, Hemsworth, whose daughter is named India, revealed the reason behind naming his daughter after the country.

""My wife (Elsa Pataky) spent a lot of time in India and that was where the name originally came from,"" Hemsworth said in that interview, adding: ""I love the place and the people. It was sort of intimidating as it was exciting because there were so many people… We felt like rock stars in a stadium. But the warmth and support we got while shooting there, no matter how disruptive we were to their daily lives, it was so good. ""

Originally titled ""Dhaka"", the film also stars Indian actors Randeep Hooda, Pankaj Tripathi, Priyanshu Painyulli, and Rudraksh Jaiswal. It revolves around Tyler Rake (essayed by Hemsworth), a fearless, black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he is enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. The film, directed by Sam Hargrave, will release on Netflix on April 24.

Talking about working for a streaming platform for the first time, Hemsworth said: ""It's my first time working on a streaming platform. I was excited to do it, strangely enough, you know, it's probably the best place to be at this point.

""We put in, you know, the same amount of commitment and passion and enthusiasm as we would with anything else, whether it was a cinema release or a streaming space. I am beyond proud of the film. From the very beginning, I loved the script. I love the story that we were able to tell and the opportunity to shoot action, unlike anything I'd certainly been a part of before.""

221,17-4-20,Mark Ruffalo open for a Hulk stand-alone,"Hollywood superstar Mark Ruffalo found fame world over as Hulk in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but he is yet to feature in a stand-alone FILM and the actor has an idea about taking the story forward.

Ruffalo has played the role in four sequels and spinoffs but is not sure about future installments though there have been talks for the character to appeal in Disney Plus' series She-Hulk .

A stand-alone on the character has not been attempted since 2008's The Incredible Hulk which featured Edward Norton as the green superhero but Ruffalo believes a separate film exploring his life can be made, he told Variety in a profile interview.

There's an idea that I think could be really interesting, he said.

We've never really followed him into his life. He's always kind of off on the side. He's like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the Avengers. It'd be interesting to fill in all the blanks about what happened to him in between all these movies.

Ruffalo is currently busy in the dual roles of a producer and actor on HBO's series adaptation of I Know This Much Is True .

Reflecting on the fluid nature of fame and recognition, Ruffalo said he is always grappling with the idea that one day the studios will stop calling him.

I have a poor-actor's mentality where it's all going to stop one day. They're going to stop calling one day, and no one is going to want me anymore, he said.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mark-ruffalo-open-for-a-hulk-stand-alone-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/mark-ruffalo-open-for-a-hulk-stand-alone.html
222,17-4-20,I feel so much freer today: Kirti Kulhari on life after 'Four More Shots Please!',"Actor Kirti Kulhari says her Amazon series ""Four More Shots Please!"" had a profound effect on her at a personal level.

The actor plays the role of Anjana, a successful lawyer and a single mother, in the show, whose second season dropped on Friday.

Kirti said in the course of two seasons, she has learned a lot from her character.

""I personally love this show, not because I'm a part of it. I'm genuinely very proud of the show for what we are trying to do and for the different things that we are trying to show.

""It really has impacted me personally as well. It's impossible to not learn from something that you're a part of. As an actor, you are growing with the character you're growing,"" Kirti told PTI.

The show, created by Rangita Pritish Nandy, features Kirti, Sayani Gupta, Maanvi Gagroo and VJ-turned-actor Bani J as a quartet of friends and follows their relationships, work-life conflicts, ambitions, and anxieties in a male-dominated society.

The actor said she has started to question everything in her life, from faith to politics, and in the process, she has dropped things that didn't make sense to her.

""I have questioned my own belief systems, my own ideologies, my own conditioning when I started being a part of the show. Whatever came up, I have questioned myself at every stage. Whenever things didn't make sense or I didn't make sense or the conditioning didn't make sense, I have dropped them.

""So, I think I have turned into a person who's much more open to different kinds of people, to the choices they make and to the idea of freedom of choices,"" she said.

Kirti added that she has become ""less of a judgmental person.""

""I don't judge people for what they do in life because I know that behind every decision and every choice, there is a story and I have learned to look at it like that.

""I've also become very comfortable with my own sexuality. I have dropped all the things that I felt were not right or wrong or whatever. I feel so much freer as a person and as an actor. So I have become so easy with my own self and with everyone around me,"" the actor said.

For the second season, it was a challenge for Kirti to found the emotional depth of her character.

""All my energies were going towards how to further develop the character which had such a powerful arc in the first season. How do you make it into a character that is everything? Of course, there is a script that you get. But how do you work on the emotional quotient of the character?

""Whoever the character is, if it doesn't hold you emotionally, it doesn't make sense then. So finding that emotional depth is always a challenge. There is also the challenge to present something that the audiences haven't seen of me.""

The season two of ""Four More Shots Please!"" has been directed by Nupur Asthana, who has taken over from Anu Menon. The show also features Prateik Babbar, Lisa Ray, Milind Soman, Neil Bhooplalam, Simone Singh and Amrita Puri.",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/i-feel-so-much-freer-today--kirti-kulhari-on-life-after--four-more-shots-please---2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/i-feel-so-much-freer-today--kirti-kulhari-on-life-after--four-more-shots-please--.html

The company is yet to reveal how many users will finally be able to join the group call when the new calling feature is rolled out globally.

The changes were spotted in WhatsApp Messenger beta for iOS 2.20.50.23.

While you're in a call, WhatsApp shows a new header, informing that the call is end-to-end encrypted.

""All participants will have to be on the most recent WhatsApp version for iOS and Android to be able to participate in a bigger group call,"" the report mentioned.

Late last month, 70 per cent more people participated in group video calls using Facebook Messenger week-over-week, and the amount time spent on those group video calls has doubled globally.

Similarly, voice and video calls on WhatsApp have more than doubled year-over-year in the places most impacted by the virus.

Apple's FaceTime video calling tool supports 32 people while Facebook Messenger can support up to 50 people in a call.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/whatsapp-to-soon-allow-more-users-in-group-video--audio-calls-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/whatsapp-to-soon-allow-more-users-in-group-video--audio-calls.html
225,17-4-20,Zoom rolls out new measures as security fears mount,"Videoconferencing platform Zoom is rolling out a number of measures meant to stem criticism over how it has handled security as users flock to the application during the coronavirus pandemic.

Zoom chief executive Eric Yuan laid out steps Wednesday that the company is taking against problems such as data hacking and harassment by individuals who crash sessions in what is referred to as ""Zoombombing."" By week's end, paid account holders will be able to select which regions their data is routed through during their sessions in a move apparently aimed at concerns over information passing through China where it might be subject to snooping.

""As a reminder, meeting servers in China have always been geofenced with the goal of ensuring that meeting data of users outside of China stays outside of China,"" Zoom said in an online post.

The Silicon Valley startup also said that it is working with cyber-security firm Luta Security to overhaul processes and its ""bug bounty"" program that pays rewards to researchers who find security flaws in its operations.

Zoom also addressed a recent report that users' log-in information was being sold by criminals on the ""dark web."" The credentials were likely stolen elsewhere on the internet, or by malicious code slipped into people's computers, according to Zoom advisor Alex Stamos, former chief of security at Facebook.

It is not uncommon for hackers to take passwords and account names pilfered in data breaches and then check whether people use them for other online services.

Zoom said it is building systems to ""detect whether people are trying out username and password pairings and block them from trying again."" Improvements to Zoom security also include a toolbar to easily access features such as locking chats from strangers and making meeting password requirements a default setting.

""To successfully scale a video-heavy platform to such a size with no appreciable downtime and in the space of weeks is literally unprecedented in the history of the internet,"" Stamos said in a post.

""The related security challenges are fascinating."" India this week banned the use of Zoom for government remote meetings, saying it ""is not a safe platform."" The New York school system has also banned the videoconferencing platform based on security concerns.

Prosecutors from several US states are meanwhile investigating the company's privacy and security practices, and the FBI has warned of Zoom sessions being hijacked.

According to Yuan, the number of people taking part in Zoom meetings daily eclipsed 200 million in March, up from just 10 million at the end of last year.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/zoom-rolls-out-new-measures-as-security-fears-mount-2020-04-17.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/zoom-rolls-out-new-measures-as-security-fears-mount.html

The health ministry official also said the average growth factor of cases from April 1 has been 1.2, whereas between March 15 and 31 it was 2.1.

He, however, suggested that it will be better if industries sanitise their premises at least twice a day.

When asked about automobile manufacturer Maruti resuming operations, Chautala said the company's plant in Manesar is in a non-containment zone, so it can also resume operations after April 20.
