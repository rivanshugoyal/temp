0,05-3-20,Under the scanner,"Surely, India can redeem itself from the calculated chaos of persecution, pogrom and detention camps by moving towards civic and constitutional morality

Visuals of marauding mobs, grief and absence of law enforcing agencies bring back to many the painful memories of the Partition. There is a constant switching of places between the perpetrator and the victim, as depicted by Urvashi Butalia in her classic The Other Side of Silence. There is no perfect victim and the role of victims as perpetrators and perpetrators as victims keeps the hate narrative going. The real question is, can any amount of revenge achieve ends of justice or give closure? Or, is it that vigilante justice only succeeds in creating another agonising sense of victimhood?

The vigilante mode of “punishing” soft targets or labelling them as “perpetrators” turns them into an “object” of hate, caught in the eye of a storm. These soft targets, allegedly guilty of past perpetration, fall victim to violent retributions. They are also dubbed as “undesirable” and even “illegals.” Being a soft target, they are profiled as belonging to a different and less than equal human group or identity.

The recent attack on a Bengali worker in Thiruvananthapuram on not being able to produce an Aadhaar card, or the alleged detention of Bengali migrant workers in Pune by vigilantes, are classic examples of painting someone as an “illegal” without bothering to verify the truth.

The use of religious flags to differentiate a Hindu house from a Muslim home in times of communal tension is a frightening demarcation of the targetted other. The recent anti-immigrant public discourse across India thrives through this plot of segregation and violence in the name of punishing the perpetrator. The widely-shared viral image of a persecutor and the victim furthers the process of othering and segregation.

In the domain of everyday transactions, asking for proof of identity has become the new normal. Be it under a surveillance camera, face identification or simply through an identity check, an intentional segregation of the “other” as suspect is carried out in the name of finding an “illegal Bangladeshi.” This lays bare the everyday operation of a surveillance society that would act as the forerunner of a “surveillance State”, which is not sanctioned by a constitutional Republic like ours.

Two issues arise here: Does a surveillance society subjectively transform a democratic, constitutional apparatus into a surveillance State? Alternatively, does it just confine itself at the level of the public? Overt determination of identity by proof or by tracking and profiling does not keep the State at the back anymore. Although the State cannot control the visual effect of on-camera scenes of aggression and lynching, to which it can respond only later. In the meantime, violence endows perpetrators with a sense of triumph. While instigators, who triggered the violence appear on the scene only later, with support of their sponsors in power. This makes law enforcers toothless and they become mute spectators of orchestrated violence. A surveillance society helps the henchmen spread a doctored narrative of violence. This is how the victim’s identity is often blurred or altered by terming him/her as violators or guilty. Similarly, one who is identified as the perpetrator could also be swapped from one side to the other. This new art of shifting blame in the form of present or past guilt, creates an image of the “other” who is tasked to prove his identity. In this way, the present practice of legal adjudication in Assam’s Foreigners’ Tribunal places the burden of proof on the “accused.” Until a person proves herself/himself to be an Indian citizen, s/he remains a person of uncertain nationality.

It is a similar situation where migrant labourers, minorities and generally those who are considered as outsiders, is concerned. A surveillance society creates its own outsiders from the figure of a migrant.

The anti-immigrant rhetoric furthers this strange imaging of the migrant who travels to a new place. The migrant is couched in the image of the persecutor or the perpetrator against the native, by citing a narrative such as the Partition. In the safe spaces marked for a particular group or identity, the migrant becomes an illegitimate intruder.

However, this logic of othering can even make the insider a victim. Alleged cases of Bengalis termed as Bangladeshis in Bengal by security forces in public spaces like metro stations and railway platforms point to this nature of harassment of an insider. The ban on fish-eating in various schools in Kolkata run by certain community- based organisations and not allowing fish eaters in some housing complexes in the city point to such racially-discriminatory practices on an insider.

The insider victim or the outsider are all subjected to suspicion and discrimination on the basis of cultural differences that can assume a form of racism even.

The culture of law is such that it goes by what is called “reasonable suspicion.” Entries pertaining to the National Population Register (NPR) ask for the father’s birthplace and NPR rules allow officials concerned to segregate doubtful cases. This is a complex interplay of suspicion and surveillance for the identification of the “illegal”, using NPR data. Such proof seeking and surveillance create conditions of discrimination and exclusion of the cultural and religious other.

Punning on author Timothy Huge Barrett, one may say that the “reason” of suspicion is clouded by the reason of unreason. Suspicion never fails to find a reason, whether it stands the test of truth or not. People declared as foreigners by Assam’s Foreigners’ Tribunals and lodged in detention camps were later found to be genuine Indian citizens. To know why suspicion and its reasons are unreasonable in going after a perceived “illegal”, one can only look at the religion, language or origin of the so-called “illegal.”

In most cases, it would be someone who does not belong to one’s own community. Such a preconceived idea of “we” and “them” never draws a line of distinction between vigilante legalism and constitutionalism. On and off- camera violence on “them” further constructs the identity of the victim in devious ways to cloak reasons of/for vigilantism. Contrastingly, cases of many victims of miscarriage of justice, as it happened in Assam’s NRC exercise, point to limits of processes of legal adjudication of citizenship.

The new norm of surveilling, snooping and othering a stranger changes the welcoming attitude towards the “other.” The drive to find “illegals” among strangers becomes an obsession. This obsession with “illegal immigrants” creates blind spots in our everyday relationships with the other. The “illegal immigrant” is mirrored in many ways, such as doubtful voters and foreigners, who legitimise racist attitudes towards others.

Is India fast moving towards such legal blinds that allow for a legal architecture of discreet probe into citizenship of its own people?

Suspicion leads to illegal checks, physical and mental harassment of the “other” on ethnic, racial, religious and linguistic lines. It can even pass as “reasonable suspicion.” The result is that a non-immigrant, non-border-crosser Indian migrant citizen could be suspected to be an illegal Bangladeshi or a Nepali, or a Chinese, depending on how one looks.

Legal resonance for this vestige of suspicion is found contextually. The Gauhati High Court declared that voter’s ID, PAN, passport, land revenue receipt and so on do not prove citizenship conclusively in a specific case. More generally, Article 326 of the Constitution makes citizenship a precondition for being a voter and hence a voter cannot but be a citizen. Specifically, the recommendations made by Supreme Court in the Lal Babu Hossein versus Electoral Registration Officer case in 1995 make it clear that there must be sufficient material evidence before someone is suspected to be “illegal”, which in most referred cases of suspects is rather shoddily observed. Hence a large number of Indian citizens face the danger of “suspicion” turning them into an “illegal” and a subject of hatred.

Surely, India can redeem itself from such calculated chaos of persecution, pogrom and detention camps by moving towards civic and constitutional morality.

1,05-3-20,Prepare your teachers well,"Technical teachers’ training should be first on the list of priorities of the Govt if we are to produce an employable workforce

The need for effective technical teachers’ training is increasing the world over as no country can afford to ignore the impact of technology. Indeed, the rapid advances made in all technical and industrial fields in recent decades have determined the very contours of contemporary civilisation. These changes call for corresponding progress in technical education if technology is to be fully utilised for the betterment of mankind. Technical teachers’ training should be first on the list of priorities if mechanical education at all levels is to be developed and expanded. These teachers occupy a key position in the modern world as they form the link between the education system and the world of industry, agriculture, business and so on. It is they who are responsible for training an increasing number of skilled workers and technicians needed for economic and scientific progress of a nation. The training of technical teachers thus poses a great challenge to a developing country like ours.

According to the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), India has 6,214 engineering and technology institutions with 2.9 million students in them. A whopping 1.5 million engineers enter the job market every year. Of these, less than one per cent land jobs in the top 100 companies. Sadly, most of the technical graduates are unemployable as they lack in-depth knowledge across domains and client-handling skills. This is a major skill gap as the industry seeks people with 90 per cent technical and professional skills. However, 90 per cent of academic activities in the country still focus on imparting bookish knowledge, resulting in a vast academia-industry gap.

Other surveys reveal that over 80 per cent of the engineers the country produces are not employable and this situation has not improved in the last several years. This is reflected in the fact that only 13 lakh students took admissions to engineering and technology institutions in 2019-20 though India has 27 lakh seats for undergraduate (14 lakh), diploma (11 lakh) and postgraduate (1.8 lakh) students.

What will compound the crisis for entrants in the job market in the country is the fact that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and emerging technologies are making inroads into the workplace and a lot of mundane, repetitive tasks will be taken over by virtual personal assistants and chatbots. This will make more room for individuals to focus on creative and cognitive tasks. Gartner, Inc. predicts that these technologies will reduce/replace almost 69 per cent of the manager’s routine workload by 2024. Teachers are the key providers of technical training. In order to be able to produce students equipped with skills that can meet the requirements of the industry, there is a need to improve and enhance the pedagogical skills of technical teachers. Hence, it is important to foster linkages with the industry and other institutions for promotion of quality and relevant training. It will help increase the number of employable students and improve the quality of employment opportunities that come their way. It is a fact that economic development drives the demand for expertise and a high quality workforce in various fields, leading to a new round of development in technical education.

The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) is the statutory body and a national-level council for technical education, under the Department of Higher Education, MHRD. It is learnt to have developed a specific training module for technical teachers suited to their needs. They will be required to undergo eight modules of training and then a three-week long internship with the industry. It is also learnt that young professionals who aspire to teach in technical institutions, will have to sit for an examination on the lines of the National Eligibility Test (NET) for college and university teachers.

Though these are well thought out initiatives, they will not suffice. The changes in the workplace must be addressed by technical education institutions to ensure the genuine implementation of a regular learning mechanism leading to career development and long-term employment. Institutes must explore the means by which technical education can cooperate with the world of employment to ensure the relevance and employability of our human resources.

Moreover, progressive policies and legislation are needed to develop worthy teachers. There is a need for technical experts to provide professional, academic and research leadership in the field in order to support policy formulation, planning, development and implementation. Plus, there is a need to innovate and build partnerships with the industry at large.Technical teachers’ training calls for a deliberate intervention to bring about learning which would make people more relevant and productive in designated areas of economic and technological activities. It ought to be the Government’s concern as it has social implications. The country’s deepening job crisis has negatively affected the Government’s image. Therefore, it must have a coherent strategic approach to produce individuals equipped with saleable skills.

2,05-3-20,A water crisis of Himalayan proportions,"In spite of being in a water-rich zone due to numerous rivers flowing through them, eight towns in the Himalayan region of India, Nepal and Pakistan are now discovering that their precious resources have dwindled by 70 per cent

After decades of mindless use and wastage of water, we are being punished for taking this precious natural resource and asset for granted as nature has responded finally and definitively.

In spite of being in a water-rich zone due to numerous glacier-fed rivers flowing through them, eight towns in the Himalayan region of India, Nepal and Pakistan are now discovering that their water resources have dwindled by 70 per cent.

This alarming data was published in the latest edition of the journal Water Policy. The researchers studied 13 towns in these countries and zeroed down on eight that are facing an acute water stress.

How deep this crisis is became evident from the rising dependence on freshwater springs in these areas, which ranged from 50 per cent to 100 per cent. What is exacerbating the crisis is the fact that encroachments in the form of small eateries, hotels and guest houses have overrun natural water bodies, resulting in catchment areas disappearing from the topography.

The small villages in the upper Himalayas have been steadily witnessing an exodus of the population and bigger towns such as Devprayag in Uttarakhand have become overcrowded.

This has resulted in the natural resources in these towns being exploited to the hilt and now they have been exhausted beyond their carrying capacity. The Water Policy report specifically names Devprayag as one of the severely impacted towns.

Unplanned urbanisation and runaway tourism are largely to be blamed for the water scarcity and the report further states that left unchecked this condition can further exacerbate and double the gap between demand and supply of water by 2050.

The increased incidence of water shortages should have not gone unnoticed by the respective State administrations in India. But it happened and the long queues at water taps and near water tankers, which used to be the preserve of cities have started becoming a normal thing in the mountains as well now.

Perhaps the first hint of a water scarcity was the vegetation of the hills in the higher reaches becoming dry. Then came the abandonment of step farming on mountain slopes due to water sources such as waterfalls, rivulets and glacier-fed water channels drying up. Water resources in the hills have always been on the receiving end. The construction of numerous hydel projects during the 90s wreaked havoc on the delicate ecology of the Himalayas as river after river and water bodies started to disappear due to water being diverted for electricity generation.

This led to the land mafia usurping these dried up riverbeds for real estate development and the sand and rock mafia plundering them for building material.

The road back to water self-sufficiency for the Himalayan towns and villages is nothing short of daunting. First and foremost, the respective State Government must cut back on the illegal construction and concentrate on water conservation. The water run-offs during monsoon must be conserved and guided to the erstwhile water bodies.

This will not only breathe new life into the ancient water bodies but restore much-needed water independence. Similarly, efforts must be made to ensure that rivers, channels and rivulets that used to feed villages, hamlets and farmlands are restored to their former glory by channelising and allocating required amount of water quantities to them.

We need to give back to nature what we have taken away from it, and that is the ecological balance in these sensitive Himalayan zones.

3,05-3-20,Lessons from an epidemic,"Elections are not currently won by promising less debt and a more resilient society and economy. The Coronavirus crisis is a warning that this will have to change

It is now apparent that the rapid spread of COVID-19 could turn into a serious global disaster, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of elderly lives and millions of jobs and livelihoods. Alternatively, in a few months, we might be sighing with relief that some combination of spring weather and containment measures averted such a calamity. Happy though that second scenario might be, it is vital for us to learn from what is happening.

Three obvious lessons stand out. The first is that in the extraordinarily interdependent world that trade, technology and travel have created, much of what goes on in other countries is our business. Not only can a physical virus spread around the world with unprecedented speed but so can a computer virus, complete misinformation, an economic recession, a nuclear accident or disregard for the environment. A fresh approach to foreign and security policy has to be based on much more than national sovereignty and must include the promotion of global welfare and high standards.

The second lesson is that a crisis is handled less honestly, openly and successfully by corrupt or authoritarian systems. In Iran, rumours abound that officials are being told not to report cases of the virus, while the number of deaths suggests that far more people are infected than has been officially admitted. As on Tuesday, it reported 77 deaths from COVID-19 and 2,336 confirmed cases of infection.

The original suppression of news of the outbreak in China was a grave error, notwithstanding the subsequent use of colossal State power to bring down the infection rates. All this is clear evidence that in the crises yet to come in the 21st century, the free flow of information, the sharing of warnings and the airing of disagreement will be characteristics of the political systems that are best at protecting their citizens.

The third lesson is one I outlined for The Telegraph earlier — that it is time for the abuse, consumption and trafficking of the world’s endangered wildlife to stop. In recent days, China has given some indication that the sickening markets in which all kinds of wild animals are sold, dead and alive, will be banned permanently. That will be very welcome and it is to be hoped that such an example will be followed by other nations such as Vietnam and Laos. The rise of Coronavirus is a clear indication that the degrading of nature will come back to hit humans very hard.

These three lessons are straightforward enough and conveniently fit the way in which most Westerners — with the major exception of US President Donald Trump — see the world: We need outward-looking countries, promoting the global good through strong cooperation, with a huge concern for the environment. They do not require us to revise the way we see the world but rather to promote it more effectively and persuade others that we are right.

Yet, there is an emerging fourth lesson as stock markets tumble and serious economic consequences loom, which is much harder for us in the West to accept — that, since the end of the Cold War, we have conducted much of our daily lives and business affairs without resilience in the forefront of our minds.

From the 1990s onwards, our economic growth has been best promoted by building very complex global supply chains and taking on high levels of debt in households and businesses alike. We must acknowledge that there are many ways in which a country like Britain is more resilient than in the past.

Yet in other crucial ways, Britain and other developed nations have steadily become more fragile when faced with an unexpected global downturn, particularly one in which millions of people might suddenly stop work, factories cease production and entire towns and cities be isolated.

Within days, an interruption of the production of parts in a factory in China can lead to the lay-off of workers. Even giant American corporations such as Boeing and Apple are finding that production of aircraft and iPhones is rapidly affected by a slowdown of activity in China. Many businesses have opted for fewer, larger component suppliers, with the result that the eggs they need come from surprisingly few baskets.

Even more striking, if the world sinks into recession in the coming weeks, will be the consequences of the remorseless build-up of debt by many companies. Central banks have done much since the crash of 2008 to remove weaknesses in the financial system, insisting that banks carry far more capital and that risks are better monitored. But at the same time, they have presided over ultra-low interest rates for far too long, balking at opportunities to raise them for fear of jeopardising growth and the buoyancy of stock markets.

As a result, much of the corporate world is now awash with debt. American companies owe around $10 trillion — at around 50 per cent of the US’ gross domestic product (GDP), an all-time record. That means that if there is a sudden loss of turnover, they will go bust at a very fast pace, with interest rates already so low that there is minimal scope for reductions that will help them.

Admittedly, this is not just a Western problem — Chinese companies are arguably even more indebted and, even before the Coronavirus crisis began, they were starting to default at a record rate. But the building up of historically unprecedented levels of debt, along with ever more fragile supply chains, have been results of our constant search for growth and low prices at the same time over the last 30 years.

Adjusting to a world in which we give resilience greater weight will be a huge and difficult effort for everyone who enjoys mass consumption and easy money. Elections are not currently won by promising less debt and a more resilient society and economy. The Coronavirus crisis is a major warning signal that this will have to change.

4,05-3-20,Kamal versus Kamal,"BJP burns fingers with Operation Lotus again, poaching Congress MLAs to topple the MP Govt but failing again

It looks like the BJP, despite its serial losses in State elections, has not given up on Operation Lotus or toppling State Governments surviving on a wafer-thin majority by buying out unhappy legislators. So much like its sustained efforts in Karnataka and Goa, its leaders are not giving up on Madhya Pradesh, a heartland State where it is still within smelling distance of power (with 107 against the Congress’ 114) and where there is some resonance of its core philosophies in the currently surcharged context created by its identity politics. Besides, it cannot forget the humiliation of losing a 15-year-old stronghold and is hell-bent on toppling the Kamal Nath Government. Even if the Chief Minister, known to be a leader who has worked the ground and knows how to manage flocks, has ultimately held his own, the BJP won’t stop at irritating a jumpy Congress, whose leaders certainly do not want to cede the slightest territory to the BJP. Consider the Congress predicament, it has precious little showpieces left anyway with veterans like Kamal Nath, Amarinder Singh and Ashok Gehlot wresting bastions and keeping federalism alive. So it better go all-out like Nath did. At the centre of the current crisis are eight MLAs, who the Congress claims, were poached by the BJP, flown in a chartered aircraft and hosted at a plush hotel in Gurugram, though it was able to rescue four of them in a midnight drama. The rest were shifted to Bengaluru but by evening were back within the party fold. Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh claimed that former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Narottam Mishra have been offering these legislators Rs 35 crore. Meanwhile, the BJP has denied its hand in the developments although the chartered aircraft belonged to a senior party leader. It instead accused the Congress of orchestrating a drama before the Rajya Sabha polls scheduled for March 26. That’s set to be a tussle with BJP going all out to retain its two seats and the Congress wanting to take its tally to two from one, as it has more legislators this time around. The latter has also issued a whip for the Rajya Sabha polls to show it means business.

The Congress has been vulnerable ever since it came to power in the State with support from a few Independents, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). The internal bickering and faction fights within the State unit were all that the BJP needed to fish in troubled waters. Although the 2018 mandate itself was a fractured one, with the results favouring neither the Congress nor the BJP, the latter has renewed its destabilisation attempts perhaps emboldened by its Lok Sabha performance. Kamal Nath is being cornered from all sides, both within his party and without, and the veteran strategist has to fight a battle on all fronts. First, the Union Home Ministry decided to re-open seven cases pertaining to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, hoping to implicate him. Even if the riots case doesn’t hold water, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has him in a bind as it arrested his nephew in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud case involving Rs 354.51 crore. To make matters worse, internal dissension between the old and new guard has put him in a precarious position. With Nath holding the dual charge as the Chief Minister and Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president, the ambitious young men, helmed by Jyotiraditya Scindia are staking their claim at leadership, considering they, too, had authored the party’s win in the Assembly elections. Such has been the distrust within the State unit that Kamal Nath himself ignored the writing on the wall simply because the warning of BJP bribing Congress legislators was sounded by Digvijaya Singh. In fact, the CM was brash enough, asking the legislators to take the money if it was being offered free. Sonia Gandhi may have returned as party chief but in keeping the loyalist yet warring old warriors like Digvijaya Singh and Nath happy, she is risking a rebellion and worse, possibly defection, by the Scindia camp. If some dissenters do play up Nath’s arrogance, she will have little option but to distance herself and delink him from the Congress dole of privileges. In fact, Nath’s swearing-in ceremony as Chief Minister was held amid protests by Sikh groups demanding his resignation. But to Nath’s credit, he has been reining in his numbers despite the BJP’s persistent poaching attempts since last December. A weathered warhorse, he may defend himself from enemies without. But within his party, he has to adjust to the reality that the protectorate of a behemoth called the Congress is missing. And his own men are out to undercut him.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kamal-versus-kamal-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/kamal-versus-kamal.html
5,05-3-20,Bit allowed,"The Supreme Court has struck down the RBI’s ban on cryptocurrency trading. But this won't be the end of the story

The ban imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on cryptocurrency trading several months ago led to the culmination of several decisions, which were not surprising as such. Yet, what wasn’t equally unexpected was the determination shown by those people, who had set up businesses around such currencies, to challenge the Central bank’s ban in the court. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled that the RBI’s ban on cryptocurrency trade was arbitrary, some believe that good times will return. But this is highly unlikely for several reasons. Let’s start with the controversy surrounding cryptocurrency, including that of Bitcoin. Along with facilitating everything — from global terrorism, drug trafficking to prostitution — the intensive “mining” process for such currencies, which uses huge amounts of computing power and, thus, energy, has come under attack from all sorts of regulators and activists. Then, there is the inherent value of such currencies, the most popular of which was Bitcoin, which boomed a couple of years ago. Its value quadrupled in a couple of weeks and inspired several other types of cryptocurrency operations with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) luring investors with the promise of high returns. But then the bubble burst and values crashed. The fad died out with the discovery that many startup currencies were nothing but frauds.

Frankly, the RBI was aware of the risks involved but behaved like so many other regulators in the country, choosing the easy way out by banning the service. Instead, the Central bank should have regulated this industry as it does with many others. The early days of cryptocurrency trading were a bit like the Wild West in India. Many investors were moving their assets to the digital world with hopes that they could hide them from the Government and, thus, the taxman. Good and proper regulation will not promote this. As it will now look for some sensible ideas, the RBI’s aim should be just this. Cryptocurrency traders and companies, too, can help the industry become legitimate by staying under the radar and not encouraging any kind of fraudulent activity, such as tax avoidance or scams. Any wrong move, and the heavy hand of the Government may come down again, either in the form of the RBI or the Finance Ministry.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bit-allowed-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/bit-allowed.html
6,05-3-20,Aviation industry catches the flu,"It is almost a year since Jet Airways shut down operations, and while some of that airline’s Boeing 737 are still flying about with Jet’s unmistakable dark blue tails for SpiceJet and Vistara, the aviation industry in India lurches towards another crisis. It should not be like this, Vistara just took delivery of their very first Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was going to start long-haul operations by April. But not just India, the global aviation industry has suddenly found itself in a crisis, and this one has nothing to do with dodgy software on aircraft and questionable financial practices. This is all to do with the Chinese Flu that has the world in a panic. This viral outbreak is the first truly global viral outbreak made possible in no small part thanks to the aviation and tourism industries and unsurprisingly both sectors are staring down the abyss.

Just look at China, according to statistics from flight tracking service Flightradar24, civilian air traffic in China is down 80 percent. Passenger traffic is down even more, as many of the flights operating are cargo flights ferrying essential supplies to and from effected cities.

China was for the past decade the fastest growing aviation market in the world, and now huge airport terminals including Beijing’s brand new one sit almost deserted. Chinese skies notorious for their heavy congestion and delays are viryaully empty and that is evident to regular observers of flight tracking services. And international services to and from China have virtually ended with several nations including India putting restrictions on visitors from mainland China. But the demand collapse isn’t just on sectors to and from China, as the Covid 2019 contagion grows to impact South Korea and Japan as well, travel to and from those nations has also been impacted. With thousands of cases also detected in Italy and several hundred across Europe, conferences and events big and small are being cancelled. The cancellation of the Geneva Motor Show being by far and away the most significant one so far. All this is leading to thousands of cancelled tickets and hotel reservations and hundreds of grounded planes.

Aircraft are quite different from cars in the sense that they get used extremely heavily, most planes fly a minimum of eight-ten hours a day at the minimum and some low-cost carriers use their planes for twelve hours daily at the very least. As it is all Indian carriers have cancelled all services to China and Hong Kong. Flights to Seoul and Tokyo might be next on the chopping block.

Additionally, as demand for Bangkok and Singapore has fallen, services have dropped by half by airlines. With non-essential travel advisories across the corporate sector and aviation ironically becoming an airborne vector of sorts, demand is collapsing even in India. Speak to airline and security staff at airports over the past two days and they’ve noticed demand drop off by a significant number although until the industry releases their statistics for March we will not know the true decline in both international and domestic passenger numbers. And Indian carriers don’t have it half as bad as any of the Chinese airlines, several of whom will probably emerge from the viral crisis still on long-term life support. Even airlines like Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong and Singapore Airlines have grounded a third of their fleets, thanks to their dependence on traffic to and from China. And as demand to Europe and even the Indian subcontinent starts showing signs of a precipitous fall, even airlines like Dubai’s Emirates, the world’s largest A380 operator have sliced back services. Once the true toll of the viral impact in the United States is clear, the world’s largest aviation market by a long distance, things could go really pear shaped for the industry. Of course, it may not be as bad as it is for tourism dependant European airlines and this viral attack could kill off many airlines and without a steady supply of Chinese, Indian and even American tourists to bolster national and local budgets, countries like France and Italy could face major budgetary issues.

And the government is planning to sell Air India in the midst of all this. To be fair, when they took the decision, they had little idea of what was coming but maybe, just maybe it might be a good idea to keep things on hold and let the market recover. And the market may not recover for some time to come. While free markets should reign and thus it is important that Air India should be privatised, the situation is b coming critical and the government might need to intervene for the entire industry.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aviation-industry-catches-the-flu-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/aviation-industry-catches-the-flu.html
7,05-3-20,Staying safe is the first way to prevent Corona,"Staying safe is the first way to prevent Corona virus. Corona virus is an infectious virus. It spreads from one person to another. This virus spreads when exposed to a person infected with Corona virus.

To avoid this, one must keep distance from the infected person and see a doctor immediately when cold, cough and fever occurs. Principal Secretary Health Pallavi Jain said this in a media workshop held at Hotel Palash on Wednesday.

The Principal Secretary informed that the Madhya Pradesh government is in constant contact with the Central government. There are no patients infected with Corona virus in the state. So far 14 samples were sent to Pune lab for examination, out of which 13 sample reports have come negative. A report is yet to come.

11,05-3-20,Hot chilies turn out sweet for thousands of chilli growers,"The hot chilies have turned out sweet for thousands of chilli growers including Santosh Anokchandra of Jamkheda village of Kasrawad, Khargone district with bumper crop arrival this time. Bediya, the second largest Chilli Yard in Asia near Sanawad in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh has received arrival of 2.71 lakh quintals worth Rs 202 crores.

The Nimar Chilli has already carved its distinct identity owing to its colour and pungency within the country and abroad. The Nirmar Chilli has already crossed geographical boundaries and are being exported to many Asian countries especially China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Thailand and UAE. Khargone, Dhar, Khandwa, Barwani, Alirajpur districts report good yield of chilies. The Chilli growers are excited about the branding of Nimari Chilli by way of securing Geographical Identity and hope that the GI Tag will have a positive impact on chilli market.

Santosh Anokchandra has grown yellow chilli this time, which fetches rates higher than that of red chilli. He informs that 95 percent farmers of Jamkheda village cultivate chilli crop. If not entire field, at least fifty percent is covered by chilli crop. A good crop means Rs 4 to 5 lakh per acre. Teja and Mahi are more popular varieties, he says. Yellow chili fetches higher price. It goes up to Rs 210 per kg, which comes down to 169 per kg. Despite this, it is gainful. He says that this time five to six acres have been covered. The weather was extremely merciful this time. Resultantly, the yield is good. Increase in temperature makes crop vulnerable to pest attack. Then the cost on using insecticides and maintenance increases. Chilli plucking is a costly affair.

Skilled farm workers, who do this specialised job take five to six rupees per kilogram. Appreciating the idea of getting brand name for Nirmar chilli, Santosh says that it is in the interest of farmers.

Kamalchand Ramlal of Bhikangaon says that about 80 farmers have grown Chilies. This means average ten acres each farmer. This time, good rates are expected. That means Rs four lakhs per acre, he adds. Mostly, Mahi variety has been grown but some have taken Venus variety. Both are good. There is a good harvest this year. He says that the air, water and soil of Nimar region are favourable for chilli cultivation. However, the chilies are pungent and hot but for us they are like sweets with good crop, he observes.

Aayush Biyani of Mumbai who has been associated with the export of chilli and other horticultural crops, says that obtaining GI certificate for Nirmari Mirchi is an important step for business. He foresees a positive impact on the trade in horticulture crop saying that the farmers will also get handsome prices. But he also makes a point that a comprehensive study of trading in other horticultural crops should also be done to know the trade impact after after getting geographical identification. The Darjeeling Tea and Nagpuri Orange are the examples, he says.

Khargone Chilli Yard Secretary Ramveer Kirar elaborates the merits of Nimar chilli informing that the quality is measured by colour, length, smell and pungency. Nimar chillies are far good in colour and pungency. He says that the chilli producing farmers have shown interest in modern methods of cultivation. All farmers cultivate chillies in the respective fields on at least 50 percent area.

The small farmers take full acreage of their fields. This has proved a boon for them. The market rate is currently running at Rs 120 - 130 per kg which is the best in last three years, he adds.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hot-chilies-turn-out-sweet-for-thousands-of-chilli-growers.html

15,05-3-20,CM’s concern over anti-India slogans raised in universities,"Expressing concern over anti-India slogans raised in universities, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that people should ask who these people were who raised anti-India slogans in universities and why such distortions were happening.

“Anti-India slogans are raised in higher educational institutions and we should be prepared to evaluate why this type of distortion occur among students. We begin our work taking pledge for the country’s unity and integrity and today slogans are raised for the division of the nation,” Yogi Adityanath said after inaugurating a two-day national seminar on ‘Mission Prerna’ and CSR Conclave organised by Basic Shiksha Parishad at Ram Manohar Lohia Law University here on Wednesday.

The chief minister flagged off a LED van for propagating information related to ‘Operation Kayakalp’. He also laid the foundation stone of buildings worth Rs 788 crore for upgradation of 350 Kasturba Gandhi Girls’ Schools.

Now, girls will be able to study in these schools up to Class 12. Earlier these schools were only up to Class 8.

“Governments can provide resources, but those who impart basic and secondary education and who lead them to that place should evaluate their actions today,” Yogi said.

Stressing on equality in education, the chief minister said that social inequality could be removed through uniform education through which children would get quality education under same environment to achieve new heights.

“To achieve this, the Bharatiya Janata Party government has implemented the NCERT curriculum in the state that will change the education system. If there is no discrimination in education and children of the state get equal opportunities, they will achieve new heights of success,” he said.

Yogi said that through the seminar, the work done by the state government for improvement in basic education in the last three years was being presented.

“When our government came to power, there was an atmosphere of chaos and anarchy in the state and the condition of basic education was the worst. The most damaging was that of proxy teachers and our government started to identify and flush them out in the first phase. Teachers should not just be confined to school but should connect with students, only then they will be able to do justice to them,” he said.

Yogi said that a teacher was not a government servant but one who shaped the fate of the nation.

“Considering Acharya Chanakya as ideal, teachers should learn from him. If Chanakya had confined himself to Nalanda University, he would not have been able to set up India as a superpower during that era. Teachers will have to prepare themselves according to challenges and need of society,” he added.

Yogi said that ‘Operation Kayakalp’ was launched for infrastructural development of more than 1,58,000 schools associated with Basic Shiksha Parishad. Under this, over 92,000 schools had been equipped with basic facilities, he added.

18,05-3-20,Bar owners warned against organising drinking competition,"UP Excise department cautioned licensed bar owners against organising drinking competition in their respective bars for promoting sale of alcohol.

Earlier on January 20, a government order was also issued holding drinking competition organised by licensed bar owners, hotels and restaurants as illegal.

Principal Secretary (Excise) and Excise Commissioner Sanjay Bhoosreddy convened a meeting of licensed bar owners and liquor vendors and warned that bar owners would be liable for tough action if they organised drinking competitions.

The official said that licences would be cancelled immediately on receipt of such complaints and directions had been issued to district magistrates and divisional commissioners to take action against bar owners if they indulged in such illegal activity.

During the meeting, bar licensees expressed happiness over the facilities extended to them in the new Excise Policy. The meeting discussed in detail the new policy and problems of various establishments and bar licensees.

The bar licensees also put forth their problems before the excise commissioner, including non-availability of NOC (no objection certificate) from Fire department for old buildings, size of liquor peg not being as per rules of Weight and Measures department, absence of a process determining liquor stock, non-availability of certain documents required for online renewal, problem of transferring approved seller etc.

The excise commissioner heard their grievances and gave an assurance to address the problems promptly.

To increase revenue from Excise department, the UP government had issued fresh bar licences in 14 districts in December last year.

Besides higher revenue, the idea behind the policy is to ensure availability of quality India made foreign liquor to customers and tourists visiting the state.

The Excise department issued eight licences in Lucknow, seven in Agra, six in Gorakhpur and one each in Mirzapur, Moradabad, Jhansi, Ghaziabad, Bareilly, Bahraich and some other districts.

19,05-3-20,SP posturing itself as most suitable option for Muslim,"



|

Fancying itself as the party in waiting to form a government after 2022 assembly elections, the Samajwadi Party is treading cautiously to posture itself as the most suitable option for Muslim voters.

SP fondly hopes that as the 2022 polls approach, the political situation in UP would mirror Delhi, where the Congress sacrificed its electoral interests to prevent the Bharatiya Janata Party from coming to power.

However, recent aggressive forays by Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra into the state seem to have thrown a spanner in SP’s ‘political dreams’.

The SP national executive will be meeting in Lucknow on March 14 and the top agenda would be the 2022 assembly elections. The quick turn of events in Delhi would also weigh heavily in the overall political strategy of the SP brass.

Sources in SP said that even after over three months of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in UP, Delhi and elsewhere, the actual public response, particularly of Muslims, was yet to unfold as the National Population Register (NPR) would commence from April 1.

SP president Akhilesh Yadav has already taken an extreme stand that none from his party would register himself/herself in NPR, which is scheduled to conclude on September 30.

Amid the surcharged communal environment, the holy month of Ramzan is also commencing from April 25.

Saner voices in the SP, however, cautioned the party chief against formulating the 2022 poll strategy on a ‘cake walk’ as its core.

“The SP has not condemned anti-CAA violence across two dozen districts on December 20. The party offered Rs 5 lakh compensation to the families of those who died in violence. We should be very careful to ensure that the perception about the party as pro-Muslim is not projected,” said a Muslim SP leader.

The leader added, “Whatever SP leaders might say in public, the ground reality is that it’s one of the most significant achievement of |Narendra Modi and Amit Shah that no major party is willing to take even slightest risk of appearing to be pro-Muslim today.”

A political analyst commented, “The Delhi polls clearly imply that Hindu majoritarian has won the political battle decisively. Elections will be won or lost, but both the winners and losers will support Hindu majoritarianism.”

Elaborating further, he said, “Arvind Kejriwal supported abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A, maintained a studied silence on the CAA and stayed away from Shaheen Bagh protests and also recited Hanuman Chalisa. It will be better for the SP to not only memorise Hanuman Chalisa but go a step further and start reciting Sundar Kand of Ramayana.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sp-posturing-itself-as-most-suitable-option-for-muslim.html

“Even though I had approached the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh and demanded action against all those who had harassed and intimidated me, including firing at my residence, nothing has been done in the matter,” she said while exposing Kiki Dhillon’s claims that he did not know Manjinder Singh Bitta, who had fired at her residence twice, by showing their pictures together.

“If anything happened to me, Kangar and Dhillon should be held responsible for the same,” she said.

WHY GOVT NOT RECOVERING Rs 632 CR BALANCE FROM MINING CONTRACTORS

AAP MLA and the Leader of Opposition (LoP) Harpal Singh Cheema alleged that the State Government, which always cries foul over poor fiscal situation, had not been recovering Rs 632 crore from the contractors for excavation activity in Sawada, Beihara and Harsha Bela areas in Ropar district for the last two

years.

Cheema, speaking during the zero hour, said: “On one hand, the government is claiming it is going through an acute fiscal crunch, and on the other, it has given a leeway to all kinds of mafia to indulge in an open ‘loot’ of its revenue generating sources.”

He pointed that these mines were closed following National Green Tribunal (NGT) order, and no effort was made by the Government to check this “loot”. A personal activist has now filed a plea in the Apex Court seeking recovery.

SAD DEMANDS PASSING RESOLUTION CONDEMNING MP CM

SAD’s Majitha MLA Bikram Singh Majithia demanded to pass a resolution condemning the Madhya Pradesh government for causing acute mental agony and humiliation to an 18-year-old Sikh boy by forcing him to take off his turban during the Class XII board examinations.

“It is condemnable that the same man who is an accused in the 1984 massacre, and is responsible for rendering hundreds of Sikh farmers homeless in MP, is behind such reprehensible measures,” said Majithia while demanding from all MLAs that “all should condemn this”.

“Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister (Kamal Nath) should resign,” he demanded.

NEW MAFIA OF INTERLOCKING TILES ON RISE

Raising another issue, Dirba MLA Cheema alleged that a “new mafia” is rising in the State, which is ‘interlock tile mafia’ which is ‘plundering’ the state exchequer. “An interlock tile, on an average, costs barely Rs five while Rs 13 are being paid by the government, in connivance with political masters, including MLAs and ministers and bureaucrats which an open loot of the state exchequer,” he said.

SUSPEND COPS WHO TORTURED, KILLED SHUKLA: SAD

SAD legislative party leader and Sahnewal MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon demanded immediate suspension and strict disciplinary action against Ludhiana police officials for allegedly torturing a young man which led to his death 10 days back. Raising the issue of torture of Deepak Shukla of Deshmesh Kalan in Sahnewal constituency during zero hour, Dhillon said that Deepak was tortured on flimsy grounds of being a thief even though he had proved his innocence in front of the public. “Family is seeking action and is not ready to cremate the body.

They are sitting on dharna and accusing the police officers of beating him dead. The Government’s refusal to take action against the guilty officials had caused huge distress and family members have gone into depression. We need to resolve this issue at the earliest, otherwise it will blow into a big issue,” said Dhillon while demanding immediate action in the matter.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad--bjp-stage-walkout.html
23,05-3-20,Rowdy scenes in Vidhan Sabha,"Punjab Vidhan Sabha on Wednesday virtually turned into a free-for-all arena, with agitated legislatures stopping just short of exchanging blows. Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who was usually seen calm and composed, lose his cool when SAD MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu made some “derogatory and abusive” comments against him.

Rowdy scenes were witnessed on the last day of the budget session when several Congress MLAs come in Manpreet’s support with some of them, including Kulbir Singh Zira, Barindermeet Singh Pahara, Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, almost attacking Tinu in the well of the House — forcing the Speaker Rana KP Singh to adjourn the proceedings for 15 minutes.

Even after the adjournment, the angry Congress legislators, Zira and Pahara, were seen pushing and manhandling Tinu. On the verge of exchanging blows, other SAD MLAs present in the House — Dr Sukhwinder Kumar, Harpal Singh Chandumajra, Baldev Singh Khaira, and BJP MLA Arun Narang — have to intervene to virtually save Tinu.

Later, the House passed a privilege motion with Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) support against Tinu for “crossing the floor”, “personal attack” on the Finance Minister, using “derogatory” language — referring the matter to the Vidhan Sabha’s privilege committee.

Going into the background, Tinu was seen making aggressive gestures against the Speaker seeking time for his fellow MLA Bikram Majithia to raise an issue in the Zero Hour, while the AAP MLAs were staging a protest in the well of the House.

When the Speaker snubbed him by saying that he should not lose his temper so often and he did not need to seek his directions to run the House, Tinu engaged in a verbal spat with the Speaker. He wanted to raise an issue related to SC scholarships, but the Speaker refused him and asked the AAP MLA Jai Kishan to move the calling attention notice.

Peeved, Tinu alone went to the well of the House carrying a handwritten placard, and shouting slogans against the Speaker and the government.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra described Tinu’s behaviour and “words against the Chair” “unacceptable” and “condemnable” urging the Speaker to take appropriate action, which the Speaker turned down saying, “let him do”.

AAP MLAs staged the walkout, and SAD’s senior legislators, including Majithia, Sharanjit Singh Dhillon, Lakhbir Singh Lodhianangal, and others, were also not present in the House at that time. While protesting all along in the well, Tinu reached near the bench of Manpreet Badal after crossing the floor and allegedly passed some some comments, prompting the Finance Minister lose his composure and reacted angrily.

As Manpreet was seen making angry gestures against Tinu, other Congress MLAs come in his support, approaching Tinu, leaving their benches. Pandemonium prevailed with the furious Congress MLAs engaged in a war of words with Tinu — forcing an adjournment. Three SAD MLAs present in the House intervened, while Pargat Singh pacified Zira and took him away.

As Tinu continued to shout slogans and show placards, Zira asked him to better leave the House.

As the House resumed, Cabinet Minister Charanjit Singh Channi described Tinu’s conduct “shameful” despite the Speaker giving sufficient time to the opposition to raise their issues during the Budget session. “Finance Minister had never said anything objectionable to anyone…Going to his table and saying such things which I cannot even repeat is condemnable,” he said.

As Chandumajra, the lone MLA present in the House, tried to defend Tinu, the Speaker pointed that any member has no right to go to any member’s table and say such things.

“The member indulged in gross violation. First, he was arguing with the Chair when he was not on his seat which is an insult to the House. Then he pointed finger towards the Chair, he then crossed the floor and made a personal attack using derogatory language against the Finance Minister,” said Mohindra.

“I have never seen the Finance Minister getting provoked this way. You can well understand that what would have been said which forced the FM to stand up from his seat and react,” said Mohindra, who moved the privilege motion.

Later, SAD legislative wing leader Sharanjit Singh Dhillon claimed that Tinu was manhandled and abused, while urging the Speaker to resolve the matter by holding a meeting in his chamber.

“Four days ago, he used such bad words against the Chair which even I cannot tell…I did not tell anyone, neither I reacted,” said the Speaker while asking the Tinu, “You have to respect others to be respected”.

Tinu, later talking with the media, alleged that the Finance Minister used a cuss word against him. “I was just asking the Finance Minister why funds meant for the SC community, particularly the scholarship, are not being disbursed,” he said.

He said that the Cabinet Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and MLA Kulbir Zira threatened him, while demanding privilege motion against Randhawa and Finance Minister Manpreet Badal.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/rowdy-scenes-in-vidhan-sabha.html
24,05-3-20,"Govt to add sugar, tea leaves, ghee","The popular Atta-Dal scheme is all set to turn sweeter and hotter with the Punjab Government adding the flavours of sugar and tea leaves to it from the “next season”. In addition, the Government will also provide ghee along with the wheat and pulses, which are already being provided on the subsidized rate.

Announcing this while responding to a question raised by SAD’s Dera Bassi MLA NK Sharma, the state Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs Minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu on Wednesday said that the State Government would begin distribution of sugar, tea leaves and ghee from next season.

“Punjab Government is duty-bound to fulfill all promises made by the Congress party in its poll manifesto in 2017. Government, in its Budget 2020-21, has made a financial provision in this regard,” said Ashu.

Sharma asked Ashu if the cards of any Atta-Dal beneficiaries made before 2016 have been cancelled and whether those already having cards have to apply again for the new cards under the revamped scheme.

Replying, Ashu said that the government carried out the verification process two-three times, and in case, the cards of any eligible person are cancelled, he or she may fill the form and get themselves enrolled under the scheme.

“During the tenure of SAD-BJP Government, many fake beneficiaries were added as bonafide for availing Atta-Dal scheme…This has led to the Congress Government to conduct a survey to identify bogus cardholders. Anyone genuine cardholder whose name is cut off from the list can apply again for addition of his name in the list,” Ashu clarified.

PROPOSAL TO ENHANCE MDM WORKERS HONORARIUM WITH FINANCE DEPT

Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla, responding to the query of Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) Sunam MLA Aman Arora, informed the House that a proposal to enhance the honorarium of cooks-cum-helpers under the Mid Day Meal (MDM) scheme in schools to Rs 3,000 has already been sent to the Finance Department.

“As per the figures, on an average, one cook is working for 38 children and getting just Rs 1700…Isn’t it a violation of human rights,” said Arora.

Singla pointed out that we are concerned about this section and that was why, the Government had increased their honorarium from Rs 1200 to Rs 1700. The proposal to enhance it further is with the Finance Department. We will increase it as and when it is approved by the Finance Department,” he said.

INCREASING PENSION UNDER GOVT’S ACTIVE CONSIDERATION

Social Security and Women and Child Development Minister Aruna Chaudhary informed the House that increasing the old age, widow, handicapped, and dependents pension from Rs 750 to Rs 1500 is under state government’s consideration.

“The government’s intention is clear. We increased it from Rs 500 to Rs 750 in the first year of coming to power. We promised to increase it to Rs 1500. We still have two years and will raise it,” Chaudhary told SAD’s Adampur MLA Pawan Kumar Tinu, who had raised the question.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-to-add-sugar--tea-leaves--ghee.html

27,05-3-20,Property tax paid on 50% buildings,"Property tax has been paid in the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) for more than 50 per cent of the buildings in Dehradun. To further enhance the tax collection, the corporation is also using satellite imagery in the process of tax collection.

About 60, 000 building owners have submitted the property tax in MCD so far. A few weeks back, the percentage of property taxpayers was quite low but according to the official sources, it reached up to 51.51 per cent by the end of February. To persuade the people towards submitting their taxes, MCD has extended the period of 20 per cent rebate on property tax multiple times this year which is probably the reason for the consistent increase in the number of property taxpayers.

The corporation has set the target of collecting the property tax of Rs 75 crore by the end of this month. Though the common people of Dehradun are paying the property tax regularly in the corporation, a number of Government departments and authorities have not paid the property tax on their office buildings to MCD which is posing hindrance in achieving the set target. The non-residential tax of several major bodies of the city like Forest Research Institute (FRI), State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA), Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) and Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital is reportedly pending which is collectively more than Rs four crore.

Meanwhile, MCD has also started using satellite imagery in the process of collecting property tax to hit their target by March 31. The company Earth Sciences Data Solutions analyses the area of those properties which are not registered in the corporation by the owners of residential and non- residential properties and send it to the MCD.

Subsequently, the municipal corporation calculates the amount of the property tax according to the area and send the bill to the owner.

Moreover the collection of property tax on Wednesday was around Rs 12 lakh and up till now MCD has collected more than Rs 41 crore.

Furthermore, the period of the rebate on property tax which was extended the fifth time by Dehradun mayor is slated to end on March 5.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/property-tax-paid-on-50--buildings.html

30,05-3-20,Centre's EAC to review underground parking project in Capitol Complex,"At a time when the Punjab and Haryana High Court order on demolition of all unauthorized structures in Sukhna catchment area is keeping the States Governments of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh Administration on tenterhooks, the State Level Expert Appraisal Committee is all set to review the contentious project of three-level basement parking for HC in Capitol Complex, Sector 1 here.

The 11-member Appraisal Committee constituted by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF), in January this year will review the project and would decide whether the project could be initiated. The UT Engineering Department has sent a proposal to the UT Environment Department seeking permission for the construction of proposed multilevel basement parking in the vicinity of HC. It is only after the preliminary approval of Appraisal Committee that the Administration can begin the environment assessment and other works related to the project. Following this, the final project report has to be approved by three-member State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Chandigarh constituted by the MoEF.

The Chandigarh Heritage Conservation Committee (CHCC) had in November last year gave approval to the expansion plan of the Punjab and Haryana High Court which included construction of three- level basement parking opposite the existing multi-level parking in the premises in Sector 1 here.

As per the proposal drafted by UT Engineering Department, the multi-level parking shall have three levels of basement to accommodate around 5000 vehicles. The tentative size of the huge proposed basement parking is 434 ft x 810 ft. The approximate covered area of one floor is 3,72,400 sft and for three floors is 11,17,220 sft.

Notably, the proposed underground parking project falls within the eco-sensitive zone area around the Sukhna Wildlife Sanctuary that was notified in 2017. Also, the parking site falls in the buffer zone of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Capitol Complex and many experts have warned that the new construction in the Complex may put its heritage status in jeopardy. The Administration had recently decided to get conducted an environmental impact assessment study of the proposed parking project which will include aspects namely ambient air quality, vehicular traffic density, flora and fauna, water quality, socio-economic survey among other factors. “The proposed underground parking project will be reviewed by the 11-member State Level Expert Appraisal Committee, Chandigarh constituted by the Central Government. Accordingly, the appraisal committee will give its recommendations about the project,” said a senior officer of UT Administration while talking to The Pioneer.

The officer said that since the project falls in eco-sensitive zone, an environment assessment study has to be conducted for it. A detailed project report will be then submitted to the State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Chandigarh for final approval, he added. Apart from seeking mandatory approvals from the Expert Appraisal Committee and Environment Impact Assessment Authority, the Administration would also have to apprize and take consent from UNESCO to undertake the construction work for parking, as the proposed site falls in buffer zone of UNESCO World Heritage Site of Capitol Complex.

Composition of Authority and Committee

The three-member State Level Environment Impact Assessment Authority, Chandigarh constituted by the Central Government consists of Srishti Pal Vasudeva, retired IFS officer as chairman, Jatinder Singh Kamyotra, ex-Director Central Pollution Control Board as member and Debendra Dalai, Director, UT Department of Environment as Member Secretary.

As the session began in the morning the BJP legislators started shouting slogans and came in the well of the House demanding the Speaker to provide the status of LoP to Babulal Marandi. The Speaker tried pacifying the members and said that the decision will be taken shortly after a legal process but the MLAs did not relent. Finally, the Speaker had to adjourn the House for 40 minutes.

Again at 12 noon when the House reassembled the BJP legislators continued shouting slogans and sat on the floor of the House. After several failed attempts the Speaker again adjourned the House till 2 PM.

In the second half both the ruling parties and the Opposition kept their talk about the budget. However, after Amar Bauri spoke in the House, opposition MLAS again came to the well and started shouting slogans regarding the recognition of Babulal Marandi as Leader of Opposition. The BJP MLAs soon walked out of the House.

Earlier, Bauri said that there has been a huge increase in crime since the formation of the government. “As soon as the government was formed, massacre was carried out in Gulikera. Riot occurred in Lohardaga. A kilometer away from the Chief Minister's Office, a man was shot in broad daylight. In Palamu and Latehar again the operation of buses has reduced at night, there is an atmosphere of fear again among the people. The law and order situation has deteriorated,” he said.

“Even if you do not give recognition to Babulal Marandi as Leader of the Opposition, but by recognising him as the leader of the BJP the deadlock can be ended. While in opposition to JPSC, JMM and Congress disrupted the House several times. The government is not doing anything on the youth and issues on which the government is formed. We are following what JMM taught us for four years by staying in Opposition. But, we are performing for a cause. If our demand is met then the deadlock will end,” he said.

Former JVM MLA Pradeep Yadav described the budget as the best budget ever. “This is a budget for the betterment of farmers, poor and youth. The government has done justice for the poor by contributing Rs 50,000 more in the housing scheme.

This is the first government to talk about giving scholarships to students of general category. “It is a big thing for 57 lakh families of the State to get the benefit of Lungi-Dhoti/Saree scheme.

He said, “For State BJP cadres they have double challenge first to spread the welfare schemes of Prime Minister Narendra Modi government at the same time to throw away Soren government which is anti-development.” He also asked the cadres to become more disciplined in attaining their goals and to take the fight from streets to Sadan.

BJP national general secretary, Arun Singh appreciating the work of new state president said, “Deepak Prakash is in the BJP organization for more than four decades but he never aspired to become MLA or MPs.

The members also threatened to commit self immolation if the forest guard recruitment exam held last month is not annulled soon by the Government.

According to one of the protesting members of UUO, Sanjay Sharma, “The Government compelled us to go on this hunger strike because this corrupt State Government does not listen to anything communicated peacefully. We were sent to the jail twice by the administration when all we were asking is to annul the recent forest guard recruitment exam because of fraud in its conduct.”

According to the protesting members of UUO, the State Government has not invalidated the recruitment exam because the real fraudsters are the Government officials who look after the procedure of the recruitment exam. The Government does not want to draw any kind of attention to the corruption occurring within its departments. “The Government certainly does not understand how much time, hard work and preparation goes into clearing a Government recruitment examination.

We work for years to clear one exam and here our Government is not ready to annul the exam in which many people must have cheated and will probably get the job. Validating such exams is fooling and cheating the people who have given the exam honestly as well as those who are thinking about it. I guess the Government of Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat does not like to take fair decisions until someone protests or dies during it.

If the Government is not affected by our protest and hunger strike, we will immolate ourselves right here which will probably convince the administration to do something,” said another protester Mohit Arya.

52,05-3-20,People demand cell phone tower in rural Palamu,"Demands are increasing with every ‘Sarkar Aap Ke Dwar’ programme at Palamu. On Wednesday DC Palamu Shantanu Kr Agrahari and his team held this programme at Dagra about 74 Kms away from Daltonganj wherein came a demand much stronger than one had expected and the demand was for the cell phone tower to be made operational which exists at Dagra CRPF base camp but is a non starter over the last 1 year or so.

Agrahari said, “This tower issue is a big problem here. The BSNL has fixed this structure but there is no machine. The tower is just a piece of work of iron bars only serving no purpose at all.”

DC further said “ Locals have cell phones here but curse themselves and the BSNL for their miseries as here connectivity comes like any blue moon and that too for some minutes or so” he said quoting villagers.

This BSNL tower is situated in the CRPF camp there at Dagra whose company commander RS Bhandari said, “It is tall and high but of no use. If I am to connect my superior I am to jump to any local high place for some connectivity. Internet is a big hollow dream here.”

Bhandari said, “Last week we had held a cricket tournament in memory of our slain and martyred Rupesh Singh. As there was no internet facility we felt too bad to pass on scenes of the tournament.”

If it was the demand for tower at Dagra programme better road and better electricity were the other demands raised equally strongly by the locals.

A stretch of nearly 18 Kms that takes one to Dagra is highly unnegotiable and had it been 2014 or 2012 etc every pit hole of this non metallic road would have been sniffed by metal detector for any IED laid there as booby trap!

There came sanctioning of 125 pensions on the spot. Agrahari said this coming Friday our officials will sort out online glitches/ hitches that are found in the pension schemes.

Agrahari said just a couple of days ago we had conducted a massive exercise of issuing certificates like caste, income, residential and in one day our officials set a record of issuing 4,000 such certificates to the applicants which by no means is anything not to be taken into account. DC’s team had DDC B M P Singh, Addl Collector P K Prasad, DSWO Aftab Alam and a host of other officials.

55,05-3-20,Soren toes Nitish’s line in women empowerment,"Chief Minister Hemant Soren is in the footsteps of his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar entailing social and economic betterment of women. The maiden budget of Grand Alliance government headed by Chief Minister Hemant Soren talks about several steps the government will take in the direction of women empowerment. Starting with this Soren announced that his government will provide 50 per cent reservation to fair sex in government jobs.

Soren on Tuesday talking to media persons after the presentation of budget said, “The budget aims at addressing the issue of all section of society. We have decided to reserve fifty per cent seats for women in government jobs. The process will commence in the upcoming vacancies of state government.”The Chief Minister said that the Government thinks that without addressing the issue of half the population development cannot reach at bottom of the society.

Sources said that the budget announcement of fixing fifty percent of jobs for women aims is a step towards empowerment. A senior Congress leader requesting anonymity said, “The Grand Alliance government believes that if the government is successful in appeasing half the population (women) it will be major electoral victory for them.” The leader further said, “We have seen how Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar riding on women empowerment is in power for more than one and half decade.”

Nitish Kumar has initiated a number of measures aimed at improving the standard of living for women in the state, including reservations in panchayats and urban local bodies and distribution of bicycles and uniforms to school girls.

More importantly the Bihar Chief Minister has launched campaign against child marriage and dowry. The announcement of liquor prohibition too is seen as step towards appeasing women as the women are largest victim of crime committed under the influence of liquor.

However, the image has been dented perhaps for the first time by the Muzaffarpur case, involving serial sexual abuse of girls and women at two shelter homes in Bihar.

The Congress spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo said, “The Congress party which is part of Grand Alliance always believes in empowerment of women. Congress idea of women empowerment can be gauge from the fact that out of 16 MLAs there are four MLA from fair sex.” Shahdeo also said that party and government believes in women should get equal representation in government jobs, local bodies and even in parliament.

However, sources said that though the Congress and government talks about women empowerment Soren ministry has only one women face (Joba Manjhi holding Women and Child Development Minister), while in Raghubar Das cabinet there were two women face Neera Yadav and Louis Marandi.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/soren-toes-nitish---s-line-in-women-empowerment.html

57,05-3-20,80 Jharkhandis under observation amid coronavirus fear,"At least 80 residents of Jharkhand are under observation amid coronavirus fear, but none of them has tested positive in so far, officials from the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) said on Wednesday. While no case of coronavirus has been reported in the State, the fear of the lethal virus has led to precautionary measures taken by Government authorities and politicians across Jharkhand.

“Around 80 people are under observation in Jharkhand. However, none of them have shown symptoms of the virus. They are under surveillance only because they travelled to a country affected by Coronavirus,” said IDSP State Director Rakesh Dayal. “There is no need to panic,” he added.

The virus, which has claimed over 3000 lives across the globe and infected nearly a lakh people, has also dampened Holi festivities in Jharkhand. Many prominent personalities in the State have decided not to attend or organise Holi gatherings in fear of Coronavirus. Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Arjun Munda on Wednesday announced that he would neither attend nor organise any gathering for Holi as a precautionary measure against Coronavirus – a development that comes close on the heels of a similar tweet by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Besides, Union Human Resource Development Secretary Amit Khare has addressed a letter to the Chief Secretaries of all the State in India, including Jharkhand, to organise special awareness campaigns at schools.

“In order to create awareness among students, preventive interventions such as frequent hand wash and respiratory etiquettes must be taught to students,” the letter said.

As many as 21 persons are under observation for Coronavirus in Jamshedpur – the highest among all the major cities in Jharkhand, IDSP officials said. As many as eight people are under observation in Capital Ranchi and 16 in Saraikela, they added. Around eight people are under observation in Bokaro too.

Wuhan city in China is the epicenter of the Novel Coronavirus – a mysterious new virus that has killed more than 3000 people across the world and infected at least 1 lakh. The virus has infected people in the USA, UK, Thailand, India and many other parts of the world. India has reported 28 cases of the deadly virus so far.

58,05-3-20,Tigress mauls man to death in Ranchi zoo,"An adult tigress mauled a 28-year-old man to death in Ranchi’s Birsa Zoological Park on Wednesday morning after the latter sneaked into the big cat’s enclosure, zoo authorities said. The deceased, identified as one Wasim Ansari alias Bablu, a resident of Booty in Ranchi, worked at a local garage and was under stress after getting estranged from his newly-wedded wife, police said.

He crossed a 15-feet deep moat and climbed a seven feet tall fence to enter the tigress’ enclosure, authorities said. He joined his hands as if he were praying and stood in front of the tigress, they added. The tigress attacked Ansari in a snap and broke his neck with two lethal bites before zoo authorities could come to his rescue.

“Prima facie, it seems that the man was mentally disturbed due to his marital problems. The CCTV footage shows that he came to the zoo alone, bought the tickets from the counter and moved towards the tigress’ enclosure,” said Officer In-Charge of Ormanjhi Police Station, Shyam Sundar Mahato. “There were no CCTV cameras at the enclosure, so we have to rely on the statements of eye witnesses and zoo authorities,” he added.

Ranchi zoo has a total of seven tigers, and the one involved in the attack on Wednesday is an eight-year-old tigress named Anushka. The incident occurred at around 10.45 am, said Dr. Ajay Kumar, a veterinary doctor at the zoo. “There were marks of two deep bites on the deceased’s neck. The man entered tigress Anushka’s enclosure and stood there joining his hands. The man could be suffering from some mental disorder,” said Kumar.

Police suspect that the man may was depressed and he entered the tigress’ enclosure to end his own life. Zoo Director Venkatesh Warlu said that the zoo has been closed for public as police are investigating the case. On being asked why there were no CCTV cameras at the tigress’ enclosure, Warlu said, “CCTV cameras cannot protect a person who enters an animal’s enclosure. It can only show what happened. We are working on a system to avert such incidents and it will be in place by the month of May.”

In a similar incident in Delhi Zoo in 2014, a 20-year-old man was mauled to death by a white tiger in its enclosure. The victim accidentally had fallen into the enclosure while trying to capture the big cat on his camera. Similar incidents have also been reported from the Tata Zoological Park in Jamshedpur in the past.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/tigress-mauls-man-to-death-in-ranchi-zoo.html

For visitors and tourists, it will be completely free,"" said an official of Tata Steel Utilities & Infrastructure Services Ltd.

All private schools should prominently display in their schools the details regarding the admissions against the 25 per cent quota under the RTE Act.”

66,05-3-20,UT Admin mulls cancellation of Kalagram lease,"The Chandigarh Administration is mulling to cancel the lease deed of Kalagram land done with the North Zone Culture Centre.

The NZCC, an autonomous body under the Union Ministry of Culture, promotes arts and culture in the northern region.

""The NZCC had recently turned down the UT Administration’s request to allow weddings at Kalagram. However, a party was held at the ground with NZCC’s permission,"" said a senior UT officer requesting anonymity.

""The Administration has raised objection to the conduct of function at the Kalagram ground and had sought NZCC’s reply on this. The Administration is now considering to cancel lease with the NZCC for violation,"" the officer said.

A site measuring about 14 acres, abutting Chandigarh – Kalka Road and bound by Chandigarh Kalka Railway Line and railway land on other two sides was allotted on lease by the UT Administration in 1994 to NZCC for setting up an artisan village (now named Kalagram). The land was given on lease for 99 years.

The annual National Crafts Mela, Chandigarh is held in Kalagram.

Notably, the Administration had last year announced that the Kalagram ground will be utilized for holding weddings, other functions and social events on the payment of charges ranging from Rs 25000 to Rs 3 lakh. The decision was taken to generate revenue considering the ideal location of Kalagram.

However, the NZCC had last month rejected the UT’s request stating that the Kalagram land can only be used for holding cultural activities.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-admin-mulls-cancellation-of-kalagram-lease.html
67,05-3-20,6 of 8 ‘poached’ MLAs return to support Nath,"Hours after Congress leaders accused the BJP of confining eight of its MLAs, including allies, to a hotel in Haryana as part of a conspiracy to topple the 14-month-old Madhya Pradesh Government, six of them returned to Bhopal on Wednesday evening.

Six legislators of the Congress, the BSP, the SP and independents accompanied by two Ministers, soon after reaching Bhopal, reached Chief Minister’s residence in the evening. However, Congress leaders claimed that four of their MLAs are still missing.

The Congress has alleged the BJP is making attempts to poach its MLAs in a bid to topple of the Kamal Nath Government, a charge denied by the Opposition party.

The MLAs were allegedly taken to a hotel in Manesar (Haryana), where State Ministers Jaivardhan Singh and Jitu Patwari accompanied by senior party leader Digvijay Singh had reached after midnight on Wednesday. They were not allowed to meet the legislators, but they managed to meet BSP MLA Rambai and took her with them to Bhopal.

Those who returned to Bhopal are: Congress’ Aidal Singh Kansana, Kamlesh Jatav and Ranveer Jatav, BSP’s Janjeev Kushwaha and Rambai, while SP’s Rajesh Shukla.

Those still missing are Surendra Shera, Bisahulal Singh, Hardeep Singh Dang and Raghuraj Kansana.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath told PTI, “Things are under control... The MLAs will come back”.

Interestingly, the Scindia camp Ministers did not reach CM House. However one of them, Pradyumn Singh Tomar speaking to the media extended support to the Kamal Nath Government but did not reply as why certain Ministers were not seen at CM House on their return to the State Capital. Scindia earlier had pleaded ignorance about the horse-trading episode as media had questioned him on this in Gwalior.

“Whistleblower” of the horse-trading controversy, senior Congress leaders Digvijay appeared before the media on Wednesday and said there is no threat to the Kamal Nath Government.

He again mounted charges on former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saying Chouhan had hired two chartered planes to ferry MLAs out of Madhya Pradesh. According to Digvijay, four MLAs were taken to Bengaluru.

“The BJP is apprehensive of anti-mafia action initiated by the Nath Government and is engaging in such dirty tactics,” Congress MP media cell in-charge Shobha Oza said.

“We dare the BJP to have a floor test,” she added. She claimed that eight MLAs were taken out of the State and four have returned while remaining are still with the BJP. However, as the matter snowballed into major political controversy nationally, the BJP leaders switched to defensive.

BJP State head VD Sharma was the first to rebut horse trading charges saying the party wasn’t part of any such thing. “It’s their internal conflicts and leaders like Kamal Nath, Digvijay and Scindia should offer answers on this.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/6-of-8----poached----mlas--return-to-support-nath.html
68,05-3-20,2 BJP MLAs absent from party meet,"While the BJP is facing allegations of toppling the Congress Government by horse trading, two of BJP legislators remained absent from the party meeting held at the State BJP headquarters on Tuesday.

There is a big question mark on the loyalty of the MLAs — Sharad Kol from Beohari and Narayan Tripathi from Maihar who in the past had cross-voted in favour of Kamal Nath Government last year during a trust vote in the State Assembly.

The newly appointed BJP state president VD Sharma had convened a meeting of party MLAs for Vindhya region at party headquarters in Bhopal on Tuesday. These two MLAs Kol and Tripathi, both former Congressmen remained absent.

As Tripathi, a known political turncoat has remained mum on his political plans for a while, Kol who had joined BJP after being denied ticket in 2018 assembly polls, had been offering contradictory signals.

However, couple of days ago, Kol in a video message had lashed out at his own party over alleged overlooking of Scheduled Caste community leaders in the party organisation. The BJP was quick to rebut the video saying it seems doctored.

However, Kol’s absence from party meeting suggested otherwise.

Both Kol and Tripathi had ditched their own party during the voting on a key bill during monsoon session of MP assembly which the Kamal Nath govt had turned into a trust vote. The BJP had taken no action on the rebels as there was no whip issued on that day.Political observers believe that numbers in assembly also compelled the BJP to keep the rebels in their flock.

The present equation in the State assembly is- at present there are 228 MLAs with Congress having 114 MLAs and BJP 108.

In the present scenario, the majority figure is 115. There are four intendents, two BSP MLAs and an MLA of the Samajwadi Party who all are extending outside support to Kamal Nath Government.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/2-bjp-mlas-absent-from-party-meet.html

101,05-3-20,Remembering legendary Biju on his birthday,"Anecdotes and stories about Biju Patnaik are mostly known to the world. His Indonesian mission to rescue former Prime Minister Sjahrir from the Dutch-controlled country during their freedom struggle and his courageous acts of transporting Indian soldiers to Kashmir during the Pakistani invasion and many more tales of valour have been severally told by great observers and chroniclers. That Bijubabu was genetically a daring individual crazy to take bigtime risks in every domain of human activity is commonly discussed folktale. He believed that risk-taking activities kept him mentally and physically fit.

Many may not know that he took his aristocratic wife Gyanwati Sethi from Lahore on the Indonesian mission when most womenfolks would shudder at the thought of life-threatening air adventures in the 1940s. The bravest couple brought Sultan Sjahrir on a Dakota plane via Singapore on July 24, 1947 to India where he attended an international conference organised by Nehru. Immediately after his Sjahrir rescue operation, he had been granted honorary citizenship with a ‘Son of the soil' reward called 'Bhumiputra'. Very interestingly, Indonesian President Sukarno’s daughter was named ‘Megawati' by Bijubabu. Even, the Indonesian airline was named ‘Garuda' by him -- purely religious Hindu names that were respectfully accepted by a predominantly Muslim community head. In 1996, while celebrating its 50th Independence Day, Indonesia bestowed upon Bijubabu its highest civilian award ‘Bintang Jasa Utama’.

Biju Patnaik was a great patriot. He had nearly executed a plan to print fake currency notes to be circulated across the Indian subcontinent to cause financial damage and eventual downfall of the British Raj. But he failed only because the required technology could not land in his hand. His Delhi house provided asylum to freedom fighters. So, the house was then known as the ‘Absconders’ Paradise'. In 1943, he served a two-year jail term for taking on his plane freedom fighters to secret hiding places.

Quite early in youth, Bijubabu was overawed by the tales of the Jain emperor Kharavela’s ventures during his rule in the first century BC that had brought unprecedented prosperity and peace to the Kalinga empire, the ancient name of modern Odisha. So, Bijubabu chose ‘Kalinga’ as the signature name for all his business and philanthropy ventures. He set up Kalinga Tubes, Kalinga Airlines, Kalinga Iron Work, Kalinga Refractories and ‘Kalinga' daily Odia newspaper. Most significantly, in 1951, he donated money for the prestigious international ‘Kalinga Prize' to be managed by the UNESCO for Popularisation of Science for displaying exceptional skill in presenting scientific ideas to lay people.

Quite early in life, Bijubabu had become a successful industrialist. His Kalinga Tubes used to be the only of its kind in India flourishing on an absolute monopoly mode. OP Jindal, founder of the famous Jindal empire of today, would come to Choudwar and paying in full, as was the norm, keep waiting for months on end to lift his scarce quota of steel pipes for trading across north India. He made enough money from pipe trading to graduate into being a leading industrialist later.

In 1946, Bijubabu was elected uncontested to the Odisha Legislative Assembly from the North Cuttack constituency. In 1952 and 1957, he won from Jagannathprasad and Surada, respectively. He became Chief Minister on June 23, 1961 and remained in the position until October 2, 1963 when he resigned from the post under the Kamaraj Plan. He was a complete secular person who had kept away from the saffron fold because of its pro-Hindu approach.

Around the early 1960s, Odisha was hardly known except for the Jagannath Temple in Puri and the poverty-stricken, dark-skinned tribals all over the region. Despite this perception, on February 1, 1962, Bijubabu established the 9th Sainik School of India when even Tamil Nadu or Madhya Pradesh did not have one. Around the same time, even while great admiring patron Nehru was boss, the Central Government was unable to give funds to build the Paradip Port. So, the stubborn Biju had then fumed, “To hell with the Government of India.” He organised Rs 1.60 billion all by himself and put up the deepest Indian port. Later, Nehru had to extend support. After Nehru’s death, Bijubabu lost clout in the Congress and left the party for good. During the Emergency period between 1975 and 77, he was one of the first to go to jail. He remained the tallest leader of Odisha with no match in popularity; and the Biju era is still in place. His biggest dream of the 21st-century Odisha was to witness youngsters wholly put the State first, not themselves. Further, they were at nobody’s mercy. By their intelligence, they were able to restore the glorious times of Emperor Kharavela's ‘Kalinga'.

Quite a few of Bijubabu’s magnanimous acts had been kept strictly guarded secret until his end. Only after his demise, countless beneficiaries emerged to say how he supported them under one strict condition of never exposing him as donor. Beneficiaries included doctors, engineers and top politicians.

A small story of Biju Patnaik's stature: In the 1970s, university hostel students had to study with meagre home support in an age of no-phone, no-scooter and virtually no cash-in-hand. Once in a while, they would be given lowest class train tickets for exercursions to other States. Senior students then would go knocking at the doors of wealthy people and rich politicians for money for the trip. They touched the then all-powerful CM Nandini Satpathy who blessed them wholeheartedly, wished them a grand trip; but when requested to dole out monetary help, nearly lost wits. Sensing the predicament, leaders of the collection party only sought free stay in Hyderabad by putting in a word to the Andhra Pradesh CM. Nandini promised to get it organised. The students returned excited. Very hesitantly, they went to Bijubabu, a commoner then. They sought only stay facility in Madras. Bijubabu instantly told Karunanidhi on phone, “My children are going to see Madras. If possible, give them some stay facility.” Getting inspired at this gesture, one of the guys asked for monetary help. Instantly, the tallest of Odia blasted them for begging. He roared names and said he was ashamed of them. Frightened, they all scampered to escape further beating. At the campus exit gate, a secretarial staff was waiting with an envelope. A students leader opened the envelope to see what is written for Karunanidhi. It contained 10,000 rupees in crisp 100-rupee notes. Nandini’s colleague CM in Hyderabad put the students in a desolate school on the floor without any other help or support. So, they forgot Karunanidhi on arrival at Madras. While putting baggage together, a group of officers with a banner reading 'Welcome Odisha Students' greeted them. They were respectfully escorted to the posh State Guest House, fed and guided free in vehicles and put back on return train with utmost dignity.

Many Indians may not be aware that the Nalco, the premier nine-jewel PSU, was the brainchild of the legend who chose the venture, identified the best technology from the French and prepared the plan to the minute details.

That’s how Biju Patnaik led his life with a harshly loud mouth but with the most compassionate heart! Today is his 104th birthday.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/remembering-legendary-biju-on-his-birthday.html

115,05-3-20,6 of 8 ‘poached’ MLAs return to support Nath,"Hours after Congress leaders accused the BJP of confining eight of its MLAs, including allies, to a hotel in Haryana as part of a conspiracy to topple the 14-month-old Madhya Pradesh Government, six of them returned to Bhopal on Wednesday evening.

Six legislators of the Congress, the BSP, the SP and independents accompanied by two Ministers, soon after reaching Bhopal, reached Chief Minister’s residence in the evening. However, Congress leaders claimed that four of their MLAs are still missing.

The Congress has alleged the BJP is making attempts to poach its MLAs in a bid to topple of the Kamal Nath Government, a charge denied by the Opposition party.

The MLAs were allegedly taken to a hotel in Manesar (Haryana), where State Ministers Jaivardhan Singh and Jitu Patwari accompanied by senior party leader Digvijay Singh had reached after midnight on Wednesday. They were not allowed to meet the legislators, but they managed to meet BSP MLA Rambai and took her with them to Bhopal.

Those who returned to Bhopal are: Congress’ Aidal Singh Kansana, Kamlesh Jatav and Ranveer Jatav, BSP’s Janjeev Kushwaha and Rambai, while SP’s Rajesh Shukla.

Those still missing are Surendra Shera, Bisahulal Singh, Hardeep Singh Dang and Raghuraj Kansana.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath told PTI, “Things are under control... The MLAs will come back”.

Interestingly, the Scindia camp Ministers did not reach CM House. However one of them, Pradyumn Singh Tomar speaking to the media extended support to the Kamal Nath Government but did not reply as why certain Ministers were not seen at CM House on their return to the State Capital. Scindia earlier had pleaded ignorance about the horse-trading episode as media had questioned him on this in Gwalior.

“Whistleblower” of the horse-trading controversy, senior Congress leaders Digvijay appeared before the media on Wednesday and said there is no threat to the Kamal Nath Government.

He again mounted charges on former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saying Chouhan had hired two chartered planes to ferry MLAs out of Madhya Pradesh. According to Digvijay, four MLAs were taken to Bengaluru.

“The BJP is apprehensive of anti-mafia action initiated by the Nath Government and is engaging in such dirty tactics,” Congress MP media cell in-charge Shobha Oza said.

“We dare the BJP to have a floor test,” she added. She claimed that eight MLAs were taken out of the State and four have returned while remaining are still with the BJP. However, as the matter snowballed into major political controversy nationally, the BJP leaders switched to defensive.

BJP State head VD Sharma was the first to rebut horse trading charges saying the party wasn’t part of any such thing. “It’s their internal conflicts and leaders like Kamal Nath, Digvijay and Scindia should offer answers on this.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/6-of-8----poached----mlas---return-to-support-nath.html
116,05-3-20,India focusing on dynamic response: Army Chief,"Besides strengthening its conventional fighting capabilities, India is now focusing on a dynamic response along its western (Pakistan) and northern (China) that is below an all out war, Army Chief M M Naravane said here on Wednesday.

Elaborating upon this aspect, he said the Balakot airstrikes demonstrated that if one was skilful, escalation does not always lead to war. Moreover, he noted that the Indian Army was looking to tap blockchain technologies, lasers and directed energy weapons for possible military use.

Addressing a seminar, the Army Chief said the force has analysed the changing character of war within the overall framework of conflict, as relevant to the Indian context adding, “the 'grey zone' and its varied nuances are receiving our concerted attention.”

Talking about the new phenomenon of showing military prowess below the threshold of an all-out conflict, he quoted the examples of the Houthi rebels attack on Riyadh airport and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and closer home, the Balakot airstrike. He said these saw short, intense and escalatory cycles of military activity in full media glare, “where sophisticated information narratives played an equally important role.”

For years, Indians were told that if and when the International Border (IB) between India and Pakistan is crossed it would escalate to a full-fledged war, the Army chief noted.

“Balakot demonstrated that if you play the escalatory game with skill, military ascendancy can be established in short cycles of conflict that do not necessarily lead to war,” he said.

Naravane said the future wars have possibly entered the era of 'contested equality,' wherein technology will make unequals, equal. “Perhaps that is already happening -- the battle wining factor in future combat may not be numerical equivalence but technological superiority,” he said while highlighting the growing importance of artificial intelligence and cyber.

Naravane pointed out that Chinese dominance in the South China Sea showed small incremental steps -- none of them serious enough to warrant any action or reaction -- cumulatively achieved the aim without firing a single shot or inviting retaliatory action.

The Chinese way of war, epitomised by thinkers such as Sun Tzu, has given a new lease and life to the concept of “non-contact or grey zone warfare”, where one shed the binary approach to conflict, Naravane said. He also asserted that the rise of non-state actors such as terrorists demands that victory in war is formulated in a nuanced manner.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/india-focusing-on-dynamic-response--army-chief.html

118,05-3-20,US Def Secy Mark Esper to meet Rajnath on Mar 16-17,"Carrying forward Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump's assertion during the latter's visit to India on further strengthening defence and strategic ties, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper will hold bilateral talks with Defence Minister Rajnath Singh here March 16-17. Besides reviewing growing military ties, the two leaders are also expected to focus on defence trade. At present, India has procured weapons worth over 18 billion dollars in the last few years.

Esper's visit comes days after Modi on February 25 said during the joint press conference with Trump here increasing the bilateral defence and security cooperation is a very key aspect of “one of the most important partnerships” of the 21st century. He also announced that the two countries decided to have comprehensive global partnership thereby giving a strong fillip to strategic ties.Trump announced that the two countries have finalised defence deals worth USD 3 billion and asserted that their focus was on having a comprehensive trade deal.

The relations between the two countries have never been as good as they are now, Trump said, adding that the countries have made “wonderful deal”.

Talking about defence and strategic ties between the two countries, Trump said the US is looking forward to providing India with some of the best and most feared military equipment on the planet.

“We make the greatest weapons ever made: airplanes, missiles, rockets, ships. We make the best. And we're dealing now with India. But this includes advanced air defence systems and armed and unarmed aerial vehicles,” Trump said after announcing the three billion dollar deal for 24 naval multi-role helicopters and six Apache attack helicopters.

In this backdrop the Indian and US Defence Ministers will take stock of the defence ties including further enhancing joint training amongst all the three Services and exchange of officers for courses in each other's country.

The two leaders are also likely to review the progress made in further promoting joint ventures to manufacture frontline weapons in India besides access to cutting-edge defence technology of the US, sources said here on Wednesday. These projects come under the ambit Defence Trade and Technology Intiative inked between the two countries some years ago.

India and US are in advanced stage of negotiations for some defence deals and the two defence ministers may also review their progress, officials said. The proposed deals include six more P-8I long-range maritime patrol aircraft ($1.8 billion), the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System-II for the missile shield over Delhi ($1.8 billion), 30 Sea Guardian armed drones (over $2.5 billion) and 13 big MK-45 naval gun systems for warships ($1.02 billion).

The US may also push its case for selling their fighter jets F-18, , F-15EX(upgraded version of F-16) or F-21 for the big 'Make in India' project to manufacture 114 jets for the IAF.

The proposed contract is worth over 20 billion dollars. The US is also in the race to sell 57 multi-role fighter jets capable of operating from aircraft carriers of the Indian Navy.

126,05-3-20,Two more arrested; NIA secures 3 emails by suicide bomber Adil,"With the arrest of three accused in the February 2019 Pulwama terror attack that took a toll of 40 CRPF jawans, the NIA has secured three emails exchanged by the suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, the contents of which are expected to unravel the larger conspiracy in the case.

Following the lead, the NIA on Wednesday arrested two more accused, Abdul Gani Bhat and his son Muntazir Ahmed Bhat, leading to total five arrests in the case. Both are residents of Pulwama and accused of being involved in funding and provision of logistics for the deadly terror attack.

The emails were exchanged on the encrypted ProtonMail mobile app and the last mail was sent by him on January 18, 2019, sources said, adding the mails related to planning about the terror strike with their handlers based in Pakistan.

The leads have come soon after the arrest of Taroq Ahmed Shah, 50, on Tuesday and his daughter Insha Jan of Hakripora village in Pulwama. On Wednesday, the NIA conducted fresh raids at the house of father and daughter who were arrested by the NIA in connection with the Pulwama attack case. It also questioned a suspect who is a resident of Qasbayar area in Pulwama in furtherance of the probe.

In the Pulwama attack last year, as many as 40 CRPF personnel were killed in an IED blast executed through an explosives-laden car that rammed a convoy of the CRPF.

Tariq Ahmed Shah worked as a tipper driver in the South Kashmir, disclosed during investigation that his house at Hakripora, Pulwama was used by Adil Ahmed Dar (Fidayeen), Mohd. Umar Farooq, a Pakistani terrorist and IED maker, Kamran another Pakistani terrorist (both were later killed in encounters with security forces), Sameer Ahmed Dar, a Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorist from Pulwama and Mohmmad Ismail alias Ibrahim, a Pakistani terrorist.

“ Accused Tariq Ahmed Shah facilitated all the terrorists at his house for sheltering and for planning of the heinous attack on the CRPF convoy. His house was also used by the above mentioned terrorists for preparing and recording of video of Fidayeen Adil Ahmed Dar, which was released by Jaish-e-Mohammad soon after the Pulwama attack,” the NIA has said.

Shah's daughter Insha Jan, 23, facilitated the terrorists at their home and provided food and other logistics during their stay on more than 15 occasions for two-four days each time, in their house during the year 2018-2019, the NIA said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/two-more-arrested--nia-secures--3-emails-by-suicide-bomber-adil.html
127,05-3-20,Centre's move to take over TN temples draws flak from DMK,"The Union Government’s proposal to bring in more heritage sites including ancient temples that are currently under the control of State Governments to the list of Centrally protected monuments has stirred a hornets’ nest in Tamil Nadu.

While MK Stalin, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly who is also the DMK supremo termed the move as an attempt by the BJP-led Centre to impose Sanskrit culture in Tamil Nadu, devotees across the State expressed their happiness over the proposal. “We believe the temples , if brought under the Archaeological Survey of India, would get freedom from the corrupt Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department,” said TR Ramesh, president, Temple Worshippers Society.

Prahlad Patel, Union Minister for Culture, had told the Lok Sabha on February 10 that the Government was in the process of reviewing the number of monuments under the protection of the ASI as well as the ones protected by the State Governments. The Minister had said that there were 3691monuments all over India which were protected by the ASI.

“The list of Centrally protected monuments can go up to 10,000. In Tamil Nadu alone, there are about 7,000 temples, many of which are hundreds of years old. On the other hand, there are some monuments under the ASI that can be shifted to the State list,” Patel had said.

Monuments and sites that are more than 100 years old come under the purview of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. There are restrictions on any construction activities within 100 meters of the Centrally protected monuments. Structures of temples like the Big Temple in Thanjavur come under the supervision of the ASI.

Stalin in a statement alleged that the existing monuments under the control of the ASI remain neglected. “The present proposal to bring more such monuments from the State list under the ASI’s control is unjust,” said the DMK chief, a sworn rationalist.

Temples in Tamil Nadu, especially those coming under the HRCE Department are in the eye of a controversy following large scale “disappearance” of prime land belonging to the temple. The HRCE Department had told the Madras High Court in January 2018 that it has no records about 50,000 acres of prime land which was owned by the temples. “Though the High Court had asked the HRCE Department to submit the details of the missing land in six months, the officials have not done so even after two months, pointed out Ramesh.

The temples in the State have reported the theft of more than 5,000 ancient idols which are yet to be recovered. Ramesh also pointed out the UNESCO Fact Finding Mission Report about the state of affairs in Tamil Nadu temples which was published in August 2017 by a team of experts. The team found that the HRCE Department has neither the capacity nor the qualified experts to carry out conservation works at such large scale and number. There is no appropriate system or process being followed as per conservation norms for documenting, assessing and reporting and tendering of any heritage works. The quality of regional and State level Sthapathys is questionable.

The statement by the minister in the Lok Sabha comes at a time when there is widespread demand from people across the country to declare Ram Sethu, the stone structure believed to have been built by Lord Rama’s army in Palk Bay separating India from Sri Lanka , a national monument.

The Pattali Makkal Katchi leader Dr S Ramaadoss said the move to include temples in Tamil Nadu under the ASI would hurt the sentiments of the devotees in the State.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/centre-s-move-to-take-over-tn-temples-draws-flak-from-dmk.html

133,05-3-20,"Congress, NCP link BJP to coronavirus","Slamming the poaching of ruling party MLAs reportedly indulged in by the Bharatiya Janata Party in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress and NCP in Maharashtra on Wednesday compared the BJP’s “Operation Lotus” to “Coronavirus” “for which efforts are being made to discover antibiotic” and said the JP Nadda-led party had proved once again that it can’t live without power.

Amid allegations by senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh and Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath that the BJP was trying to lure their party’s MLAs by offering `25-30 crore, former Chief Minister and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan said: “The BJP’s Operation Lotus is like Coronavirus, We are trying to discover an antibiotic to cure this virus”.

Talking to media persons at the Vidhan Bhavan here, Chavan — who is a PWD Minister in the MVA Government in the State —said: “The BJP regularly resorts to ‘Operation Lotus’ in states where it is not power. It tries to poach MLAs from the ruling party. But, I am confident that that the BJP will not succeed in its operation in Madhya Pradesh”.

“There may be any political party in power in different state, but the BJP should learn to function in a democratic manner. Kamal Nath is an efficient Chief Minister and there is no threat to the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh,” Chavan said.

Hitting out at the BJP for its ongoing efforts to lure Congress MLAS in Madhya Pradesh, State NCP Minister Jitendra Awhad tweeted in Marathi: “There is a lot of fear among the people about coronavirus. There is also outbreak of Dengue. There is rift in the society over CAA and NRC. When all these are happening, it is shame on the BJP which cannot remain without power has stooped so low ( in Madhya Pradesh”.

“The BJP has established that the levels of political are plunging low in the country. The BJP has created an image for itself that it can’t remain without power. The BJP is keeping the Congress MLAs locked up. How long people can tolerate this kind of act by the BJP,” Awhad said in another tweet. In his retaliation to Chavan’s statement, senior BJP leader Sudhir Mungantiwar said: ""Congress is itself like coronavirus. Ashok Chavan is a senior leader of Congress and he should not say such things. But Congress starts with the letter 'C' and so does coronavirus. BJP starts with 'B', so BJP has nothing to do with coronavirus.""

On Monday, MP’s former Chief Minister Digvijay Singh had alleged that the BJP was trying to destablise the Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh by offering Congress MLAs `25 to 35 crores each. BJP leader and former MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan hit back at Digvijay Singh accusing him of indulging in blackmail and alleged that the Congress leader was making such charges against the BJP in Madhya Pradesh ""to stay relevant"".

On his part, Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Wednesday slammed the BJP and stated that it (BJP) was making an unsuccessful attempt of toppling the Madhya Pradesh Government.

""Congress has full majority in the State and we have proved it. The BJP, along with the money power of the land mafias, is trying to destabilize the Madhya Pradesh government. BJP is not liking our policy of making the state free from mafias and hence, such attempts are being made on their (mafia's) money power,"" Kamal Nath said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/congress--ncp-link-bjp-to-coronavirus.html

As it highlighted the construction of 10 crore toilets in rural areas and over 5.9 lakh villages in 699 districts of 35 states/UTs declaring themselves open defecation free (ODF) in the first phase of the Mission, launched in 2014, the Government released a survey report on the impact of the mission on convenience, safety and self respect of women in rural India.

135,05-3-20,Govt’s attempt to shift focus from Delhi riots: Didi,"In a continued tirade against the Centre Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that the Modi Government is trying to spread coronavirus scare in India in order to divert the attention of the nation from the Delhi riots.

“I don’t give less importance to the Corona threat which is very real but suddenly they (Centre) are blowing it out of proportion so that they do not have to explain their failure in controlling the Delhi riots that left more than 50 people dead,” Banerjee said adding how corpses are still being fished out from drains and claiming “at least 700 people are still missing. There is a mound of dead bodies.”

Banerjee had been under ceaseless attack from the Left and the Congress for maintaining a “dubious silence” on Delhi riots when Union Home Minister Amit Shah was visiting Bengal last week. Her “late anti-BJP outburst” was promptly interpreted by the Congress as “ploy to hoodwink the people.”

Banerjee who was speaking in a meeting at Buniyadpur in South Dinajpur district announced that her party would undertake a “BJP Chi Chi” (shame shame) campaign in all the blocks of the State. “On Friday TMC will launch a BJP chi chi campaign to condemn the genocide in Delhi” and the role played by the administration to control the riots, she said.

The same slogan will also be used in the coming days to denounce the “discriminatory” Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register and National Register for Citizens, she said.

Banerjee’s “Chi Chi” campaign is thought to be a counter-coinage for the BJP’s proposed Aar Noi Anyay (no more injustice) campaign which they will start soon in Bengal.

Condemning the “Goli Maaro” (shot them) slogan often being raised from BJP meetings and rallies Banerjee said after inventing such hate slogans in Delhi they are now trying to import it in Kolkata. “What audacity! They are calling the people gaddars (traitors). Who is a gaddar? Who will decide that? You (the BJP) are the descendents of Gaddars,” she said adding her party would “never allow such people to infiltrate Bengal. Such people (BJP) have no place in our country.”

Incidentally two more persons: one from Liluah off Howrah and the other from Sodepur were arrested on Wednesday for raising Goli Maaro slogan from Amit Shah’s rally on Sunday. With Wednesday’s arrest total number of such people apprehended went up to 7 sources said.

In a circuitous attack on Shah who during her speech fixed a target of 200 seats from Bengal Banerjee said “the BJP is saying that they will target 200 out of 294 seats suggesting the rest they will leave for the Left and the Congress with whom they have a hidden understanding … But I tell them that I will target even one seat where the BJP is contesting.”

In a statement aimed at the Hindu gallery Banerjee said “the BJP always plays the Hindu card by chanting Hindu… Hindu but in Assam they have victimized more Hindus than Muslims. The majority of the 19 lakh people thrown out of the NRC are Hindu Bengalis.”

She also said that the BJP Government in Tripura was attacking the Scheduled caste and in Assam they are torturing the tribal population. “As you (BJP) had committed great atrocities against the tribal people in Jharkhand the people of that State threw you out of power.”

In a strong counter attack to what Banerjee said the BJP State president Dilip Ghosh wondered “who is actually condemning violence: Mamata Banerjee or Narendra Modi” adding “the Prime Minister has already tweeted against the Delhi riots but Mamata Banerjee has not said a single word against the people who committed violence in Bengal by burning trains and railway station after the enactment of the CAA.”",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/govt---s-attempt-to-shift-focus-from-delhi-riots--didi.html

Replying to a question in the State Legislative Council, Chavan said: “Our Government is all for setting mid-sea memorial for Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji. But, we will first order into the strictures passed by the CAG on the tendering process of the project. Later, we will take a policy decision in the matter”.

“Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is reverential figure in the entire country and it is essential that we set up a grand memorial for him. But the CAG has raised objections to the tendering process followed by the previous BJP-led Government. In addition, there are several litigations against the project on environmental issues,” the Minister said. “Following a directive by the Supreme Court, the work on the construction of the mid-sea Shivaji memorial for more than a year now,” Chavan said.

Chavan also slammed the previous Devendra Fadnavis government for not having made any progress in the construction of the Shivaji during the last five years when it was in power in the state.

It may be recalled that in the first session of the State Legislature held in Nagpur in December after the MVA government assumed office on November 28 last year, the ruling NCP leader Dhananjay Munde had demanded an inquiry into the alleged irregularities in the mid-sea Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial project.

“The previous BJP Government that came to power invoking Maratha warrior Chhatrapati Shivaji’s name had the project had launched the mid-sea Shivaji memorial through a Jal Puja at the hands of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Devendra Fadnavis government committed irregularities in the tendering process of the project,” Munde had said.

The proposed Shivaji memorial — 212 metres in height that includes a 123.2-m statue standing atop an 88.8-m pedestal — was a flagship project of the previous BJP-led Government.

The equestrian statue of the great Maratha warrior king will come up on a rocky islet around 3.5 km from the Marine Drive in south Mumbai.

The memorial will — apart from the statue of Shivaji —house an open-air theatre, a library and a museum showcasing the Maratha warrior's life. Besides, the memorial will have a viewing gallery akin to the one at Statue of Liberty in New York harbour. It will have a landscaped+ garden that can accommodate 3,000 people at a time. In 2017, L&T was shortlisted for `3,826-crore after the consortium of Reliance Infrastructure and Afcons quoted an estimate of `4779-crore for the project.

The project was estimated to cost around `3,826 crore, but now official sources said there has been “a further revision in the cost”.

According to the release, it has been observed that due to applicability of additional fee on late filings, which in case of inordinate delay could actually become a financial burden, a large number of LLPs have remained non-compliant.

144,05-3-20,Markets recoil as coronavirus cases spike in India,"Equity indices resumed their downward march on Wednesday as domestic investors were spooked by a sudden spike in coronavirus cases in India.

The government on Wednesday said 28 Covid-19 cases have been detected in the country so far, up from six as of Tuesday. This includes a group of 16 Italian tourists and their Indian driver.

Meanwhile, Union minister Prakash Javadekar said the government was proactively engaged in dealing with coronavirus, and the prime minister was monitoring the situation everyday.

After gyrating over 945 points during the day, the 30-share BSE Sensex settled 214.22 points or 0.55 per cent lower at 38,409.48.

The broader NSE Nifty closed 52.30 points or 0.46 per cent down at 11,251.

Banks were the biggest drag on the Sensex, with IndusInd Bank, HDFC Bank, SBI and ICICI Bank dropping up to 3.85 per cent.

Other laggards included Bajaj Finance, ITC, UltraTech Cement and Tata Steel.

On the other hand, Sun Pharma was the top gainer, spurting 2.86 per cent, followed by Asian Paints, Tech Mahindra and M&M.

“Fresh virus cases reported in India overshadowed monetary easing by Fed. Despite mixed global cues, the domestic market took a hit fuelled by weakness in metals, banks and auto stocks.

“Short term tremors due to virus could be felt across the globe including Indian indices but for the long term, the impact looks limited,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.

BSE bankex, finance, basic materials, realty, FMCG, oil and gas, auto and metal indices ended in the red, while IT, healthcare and teck climbed up to 1.13 per cent.

Global stocks rallied after the US central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a sizable half-percentage point in an effort to support the economy in the face of the spreading coronavirus.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noted that the coronavirus “poses evolving risks to economic activity”.

The rate cut, however, failed to cheer Indian investors. There is still a lot of uncertainty on how the major economies will contain the spread of the virus, according to Ashika Institutional Equity Research.

149,05-3-20,‘Won’t let Houses function till debate allowed’,"No early resolution to parliament logjam is in sight as the proceedings in Parliament remained paralysed for the third consecutive day on Wednesday with the Congress resolving that its protest will continue till a debate on Delhi riots is allowed in both the Houses.

The BJP and the Modi-Government has made it clear that the discussion would be possible only on March 11, a day after ‘Holi’ in the Lok Sabha and on March 12 in the Rajya sabha.

Congress’ leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said his party has been demanding that there should be a discussion in Parliament on the recent riots in the national capital. “The Government should accept its responsibility and the perpetrators of the violence should be punished. We have been asking the Government repeatedly to debate on the issue,” he said.

The Government is of a view that in about a week’s time , situation in the Capital would return to complete normalcy with relief and rehabilitation work already underway in the North-East Delhi. Speaker of Lok Sabbha and Chairman of Rajya Sabha have also spoken that a debate on Delhi violence would be held post-Holi.

As the Government and opposition are trying to make Delhi’s communal violence a political blamegame, the toll has reached 53 with more injured succumbing to their injuries.

Parliament could hardly transact any substantial business as upper house was adjourned soon after it began its proceedings and Lok Sabha also witnessed adjournment for the day after the Chair had to put-off proceedings repeatedly in the wake of loud and continuous protests from the Congress benches.

Proceedings in the lower house were disrupted for the third day on Wednesday as opposition parties created uproar demanding an immediate discussion on the Delhi violence. The House was first adjourned soon after it met at 11 am, then at noon and finally for the day a little past 2 pm.

The Opposition parties were demanding an immediate discussion on Delhi violence but Parliamentary affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi said it can be taken up on March 11 in the Lower House and on March 12 in Rajya Sabha.

Not convinced, the opposition continued the protest storming the well on several occasions. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla was not present during the day and the proceedings were chaired by presiding officers.

Amid din, the Direct Tax Vivaad Se Vishwas Bill was passed by the House. Opposition parties continued to demand resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah and continued to chant slogans -- ‘Modi Sarkar Shame Shame’, ‘Pradhan Mantri Jawab Do’.

Earlier, Congress members trooped into the Well shouting slogans and some of them displayed placards, demanding resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Nearly 30 members from the Congress were in the Well. Some of them were heard asking where the Speaker was and also shouted ‘we want justice’. Despite the din, two questions were taken up during the Question Hour. Supplementaries to a query related to coal production was answered by Joshi, who is also the Coal Minister. Kirit Solanki, who was in the chair, told agitating members that Question Hour should continue.

As the ruckus continued, he adjourned proceedings till noon after which it was adjourned for the day.

Congress has claimed that all opposition parties have consensus that till a discussion on Delhi riots is allowed, they will not allow Parliament to function. “Today also, we protested inside the House. Till the time a debate on Delhi riots is allowed in Parliament, our protest both inside and outside will continue,” Chowdhury told reporters outside the Parliament.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/---won---t-let-houses-function-till-debate-allowed---.html

151,05-3-20,Banks allowed to provide services on cryptocurrencies,"The Supreme Court Wednesday allowed banks and financial institutions from providing services related to cryptocurrencies by setting aside the RBI’s 2018 circular which had prohibited them.

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of their units and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.

A three-judge bench, headed by Justice RF Nariman, said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) circular is liable to be set aside on the ground of “proportionality”.

“Accordingly, the writ petitions are allowed and the circular dated April 6, 2018 is set aside,” said the bench, also comprising justices Aniruddha Bose and V Ramasubramanian.

“When the consistent stand of RBI is that they have not banned VCs (virtual currencies) and when the Government of India is unable to take a call despite several committees coming up with several proposals including two draft bills, both of which advocated exactly opposite positions, it is not possible for us to hold that the impugned measure is proportionate,” the bench said in its 180-page verdict.

The apex court delivered the verdict on pleas challenging the RBI circular.According to the circular, the entities regulated by the RBI were prohibited from “providing any service in relation to virtual currencies including those of transfer or receipt of money in accounts relating to the purchase or sale of virtual currencies”.

The petitioner, Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI), had argued in the top court that the RBI had banned cryptocurrencies on “moral grounds” as no prior studies were conducted to analyse their effect on the economy.

It had contended that the RBI barred all the entities regulated by it from providing services to any individual or business dealing in virtual currencies. In 2013, the RBI in an advisory cautioned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks that they were exposing themselves to.On July 3, 2018 while hearing IMAI’s plea, the top court had refused to stay the RBI circular prohibiting banks and financial institutions from dealing with the cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/banks-allowed-to-provide-services-on-cryptocurrencies.html

153,05-3-20,Maoist mastermind Gota behind Gadchiroli landmine blast held,"In a major success for the security agencies, a special investigation team of the Gadchiroli police on Wednesday arrested dreaded Maoist Dinkar Gota, who was one of the masterminds of the dastardly landmine blast in which 15 C-60 commandos and a private driver were killed on May 1, 2019, and a fellow female Maoist.

Identifying the arrested female Maoist as one Sunanda Koreti, the Gadchiroli police said that Gota was at that time a Divisional Committee Member (DVCM) of the north Gadchiroli Maoist committee, while Sunanda is a Maoist from Korachi Maoist Dalam operating in eastern Maharashtra.

“Acting on a tip-off received by Gadchiroli district police superintendent Shailesh Balkawde, a special investigation team of police arrested Gota and Sunanda early this morning. There was a bounty of Rs 18 lakh on these Maoists,” a senior district police said.

Beginning as a member of Tipgad naxal ground way in 2005, Gota has his way upin the naxal ranks. “Apart from his involvement in the May 1, 2019 landmine blast, there are 109 serious crimes registered against Gota in various police stations in Gadchiroli district6. Of the total crimes, he has been booked for 33 murders. He was also behind a major arson incident that took place at Dadapur on May 1, 2019 in which Maoists set ablaze 36 vehicles. There is a bounty of Rs 16 lakh on Gota,” the police officer said.

Sunanda, who began to operate Maoist in Gadchiroli district in 2009, has 38 serious offences registered against her in various police stations. The state government had announced a bounty of Rs 2 lakh on her.

Gota and Sunanda, who have been booked under sections 435, 427, 143, 147, 148,148 and 120 (B) of the IPC, various sections of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and other acts, were produced before a Gadchiroli court which remanded them in police custody for 14 days.

The arrest of Gota and Sunanda comes on the heels of the surrender of Gadchiroli Maoist divisional committee member Vilas Kolhe along with his AK-47 rifle, and arrest of eight Maoists in connection with the Dadapur-Jambulkheda incident.

It may be recalled that 15 commandos and a driver were killed in a landmine blast of two security vehicles carried out by Maoists in Kurkheda tehsil of Gadchiroli district in eastern Maharashtra on May 1, 2019.

The shocking attack on the security vehicles had come nearly ten hours after the Maoists set on fire at least 36 private vehicles and two site offices of a road engaged construction and repair work along the Purada-Malewada-Yerkhade stretch of along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh national highway number 136.

The C-60 commandos of the Gadchiroli police were travelling in two vehicles for naxal combing operations, when they found several fallen trees blocking the road leading to an isolated stretch of the road in a forest area.

When the security personnel alighted to clear the road, landmines planted by Maoists blew up, leaving 16 personnel dead. Those killed comprised 15 commandoes and one driver.

The incident, which took place at shortly after noon at Jamburkheda, six kilometres away from Kurkheda town, comes nearly one year after the security agencies killed as many as 40 Maoists were killed in two biggest-ever naxal encounters undertaken in the jungles of Gadchiroli district in eastern Maharashtra.

In the twin encounters that took place on April 22-23, 2018, the security personnel had nearly eliminated all the Maoists operating in the area.

The attack was seen as an attempt by the Maoists to avenge the last year’s twin anti-naxal encounters and to voice their frustration over the very polling percentage witnessed in the first phase of Lok Sabha polls on April 11.

The Gadchiroli-Chimur parliamentary seat had registered a staggering 71.98 per percentage polling. This was the highest polling percentage recorded in the four phases of polling in Maharashtra.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/maoist-mastermind-gota-behind-gadchiroli-landmine-blast-held.html

155,05-3-20,NCLAT asks CCI to initiate probe against Flipkart,"The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday asked fair trade regulator CCI to initiate again the probe against e-commerce major Flipkart for an alleged use of its dominant position.

A three-member bench of the NCLAT headed by Chairman Justice SJ Mukhopadhaya has set aside the earlier order passed by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) in this regard.

Earlier, the CCI had absolved e-commerce major Flipkart of unfair practices using its dominant position.

The appellate tribunal has directed the CCI to ask its probe arm Director General (DG) to investigate into the allegations. “We set aside the order passed by CCI...,” the bench said, adding that the fair trade regulator “is directed to initiate probe against Flipkart”.

The NCLAT said that the All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) has successfully made its case here.

Flipkart said it was waiting for the copy of the order passed by the NCLAT. “We understand that the NCLAT has issued an order in relation to the AIOVA appeal. We are currently awaiting a copy of the order,” a Flipkart spokesperson said.

In November 2018, the AIOVA had approached the CCI alleging abuse of market dominance by e-commerce major. The AIOVA had alleged abuse of market dominance against Flipkart India Pvt Ltd, which is into wholesale trading/distribution of books, mobiles, computers and related accessories, and e-commerce marketplace Flipkart Internet Pvt Ltd.

It had alleged that small vendors had become allies of the big vendors and suppliers to leading sellers such as Cloudtail, WS Retail, etc. on the Flipkart and Amazon platforms, rather than selling directly to consumers through the online e-commerce marketplace sites.

However, passing an order on November 6, 2018, the CCI had held that the business practices of Flipkart and Amazon were not in violation of competition norms and rejected allegations of abuse of market dominance made by the AIOVA.

The CCI had ruled that looking at the present market construct and structure of online marketplace platforms in India, “it does not appear that any one player in the market is commanding any dominant position at this stage of evolution of market”.

The AIOVA, as mentioned in the CCI order, is a group of over 2,000 sellers selling on e-commerce marketplaces such as Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal etc.

Earlier in February this year, in a different matter, the High Court of Karnataka had stayed the CCI investigation into allegations of anti-competitive behaviour by two e-retailing majors Amazon and Flipkart for a period of eight weeks. The CCI had ordered a probe into Amazon Seller Services and Flipkart Internet, units of the two e-commerce marketplaces, on January 13 after receiving complaints from trader body Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh.

161,05-3-20,"S Korea hunts sick beds; rising virus toll in Iran, Italy","South Korea struggled to find enough hospital beds for sick patients, Iran and Italy grappled with rising deaths, and Saudi Arabia banned citizens from performing the pilgrimage to Mecca as the coronavirus that tormented China acquired firm footing elsewhere in the world.

As the number of new cases drops precipitously in China, attention has shifted to South Korea, Italy and Iran, countries with major coronavirus clusters that the World Health Organisation says account for 80 per cent of new cases outside China.

“People are afraid and uncertain. Fear is a natural human response to any threat. But as we get more data, we are understanding this virus and the disease it causes more and more,” said WHO’s leader Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

WHO said about 3.4 per cent of people infected with the virus COVID-19 globally have died, making it more fatal than the common flu.

Death rates in outbreaks are likely to skew higher early on as health officials focus on finding severe and fatal cases, missing most milder cases. WHO says the majority of people with the new coronavirus experience only mild symptoms and do not require any treatment.

In Daegu, the South Korean city at the centre of that country’s outbreak, a shortage of hospital space meant about 2,300 patients were being cared for in other facilities while they awaited a hospital bed.

Attending a meeting on quarantine strategies in Daegu, Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun assured his country, saying, “We can absolutely overcome this situation... We will win the war against COVID-19.”

South Korea reported 435 new infections on Wednesday, far smaller than its high of 851 a day earlier. A total of 5,621 people in South Korea have contracted the virus and 32 have died.

Iran reported 92 deaths among its 2,922 confirmed cases, the most of any country except China. Among the ill are members of the government, and the country cancelled Friday prayers for the second week in a row.

The deaths in Italy rose to 79. The outbreak in Italy has been concentrated in the northern region of Lombardy, but fear over the virus’ spread led even the Vatican to insist Pope Francis was not infected.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/s-korea-hunts-sick-beds--rising-virus-toll-in-iran--italy.html
162,05-3-20,Europe must support Turkey in Syria if it wants migrant solution: Erdogan,"European countries must support Turkey’s “solutions” in Syria if they want to resolve the migration crisis, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday, accusing Europe of “trampling” on refugees’ rights.

“If European countries want to resolve the issue, they must support Turkey’s efforts for political and humanitarian solutions in Syria,” Erdogan said in a televised speech.

“All European countries closing their borders to refugees today, trying to push them back by hitting them and sinking their boats, in fact even shooting at them, are trampling over the universal declaration of human rights,” he said in Ankara.

Following the deaths of over 30 Turkish soldiers in Syrian regime fire last week in Idlib, Turkey opened its borders with Europe to refugees and migrants.

Turkey is home to around 3.6 million Syrian refugees and many other migrants from countries including Afghanistan use Turkey as a transit country to Europe.

It fears another mass influx if Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, falls to Syrian forces.

Thousands of migrants have massed at the Turkish-Greek border since Erdogan gave them the green light to try to enter Europe, leading to clashes with Greek police.

Erdogan criticised the Greek response, saying: “The Greeks — who are resorting to any means to stop refugees coming into their country, even drowning them or killing them with live ammunition —they shouldn’t forget they might need this same mercy one day.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/europe-must-support-turkey-in-syria-if-it-wants-migrant-solution--erdogan.html

164,05-3-20,Markets mostly rise after emergency Fed cut sinks Wall Steeet,"Asian and European stocks mostly rose on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve sprang its first emergency rate cut since the global financial crisis to counter economic fallout from coronavirus.

In the first unscheduled rate reduction since 2008, the Fed axed its key interest rate by a half point to a range of 1.0-1.25, arguing it was needed because “coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity”.

Wall Street then tanked on fears the central bank was in panic mode over the spreading COVID-19 disease, which has so far killed 3,200 people worldwide and infected more than 90,000.

However, equities in Europe and Asia mostly advanced on Wednesday as investor nerves subsided, dealers said.

In commodities, oil rallied on indications that the OPEC crude producing cartel could slash output this week in order to prop up prices.

“Market sentiment certainly seems to have stabilised after a historic US session which saw the role of monetary policy undermined as traders sold into an extraordinary bout of easing from the Fed,” said IG analyst Joshua Mahony.

“The US economy is actually yet to feel a significant economic impact from this virus, and thus the decision to take such drastic action provided markets with a warning of exactly how big this threat is,” added Mahony, noting the Fed still has a scheduled rate call in two weeks.

In late morning deals, London stocks jumped 1.3 percent, while there were 1.0-percent gains in Frankfurt, Paris and Milan.

The deep cut in US rates on Tuesday followed a statement from G7 finance ministers that they stood ready to take “appropriate actions... Including fiscal measures” in response to the virus.

Lower interest rates traditionally boost the global economy because they curb loan repayments for businesses and individuals, and also increase the level of consumers’ disposable income. Yet many analysts predict the US rate cut will not be enough to offset virus-fuelled economic turmoil.

“It is the first emergency cut since the financial crisis -- and the rate cut will be fairly ineffectual in offsetting the coming hit to the economy from the coronavirus,” said Kingswood chief investment officer Rupert Thompson, predicting that the Bank of England could follow the same path.

“While these moves may help support equities short term, they do little to reduce the enormous uncertainty over the extent of the eventual spread of the coronavirus and the damage it could have on global growth.”

In announcing the reduction, the US Federal Open Market Committee said US fundamentals “remain strong” but warned that “coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity”.

The move initially sent Wall Street rallying, but traders soon reversed course as they grew increasingly nervous about the economic outlook.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/markets-mostly-rise-after-emergency-fed-cut-sinks-wall-steeet.html

Reduction in penalties for certain offences as well as in timeline for rights issues, relaxation in CSR compliance requirements and creation of separate benches at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) are among the raft of other proposed changes in the Companies Act, 2013.

Briefing reporters, Corporate Affairs Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the priority is to “decriminalise” provisions in the Act.

There would be 72 changes resulting in amendments to 65 sections of the Act and the aim is to ensure greater ease of doing business as well as living.

Sitharaman, who is also the finance minister, said 23 offences would be recategorised out of 66 compoundable offences under the Act. Besides, seven compoundable offences would be omitted, she said.

She also said penalties would be reduced in case of various compoundable offences. Generally, compoundable offences are those which can be settled by paying certain amount of money.

167,05-3-20,Trade impact of Coronavirus epidemic for India estimated at 348 million dollars: UN,"The trade impact of the coronavirus epidemic for India is estimated to be about 348 million dollars and the country figures among the top 15 economies most affected as slowdown of manufacturing in China disrupts world trade, according to a UN report.

Estimates published by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Wednesday said that the slowdown of manufacturing in China due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak is disrupting world trade and could result in a 50 billion dollar decrease in exports across global value chains.

The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment.

Among the most affected economies are the European Union (USD 15.6 billion), the United States (USD 5.8 billion), Japan (USD 5.2 billion), South Korea (USD 3.8 billion), Taiwan Province of China (USD 2.6 billion) and Vietnam ( USD 2.3 billion).

India is among the 15 most affected economies due to the coronavirus epidemic and slow down in production in China, with a trade impact of 348 million dollars.

The trade impact for India is less as compared to other economies such as EU, the US, Japan and South Korea. Trade impact for Indonesia is 312 million dollars.

For India, the trade impact is estimated to be the most for the chemicals sector at 129 million dollars, textiles and apparel at 64 million dollars, automotive sector at 34 million dollars, electrical machinery at 12 million dollars, leather products at 13 million dollars, metals and metal products at 27 million dollars and wood products and furniture at 15 million dollars.

“Besides its worrying effects on human life, the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has the potential to significantly slowdown not only the Chinese economy but also the global economy. China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations. Any disruption of China's output is expected to have repercussions elsewhere through regional and global value chains,” UNCTAD said.

Over the last month, China has seen a dramatic reduction in its manufacturing Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) to 37.5, its lowest reading since 2004.

This drop implies a 2 per cent reduction in output on an annual basis. This has come as a direct consequence of the spread of corona virus (COVID-19).

“The 2 per cent contraction in China's output has ripple effects through the global economy and thus far has caused an estimated drop of about USD 50 billion across countries,""UNCTAD said.

""The most affected sectors include precision instruments, machinery, automotive and communication equipment,” it added.

UNCTAD said because China has become the central manufacturing hub of many global business operations, a slowdown in Chinese production has repercussions for any given country depending on how reliant its industries are on Chinese suppliers.

“In addition to grave threats to human life, the coronavirus outbreak carries serious risks for the global economy,” UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi said.

“Any slowdown in manufacturing in one part of the world will have a ripple effect in economic activity across the globe because of regional and global value chains,” he said.

Pamela Coke-Hamilton, who heads UNCTAD's Division on International Trade and Commodities, said for developing economies that are reliant on selling raw materials, the effects could be felt “very, very intensely.”

“Assuming that it is not mitigated in the short-term, it's likely that the overall impact on the global economy is going to be significant in terms of a negative downturn,” she said.

The estimated global effects of COVID-19 are subject to change depending on the containment of the virus and or changes in the sources of supply.

Meanwhile, the extent of the damage to the global economy caused by novel coronavirus COVID-19 moved further into focus as UN economists announced a likely USD 50 billion drop in worldwide manufacturing exports in February alone.

Highlighting the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of the epidemic, in which there have been more than 90,000 confirmed cases in more than 70 countries (the majority in China) and over 3,000 deaths, Coke-Hamilton said that US measures “in terms of visitor arrivals, cancelling various meetings” were having a “knock-on effect” in terms of demand.

“So right now, we're not clear on where it will go – a lot will depend on what happens with COVID-19; if they are able to come up with a vaccine then hallelujah, hopefully it will end very quickly, but if not, the impact can be severe,” she said.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trade-impact-of-coronavirus-epidemic-for-india-estimated-at-348-million-dollars--un-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/trade-impact-of-coronavirus-epidemic-for-india-estimated-at-348-million-dollars--un.html

Yes Bank, which is grappling with bad loans, is looking to raise fresh capital but the plans are facing uncertainties.

It has also delayed announcement of December 2019 quarter results due to the ongoing crisis.

In a remarkable rebound for his campaign, 77-year-old Biden won nine of the 14 states that voted to pick a Democratic candidate on “Super Tuesday”, the most important day in the race for the White House.

The former US vice-president overturned predictions to narrowly take the key state of Texas from his main challenger, Sanders, 78. He also won the primaries in Virginia, North Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Minnesota and Massachusetts.

However, Sanders won big in California - the biggest prize of the night - as well as in Colorado and Utah. He also won from his home state of Vermont.

The two now lead the race to face President Trump, a Republican, in the November 3 presidential election.

“We are very much alive,” Biden told a crowd in Los Angeles. “Make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.”

According to NBC News projections, Biden gained 342 on Super Tuesday, bringing his delegate total to 395. Sanders, meanwhile, so far won 245 delegates and is now at 305.

Sanders, by winning big in the State of California – which sends 415 pledge delegates – signalled that his fight to win the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump was far from over. Either of the candidates need at least 1,991 of the 3,979 pledged delegates to win the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/democratic-prez-race-narrows-down-to-two-way-fight-between-biden--sanders.html

The biomedical waste emanating from the city not only pollutes the environment but citizens also suffer from various infections. The NGT has taken the problem of the biomedical waste very seriously. Many environmentalists had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal in this regard requesting that this waste be disposed of as per the standards. In addition, the corporation is going to buy 10 special plastic energy machines to destroy the city’s restricted plastic materials. The city stated that these machines will be received through JAM portal.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-to-install-incinerators-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/ghaziabad-municipal-corporation-to-install-incinerators.html

It encompasses a range of diseases and conditions that include dental caries, periodontal disease, tooth loss, oral cancer, oro-dental trauma, birth defects such as cleft lip and palate. It is a vital component of preventive medicine and essential to general health. But it’s often neglected until the suffering is affecting routine work. Health care approach towards optimum oral health requires multi-speciality management including prompt diagnosis and treatment.

The study, Global Burden of Disease 2017, estimated that oral diseases affect 3.5 billion people worldwide. India is called as the “oral cancer capital” of the world, attributed to its high intake of both smoked and smokeless tobacco products, strongly associated with oral neoplasms. World Health Organisation data also highlights that nearly six million deaths per year around the world may be directly attributed to tobacco use.

National Triple O Symposium and International Oral Precancer and Cancer Congress aim to provide an apt forum and vivacious platform for researchers, academicians, practitioners and students from India and the globe to share their ideas, findings and practical experiences. One can learn more about integrated practice and can take part in various panel discussions, lectures that will augment the skills and knowledge.

This year, Maulana Azad Institute of Dental Sciences (MAIDS), Government of NCT of Delhi is organising the 18th National Triple O Symposium and 4th International Oral Pre-cancer and Cancer Congress. This joint Congress is being organised based on the theme of Integrating Multispecialities for Holistic Management of Oral Diseases from March 6 to 8.

175,05-3-20,Keep the traditions alive: Khanam,"India is a land of rich culture and heritage. Since the beginning of our civilisation music, dance and drama have been an integral aspect of our culture. Initially, these artforms were used as a medium of propagation for religion and social reforms.

From the Vedic era to the medieval period, the performing arts remained an important source of educating the masses. Culture plays an important role in the development of any nation; it represents a set of shared attitudes, values, goals and practices. A country as diverse as India is symbolised by the plurality of its culture. We have the largest collection of songs, music, dance, theatre, folk traditions, performing arts, paintings and writings.

What is art?

“Art is an aesthetic expression of human emotions, known as ‘Rasa’. It signifies the ultimate satisfaction of pleasure. Human emotions can be categorised into nine sub-headings or ‘Navras’. The intellectual mind merges with the artistic streak, giving birth to art. Some of these are expressed through live performances and others through visual arts.

Evolution of performing arts

Tradition of classical dance and music is ancient. In Indian tradition, dance and music are based on devotion. They form an integral part of the socio-religious rituals and festivities. Great Indian poet Kalidas mentions in Meghaduta that the Mahakal temple in Ujjain resounded with the sound of the ankle bells of the dancing girls.

The oldest archaeological evidence of dance exists in the form of pictures and sculptures dating from about 2500 BC.

Sangeet Ratnakara written by Sarangdeva in the 13th century mentions 264 ragas. A variety of string and wind instruments were invented over the period of time. Many rulers patronised music and dance. The Gupta monarch Samudra Gupta was himself an accomplished musician. In some of his coins, he is shown playing the Veena.

Similarly in the medieval period the Sufi and Bhakti saints encouraged music... Qawwalis were sung in Sufi khanqahs, shrine and devotional music like Kirtan and Bhajan became popular with the Bhakti Saints. Names of Kabir, Mira bai, Surdas, Tulsidas, Vidyapati are closely associated with religious music. Many scholars have invented many instruments and ragas. Great scholars like Amir Khusrau contributed equally to the promotion of music. Kitabe Navras written by Ibrahim Adil Shah II during the 17th century is a collection of songs in praise of Hindu deities and Muslim saints.

There were many famous musicians of Mughal’s court, the patronage given to these artists by the ancient and medieval rulers have been instrumental in keeping the traditions alive. The great musician Tansen, was a vocalist and instrumentalist at the court of Akbar in the 15th Century. Descendants of Tansen founded a tradition upon which modern Indian classical music is based upon.

The soul of Indian Music

The soul of Hindustani sangeet is spiritual communication to the almighty. The dancers and musicians convey their emotions through this medium.

Guru Shishya Parampara

This parampara is about disciples learning under a particular guru, transmitting his musical knowledge and style, and belonging to the same gharana. Indian traditional dance styles are more than 2,000 years old and there arises the need to create awareness and interest in the younger generation so that they get the real sense of the term keeping our age-old tradition and culture intact.

The modern guru-shishya relationship is an inter-mingling of the traditional gurukul system and the modern teacher-student relationship. It is constantly evolving through new methods of teaching, innovative choreographies, different interpretations our mythological stories but trying their best to follow the tradition. In India, this concept has survived despite all the modern mechanisms. Though the modern relationship is yet to find its space between tradition and modernity.

The Gharana System

Without mentioning the Gharana, Guru-Shishya Parampara seems incomplete. Different Gharanas are like different flowers and each flower has its own fragrance. They are the school of thoughts and each of them have a different vision. A Gharana needs a continuity of at least three generations.

Unlike the West, where the dance and music are written heritage, the Indian performing art also includes oral understanding and is a flowing tradition. Every nuance imbibed/interpreted by individuals is different and the signature of an artist is to contribute to the flow of the tradition making it relevant for the contemporary time.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/keep-the-traditions-alive--khanam-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/keep-the-traditions-alive--khanam.html
176,05-3-20,"How will you handle Dhoni’s future, Kohli’s stature?","The Madan Lal-led Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) had two common questions for the potential national selectors: “how will you handle Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s future with the Indian team and skipper Virat Kohli’s stature?

All the Five candidates were asked a common question on Dhoni, who has not played since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand in July.

However, the former skipper will lead Chennai Super Kings in the IPL beginning March 29.

“Yes, the CAC had one common question and that was about their call with regards to Mahendra Singh Dhoni and whether they will select him for T20 World Cup,” a senior BCCI official said.

It is understood that the new BCCI regime wants the selection committee to have a clear cut stand on Dhoni’s international future.

“Dhoni is both a sensitive and tricky issue and that’s why the question needed to be asked,” the source added.

A few of the candidates were also asked whether they are “only looking at the chairman’s post” or they would be happy to become just a selector.

Lal was also asked if Virat Kohli being a strong captain was considered while picking the panel and he said both Joshi and Harvinder had the “best answers” on this particular topic.

“We have this factor the most in our mind. Our captain is a high performing player. We have kept it in mind that we find somebody who can communicate with him, because in the end it is the captain, who has to run the team.

“Captain matters a lot to the team and so it is important on how you communicate with him. What is gone is in the past, the two selectors that we picked had the best answers on this topic.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/how-will-you-handle-dhoni---s-future--kohli---s-stature-.html
177,05-3-20,Sunil Joshi is new selection committee chairman,"Former India spinner Sunil Joshi was on Wednesday named chairman of the national selection panel by the BCCI’s Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), which also picked ex-pacer Harvinder Singh in the five-member group.

The CAC, comprising Madan Lal, R P Singh and Sulakshana Naik, named the two selectors. Joshi replaces MSK Prasad (South Zone), who had an extended run after completing his four-year tenure.

“The committee recommended Sunil Joshi for the role of Chairman of the senior men’s selection committee,” read a statement from BCCI Secretary Jay Shah.

In an unprecedented decision, the BCCI said the CAC will review the panel’s performance after one year and “make recommendations” accordingly.

Harvinder was chosen from Central Zone and replaces Gagan Khoda in the panel. The existing members of the selection panel are Jatin Paranjpe (West), Devang Gandhi (East) and Sarandeep Singh (North).

“We have picked the best guys for the job. We picked them (Joshi and Harvinder) because they were very clear in their views,” Lal said after the interviews.

Specifically on Joshi, Lal said: “We liked his straight-forward attitude. He is experienced also (having been part of the Bangladesh support staff). He has also coached UP.

“I asked him how he handled Bangladesh selectors. He has done the toughest of jobs. His thoughts were the best.”

Lal said candidates’ playing experience in all three formats was considered.

“Their experience in Tests, ODIs and first-class was considered. The rest we will get to know (with their performance). After one year’s time, if we find they have not done a good job, we will decide accordingly,” he said.

Joshi’s selection from South Zone and Harvinder getting picked from Central Zone also shows that the Board has stuck with the zonal policy.

“Our zonal system is very effective and you need it as India is a huge country,” said Lal .

The 49-year-old Joshi played 15 Tests and 69 ODIs between 1996 and 2001, taking 41 and 69 wickets respectively.

Harvinder, who is 42, represented India in three Tests and 16 ODIs between 1998 and 2001, taking four and 24 scalps respectively.

On selectors dealing with the high-profile team management including skipper Virat Kohli and head coach Ravi Shastri, Lal assured the chosen ones will not shy away from taking tough calls.

“We have selected those who can take the hardest of decisions. (Be it) Ravi Shastri or Virat Kohli, we are taking about the India team. We selected those who can take tough calls.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/sunil-joshi-is-new-selection-committee-chairman.html
178,05-3-20,Unadkat leads Saurashtra to final,"Saurashtra entered their second successive Ranji Trophy final with a 92-run win over Gujarat on day five of their semifinal here on Wednesday.

Saurashtra captain and lead pacer Jaydev Unadkat led from the front with a seven-wicket haul as Gujarat were bowled out for 234 in the final session on day five.

Chasing 327, Gujarat had resumed the day at seven for one. They were down and out at 63 for five before captain Parthiv Patel (93) and Chirag Gandhi (96) shared a 158-run stand to raise hopes of an improbable win.

However, Unadkat removed both the set batsmen to fashion a memorable win for his team.

Saurashtra will host Bengal in the final from March 9. Saurashtra had lost last year’s title clash to Vidarbha.

Resuming on seven for one, the visitors lost their second wicket on the same score.

Unadkat struck early as he removed Samit Gohil (5), who was caught at second slip.

Unadkat had his third scalp when took a return catch to send back Dhruv Raval (1). Gujarat were in trouble at 18 for three.

When it looked like Bhargav Merai (14) and skipper Parthiv were steadying Gujarat’s ship, Prerak Mankad broke through by trapping Merai in front of the wicket as Gujarat slipped to 60 for four. Soon, it became 63 for five after Rujul Bhatt (1) also fell cheaply.

Parthiv held one end up and then found an allay in Chirag, their heroics helped Gujarat to take tea at 206 for five, still needing 121 runs in the final session.

Just then, Unadkat turned the tables in favour of the hosts by dismissing Parthiv and new man Axar Patel (0) in the same over.

With the two wickets, Unadkat also completed his 20th five-for. Saurashtra then wrapped up the tail, and fittingly, Unadkat took the last wicket.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/unadkat-leads-saurashtra-to-final.html
179,05-3-20,US launches airstrike against Taliban,"The US launched an airstrike against Taliban fighters to defend Afghan forces on Wednesday, an American military spokesman said, as violence spirals after a string of deadly attacks by the insurgents, throwing the country’s nascent peace process into grave doubt.

News of the airstrike in southern Helmand province — the first in 11 days — came hours after US President Donald Trump told reporters he had had a “very good” chat with the Taliban political chief, who on Saturday signed a historic deal with Washington to withdraw foreign forces.

Since the signing in Doha however, the militants have ramped up violence against Afghan forces, casting a pall over peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban, due to begin on March 10.

US Forces-Afghanistan spokesman Sonny Leggett tweeted that the airstrike targeted Taliban fighters who were “actively attacking” an Afghan forces checkpoint in Helmand.

“This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack,” he tweeted. “We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments. As we have demonstrated, we will defend our partners when required.” He said insurgents had carried out 43 attacks on checkpoints in Helmand on Tuesday alone. Provincial police spokesman Mohammad Zaman Hamdard told AFP: “In the past two days we have witnessed the most intense Taliban attacks in Helmand.”

“They have attacked several districts and many military bases,” he added.

Elsewhere the insurgents killed at least 20 Afghan soldiers and policemen in a series of overnight attacks in other provinces, government officials told AFP on Wednesday.

“Taliban fighters attacked at least three army outposts in Imam Sahib district of Kunduz last night, killing at least 10 soldiers and four police,” said Safiullah Amiri, a member of the provincial council.

A defence ministry official speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity confirmed the army toll, while the provincial police spokesman Hejratullah Akbari confirmed the police fatalities.

The insurgents also attacked police in central Uruzgan province Tuesday night, with the governor’s spokesman Zergai Ebadi telling AFP: “Unfortunately, six police were killed and seven wounded.”",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/us-launches-airstrike-against-taliban.html
180,05-3-20,‘My religion is love’,"Kathak dancer Manjari Chaturvedi says religious differences in a country cannot define its culture and people. And despite being stopped from performing at a concert midway, she kept her message alive. By Chahak Mittal

Aasha se bhasha na mile to, iss ka matlab phoot nahin,

Ik daali par reh kar jaise, phool juda hain paat juda,

Bura nahin agar yunhi watan mein, dharm juda ho zaat juda,

Apne watan mein...’

This song from the black-and-white era film, Didi (1959), stands relevant even today and makes one feel proud of the vast diversity of our country, that is resolutely battling the naked ambition of the political class. Kathak dancer Manjari Chaturvedi, who is set to open at the Jahan-e-Khusrau Sufi Music Festival 2020, believes the same. She says, “Religious differences will never cease to exist but that doesn’t mean they can define the people of a nation. They cannot determine its culture and identity. We have to find a way out towards harmony. Which is why, I believe, it’s very important to talk about love and also, breathe it — not only here but all over the world.”

Recent examples are evidence of how political upheavals and communal differences have affected art and artistes in many ways. One of the biggest one being the banning of Pakistani artistes and films in India and vice versa. An incident also occurred with Manjari when a month ago, her performance was stopped midway in Lucknow. She alleged that they didn’t want qawwali to be played there. Recalling the row, she says, “My concert was stopped for a reason but I don’t believe that there is anything wrong in performing qawwali. For me, it is as spiritual as any other composition. But it did not appeal to some people. So, I turned around and told them that it was unfair to stop the show. But did I stop performing as an artist? No. I will continue to speak about the message of love.” She adds that over the past 25 years that she has been in the industry, “governments have come and gone. But my work has been the same. Hence, the work of art is not defined by the political ideology of that moment. It is what we call our sanskriti, and our culture is defined by its people, not their differences.”

Manjari will be performing on the poetry of Rumi, “one of the most loved poets,” interpreting the core emotion. “Even though I had been trying to work on this since a long time, the Rumi project is new. It talks about how the human soul is separated from the universal soul, which is the Almighty. It is aspiring to meet it, which is like ‘Atma ka parmatma se milan.’ There are also English translations of it recited by Murad (Ali) because people might not understand Persian but they need to know what poetry is saying as dance is not just a performance, it also communicates. It is about a singular entity and not particularly a story. It is about the universal soul. It doesn’t have a face, name or shape to it. It’s just a soul that’s being explored through dance and music. It’s abstract,” says she.

Why did she only choose Rumi as her muse? The reason is ‘Ishq.’ She says, “Today, we need to talk about love as much as we can. Because what else do we need? We don’t require hate. We have to actually bring it to every platform. I believe the English term — love — is very limiting. And there’s no right translation of Ishq. It is that level of love where you forget your own identity and in which you burn. Ishq is something that burns you and I find that the intensity is higher in the term as compared to ‘love.’ ‘I love you’ is very easy to say but to burn in that intensity is different. And that is what Rumi experienced.”

Social media is witness to how Rumi has been quoted by so many — irrespective of which generation one belongs to. But Manjari feels that its right meaning has still never been completely understood or felt. Says she, “Rumi’s poetry gives us the possibility that ‘that’ kind of love does exist. It is musical, it is magical. And I am just exploring the probability of that kind of love which he had felt.”

It’s her travels to different parts of the world that has made her explore a variety of artforms and cultures. Which is why she believes that festivals like the Jahan-e-Khusrau are very important. “I have travelled to 35 countries in 20 years. And nowhere did anyone ask me about how many malls there are in Delhi. Instead, they asked me how do I perform kathak? What is Krishna’s philosophy? How do you find your music? How do you plan your performances? The question about how many malls are there in your city sometimes becomes irrelevant if you don’t have your arts and culture alive. Sanskriti is important. Otherwise, there will be no difference left in a mall in Vasant Kunj and a mall in Dubai. The difference is in the essence of a place’s culture,” she points out.

Manjari has been known for her “Courtesan Project,” through which she has talked at length about how gender discrimination has prevailed in art. Through her performances and concerts, she has recreated the lives and magic of courtesans — who have time and again, been the muse for poets, painters, sculptors, artists, musicians, writers, filmmakers and the creative thought at large. How much has people’s perspective changed since the time she started the conversation around them? “Very much!” she says and adds, “It’s been nine years since I started the project. And because I was already an established artist even at that time, when I started talking about it suddenly, there was an unhealthy buzz. People were making comments like, ‘Oh! Look at her. Now she’s going to do this.’ ‘This is what kathak is going to be reduced to now.’ ‘She’s going to start doing Mujra now.’ But now, I see, a lot has changed. They have started to understand what I am saying.”

She explains that her only point of debate was that one cannot discriminate art on the basis of gender and explaining this took almost a decade. She adds, “The men performers are called ‘Ustads’, whereas women performers are called ‘Nachne-gaane vaali.’ The judgement needs to be limited on what has been performed and that whether it is right or not. How can you decide that a ghazal is good or bad depending on the gender of the performer? It was the first time in 100-200 years, even post-independence, that there was a conversation about tawaifs. Why do women performers only have to be linked to sexuality? It is very easy for patriarchy to bring a woman down. And this is one of my projects through which I have actively questioned gender inequality. And today, I could say that people are understanding my point of view and agreeing too.”

However, she also feels that such a thought came to her due to a realisation — “I come from a privileged background.” Being a Brahmin and an educated person, she has had many privileges. She says, “Initially, they would laugh at me when I began the Courtesan Project. I realised that I was born with these privileges and I am grateful to it. But not everybody was born with them. So if I don’t do something for the ones who don’t have the privilege, what is the point of having it then?”

Filmmaker Tahira Kashyap is worried after seeing the increase in the number of people infected by coronavirus in India.

She said on social media, “Trip to delhi... as I entered the airport I saw everyone wearing masks. The sight in itself started giving me anxiety. How are we living? What's happening to my earth? I literally had to call up a friend and get comforted as the anxiety was becoming a sort of panic attack.”

“Not seeing faces, not seeing people smile or talk, one sneeze or sniff and people become wary, the sight is really disturbing. This on one side and riots on the other...collective prayers can work is all I know, is all I can hope for,” Tahira added.

‘The last time I started getting thousands of good words was after the release of Article 15. I ran away to Gulmarg, to the mountains where there was no network!

182,05-3-20,‘Always have a signature sound’,"Dutch musician Nicky Romero, who will perform at the Road to Ultra Music Festival, says that electronic dance music is all about diversity and inclusion. By Team Viva

How do you think the Road to Ultra Music festival has evolved over the years?

Ultra has always been a great supporter of talent and the latest evolutions in dance music. Its really exciting to see new markets like India open up and expose the dance community to new artists.

How is it performing live in front of the Indian audience?

The love is incredible. I can really tell that there are dedicated fans in India and its exciting to learn more about the culture and feel the energy.

How have you explored different genres of music?

I listen to all kinds of music. My hits are from different genres of music. I’ve been lucky enough to meet many talents — musicians, writers, and vocalists all over the world. I try to borrow what inspires me from their music and combine it with my fundamentals. This process never stops and through this the most important thing I’ve learned is to not be afraid to come out of your comfort zone.

Tell us about your new sounds for 2020?

This year is about developing new sounds in the studio and redefining some of my signature production techniques. We’re releasing a lot more club tracks this year and will continue to experiment and collaborate in almost all the genres. I’ve been working on some great new music with collaborators, this is what keeps me excited and focussed.

Give us your overview of being a successful EDM artist?

Always have a signature sound and sta focussed in the studio. Also, it is very important to learn, evolve and remember why you started making music in the first place.

What has been your creative process?

Inspiration comes in all shapes and forms. Sometimes I start from a vocal demo, other times from scratch with writers and musicians in my studio. Sometimes the process happens by sending bits and pieces of the track back and forth on a collaboration over weeks or months until its just right. It is important to always keep your signature production elements in the DNA of the track and never rush the process.

Why is EDM becoming so popular in India? Do you think is it pushing other genres out? Why?

I think there is room for all genres of music. EDM is all about diversity and inclusion. I hope the various genres of music in India influence the type of dance music that is being made. Infact, they just add to each other in a positive way.

Where are the global music trends heading?

Genres are blending and more international acts are getting a major spotlight. India and South America are the hot spots right now.

Do you think India is determined to become next EDM hub of the world?

I hope so. I would love to travel to perform here more often. The fans here are some of the best in the world.

183,05-3-20,Simple and pure,"Louis Vuitton stages style history wall, Chanel goes pared-down at Paris Fashion Week

Louis Vuitton staged a dazzling cinematic fashion production to cap Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday, with a wall of around 200 human figures dressed in fashions that spanned human history.

While Chanel staged a comparatively low-key affair, as the coronavirus outbreak kept many of the regular VIPs and fashion editors away. Some guests who made it wore CC-branded face masks, while others watched the Parisian stalwart’s display streamed online. Restraint was also evoked in Chanel designer Virginie Viard’s designs: A marked departure from her showman predecessor and mentor, the late Karl Lagerfeld. Simplicity was the Chanel “mot du jour” — from the set of tiered white steps to the pared-down aesthetic of monochrome.

Here are some highlights on the last day for fall-winter 2020 ready-to-wear.

LOUIS VUITTON’S WALL OF HISTORY

Elizabethan ruffs glistened in the lights alongside medieval two-point hats, pantaloons, exaggerated wigs and crinolines Tuesday at Louis Vuitton’s fall collection in Paris.

Guests marveled, as the show began inside the Louvre’s Cour Carree, to reveal a “wall” full of 200 people dressed in glimmering historic costumes, ranging from the 15th century to the 1950s.

It was an arresting spectacle, especially when music sounded in a beautiful and stirring harmony. The set, by Stanley Kubrick’s costume designer Milena Canonero, led the house to ask: “ What if all of the innumerable eras that nourish fashion could come together?”

Yet despite the exorbitantly-priced set piece, and a few garments, the answer was thin. The journey through design history in this Ghesquiere showing was relatively limited and the runway seemed to explore different themes to those evoked by the set piece.

Some historic-looking puff skirts with layers in gold gave certain looks a period air, as did bejeweled and embroidered jackets with a semi-circular lapel the historic musing was scant.

But front row of stars, including Alicia Vikander, Lea Seydoux and Lupita Nyong’o, attested that this show was instead rooted firmly in the present.

On the runway, multi-coloured ski jackets followed pin-striped pants, loose silk knee-length dresses in sparkling tiger prints, black leather ankle boots with a geometric flash of color, and tailored plaid jackets with strong black lapels. The collection, albeit finely executed, was rather hard to pin down.

CHANEL SEEKS SIMPLICITY

“A very simple, very pure momentum. Romanticism, but without any flourishes,” is how Viard described her designs.

Evoking French film director Claude Chabrol’s 1968 film The Does, a lesbian drama, female models walked the runway together and chatted like intimates in the first looks. The models wore stylish retro black leather boots, ones with a brandy bell-shaped collar at the mid-calf that became the collection’s leitmotif.

Viard’s simplest designs were the most effective: A black silk bodice dress with the top lobbed off and dropped Juliette sleeves. Modeled by Cindy Crawford’s daughter, Kaia Gerber, it had guests clicking their cameras. And voluminous studded jodhpurs that opened up at the bottom cut a beautiful silhouette. This design, Viard said in a touching detail, was an homage to Lagerfeld’s personal style. Another simple garment, a loose wool jacket in Chanel’s emblematic pink with a soft-spiky collar, was a high point.

Yet, a drawback of the tasteful showing were some of the overly flashy gold chains and costume jewelry that often distracted the eye from the show’s central aesthetic.

FUN AT MIU MIU

There has been renewed focus on Miuccia Prada after she announced during Milan Fashion Week that she had hired Belgian designer Raf Simons as co-creative director of the family house that she directed to icon status.

The first show since then for Prada’s little-sister brand, Miu Miu, did not disappoint creatively. The “intellectual” fashion display was a pastiche of itself. Bright colours, intentionally contrasting checks, faux animal fur and sumptuous shimmering silk gowns merged in divergent ways for disruptive, quirky effects.

Old school glamour came in an emerald green crinkled silk column dress, modeled with 1930s-style wavy hair that looked like it had been left in curlers a little too long.

As expected from Miu Miu, the fun vibe was everywhere: From the patterned runway that confused the eye when a model in a plaid split-leg dress walked it to the knit Cetacean blue bathing suit sweater and bright red furry heels worn by model Bella Hadid.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/simple-and-pure-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/simple-and-pure.html
184,05-3-20,A step towards healthy living,"Union Minister of State for Shipping and Chemicals and Fertilisers, Mansukh Mandaviya, talks about how the Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana has benefitted citizens

Working tirelessly for affordable healthcare for the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s focus has been on various health related aspects for people coming from different walks of life. He believes that alongside infrastructure, there should be a major focus on the health sector reforms. Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana, Fit India Movement, Ayushman Bharat Yojana are the results of his vision. He has been interacting with the nation time and again, urging them to embrace fitness as the way of life. However, in case of any healthcare requirements, he has provisioned for affordable solutions for all to access.

In 2014, when the government of Narendra Modi came in power, he took up the cause of creating awareness about generic medicines and demand among the common people. Jan Aushadhi scheme focuses on price fixation of various drugs and medicines. With 6,209 Jan Aushadhi kendras, covering 700 districts out of 728, they facilitate for 900 drugs and 154 surgical items. Jan Aushadhi kendra is the world’s largest chain of pharma stores covering all major therapeutic categories such as anti-infective, anti-diabetic, anti-cardiovascular, anti-gastrointestinal and even anti-cancer. The sales of the kendras in the FY 2019-20 have crossed Rs 391 crore leading to the total savings of approximately Rs 2,200 crore for the common citizens as these medicines were availed at 50 to 90 per cent cheaper rates than the average market price of that particular dozes.

To strengthen the supply chain, boost its efficiency and ensuring that the medicines reach the customers in good health and on time, special arrangements were devised around a robust IT enabled end-to-end supply chain management system. This intelligent Supply Chain Management System efficiently manages Central Warehouse and three regional warehouses. The warehouses powered by technical expertise are temperature controlled. They record the medicines through radio scanners at the time of arrival, specify their place and store them at exact spots with the help of automated cranes and trolleys. This warehouse in Manesar has a systemised way of three layer scanning system, storing and dispatching the generic medicines with utmost care and expertise.

Prioritising women’s health and promoting importance of hygiene during their menstrual cycles, a step towards women empowerment was taken by the Government. Oxo-biodegradable Suvidha Sanitary Pads were launched at Rs 2.5 per pad on June 5, 2018 and its price was slashed to Rs 1 per pad in August 2019. It is now available at various Jan Aushadhi kendras.

Soon the government targeted essential medicines for the price control, which had an effective impact on the National List of Essential Medicines. Till now, the price of 957 drugs has been put into price fixation which resulted in approximately Rs 5,416 crore savings. The maximum retail price of 106 formulations (anti-diabetic and cardiovascular) has been capped by NPPA, the prices of Coronary Stent and Orthopaedic Knee Implants saw reduction upto 85 per cent in February 2017 and upto 69 per cent in August 2017 respectively resulting in Rs 6,047 crore savings. Also NPPA has capped the cancer related medicines with a trade margin of 30 per cent, which has also helped Jan Aushadhi scheme to reach out to maximum number of common citizens and providing a relief from excessive cost.

Reported as one of the highest expenditure disease in 2014, Cancer demanded a substantial portion of the expense to be spent on drugs. To harness this alarming situation, the government curbed the prices of anti-cancer drugs. So far, 59 anti-cancer drugs are already under price control as scheduled formulations and NPPA have fixed ceiling price of 81 scheduled formulations of such medicines. The immediate result was reduction in MRP of drugs up to 91 per cent covering 565 brands. For instance, the previous price of BIRLOTIB brand tablets (10 pack) of ERLOTINIB 150 mg medicine was Rs 9,999 and post price control, it is reduced to Rs 892 per pack. Similarly, PEMESTAR 500 was priced at Rs 25,400 per injection, which has been reduced to Rs 2,509 per injection. This resulted in the savings of Rs 984 crore, giving a relief to the cancer affected patients and to their family.

The overall saving done in favour of the consumers accounts for Rs 14,447 crore approximately. The success of Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Aushadhi Pariyojana becomes evident when the people of India now term these affordable medicines as Modicines and the Jan Aushadhi kendras as Pradhan Mantri ji ki dukan.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-step-towards-healthy-living-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-step-towards-healthy-living.html

Over 25,000 delegates from 47,000 Lions Clubs all over would meet in the city from July 1 to 5 in 2022. India is likely to get it tourism revenue between $50-60 million.

The club culture has been in trend for a long time. People are finding it difficult to get membership of clubs. The membership of clubs like the Golf Club, Gymkhana Clubs and others is beyond the reach of even high rank officers and the upper class. These clubs provides all the comforts, such as swimming pool, bar and many others at reasonable prices.

Lions Clubs International provides an opportunity to serve humanity with a team spirit. The system of membership of such clubs is not by application but through invites from the existing members. This is offered to a person who has inclination for social service and is willing to devote his time and resources.

Its activity include the eradication of illiteracy. Under this project, the club runs around 200 schools all over the country. They provide quality education to the lower middle class and needy sections. In the city, there are two Lions schools and both have imparted education to around two lakh students in the last 50 years.

Another project of the club is Lions Blood Banks and Eye hospital (180) in various parts of the country.

It was founded in 1917 in USA by Melvin Jones of Chicago and has a membership strength of above 1.4 million. India joined Lions Clubs in 1956.

Lions Clubs International Foundation (LCIF) is the financial arm of the NGO providing funds for community service projects all over the world. As per the data available since 1973 India has got LCIF grants of more that 10.5 crore dollar for utilisation in community service activities.

Its service activities in the country include charity hospitals, schools, blood banks, dialysis centres, vision care centres, orphanage centres, helping disabled and the people affected due to natural calamities. Our focus has been on promoting ecological balance, relieving people from hunger, containing diabetes, childhood cancer, etc. It has been partnering with government in vaccination/immunisation programmes.

The club is perhaps the only NGO which has setup around 70 children parks and gyms in public parks. The first park was developed at Batala, a border town near Amritsar. Dr Naresh Aggarwal, the then International President of the LCI conceived this project in 2017-18. So far the club has setup 68 parks in different parts of the country.

It also actively participates in Swachh Bharat Programme. Every year the International Convention Lions Clubs from all over world is held in different countries. Last year, it was in Milan, Italy. This year it is going to be in Singapore.

186,05-3-20,No reserve day for semis,"The International Cricket Council (ICC) has turned down Cricket Australia’s request to have a reserve day for the semifinals of the ongoing Women’s T20 World Cup. The two semifinals are scheduled to take place today in Sydney but the forecast of rain throughout the afternoon threatens to jeopardise both fixtures.

Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts on Wednesday revealed that the apex body declined the request under tournament rules.

“We’ve asked the question (on a reserve day),” Cricket Australia chief Kevin Roberts was quoted as saying on the radio station SEN.

“It’s not part of the playing conditions and we respect that. We’re optimistic based on the drainage at the SCG combined with a weather forecast that is not perfect but not terrible either,” he added.

According to the rules laid out by the ICC for the tournament, there must be at least a 20 overs match with both sides playing 10 overs each.

“We’re really hopeful and planning for different scenarios tomorrow night but the important thing is getting our team ready to play a 10 over match, a 12 over match, an 18 over match or whatever it happens to be if it’s not a full 20-over contest,” Roberts said.

However, an ICC spokesperson defended the decision, according to media reports, stating that adding a reserve day would extend the duration of T20 World Cup which is supposed to be “short and sharp”

“The ICC T20 World Cups are short sharp events where reserve days are factored in for the final. Allowing for any other reserve days would have extended the length of the event, which isn’t feasible,” he said.

“There is a clear and fair alternative should there be no play in any of the semi-finals with the winner of the group progressing.”

In case either or both the semifinal matches are washed out, India and South Africa will qualify for Sunday’s final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground having finished on top of their respective groups.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-reserve-day-for-semis.html

190,05-3-20,Coronavirus: Fourteen Italians shifted to Gurgaons's Medanta Hospital,"The fourteen Italians, who have tested positive for coronavirus, have been shifted to the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon from an ITBP quarantine centre.

The hospital issued a statement on Thursday morning, saying these patients are housed on a completely separate floor, which has been quarantined and has no contact with the rest of the hospital.

There is a dedicated medical team wearing protective gear looking after these patients. All items used on the floor are isolated to that floor.

The isolated floor will completely contain the disease even with these asymptomatic persons. All other hospital operations are operating as normal, and there is no increased risk to patients, visitors or staff, the statement said.

Twenty-one Italian tourists and their three Indian tour operators were shifted out from an ITBP quarantine centre here on Wednesday as they were exposed to novel coronavirus.

An affected Italian couple is being treated at Jaipur's SMS medical college.

Officials on Tuesday said the foreigners have been sent to a private hospital in Gurgaon and a centre in the national capital while the Indians have been transferred to the Safdarjung Hospital.

Fourteen Italians and an Indian (driver), who were in the same group as the affected Italian couple, tested positive for the virus as per information provided by the Health Ministry.

The Italian tourists and three Indians were admitted to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) force centre in Chhawla on Tuesday.

The Centre already has 112 people, 76 Indians and 36 foreigners, since February 27 after they were evacuated by an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane from China's Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus.

191,05-3-20,Nirbhaya case: Sena blames 'loopholes' in law for delay in execution,"The Shiv Sena on Thursday lamented that the execution of convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case has been being delayed due to ""loopholes"" in the judicial system.

Hope people will not lose faith in the judiciary because of the delay in implementation of punishment of the convicts who are facing the gallows in the Nirbhaya case, an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said.

The execution of the death warrants of the four convicts - Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) - has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting legal remedies. All the convicts in the case are to be hanged together.

The Shiv Sena said courts must have been ""bound"" by provisions of the existing laws. But, the implementation of punishment to the culprits should not be delayed when the country's top court has upheld the hanging of the accused.

The President rejected their mercy petitions, their death warrants were issued and the date and time of the hanging was finalised, the Marathi daily noted.

""The loopholes in the existing laws should not come in the way of implementation of the death sentence. Such unfortunate developments shouldn't happen,"" it said.

Wondering who should be blamed for this, the Sena said ""unfortunately, what should not happen is happening"" in the Nirbhaya case.

""We hope peopledon't lose trust in the judiciary because of the delay in hanging of the Nirbhaya case convicts,"" the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.

Due to the delay in delivery of justice, people feel that the ""disha"" shown by Andhra Pradesh, wherein the accused in a rape case were ""killed by Hyderabad police"", should be implemented elsewhere, the Sena said.

The Andhra Pradesh government recently formulated the Disha Act that seeks to fast track cases of offences against women and children and award death penalty.

It was enacted as a tribute to a veterinary doctor who was brutally raped and murdered in Andhra Pradesh's neighbouring Telangana in November last year.

The law mandates completion of investigation in cases of sexual offences within seven working days and the trial within 14 working days from the date of filing the charge sheet.

Four accused in the rape and murder of the veterinarian were killed in a police encounter on the outskirts of Hyderabad in December last year.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--sena-blames--loopholes--in-law-for-delay-in-execution-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--sena-blames--loopholes--in-law-for-delay-in-execution.html

193,05-3-20,ED books former Jet Airways boss Goyal for money laundering; conducts raids,"Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal and few others have been booked by the ED in a money laundering case even as the agency is conducting searches at his premises, officials said on Thursday.

They said a criminal case against the former chairman of the airlines has been filed under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after taking cognisance of a recent Mumbai Police FIR filed against him.

The Enforcement Directorate carried out raids at Goyal's premises in Mumbai on Wednesday and also questioned him after filing the case, they said.

The action is continuing, they added.

The Mumbai Police FIR pertains to charges of alleged fraud by Goyal and others against a Mumbai-based travel company.

Goyal has earlier been grilled by the central probe agency in a case filed under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) in September last year.

The agency had carried out similar raids, under the FEMA, in August last year against Goyal, his family and others.

ED has alleged in the past that the businessman's empire had 19 privately-held companies, five of which were registered abroad.

The agency is probing charges that these firms allegedly carried out ""doubtful"" transactions under the guise of selling, distribution and operating expenses.

The ED suspects that expenses at these companies were allegedly booked at fake and high costs and as a result, they ""projected"" huge losses.

Alleged shady aircraft lease transactions with non-existent offshore entities are also under the ED scanner and it is suspected that Jet Airways made payments for lease rental to ""ghost firms"", which purportedly routed the ill-gotten money in Goyal's companies.

A full-service carrier, Jet Airways shut its operations in April last year after running out of cash.

Dhoni, who has been on a sabbatical since India’s semifinal exit from the ODI World Cup last year, on Monday received a rousing reception at the the MA Chidambaram Stadium here during his first training session with CSK ahead of the event beginning March 29.

“...CSK has helped me improve in everything, whether it was being a human being or being a cricketer, handling situations that are tough both in and out of the field and how to be humble once you are doing well,” Dhoni was quoted as saying on a Star Sports show.

His ardent CSK fans fondly call him Thala, and the 38-year-old said the love and respect he has got from them is special.

“Thala’ basically means brother, so for me it’s more the abstract of the fans, the love and affection towards me is the reflection of that,” he said.

“Whenever I am in Chennai or down South they never call me by my name, they address me as Thala and the moment someone calls me Thala they are showing their love and respect but at the same time he is a CSK fan.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/csk-made-me-better-player--dhoni.html
195,05-3-20,Verma rises to top in rankings,"Teenage Indian batting sensation Shafali Verma on Wednesday rose to the top spot in the ICC women’s T20I rankings, riding on her stellar run at the ongoing World Cup.

The 16-year-old Verma takes over from New Zealand’s Suzie Bates, who had been the top batter since October 2018 after wresting the spot from West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor.

However, Smriti Mandhana has slipped a couple of rungs to sixth in the latest list.

Verma and England spinner Sophie Ecclestone will go into the semifinals of the event as the top ranked batter and bowler respectively.

Verma’s explosive batting at the top of the order saw her score 161 runs in four innings, including knocks of 47 and 46 against Sri Lanka and New Zealand. It helped her become only the second India batter after Mithali Raj to top the women’s T20I batting rankings.

Ecclestone, who took eight wickets in four matches including a best of three for seven against the West Indies, is the first England bowler to be number one since Anya Shrubsole in April 2016 and the first England spinner at the top since Danni Hazell in August 2015.

Among the Indian bowlers, Poonam Yadav is up four places to eighth after a good run in World Cup.

New Zealand captain Sophie Devine is now the sole number one all-rounder after coming into the tournament as a joint number one along with Australia all-rounder Ellyse Perry.

Australia remain at the top of the T20I team rankings with 290 points and England in second position with 278.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/verma-rises-to-top-in-rankings.html
196,05-3-20,Tackling Poonam will be key: Knight,"England captain Heather Knight feels tackling spinners, particularly the in-form Poonam Yadav, will be crucial to her side’s chances of upstaging an unbeaten India in the semifinal clash.

Yadav bamboozled hosts Australia in the opening match of this tournament and her wicket-taking exploits haven’t stopped there. She is leading the charts with nine scalps in four matches.

But the leg-spinner couldn’t cast her spell the last time India met England in the tournament, conceding 29 from her four overs as Knight’s side romped to an eight-wicket victory to reach the final two years ago.

“We’ve practised for her a lot, I thought we played her outstandingly in the last T20 World Cup and that was due to the preparation we had,” Knight said on the eve of the match.

“We don’t have (assistant coach) Ali Maiden anymore, who bowled brilliant leg-spin, but we’ve got a few coaches who have bowled it brilliantly and we’ve been really clear on how we’re going to do things against her,” she added.

Yadav has gone on to become India’s leading T20I wicket-taker and her ability to deceive on Australian pitches has forced Knight to take note ahead of their crunch match.

“She’s a massive threat for them and is an improved bowler since the last World Cup, so for us to be successful, we’re going to have to play her and all their spinners well. That’s going to be key in the game,” the England skipper said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/tackling-poonam-will-be-key--knight.html
197,05-3-20,‘Shafali has brought happiness & positivity’,"Shafali Verma has not only lit up the Women’s T20 World Cup with her explosive batting but the “naughty” teenager has also added immense happiness and positivity to the Indian team off the field, feels captain Harmanpreet Kaur.

The 16-year-old Verma has scored 161 runs at a stunning strike rate of 161, setting the tone for India’s four Group A victories with fearless batting despite being in her first global tournament.

Ahead of today’s semifinal showdown with England at SCG, her captain acknowledged what the fresh-faced teenager has offered India behind the scenes.

“She’s very naughty, gets so much happiness and positivity to the team, always wants to enjoy it,” Kaur said.

“And when batting with her she’s motivating you and releasing pressure, that kind of player you need in your team. Whoever is playing, wants to play for the country and give their best, she’s enjoying for the team,” she added.

Kaur said since this Indian side has been together for a while, it has now built a conducive environment for youngsters like Verma to prosper.

“Now this team has been together for a long time, we learn a lot from each other, learn a lot of cricket. It makes it easier for players such as Shafali because when anybody enters the team, they see everyone is working together.

“They also feel nice and try to do what others are doing,”she said.

The skipper, herself known to be a power-hitter, has endured a poor start to the tournament by failing to reach double digit scores.

Kaur insisted that everyone in the team is being handed out their roles to ensure that the side continues to perform well.

“Right now, what we are trying to do, is give individual roles so that everyone can come and perform for the team. I didn’t perform with the bat but the team is doing well and we are enjoying that. That is more important for us.”

Verma has certainly been in form Down Under but there’s no getting away from India’s disappointing women’s T20 World Cup record against England.

They have never beaten Heather Knight’s side in the competition, a run which includes an eight-wicket defeat in the 2018 semifinals.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/---shafali-has-brought-happiness---positivity---.html
198,05-3-20,Harman & CO seek 1st final spot,"Firm title contenders after a sensational unbeaten run in the group stages, India will have to ensure a solid all-round performance to get the better of formidable England in the semifinals of the ICC women’s T20 World Cup at Sydney Cricket Ground today.

India have been the best side so far and they would be seeking their maiden final appearance in the showpiece’s history with a win over England.

In the earlier seven editions, India have never reached the final but this time, they have emerged as serious title contenders after a string of superlative performances.

They are in red-hot form, but history favours England as they have won all the five matches played between the two sides in this tournament.

The last time, the two teams met in a T20 World Cup, England won by eight wickets in the semifinals in West Indies.

Before that, India lost in 2009, 2012, 2014 and 2016 editions — all in group stages.

“After losing the last semifinal, as a team we realised we have to work as a unit, and right now you will see that our team is working as a unit and we are not reliant on just one or two players,” India captain Harmanpreet Kaur said, referring to the semifinals loss in 2018.

Seven players in this Indian team played in that semifinal and they would be looking to turn the tables on the Englishwomen this time.

The Indians will also take confidence from the win against England in the tri-series in Australia ahead of this World Cup.

On form, most of the Indians are in top form with teenage sensation Shafali Verma being the leading batter, having scored 161 runs in four innings.

With a batting average of 40.25, the 16-year-old is on the third spot among leading run-getters in the tournament, followed by England’s Natalie Sciver (202) and Heather Knight (193).

One-down Jemimah Rodrigues is also in good touch and has made useful contributions though she has not scored big so far, with 34 being her highest.

The middle order has also stepped up whenever needed with Veda Krishnamurthy, Shikha Pandey and Radha Yadav making their presence felt in different matches.

The two most experienced players in skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and opener Smriti Mandhana have, however, not been living up to the expectations and the semifinals could be their big comeback.

In the bowling department, leg-spinner Poonam Yadav is on top of the tournament chart with nine wickets from four matches. She has been ably supported by Shikha Pandey (7 from 4 matches).

For England, who have qualified for the semifinals after finishing second in group B with three wins and one loss, batting has been their strength.

Natalie has plundered 202 runs with an average of 67.33, including three fifties, and the Indians will have to find a way to stop her in her tracks.

199,05-3-20,India advance to women's T20 World Cup final after semifinal against England washed out,"An unbeaten run in the group stage propelled India into their maiden Women's T20 World Cup final after their last-four clash against England was washed out here on Thursday.

Persistent rain since morning delayed the toss and eventually the semifinal was called off without a ball being bowled, taking Indians into the summit clash and leaving England players in tears.

""Really frustrating. Not how we wanted the World Cup to finish for us. No reserve day, no chance of getting play, and ultimately that loss against South Africa cost us,"" a dejected England captain Heather Knight said after the game was abandoned.

Her India counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur also agreed that the semifinals should have had a reserve day, a request which was made by Cricket Australia but turned down by the ICC.

""Unfortunate we didn't get a game, but there are rules and we have to follow it. Having reserve days in the future will be a great idea,"" said Kaur.

Knight said her team paid the price for not starting the tournament well.

""It's all very English isn't it, talking about the weather and getting knocked out. It felt that we gained a bit of momentum in the last few games and we were pumped up for the semifinals,"" she added.

""Lessons are to win the first game I guess (laughs). It's become a trend, not to start well in tournaments, and that has cost us.""

India had topped Group A with four victories in as many matches while England had finished second in Group B with three wins and a defeat.

""From day one, we new we have to win all the games because in case the semis don't happen, that would be hard for us. In that sense, credit to the team for winning all the games,"" said Kaur.

""Everybody is looking in great touch - Shafali (Verma) and Smriti (Mandhana). They are giving us good starts, and that helps. Me and Smriti are trying to spend more time in the nets,"" she added reflecting on her and Mandhana's so far indifferent form.

""We are looking more positive now. Unfortunately we haven't come up with big innings, but our teammates are, and at the end of the day it's a team game.""

England had ended runners-up in the previous edition.

201,05-3-20,Eating 1 egg a day not bad for your heart: Study,"Eating up to one egg per day may be good for you and does not increase the risk of heart attack or stroke as previously feared, say researchers.

The study, published in the journal The BMJ, adds to evidence that moderate egg consumption (up to one egg per day) is not associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

Eggs are an affordable source of high-quality protein, iron and unsaturated fatty acids, but due to their cholesterol content, the association between egg intake and CVD risk has been a topic of intense debate over the past decade.

""Recent studies reignited the debate on this controversial topic, but our study provides compelling evidence supporting the lack of an appreciable association between moderate egg consumption and cardiovascular disease,"" said study first author Jean-Philippe Drouin-Chartier, Professor at Laval University in Canada.

The new findings update a 1999 study -- the first major analysis of eggs and cardiovascular disease -- that found no association between eggs and CVD risk.

For this study, researchers analysed health data from 173,563 women and 90,214 men participating in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) I and II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) who were free of CVD, type 2 diabetes, and cancer at baseline.

They used repeated measures of diet during up to 32 years of follow-up to gain a detailed picture of potentially confounding lifestyle factors such as high body mass index and red meat consumption.

The researchers also conducted the largest meta-analysis of this topic, including 28 prospective cohort studies with up to 1.7 million participants.

The analysis of NHS and HPFS participants found no association between moderate egg consumption and risk of CVD.

Results from the meta-analysis supported this finding in the US and European populations; however, some evidence suggested that moderate egg consumption may be associated with lower CVD risk in Asian populations although this may be confounded by the overall dietary pattern.

""While moderate egg consumption can be part of a healthy eating pattern, it is not essential,"" said Indian-origin researcher and study co-author Shilpa Bhupathiraju from Harvard University in the US.

""There is a range of other foods that can be included in a healthy breakfast, such as whole grain toasts, plain yogurt, and fruits,"" Bhupathiraju added.

204,05-3-20,"No coronavirus in Maha, don't panic, but caution needed: CM","Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday said no case of coronavirus infection has been found in the state and there was no cause for panic, but caution was necessary for the next eight to ten days.

Addressing a press conference here, he also said people should refrain from visiting crowded places.

""Extra precaution is needed to be taken during the next eight to ten days....People should celebrate the Holi festival in a restrained way,"" he said.

The medical staff at the airports will be increased for conducting thermal screening of all the passengers arriving from other countries, Thackeray said.

Thermal checking is being carried out at Nagpur and Pune airports in the state too, he said.

Mumbai municipal commissioner Pravin Pardeshi, also present at the press conference, said additional quarantine beds have been kept ready at private hospitals in the city.

Pardeshi also stated that people need not wear face masks, which the medical staff who are treating suspected coronavirus patients need.

Some 18,000 passengers arrive at the international airport in Mumbai every day, the commissioner said.

So far about 70,000 passengers have undergone thermal checking and 90 of them showed symptoms of the disease. But 83 of these patients eventually tested negative for the virus while the lab reports of seven people were awaited, Pardeshi added.

Earlier, making a statement in the Legislative Assembly, chief minister Thackeray said his government was taking all necessary steps for the prevention of the ""coronavirus epidemic"".

""I want to tell people that the next eight days are crucial and we have to remain cautious,"" he told the House.

""We need to tackle the crisis effectively without getting scared and panicky,"" he said. ""If we get scared, we may end up committing avoidable mistakes,"" he added.

Adequate testing facilities were in place in Mumbai, Nagpur and Pune, the chief minister said.

""There is enough stock of masks. We need to see if the vacant Seven Hills Hospital in Mumbai can be used for quarantine facilities,"" he added.

He had instructed authorities to provide masks and required clothing to the cleaning staff of international flights at the airports in the state, Thackeray informed.

Hotel managements have also been instructed to check if foreign tourists checking into their hotels have undergone thermal screening, he said.

""I have instructed the Information and Publicity department to issue advertisements for mass awareness at railway and bus stations regarding precautions to be taken,"" he said.

Noting that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had decided not to celebrate Holi in view of the virus epidemic this year, Thackeray said, ""When there was an outbreak of swine flu, the dahi-handi celebrations were cancelled (in Maharashtra).

205,05-3-20,Screening for all global fliers,"Coronavirus cases in India rise to 29, including 16 Italians

Fifteen Italian tourists tested positive for coranavirus on Wednesday, taking the total confirmed cases in the country to 29, including 3 in Kerala who have now recuperated. An Italian tourist had tested positive a day earlier. His wife too has become a confirmed case.

With the count going up by the day, the Government announced that all international passengers will henceforth be screened at airports for the disease. Earlier, travellers from only 12 countries were being screened at the airports.

An Indian driver accompanying the Italian tourists has also tested positive. So far, a total of 16 Italian tourists have been tested positive apart from the driver.

Meanwhile, Paytm has advised all its employees to work from home for the next couple of days after one of their employees from Gurugram tested positive. He is supposed to be the same Delhi man who had returned from Italy and tested positive on Tuesday. Paytm also decided to shut its offices in Gurugram and Noida for at least two days.

A Paytm spokesperson said, “One of our colleagues based out of Gurugram office who recently returned from Italy post a vacation has sadly been tested positive for coronavirus. He is receiving appropriate treatment and we are extending complete support to his family. As a precautionary measure, we have suggested his team members to get health tests done immediately. We have also advised all our colleagues to work from home for a couple of days while we get our offices sanitised. However, there will not be any impact on our daily operations and Paytm services will continue as usual.”

Meanwhile, 21 Italian tourists were shifted out from an ITBP quarantine centre and sent to a private hospital in Gurugram and a centre in Delhi. Their three Indians tour operators have been transferred to Safdarjung Hospital.

The Italian tourists and three Indians were admitted to the ITBP centre in Chhawla on Tuesday.

The centre already has 112 people, 76 Indians and 36 foreigners, since February 27 after they were evacuated by an Indian Air Force (IAF) plane from China’s Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus. The first samples of these 112 people had tested negative when reports came in last week.

Meanwhile, Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said so far 5,89,000 people have been screened at airports, over 15,000 at major and minor sea ports, around 10 lakh at borders with Nepal and around 27,000 were currently under community surveillance.

Of the confirmed cases, 16 are of a tourist group from Italy. An Italian man and his wife are being treated at Jaipur’s SMS Hospital, while 15 members of the group and their Indian driver have been quarantined at the ITBP camp in Chhawla.

Among others is a 45-year-old man from Delhi’s Mayur Vihar and six of his relatives from Agra whom he recently visited. They are all being treated at Safdarjung Hospital. According to Health Ministry officials, the Italian tourists wanted to go back to their country after the first person in their group tested positive in Jaipur, but authorities advised them to stay in India.

Three coronavirus patients reported in Kerala earlier have already been discharged.

The Ministry also said that two cases with high viral load have been detected in Telangana. Their samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology at Pune for confirmation of coronavirus, health authorities said on Wednesday, as the Government stepped up precautionary measures.

The virus scare hit the IT corridor at Cyberabad herewitha complex, housing software companies, being “closed” for sanitisation after a person working there was suspected to be suffering from the infection. The State reported its first COVID-19 case on Monday when a 24-year-old software personnel, who recently returned from Dubai, had tested positive for the virus.

State Health Minister E Rajender said in a release on Wednesday that samples of two persons have been sent to Pune for full confirmation with regard to COVID-19.

The two persons are among the 47 whose samples were tested at the State-run Gandhi hospital here on Tuesday. According to the Minister, 45 samples tested negative. The two persons are -- a foreigner who came from Italy and another who moved closely with the man who tested positive for the virus, he said. According to a police official, of the 21 buildings in the complex located in the IT corridor “only one building has been closed for sanitisation, that too it has not been entirely closed.”

Meanwhile, Vardhan held a meeting with Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain and civic body officials on Wednesday and urged them to augment facilities of isolation wards in city hospitals if more cases of coronavirus gets recorded.

“We have to work as a unit to combat the COVID-19 threat to the nation. A coordinated, collective effort in a mission mode is required,” he said at the meeting.

As part of the country’s preparedness for containing the spread of the disease, the Union Health Minister said that all the foreign nationals, and not just those from 12 countries listed earlier, will henceforth be screened for COVID-19 at 21 designated airports.

Addressing the media, he said the Government has adopted a cluster approach, as a part of which health authorities will check and sensitise every household within 3 km-radius of the house of the infected person, to prevent community spread of the virus.

Vardhan said that at present, 15 laboratories in India are conducting tests for coronavirus. Nineteen more laboratories are being established, he said, adding seven to eight labs started functioning on Tuesday and rest will be made operation by Wednesday.

Health Ministry officials said during contact tracing procedure, the Ministry’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) have identified 66 people who had come in contact with the Delhi man who have been tested positive for corona virus, while 88 people who had come in contact with the 24-year-old Hyderabad man have been identified.

Vardhan further said the Government intends to set up a laboratory in Iran so that Indians there can be tested for a possible exposure to novel coronavirus before being brought back. An estimated 1,200 Indians, mostly students and pilgrims, are in Iran currently.

While coronavirus infection is showing signs of receding in China with 38 new fatalities, taking total number of deaths to 2,981, in Iran, over 2,000 coronavirus cases and 77 deaths have been reported.

“If the Iranian Government lends its support, a testing facility could be set up there as well, so that Indians there can be tested before they can be brought back,” the Union Health Minister said.

One scientist from the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune has been sent to Iran while three more from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will leave at 4 pm on Wednesday to check the feasibility of setting up a laboratory there for conducting coronavirus test.

Responding to a question over shortage of masks across the country, the Union Health Minister said, “We have ensured that the export of N95 masks and personal protective equipment, etcetera, are banned and taken care of. The Ministry has taken adequate measures to ensure there is no scarcity of these.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/screening-for-all-global-fliers-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/screening-for-all-global-fliers.html
206,05-3-20,6 of 8 ‘poached’ MLAs return to support Nath,"BJP rejects toppling bid charge; MP CM says things under control, all MLAs will come back

Hours after Congress leaders accused the BJP of confining eight of its MLAs, including allies, to a hotel in Haryana as part of a conspiracy to topple the 14-month-old Madhya Pradesh Government, six of them returned to Bhopal on Wednesday evening.

Six legislators of the Congress, the BSP, the SP and independents accompanied by two Ministers, soon after reaching Bhopal, reached Chief Minister’s residence in the evening. However, Congress leaders claimed that four of their MLAs are still missing.

The Congress has alleged the BJP is making attempts to poach its MLAs in a bid to topple of the Kamal Nath Government, a charge denied by the Opposition party.

The MLAs were allegedly taken to a hotel in Manesar (Haryana), where State Ministers Jaivardhan Singh and Jitu Patwari accompanied by senior party leader Digvijay Singh had reached after midnight on Wednesday. They were not allowed to meet the legislators, but they managed to meet BSP MLA Rambai and took her with them to Bhopal.

Those who returned to Bhopal are: Congress’ Aidal Singh Kansana, Kamlesh Jatav and Ranveer Jatav, BSP’s Janjeev Kushwaha and Rambai, while SP’s Rajesh Shukla.

Those still missing are Surendra Shera, Bisahulal Singh, Hardeep Singh Dang and Raghuraj Kansana.

Meanwhile, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath told PTI, “Things are under control... The MLAs will come back”.

Interestingly, the Scindia camp Ministers did not reach CM House. However one of them, Pradyumn Singh Tomar speaking to the media extended support to the Kamal Nath Government but did not reply as why certain Ministers were not seen at CM House on their return to the State Capital. Scindia earlier had pleaded ignorance about the horse-trading episode as media had questioned him on this in Gwalior.

“Whistleblower” of the horse-trading controversy, senior Congress leaders Digvijay appeared before the media on Wednesday and said there is no threat to the Kamal Nath Government.

He again mounted charges on former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan saying Chouhan had hired two chartered planes to ferry MLAs out of Madhya Pradesh. According to Digvijay, four MLAs were taken to Bengaluru.

“The BJP is apprehensive of anti-mafia action initiated by the Nath Government and is engaging in such dirty tactics,” Congress MP media cell in-charge Shobha Oza said.

“We dare the BJP to have a floor test,” she added. She claimed that eight MLAs were taken out of the State and four have returned while remaining are still with the BJP. However, as the matter snowballed into major political controversy nationally, the BJP leaders switched to defensive.

BJP State head VD Sharma was the first to rebut horse trading charges saying the party wasn’t part of any such thing. “It’s their internal conflicts and leaders like Kamal Nath, Digvijay and Scindia should offer answers on this.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/6-of-8----poached----mlas--return-to-support-nath-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/6-of-8----poached----mlas--return-to-support-nath.html
207,05-3-20,"PM, Prez, BJP chief, Delhi CM won’t hold Holi Milan","Coronavirus spoils leaders’ plan; city riots stop Kejriwal

Looming coronavirus threat is all set to play spoilsport with Holi festivities. President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah and party president JP Nadda, on Wednesday said they would not attend any Holi Milan function in view of the coronavirus outbreak. Holi is on March 10.

Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday that he would not celebrate Holi in wake of communal violence in North-east Delhi.

In a tweet posted using the official Twitter handle of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, President Ram Nath Kovind said, “With alertness and safeguards, we all can help contain the outbreak of COVID-19. In a precautionary measure, the Rashtrapati Bhavan will not hold the traditional Holi Milan.

The Prime Minister too tweeted that he would not hold Holi Milan as experts have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of coronavirus.

“Experts across the world have advised to reduce mass gatherings to avoid the spread of COVID19. Hence this year, I have decided not to participate in any ‘Holi Milan’ programme,” Modi tweeted.

Following Modi’s announcement, Nadda, Shah and other senior party leaders also said they would not participate in any Holi Milan function due to concerns over spread of coronavirus.

“The world is battling COVID-19 novel coronavirus. The countries & medical fraternity are jointly making efforts to contain its spread. Keeping this in mind, this year, I will neither celebrate Holi nor organise Holi Milan. Stay safe, stay healthy,” Nadda tweeted.

According to sources, Nadda has written to all State unit presidents, asking them to avoid holding Holi Milan programmes as a precautionary measure.

Similarly Union Home Minister Shah urged the people to avoid public gatherings. “Holi is a very important festival for Indians but in the wake of coronavirus, I have decided not to participate in any Holi Milan this year. I also appeal everyone to avoid public gatherings and take good care of yourself and your family,” he said on Twitter.

208,05-3-20,"With no domestic takers, Govt OK’s NRIs to buy Maharaja","Non-Resident Indians can now own 100% stake in Air India as Centre removes 49% limit clause

With no domestic buyers in sight even after months of aggressive hawking, the Government has now decided to allow Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) to acquire total stake in the national carrier Air India.

The Union Cabinet on Wednesday changed the rules for the sale of Air India by permitting NRIs to control up to 100 per cent stake as against the earlier limit of 49 per cent. The decision comes at a time when the Government has invited preliminary bids for selling the “Maharaja” lock stock and barrel.

However, foreign investments in the national carrier, including that of foreign airlines, shall not exceed 49 per cent, either directly or indirectly, an official statement said.

It said the condition that substantial ownership and effective control of Air India shall continue to be vested in Indian nationals.

Addressing media on the issue, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “Today’s decision on Air India is one milestone decision.” The airline will come under private hands but it will continue to provide services to passengers and it would also increase investment opportunities, he said, without explaining much details of present status of the situation.

“To permit foreign investment up to 100 per cent by those NRIs, who are Indian nationals, in case of Air India Ltd, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has approved to amend the extant FDI policy,” the statement said.

It said in light of the proposed strategic disinvestment of 100 per cent of Air India, it has been decided that foreign investment in the national carrier be brought on a level playing field with other scheduled airline operators.

The amendment “are meant to liberalise and simplify the FDI policy to provide ease of doing business in the country,” it said, adding it would lead to largest FDI inflows and thereby contributing to growth of investment, income and employment.

Allowing 100 per cent investment by NRIs in the carrier would also not be in violation of Substantial Ownership and Effective Control (SOEC) norms. NRI investments would be treated as domestic investments. Under the SOEC framework, which is followed in the airline industry globally, a carrier that flies overseas from a particular country should be substantially owned by that country’s Government or its nationals.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/with-no-domestic-takers--govt-ok---s-nris-to-buy-maharaja-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/with-no-domestic-takers--govt-ok---s-nris-to-buy-maharaja.html
209,05-3-20,SC refuses to allow Delhi violence victim to intervene in hate speech case of activist Harsh Mander,"The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to allow a victim of the recent Delhi violence to intervene in a matter in which the Centre has raised the issue of alleged hate speeches by activist Harsh Mander during anti-CAA protests.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde and said the riot victim wanted to intervene in the Harsh Mander case, which is scheduled to be heard on Friday.

""We will not allow you to intervene,"" Bobde told the advocate.

Gonsalves said he had seen the video of an alleged hate speech by Mander and wanted to place it on record.

""We had asked the solicitor general to put it (video of alleged hate speech by Mander) on record. We don't need you in that proceeding,"" the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said.

When Gonsalves said he had appeared for Mander before the high court in the Delhi violence matter, the bench said, ""You can appear for him here also.""

The Delhi Police had on Wednesday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court against Mander and sought initiation of contempt proceedings against him for alleged ""derogatory remarks"" making insinuations against the apex court and its judges.

The affidavit was filed after the Centre's allegation before the Supreme Court that Mander, who has sought registering of FIRs against some BJP leaders for their alleged hate speeches that purportedly led to the violence in Delhi, himself had made certain objectionable remarks against the top court, ""majesty of law"", the government and Parliament.

The Supreme Court had taken strong note of the Centre's allegations and not only refused to hear Mander's counsel Karuna Nundy till the issue of his alleged hate speech is ""sorted"", but also kept his petition to itself while transferring other pleas related to the violence to the Delhi High Court.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta had referred to some of the alleged hate speeches delivered by Mander during the anti-CAA protests and at the Jamia Millia Islamia on December 16 last year.

He had read out in court certain excerpts from alleged speeches of Mander and said they included objectionable statements about the apex court, Parliament and the government.

The apex court, in May least year, had come down heavily on Mander for seeking recusal of the then CJI from hearing his PIL saying it would not allow anybody to ""browbeat"" and ""damage the institution"".

The then CJI Ranjan Gogoi had struck off Mander's name as the petitioner and had rather appointed his lawyer Prashant Bhushan as the amicus curiae in the case.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sc-refuses-to-allow-delhi-violence-victim-to-intervene-in-hate-speech-case-of-activist-harsh-mander-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/sc-refuses-to-allow-delhi-violence-victim-to-intervene-in-hate-speech-case-of-activist-harsh-mander.html
210,05-3-20,EPFO cuts interest rate on deposits to 8.5 pc for 2019-20,"Retirement fund body EPFO on Thursday lowered interest rate on provident fund deposits to 8.5 per cent for the current financial year, said Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar on Thursday.

The EPFO had provided 8.65 per cent rate of interest on EPF for 2018-19 to its around six crore subscribers. The decision was taken at a meeting of the the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation's (EPFO) apex decision making body -- the Central Board of Trustee.

""The EPFO has decided to provide 8.5 per cent interest rate on EPF deposits for 2019-20 in the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) meeting today,"" Gangwar told reporters after the meeting here.

Now, the labour ministry requires the finance ministry's concurrence on the matter. Since the Government of India is the guarantor, the finance ministry has to vet the proposal for EPF interest rate to avoid any liability on account of shortfall in the EPFO income for a fiscal.

212,05-3-20,Nirbhaya case: Delhi court fixes Mar 20 as date of execution of 4 convicts,"New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) After three postponements in six weeks, a Delhi court on Thursday set March 20 as the fresh date for the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case that has witnessed several twists and turns after they received the death sentence in 2013.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana directed that Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) ""be hanged by the neck until they are dead on March 20 at 5.30 am"". All the convicts in the case are to be hanged together in Tihar jail here.

The order was pronounced after the lawyers for the Delhi government and the convicts submitted that the condemned prisoners have exhausted all their legal remedies.

A P Singh, the lawyer for the convicts, conceded that there was no legal impediment for the court in proceeding to fix the execution date.

""It is fairly conceded at bar by counsel of convict as well as public prosecutor (appearing for the State) that as of now, there is statutory no bar in exercise of power under 413/414 (issuing death warrant) of the CrPC, rather it is obligatory on the part of the court to discharge the duties cast upon it under the relevant provisions.

""In view of the same, it is directed that convicts shall be hanged by the neck until they are dead on March 20 at 6 am,"" the court said.

Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said their struggle would continue till the time they are hanged and hoped that March 20 will be the final date of hanging.

""The morning of March 20 will be the morning of our lives,"" Devi told reporters.

She also said that if there is any chance, she would want to see the convicts dying.

""While dying Nirbhaya asked to ensure they get such punishment that such crime is not repeated ever. If there is any chance, I would like to see them die.""

The new date for the hanging was fixed even as the Supreme Court said it would examine on March 23 the legal issue arising out of the Nirbhaya case on whether there could be separate hanging in a common crime where there are more than one death row convicts.

""The question is whether there can be separate hanging or whether it has to be simultaneous. We will go into it,"" said a three-judge bench headed by Justice R Banumathi against the backdrop of the contention by the Centre that the hanging of convicts for a common crime can be carried out separately as and when each one exhaust their legal remedies.

The move by the apex court is not expected to have any bearing on the execution of the four death row convicts on March 20 since they have exhausted all legal remedies.

The apex court was hearing an appeal filed by the Centre and the Delhi government challenging the February 5 order of Delhi High Court which said that the four Nirbhaya case convicts have to be executed simultaneously.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre and Delhi government, told the bench that these convicts have taken justice delivery system for ""a ride"" and made a ""mockery"" of it by adopting delaying tactics.

Mehta, who said ""credibility of the system is at stake"", informed the bench that a trial court has fixed March 20 as the date of execution of the four convicts who have exhausted all their legal remedies.

Taking note of the submission, the bench, also comprising justices Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna, posted the plea for arguments on merits on March 23 and made it clear that no adjournment would be given.

During the arguments, Mehta said there was no statutory provision which stipulates that convicts have to be executed simultaneously and as per the law, only trial of a case has to be conducted simultaneously.

""Today, there are four convicts in this case. Tomorrow, there may be a case having 10 or 20 such convicts and they may again delay the execution by moving separate forums at different time,"" he said, referring to the tactics adopted by the convicts in the Nirbhaya case.

Mehta said pleas filed by Mukesh and Vinay against rejection of their mercy petitions by the President has already been dismissed by the apex court.

""For Mukesh and Vinay, we should be permitted to execute them. There is no need to give any further time to them,"" he said, adding, ""This is not our anxiety to hang somebody. Nobody likes this. Our anxiety is that credibility of the system is at stake"".

He said the two other convicts -- Akshay and Pawan -- will now file pleas in the top court challenging rejection of their mercy petitions and in this scenario, the authorities should be allowed to execute Mukesh and Vinay.

""It is de-humanising to keep them under such threat,"" Mehta said.

When the bench said it would hear the matter on merits on March 23, Mehta said, ""These convicts have taken the system for a ride. Please say that whosoever of them want to file for whatsoever remedy, they should do it before March 20"".

To this, the bench said, ""We will not say this. We will hear the matter on March 23"".

The first date of execution--January 22--fixed on January 7 was postponed by the court to February 1. But on January 31, the court indefinitely postponed the hanging. On February 17, the court again issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 but just one day before it was deferred till further orders.

A city court on September 13, 2013 awarded the death sentence to the four convicts, less than one year after the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Review petitions and curative petitions were then filed in a staggered manner in the Supreme Court against the Delhi High Court order on March 13, 2014 confirming the death sentence.

The last option of mercy petition before the President to escape the gallows was also exercised by the convicts one by one but they all stand dismissed.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nirbhaya-case--delhi-court-fixes-mar-20-as-date-of-execution-of-4-convicts-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/nirbhaya-case--delhi-court-fixes-mar-20-as-date-of-execution-of-4-convicts.html
213,05-3-20,"Delhi violence: Court dismisses Thair's plea to surrender, police arrests him","New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) Absconding AAP councillor Tahir Hussain was arrested by Delhi Police on Thursday after a court here dismissed his plea seeking to surrender before it in connection with alleged killing of Intelligence Bureau (IB) official Ankit Sharma during the recent violence in northeast Delhi.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja refused to entertain Hussain's plea saying that the relief sought by him was outside the court's jurisdiction.

The court said that as per the provisions of 177 Criminal Procedure Code (Ordinary place of inquiry and trial), the offence shall ordinarily be inquired into and tried by court within whose local jurisdiction it is committed.

""In the instant case, the offence has been committed within the jurisdiction of PS Dayalpur which falls within the jurisdiction of Karkardooma Court. The reason given in the application for moving this application does not justify the conduct of the applicant to choose this forum for seeking the reliefs,"" the judge said.

Advocate Mukesh Kalia, appearing for Hussain, submitted that there is a grave apprehension of threat to his life and therefore he has not surrendered before competent court as there is ""charged environment"" in Karkardooma District court.

He said Hussain has no connection or involvement in the FIR registered by the police and he is being falsely implicated.

Considering the gravity of the situation, Hussain wishes to surrender before the court, he said.

The court said the Delhi High Court has specifically made a division of the jurisdictions, be that of the police stations or the courts district-wise and work has been allocated accordingly.

It said: ""This court is a special designated court dealing with the matters of MPs/MLAs. The high court has designated this court as special court to deal with cases on fast track with endeavour to dispose of the same within one year as its objective.

""The applicant does not fall in the aforesaid category, hence this application cannot be even entertained by this court.""

The court further said that the relief sought by Hussain does not fall within the domain or jurisdiction of this court, ""hence, no such relief can be granted. In view of the observations, the application deserves to be dismissed"".

As the court dismissed Hussain's plea, a Delhi Police team, which had already arrived, arrested him and took him into custody.

Hussain moved the surrender application before the court saying that he was willing to join the investigation and wanted to surrender in the case.

Hussain has been booked in the murder case of the IB staffer in northeast Delhi amid violence over the new citizenship law last week.

Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) had then suspended him for alleged involvement in the violence which has left at least 42 people dead and around 200 injured.

The family of Sharma (26), who was found dead in a drain near his home in northeast Delhi's riot-hit Chand Bagh area, has accused Hussain of being behind the killing.

On the complaint of Sharma's father, the police registered an FIR against Hussain, who has rejected the charge. Communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi four days ago after violence between anti-and-pro-Citizenship (Amendment) Act groups spiralled out of control.

215,05-3-20,India-EU summit to be rescheduled in wake of coronavirus: MEA,"The India-EU summit which was slated to be held later this month will now be rescheduled in view of the coronavirus outbreak, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday.

India and EU decided to reschedule Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Brussels in view of the advice by health authorities in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

He also said no case of any Indian being affected by coronavirus in Iran has emerged.

Indian embassies across world are on the job to help Indians, he said as several countries grapple with the outbreak of the deadly virus.

On criticism by global bodies over the violence in the national capital, Kumar said the situation in Delhi is fast returning to normal and law enforcement agencies are doing their best.

Asked about critical comments by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Delhi violence, he said these were driven by his political agenda.

To a separate question on the US-Afghan peace deal, he said India will continue to extend all support to Afghanistan for its overall development.

He also said that India has conveyed its concerns to China over the seizure of an autoclave from a Pakistan-bound Chinese ship by Indian authorities at Kandla port.

216,05-3-20,"Nirbhaya rapists’ legal remedies exhausted, Delhi Govt seeks death warrant","After President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the last remaining mercy plea of Pawan Kumar Gupta, one of the four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, the Delhi Government on Wednesday moved a city court seeking a fresh date for execution of the four convicts.

According to Delhi Prison Rules, a 14-day period has to be given to a death-row convict after the dismissal of a clemency plea before the prisoner can be hanged. All the four are to be hanged together.

A Union Home Ministry official said President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petition of 25-year-old Pawan Kumar Gupta.

The Delhi Government told Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana that all legal remedies of the convicts have been exhausted and nothing survives now. The judge then directed the convicts to file their response by Thursday even as the prosecution said no notice was required.

While issuing the notice, the court said principles of natural justice are part of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of the Constitution and the sacrosanct principle of “Audi alteram partem” (listen to the other side) cannot be ignored.

The hanging of Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) besides Pawan previously scheduled for March 3 was deferred for the third time in six weeks by the court on Monday in yet another twist in the case marked by apparent delaying tactics by the condemned prisoners. The President has already rejected the mercy petitions of Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay.

The court on Monday postponed the hanging till further orders.

Nirbhaya’s father expressed the hope that the convicts will be hanged this month. “Pawan has one option left -- that is to challenge the mercy plea in Supreme Court as the others have done. Let’s see what happens next, but we are confident of getting justice,” said Nirbhaya’s father adding that he is hopeful that the convicts will be hanged this month and justice will be finally delivered after a long wait.

The first date of execution--January 22--fixed on January 7 was postponed by the court to February 1. But on January 31, the court indefinitely postponed the hanging. On February 17, the court again issued fresh date for execution of death warrants for March 3 at 6 am.

The Delhi High Court, meanwhile, declined to entertain a plea seeking directions to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to intervene and enquire into the mental and physical state of the four death row convicts.

A Bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said the petition was not maintainable as it should have been first filed before the NHRC.

Asking the petitioner to move the NHRC, the Bench disposed of his plea.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.

The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

The case has witnessed a series of twists and turns right after a Delhi court on September 13, 2013 awarded the death sentence to the four convicts, less than one year after the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi.

218,05-3-20,"In Italy and beyond, virus outbreak reshapes work and play","Italy closed all schools and universities and barred fans from all sporting events for the next few weeks, as governments trying to curb the spread of the coronavirus around the world resorted to increasingly sweeping measures that transformed the way people work, shop, pray and amuse themselves.

With the virus present in more than 80 countries, Saudi Arabia barred citizens from making the Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, Iran cancelled Friday prayers for a second week, and leader after leader pleaded with citizens to put an end to that traditional symbol of mutual trust, the handshake.

The Italian government decreed that soccer games and other sporting events will take place without spectators until at least April 3. Italy is the epicentre of Europe's coronavirus outbreak. More than 3,000 have been infected and at least 107 have died, the most of any country outside China, where the illness began.

Italy also closed schools for 8.4 million students through March 15, after at least four other countries — Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon and Iraq — took similar action.

""I know it's a decision with an impact. As education minister, I obviously want my students back in school as soon as possible,"" said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina.

Italy, Iran and South Korea confronted fast-growing clusters of the disease that accounted for about 80 per cent of new cases outside China, according to the World Health Organisation. In all, more than 95,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, with more than 3,200 deaths.

In the United States, the death toll reached 11.

Iran reported 92 deaths among its more than 2,900 cases, though many fear the outbreak is far bigger. Among the ill are dozens of members of the government. The Islamic republic cancelled Friday prayers to avoid public gatherings.

""The virus has no wings to fly,"" said Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour. ""We are the ones who transfer it to each other.""

WHO said about 3.4 per cent of people infected with the COVID-19 virus globally have died, making it more lethal than the common flu. But that figure was met with skepticism, with scientists noting that large numbers of mild cases have probably gone undetected or unreported.

A study last week in the New England Journal of Medicine of data from more than 30 Chinese provinces estimated the death rate at 1.4 per cent.

In Daegu, the South Korean city at the centre of that country's outbreak, a shortage of hospital space meant about 2,300 patients were being cared for in other facilities while they awaited a hospital bed.

Prime Minister Chung Se-Kyun sought to assure people in the southeastern city, saying, ""We will win the war against COVID-19.""

South Korea reported 145 new infections on Thursday, raising its total to 5,766, second-highest in the world.

In Europe, officials told French soccer players to simply disperse — without shaking hands — after lining up, and referees and coaches will no longer shake hands either.

In Paris, the Louvre finally reopened after closing because of fears among workers about catching the virus from visitors, but it will no longer accept cash, because of the danger of germs.

A news conference at Milan's Triennale contemporary art and design museum looked like an exhibit itself, with journalists' chairs spaced more than a yard (metre) apart.

In Israel, the country's chief rabbi urged observant Jews to refrain from kissing the mezuza, the small box containing a prayer scroll that is posted by Jews on their doorposts. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also urged people to adopt the Indian greeting of ""namaste"", with hands together, rather than a handshake.

Businesses of all types suffered a downturn as travel and tourism plummeted and worried consumers changed their habits.

""People are afraid to touch anything or take anything from us,"" said Maedeh Jahangiri, a perfume seller at a mall in Tehran.

China reported 139 new cases Thursday and 31 deaths, raising its totals to 80,409 cases and 3,012 deaths. The number of cases was higher than Wednesday's figure, but new deaths were lower, as the illness continues to decline in the country.

While hardest-hit Hubei province had most of the new cases and deaths, hospitals there released another 1,923 patients who were declared cured.

Doctors working in Wuhan, Hubei's capital where the illness emerged in December, said hospitals there have an increasing number of empty beds but cautioned a new spike of infections was always possible.

The Daily Mail reported that the ship had previously carried two passengers who contracted coronavirus and one among them died. Currently at least 20 people on the ship have been reported ill. The ship is carrying around 2,500 passengers and normally has around 1,150 crew members, according to npr.org.

The ship was returning to San Francisco from a voyage to Hawaii amid the suspected coronavirus outbreak, the report said.

Two passengers who had travelled on the same ship on a previous voyage last month between San Francisco and Mexico later fell ill and tested positive for the coronavirus. One of the infected two was a 71-year-old man who died on Wednesday. It is California's first fatality from the disease.

The second person is currently in hospital and is said to be ""gravely ill"", Daily Mail reported.

Eleven passengers and 10 crew members who are currently on the same ship have now reported symptoms that could turn out to be the coronavirus, seasonal flu or the common cold.

It is not clear if the 21 people currently reporting symptoms are among the 62 who were on the Mexico leg of the trip and came in contact with the two infected passengers.

Since the outbreak of the disease, globally, more than 92,000 people have tested positive and 3,100 have died so far. In China, the epicentre of the infection death toll due to the novel coronavirus increased to 3,012 with a total of 80,409 confirmed cases on Thursday.

The US has so far reported around 160 confirmed cases of coronavirus infection and according to USA Today, around 30 of them are in California.

220,05-3-20,"Sengar, cops convicted of custodial death of Unnao rape victim’s dad","Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and seven others, including policemen, were on Wednesday found guilty by a Delhi court for the custodial death of Unnao rape survivor’s father. District judge Dharmesh Sharma convicted them of culpable homicide, not amounting to murder.

The court said the accused had no intention of killing him, “however, they beat up the victim in a brutal manner that led to his death.” The judge also criminated the role of doctors who were entrusted to take of the rape victim’s father, saying “doctors at the district hospital were negligent and acted like butchers”.

Judge Sharma also said the facts and circumstances brought on the record prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused hatched another crucial part of the conspiracy to foist a false case upon the victim by planting a country-made gun and four cartridges.

The court said the accused — Ashok Singh Bhadauria, KP Singh (both policemen), Kuldeep Singh Sengar, Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh, Shashi Pratap Singh, Suman Singh and Atul (Sengar’s brother) —are held guilty of committing offence under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy).

The court also held the convicted the accused under a section of Arms Act. While convicting Makhi police station in-charge, Ashok Singh Bhadauria, and Sub Inspector, KP Singh, the court said that “being seasoned police officials, disobeyed the direction of law to protect the life and liberty of the victim when he, as well as Kishore Kumar Mishra, was being beaten up by the co-accused persons… They allowed the assailants their protective police cover affording them a free hand to do what they did… ultimately the victim died due to the injuries sustained in the incident.”

The court, however, acquitted other accused persons --- constable Amir Khan, Shailendra Singh, Ram Sharan Singh and Sharadveer Singh --- giving them benefit of doubt. The court said, “It is apparent that too many persons behind the curtains were supporting, assisting or abetting the gruesome act but then each one cannot be held culpable as per law on mere suspicion.”

It had on December 20 sent Sengar to jail for the “remainder of his natural biological life” for raping the woman in 2017, when she was a minor.

The CBI had examined 55 witnesses in support of the case and the defence examined nine witnesses. The court had recorded the statements of the rape victim’s uncle, mother, sister and one of her father’s colleague who claimed to be an eyewitness to the incident.

According to the CBI, on April 3, 2018, there was an altercation between the rape victim’s father and one Shashi Pratap Singh. The chargesheet filed on July 13, 2018, said the victim’s father and his co-worker were returning to their village, Makhi, when they asked Singh for a lift. Singh denied them the lift, triggering an altercation among them. Singh called his associates, following which Kuldeep’s brother Atul Singh Sengar reached the spot along with others and beat up the woman’s father and his co-worker.

The woman’s father was subsequently taken to the police station by them where an FIR was lodged against him and he was arrested. The chargesheet said that all this while Kuldeep Sengar was in touch with the district police superintendent and Makhi police station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria. Later he also spoke to the doctor who examined the rape victim’s father.

Charges were framed against Kuldeep, Atul, Bhadauria, sub-inspector Kamta Prasad, constable Amir Khan and six others in the case. The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1 last year.

In July, 2019 a truck rammed into the car the rape victim was travelling in with some family members and her lawyer. Two of her aunts died in the incident. She was airlifted from a hospital in Lucknow and to AIIMS in Delhi.

The victim has been provided accommodation in Delhi and is under CRPF protection.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/sengar--cops-convicted-of-custodial-death-of-unnao-rape-victim---s-dad-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/sengar--cops-convicted-of-custodial-death-of-unnao-rape-victim---s-dad.html

""My parents are actors, but I don't think I have been grown up in the family of stars. Father, for instance, has always been very particular about education and my mother is the flagbearer of humility. She so believes putting your head down and letting your work speak for yourself,"" Sara said.

""I never had much exposure to Bollywood. I don't really think I come from a family of stars. I don't look at myself as a star,"" added the daughter of actors Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh.

Looking back at her growing up years, she said: ""I was a mischievous student in school who played pranks on everyone. One of the pranks I remember was dropping glue on the fan blades which spilled all over the class when switched on. I almost got suspended for this because my principal kept asking why I did this, and I had no answer to it.""

Asked about her equation with wife of Saif and actress Kareena Kapoor, Sara replied: ""I admire Kareena Kapoor and her work. She's a professional who always gives preference to work. Her style of working is something I would want to imbibe from her.""

225,05-3-20,"India hits out at Erdogan, British minister for 'irresponsible' comments over Delhi violence","India on Thursday hit out at Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the UK's junior foreign minister Nigel Adams for their ""irresponsible"" comments over violence in the national capital when it is going through a ""sensitive time"".

External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Erdogan's comments were ""factually inaccurate"" and driven by his ""political agenda"".

Last week, the Turkish president had severely criticised India for the communal clashes in Delhi and even went on to call them ""massacres of Muslims"".

Kumar said India had made a strong demarche on the matter with the Turkish Ambassador in Delhi on Tuesday.

""The comments are factually inaccurate and are driven by his political agenda. We do not expect such irresponsible statements from a Head of State,"" Kumar said.

On the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights approaching the Supreme Court against the citizenship amendment law, Kumar said it is now for the top court to decide on the issue.

Asked about comments by Adams on the violence in Delhi, Kumar said the situation in the capital is fast returning to normal and that law enforcement agencies are doing their best to restore confidence and ensure that law and order is maintained.

""Prime Minister has appealed for peace and brotherhood. Senior officials have visited the place of violence, peace committees have been formed and other steps have been taken in this direction,"" he said.

""At this sensitive time, we would urge people not to make any irresponsible comments and not to be influenced by selective and unsubstantiated narrative on the matter,"" he said.

On Wednesday, Adams, the UK's Minister of State in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), said the British government is concerned over the potential impact of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India.

His response came following an urgent question on recent violence in India by Pakistani-origin Opposition Labour Party MP Khalid Mahmood in the House of Commons.

The national capital witnessed horrific violence last week following clashes between supporters and those opposing CAA. According to authorities, at least 42 people were killed in the violence.

There have been massive protests across India in the last two months over the new law with the opposition parties and rights groups terming it as violative of founding principles of the Constitution.

Rejecting the criticism, the government has been accusing the opposition parties of misleading people on the law for political gains.

The new law provides for granting citizenship to non-Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who were victims of religious persecution.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-hits-out-at-erdogan--british-minister-for--irresponsible--comments-over-delhi-violence-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/india-hits-out-at-erdogan--british-minister-for--irresponsible--comments-over-delhi-violence.html

227,05-3-20,Venezuela's president urges all women to have 6 children,"President Nicolás Maduro wants Venezuelan women to have many children as a way to boost the country, which has seen millions of people flee in recent years to escape its economic crisis.

Maduro made the exhortation during a televised event Tuesday evening for a government program promoting various birth methods.

“God bless you for giving the country six little boys and girls,” the socialist president told a woman at the event. “To give birth, then, to give birth, all women to have six children, all. Let the homeland grow!” The comments drew criticism from human rights activists and others who noted Venezuelans already are struggling to provide food, clothes and health care for their families.

""It is irresponsible, on the part of a president of the Republic, to encourage women to have six children simply to make a homeland, when there is a homeland that does not guarantee children their lives,"" said Oscar Misle, founder of CECODAP, a group that defends the rights of young people.

The country's economic collapse, coupled with its deep political divisions, led more than 4.5 million Venezuelans to emigrate since 2015, according to the United Nations.

The U.N. World Food Program also recently said that 9.3 million people — nearly one-third of Venezuela's population — are unable to meet their basic dietary needs.

""You have to be very cynical to ask that we have six children,"" said Magdalena de Machado, a housewife picking through scraggly vegetables at a street market in the center of Caracas for making soup for her sons, ages 2 and 4.

""Only two days a week we can serve some meat and chicken. For years we were late having children. We had them when we thought we were better off, but in the last year we've been buying less and less food,"" she said.

De Machado and others also questioned how women could be expected to increase births amid the deterioration in the country's health care, both for adults and children.

A report by Humans Rights Watch in collaboration with the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health concluded last year that the health system in Venezuela has ""totally collapsed."" Among other problems, it cited rising levels of maternal and child mortality as well as the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/venezuela-s-president-urges-all-women-to-have-6-children-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/venezuela-s-president-urges-all-women-to-have-6-children.html

The total stood at 5,766, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, with 35 deaths.

So far 36 countries and regions have imposed a blanket entry ban on people who have recently been in the South, according to the foreign ministry in Seoul.

Nearly 90 percent of the national total come from the southern city of Daegu -- with more than 4,300 cases confirmed there -- and the neighbouring North Gyeongsang province.

The outbreak in the city of 2.5 million among Shincheonji members began with a 61-year-old woman, who developed symptoms on February 10 and attended at least four services in the city.

The government proposed an extra budget of 11.7 trillion won ($9.9 billion) on Wednesday to address the epidemic's impact and improve the country's infectious disease prevention system.

It is part of a 30-trillion-won ($25-billion) package President Moon Jae-in announced Tuesday to address the ""grave"" situation brought on by the outbreak in the world's 12th-largest economy.

229,05-3-20,Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar dead at 100,"Former UN chief Javier Perez de Cuellar, who was known for his peace-making efforts including brokering a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war, died Wednesday in his native Peru, aged 100, his son said.

Perez de Cuellar served as UN secretary general from 1981 to 1991, when he was often described as a ""pacifist by vocation and nature.""

Lauded by his countrymen as one of the most illustrious Peruvians of his era, Perez de Cuellar led the United Nations through a period marked by the fight against world hunger, the eight-year war between Iran and Iraq, as well as the civil war in US-supported El Salvador which led to UN-mediated peace talks.

""My dad died after a complicated week. He died at 8:09 pm tonight (0109 GMT Thursday) and is resting in peace,"" his son Francisco Perez de Cuellar told RPP radio.

Perez de Cuellar was known for his efforts to reconcile warring parties.

He considered the 1990 independence of Namibia, one of the last colonial enclaves on the African continent, his greatest accomplishment as secretary general.

Perez de Cuellar's popularity prompted him to accept the presidential nomination from one of Peru's leading political parties -- the Union for Peru -- in 1995, which pitted him against then-incumbent president Alberto Fujimori.

The unifying force behind the Union for Peru, Perez de Cuellar won only 21.8 per cent of the vote, coming in second behind Fujimori who got 64.4 per cent.

In 1997, informants revealed that Perez de Cuellar had been subject to systematic surveillance and phone tapping during the campaign, ordered by the head of Fujimori's intelligence services, Vladimiro Montesinos.

Following the collapse of the Fujimori regime in November 2000, Perez de Cuellar was appointed head of a government of ""unity and national reconciliation.""

As prime minister, he helped expose a web of corruption woven by Montesinos over the course of Fujimori's 10-year rule.

After the election of President Alejandro Toledo in 2001, Perez de Cuellar was appointed ambassador to France.

Born into an upper middle-class family in Lima and educated in Catholic schools, Perez de Cuellar spent most of his professional life outside his homeland, in diplomatic posts in Britain, Bolivia, Poland, the former Soviet Union, Switzerland and Venezuela.

He was president of the UN Security Council from 1973 to 1974 and was UN permanent representative in Cyprus from 1975 to 1977.

The career diplomat's son and daughter are from his first marriage, along with six grandchildren. He and his second wife, Marcela Temple, had no children.

A lawyer by education, Perez de Cuellar received honorary doctorates from nearly 40 universities around the world.

Antonio Guterres, who currently heads the UN, wished him ""with pride & joy"" a happy 100th birthday on January 19.

""On this momentous occasion, we at the UN draw on his example for inspiration & are deeply grateful for his many contributions and achievements as Secretary-General,"" Guterres wrote on Twitter.

Perez de Cuellar's remains will lie at the Peruvian foreign ministry before burial on Friday, his son said.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/former-un-chief-javier-perez-de-cuellar-dead-at-100-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/former-un-chief-javier-perez-de-cuellar-dead-at-100.html

After arduous efforts throughout the country, the current situation of the epidemic prevention and control has continued to improve, and production and people's living have been recovering, Xi said in a meeting of the Political Bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) on Wednesday here.

He called for more efforts to accelerate the establishment of an economic and social order that is compatible with the prevention and control work of the epidemic, so as to consolidate and expand this hard-won good momentum and create condition to build a moderately well-off society in all respects, and completely eliminate absolute poverty, state-run CGTN reported.

The epidemic prevention and control work remains tough in Hubei province and Wuhan city, and the risk of the epidemic spreading is increasing due to increased movement of people and gatherings in other regions, he pointed out.

He asked relevant authorities to deepen global cooperation and play China's role as a responsible major country.

It is imperative to promptly advance various tasks of economic and social development, orderly promote the resumption of work and production, realise the orderly flow of people and property, the connection of production, supply and marketing, and the effective integration of domestic and foreign trade, and minimise the loss caused by the epidemic, Xi said.

The CPC meeting highlighted the importance of the COVID-19 prevention and control work in Beijing and called for more efforts in preventing the situation from rebounding.

The meeting also urged more scientific research into test kits, vaccines and medical supplies.

By the end of Wednesday, there have been 12,600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus outside China, with over 214 deaths, statistics from the World Health Organisation showed Thursday.

231,05-3-20,"Kajol: Give me three scenes, I can create magic","She ruled hearts with her celebrated roles in ""Baazigar"", ""Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge"", ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..."", ""My Name Is Khan"" among several others. From being the Bollywood heroine who broke all stereotypes of image to become a superstar, Kajol also marks a huge change in her digital debut with the short film ""Devi"", where she shares screen space with nine other actresses. She says she is at a point in her career where impact of the character matters more than length of the role.



In a three-decade mainstream career in Bollywood, she has proved herself as an actor and a star time and again. What does she look for in a script now? ""The magic,"" she replied. ""Give me three scenes and I can create magic. I do not need a title role where all I have is the title, a poster and, in the whole film, I am furniture. If you look at my career and choice of roles, I have always done something where the character has an emotional graph, something substantial. I want to create a memory in the mind of the audience through the characters I portray. That is precisely the reason I keep saying that I have to like the script. If the character I am offered is not impacting me how will it impact the audience? So, if you think I am choosy, I would say, I am living the life of an artist that I have earned through years of hard work,"" Kajol added, while speaking to IANS.

Starting her career in 1992 with ""Bekhudi"", Kajol has bagged numerous popular awards and also proved her versatility with a variety of roles. She was equally impressive as the murdered Isha Diwan in the whodunit ""Gupt"" and the tomboy-turned-glam girl in ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"". She excelled as the mother who lost her only child in religious hatred in ""My Name Is Khan"", and she exuded effortless ease playing twin siblings of diametrically opposite nature in ""Dushman"". Indeed, there is hardly any experimentation that she is scared to try out.

Does success gave her confidence to do so? ""Success surely gives you confidence, and financial independence also gives you the courage to live life on your own terms. But I have to mention that my idea of success is not just about earning fame and money. I know people who are successful by the definition of society but they are turning out to become people who suffocate in their own image. For me, I have to become the person I like in the first place. After a point, fame and money become inconsequential,"" replied the actress.

She added: ""I feel I am successful not because of the fame and money but because of the individual I have become. The family I have, my kids, my husband, my choice of films -– success is a combination of everything to me.""

Asked about if her criteria of choosing a film have changed, Kajol replied: ""My choices of films are the reflection of what I believe in. That is how I can be honest with my choices as a performing artist. I know there are some mitigating circumstances under which one has to do a film. Having said that, I am practising my choice because I am not working just to earn money. I rather earned this luxury through my body of work in the nineties. I am fortunate to have that financial freedom that many artists do not have, so I might as well utilise it to be a part of narratives that are thought-provoking.""",entertainment,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/kajol--give-me-three-scenes--i-can-create-magic-2020-03-05.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/entertainment/kajol--give-me-three-scenes--i-can-create-magic.html
