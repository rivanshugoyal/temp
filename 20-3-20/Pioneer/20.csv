0,20-3-20,Continuous R&D must,"The last decades have seen myriad vaccines in progress trailing off after outbreaks of diseases which were Coronavirus cousins, like the SARS and the MERS, fizzled out

When the new Coronavirus genome sequence was posted on an online databank in January, scientists in several biotechnology laboratories around the globe saw its close similarity to the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus and thereby several teams started work on vaccine development. Internationally, experts are of the opinion that the world will “need the vaccines” to contain the current pandemic as it is very possible that this outbreak will not just fizzle out (considering its epidemiology and pattern) like the outbreaks of the last few decades but could return. In fact, it could come back with a vengeance (with mutations and antigenic shifts and drifts).

Large pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, as well as comparatively lesser-known biotechnology firms like Gilead, Regeneron, Inovio and Moderna, are pursuing vaccines and chemicals to fight the Coronavirus and the estimate is that at least 40 other biotechnology companies, small and big, are on one or the other research and development (R&D) mission for a vaccine or a drug to save the world at this time of a crisis. During the SARS pandemic, a research team at Boston was able to secure investments and thereby work progressed to clinical trials. The team, in all likelihood, could have accomplished all the phase trials for vaccine development. And had that been done during the 2002-2003 epidemic, we could have potentially been equipped with a vaccine to use in China in the initial days of the outbreak. This could have saved the world from the current pandemic and its resultant fallouts.

""This is the problem with the whole vaccine infrastructure, it is reactive and not enough anticipatory. Oh, SARS is gone now, let’s forget the fight we were on and just move on to other projects”, says one of the prominent scientists from the biotechnology industry.

The last decades have seen myriad vaccine R&D work in progress trailing off after outbreaks of infectious diseases which were Coronavirus cousins, like the SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), fizzled out. Whenever a “mysterious” new illness emerges and public alarm is at its peak, there’s a race to develop a way to prevent or treat the disease. But by the time a promising candidate is ready, it’s often too late and the outbreak is on the wane. The world has seen this happen with the outbreaks of Zika, Ebola, SARS, MERS interspersed between epidemics of H5N1 and H7N9 avian, swine and H1N1 influenza.

The reasons for such incomplete work are varied — the potential patient pool for clinical trials dries up once an infectious outbreak subsides and the pool of medical customers for a drug also disappears as an epidemic disappears quite unpredictably, offering little chance to recover an investment of what could be hundreds of millions of dollars. Currently, various R&D works have been going on in parallel. The one at the most advanced stage is at its first human trial in Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle, where four patients received jabs — the first being a 43-year-old mother of two. This vaccine developed at Moderna therapeutics uses pre-existing technology and is made to a very high standard. The company claims it can’t cause the disease as genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease is used and not a “real virus” extract. It is named Mrna-1,273 Vaccine and is very unlike the usual vaccines in use that are prepared from weakened (live) or killed viruses.

Scientists working at Moderna say the vaccine has been made using a tried and tested process. And at the same time experts reiterate that it will take many months to know if this vaccine has served the intended purpose or not. The main goal of this first set of tests is to find out if the vaccine is safe. If it is, later studies will determine how well it works. Such rapid development of a potential vaccine is unprecedented, and it was possible because researchers were able to use what they already knew about related Coronaviruses that had caused SARS and MERS.

Besides this advancement, there are others on the job for the benefit of humanity. In a suburb south of Boston, robots are manufacturing a potential vaccine. Another candidate vaccine —development work for which started when SARS terrified the world in early 2000s — sits in deep freeze in a repository ready to be thawed and formulated into thousands of vials for further testing. Yet another is being put together at facilities in San Diego and Houston, with projections that it could be tested on people by the summer of 2020. Another laboratory in San Diego, the Inovio, is using a new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. It is named INO-4,800 and is planned to enter human trials by the summer.

For any vaccine to be deployed after development takes at least a year because of the time needed to run clinical trials and attain regulatory permissions. Hence in all probability there may be an approved therapeutic drug (to treat COVID-19) long before scientists actually arrive at a licenced, marketable vaccine.

Several drug makers, most prominently Gilead Sciences (California) —an anti-HIV drug company and Toyama Chemical (Japan) are testing medicines developed for other diseases as a possible Coronavirus treatment. The most promising, broad spectrum anti-viral drug that has come up is Remdesivir, the same drug that was tried in controlling the Ebola virus outbreak with poor results.

Gilead and health authorities in China are racing to test it on people in controlled trials. This US-based biotechnology company had already shipped this drug to China to be used on the patients even without FDA approval on requests from treating physicians.

Another drug Kaletra — a combination of two anti-HIV drugs from pharma group AbbVie is in trials. The anti-malarial drug Chloroquine is another relatively safe drug with high activity against the Coronavirus, though this needs some definitive clinical trials to mark its efficacy.

The laboratory of Beth Israel in collaboration with Janssen is working to accelerate another vaccine. This laboratory is using a common cold virus to deliver a Coronavirus antigen into cells to stimulate the immune system. This laboratory has earlier used a similar approach to make over a million doses of a vaccine for the Ebola virus that has yet to be licenced. The work done against Coronavirus is in the stage of testing multiple versions of the vaccine on mice, ferrets and Rhesus monkeys exposed to the Coronavirus within a research facility.

Historically, the promise of breakthrough medicines and treatments appears to rest with private companies, and not the federally-sponsored manufacturing sites. Drug companies are often seen to be reluctant to develop vaccines because more often than not such epidemics dissipate long before a vaccine can pass through the regulatory lines and be approved. And the financial implications of such R&D work are too high on the companies to handle, once the disease and the customers dissipate quite suddenly.

Charitable donations are being used to support prominent pharma groups and promising projects and the leading player in this is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). This is supporting Inovio and Moderna groups for vaccine development and its co-founders are the Governments of Norway and India, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome trust.

For future disaster preparedness against infectious disease outbreaks we need funds from Governments and philanthropic organisations to support pharmaceutical groups not just in their basic research but for the late stage developments as well.

1,20-3-20,"We need quick action, not panic","A Coronavirus vaccine has entered the stage of human-volunteer trials in Seattle, US and in the UK it will happen somewhere in June

COVID-19 has been clouding most minds on this planet for months now. If you still don’t know about COVID-19, you’ve probably just landed from Mars. The most difficult and harmful thing at a time like this is misinformation and scant information, coupled with the lack of tools to handle the disaster. I’m not talking about the contagion but about the level of scaremongering that is not far from the horrifying 2011 sci-fi of the same name. More than 150 countries are battling with Coronavirus today and thousands of lives have been lost. A vaccine has entered the stage of human-volunteer trials in Seattle, US and in the UK it will happen somewhere in June. No conclusive medication has so far been approved by any global authority for treatment, though there have been sporadic reports, including from Jaipur and Delhi, of a “cure”. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has predicted a winter peak later this year with potential cases rising over the 500 million mark and casualties touching over 10 million by end-2020 or early 2021. So where does that bring us? We need to act now. The world woke up to the Coronavirus slower than it should have. The Chinese, Korean, Italian and Spanish lockdowns, the German border closure, French and other European responses and those of the UK, US, Canada and Australia, have all been delayed and partial.

The Indian Government, too, has been, in all honesty, a bit slow in reacting. We have adopted a “brake-and-go” approach. The recent step of involving South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) nations to jointly handle the problem, in view of porous land-borders like Europe, is a commendable step in the right direction. But more is needed. If the outbreak goes out of control, we could see an acute shortage of beds in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and High Dependency Units (HDUs).

One option could be the Government temporarily bringing all ICU beds under federal control, or at least monitoring their preparedness federally. State Governments have not been proactive on lockdowns. We still have allowance for gatherings in many States, whether for marriage ceremonies or in some places, even otherwise. All gatherings of more than five people should be banned, unless all of them live together in the same household. Still all the States have not closed cinemas, gyms or clamped down on public gatherings. This needs to be done fast. Restaurants need to follow the European lead of ensuring minimum one metre distance (preferably three metres) between customers, else they should be closed temporarily.

Work from home is still sporadically implemented and needs addressing. The Government also needs to ring-fence an emergency budget like the UK and the US to handle the crises. Both employees and employers need to be supported with additional and emergency provisions of sick pay so they can self-isolate quickly. Public information should be more widely disseminated. Handwashing and correct alcohol gel application needs to be taught to every household and the media has a vital role to play here. A blanket ban should, however, be imposed on any media/social media portal spreading misinformation. The public should be educated not to resort to panic reactions of hoarding food and other commodities. This will be counter-productive and lead to more chaos. All non-essential services like Outpatient Departments, elective surgeries and so on should be suspended in all hospitals across the country for two months. This should be done both to avoid any unnecessary public gathering and travel and to free up resources to tackle the worst. All educational institutions should be closed for at least two months. The most vulnerable — those over 70, diabetics, heart patients, those with dementia and immunodeficiency — should have protocols in place and preferably should be isolated for two months. A travel advisory should be issued to avoid all but the most essential travel, which should be clearly defined. Social security measures should be stepped up. Hoarding of any essential material and disinfectants should be acted against immediately to ensure free availability of disinfecting material to the public at reasonable rates and on subsidised rates or free for poor households. A federal disaster management department with daily public updates from the Prime Minister should be set up. This is the time for a daily “Jann ki baat,” not just a one-off address to the nation.

There is a saying in trauma care: “The treatment of bleeding is to stop the bleeding”. The same goes with COVID-19. “The treatment of Coronavirus is to stop it from spreading”. We are in the so-called “Golden Hour” of Advanced Trauma Life Support. But it won’t last long. The window is not more than 15 days. There’s no need to panic, only to act quickly, logically and responsibly. This is a war which people and Governments need to fight together. Of course there will be some losses which can be minimised by right action at the right time. Empowerment of masses through right education and their participation is the key to combat this. However the Government cannot leave it for the masses to fight it out either. A joined-up thinking is required.

2,20-3-20,Birth of a new work culture,"As more and more people worldwide work from home, many core company policies for remote workers, telecommuting, cybersecurity, crisis management and so on will need an overhaul

Many of you would have seen a cartoon doing the rounds of social media which shows a man sitting on a couch with a laptop and an accompanying caption which reads, “Oh that meeting was just an email!” Some of you reading this now might have gotten used to music streaming in from your neighbour’s house, as you sip on your favourite beverage while on a video call with 30 of your colleagues in casuals. The new workplace is here and chances are it will change the way humans will ever work, that is if they stay long enough, to reboot planet Earth. The global pandemic has ensured a new world of cars parked in garages, cleaner city air, occasional wildlife appearances in deserted streets and fishes and dolphins being spotted in rivers and oceans closer to cities. Many point out that large technology companies and global corporations, which already have flexible work options, superior cybersecurity fixes and streamlined work from home policies, will be the first ones to deliver large chunks of jobs home. The question is what happens to smaller firms and micro-firms that do not have access to these high-end solutions and seek maximum efficiency from (in many cases) shoestring budgets and minuscule employee strength. These firms will find it difficult to manage productivity. There are many more likely outcomes which will need fresh thinking, particularly in the areas of urban space planning, power management, human resource management and many integrated policy issues.

When companies realise that they can perform optimally with remote workers, they are most likely to vacate plush commercial spaces. Real estate valuations for most of these spaces will undergo a huge downgrade as anchor corporations exit. This will impact financial firms, banks and developers with exposure to office properties. Long-term leases are also most likely to come under stress. Shift to a home workstation also means daily power consumption patterns will shift geographies within cities. Traditionally, during weekdays, power demand peaks in office complex zones shifting to residential complexes at night and entertainment zones like malls, shopping complexes hotels and so on during the weekends. However, with a likely crumbling of traditional cubicles, power consumption patterns will even out across the cityscape all the days of the week. This will also stem demand for better broadband and network connectivity, 24/7 demand for electricity and chic meeting joints in residential neighbourhoods.

A crucial aspect of modern office work is earned sick leave for employees. While most global corporations and Government staff will have access to substantial number of earned leaves per year, it is the medium small size and micro-firms which will have to rethink their policies. Most small firm employees would lament lack of earned leaves in their respective set-ups for fear of losing jobs.

The situation becomes far graver for a country like India which has far more Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) and family firms employing less than ten people. Add to this the support staff like housekeeping, cleaners, drivers, maids, office delivery persons who make up a vital part of any office. Most of them today would be fearful of reporting a fever or a seasonal illness and in turn spread diseases across communities, homes and offices. With global trends shifting to the work from home culture, a fresh clamour for some kind of group insurance for the unorganised sector and mandatory earned leaves, specially for a country like India, will continue to grow.

The Uttar Pradesh Government has done a commendable job by announcing a certain fixed amount transfer for daily wage earners and labourers, who are likely to lose livelihoods for some days due to temporary shutdowns of cities and towns. This initiative should trigger similar moves by other State Governments but it will still leave out a huge chunk of the urban workforce in the unorganised sector. Think of your domestic help, cooks, delivery agents and so on, who are mostly considered a temporary workforce. Traditionally they do not have earned sick leave or medical insurance and post-retirement benefits.

Threats like COVID-19 should be a wake-up call for employers/employees to demand group insurance for micro and small firms and seek recognition of temporary workforce for benefits on the same lines as their permanent counterparts. Contrary to popular belief, this may actually bring down costs for many employers as preventive measures could prove a hundred times better than a cure in the long run. This is also more likely to bring a sense of professionalism found lacking in many workers in the unorganised sector as additional answerability, including regular health checks will foster discipline. Finally, many core company policies like creating new work protocols for remote workers, telecommuting, remote access and cybersecurity policies, remote recovery, crisis management, virtual private network management and many such will need an overhaul.

Pandemics don’t need passport for entry into geographies. It may create a temporary shutdown of borders and may give strength to voices opposed to a globalised world. However, one should remember that pandemics require multinational cooperation to formulate an integrated strategy for citizen safety and health. This should bring nations closer, now more than ever.

3,20-3-20,Scourge of Indian politics,"With State after State facing rebellion with elected representatives switching loyalties, it’s time we amend the archaic anti-defection law and strengthen the role of the Governor

Politics is the art of governance where the responsibility to improve the living conditions of the people rests with the ruling party. But in reality, Indian politics has to do more with the accumulation of power at institutions to govern them. Here, both the ruling as well as Opposition parties jostle to derive authority that comes along with powerful positions. Of late, politics in the country is completely centred around politicians and their cronies enjoying the fruits of powers by hook or crook.

In State after State, our legislators, faced with a quirky situation, have become a laughing stock as they continue switching party loyalty for money and higher positions, including the most sought-after job of a Minister. Political defections in our country have reached alarming proportions, making a mockery of democracy itself. Our leaders have thrown all sense of “decency” and “Constitutional values” into the dustbin. All they are concerned about is self-interest. The rule book of our Constitution is, perhaps, the worst victim amid the ongoing political chicanery.

Things were set right with the Bommai case, where the Supreme Court put an end to the arbitrary dismissal of State Governments by a hostile Central Government. But power games between the BJP and the Congress continued. More recently, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka and now Madhya Pradesh have exposed the erring knots of our polity. The Kamal Nath Government is now facing a survival crisis as some of its MLAs, those belonging to the Congress and others from alliance partners, have rebelled against the State leadership. The Congress has accused the BJP of trying to bribe its MLAs to switch sides. Our courts, the Supreme Court as well as various High Courts, and sometimes even the Speaker and Governors gleefully enjoy watching political parties squabbling with each other. If such incidents become routine, the apex court will have to spend a chunk of its time in settling such mundane matters. It may get distracted from performing its fundamental duty to dispense justice to the people.

But the question is, why do our legislators switch loyalties? Even after three decades and more, politicians have time and again violated the spirit of the 1985 anti-defection law. This law, referring to the Aaya Ram, Gaya Ram culture, was introduced as a bold move to deter the defection of lawmakers, who are lured by the promise of office, cash or other considerations. Since then, the law has been amended several times to suit the politics of the day, yet horse-trading remains the norm. Our leaders as also other office bearers, like the Speaker and the Governors, continue to exploit every loophole in it.

As of now, the anti-defection vests more powers with the Speaker. It is he who takes the final call on the resignations of the dissident MLAs. His decision is subject to judicial review but judicial reviews of the enforcement of the anti-defection law are a developing arena. According to the law, the Speaker has to act on merit and be impartial. But there have been many examples where it has been seen that presiding officers have not acted as impartial umpires. It is also expected of the Governor to play a non-partisan role but here, too, s/he has been found to be sympathetic to the ruling party.

It’s quite clear that the Kamal Nath Government in Madhya Pradesh has been reduced to a minority after 22 of its MLAs resigned from the Assembly. It’s true that horse-trading has become an intricate part of politics because of a downward slide in ethics. The hallmark of Indian democracy is such that it calls the party/leader, who secures a majority, to form the Government. But once the support diminishes, the best course for the falling Government is to tender resignation in a dignified manner and allow the democratic process to take over. But this rarely happens as our politicians are hell-bent on the democracy turning into a mobocracy.

Democracy can survive only when the executive, legislature and judiciary work harmoniously, independently and with a deep commitment to upholding the larger public interest. The ruling Government must initiate debate and discussion on how to promote value-based politics in the country. People are now fed up with divisive politics based on caste, creed and religion. By now it is clear that the anti-defection law lacks the strength to tackle corruption. This is why we need to review the functioning of our Constitutional objectives. As a first step, the Constitution must be amended. The scope to define corruption (beyond monetary aspect) must be widened. Misuse of Government funds must be strictly prohibited and included as an offence. Second, no one should be allowed to make his/her own interpretations on Constitutional provisions and rules. Bureaucrats are past masters in this and, thus, misguide the politicians in power. This is why we need to take a re-look at the anti-defection law.

There have been many commissions and panels, including the Dinesh Goswami Committee on Electoral Reforms and the Constitution Review Commission, which have stressed the need to do away with the Tenth Schedule provision regarding exemption from disqualification in case of a split. Some have even recommended that the President and the Governor should decide on disqualification in coordination with the Election Commission. The anti-defection law should be scrapped in its present form or should be amended and made straight. The cardinal principle of majority support should be the only criterion to determine support.

Only the Governor should be given the power to compulsorily order floor test in the Assembly, that, too, within a specific time. Third, the divisive politics played by regional satraps is a threat to political stability. Regional parties must lose their recognition for violating certain identified norms of governance. Fourth, a check on arbitrariness is a must while doling out post-retirement jobs to the bureaucracy. There’s also the need to enlarge the kitty of choosing experts beyond a coterie as there are several qualified people available in all fields.

The Modi Government, too, is faltering in bringing swift reforms. It is following the policy of nepotism and crony capitalism, which led to the previous UPA Government facing embarrassment from their appointees quite often. Networking around the powers that be and hitting a connection in the Delhi coterie are the only criteria today. The fact remains that unless our national character improves, no reforms will help. However, eternal hope is the cause of sustaining the Indian civilisation as we have the wherewithal to overcome such hiccups in nation-building.

4,20-3-20,Shivpal meets Rajbhar,"Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party (Lohia) supremo Shivpal Singh Yadav met Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party chief Om Prakash Rajbhar on Thursday, giving an indication that the two outfits could forge an alliance in the 2022 assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh.

The two leaders were closeted for about an hour and discussed various issues. They later admitted that it would be better for smaller parties to forge an alliance to contest the assembly polls.

Speaking to media persons after the meeting, Rajbhar said that he had a successful meeting with the PSPL chief and he was ready to join the Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha mooted by him.

“When a Union government can be formed in alliance with 38 political parties, why should 50 parties not contest the polls jointly,” he said.

Shivpal Yadav said that his effort would be to unite the backwards and the move made by Rajbhar was appreciative.

“We have to join hands so that the fight for the backwards can be taken to a conclusive end,” he stated.

Earlier, Rajbhar had spoken to Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, Apna Dal’s Krishna Patel and other smaller backward leaders of the state to form a platform for the 2022 UP assembly polls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shivpal-meets-rajbhar.html

6,20-3-20,Youths scuffle with cops at anti-CAA sit-in venue,"



|

An attempt of Lucknow police to spread awareness about coronavirus among anti-CAA protesters staging sit-in at Hussainabad Clock Tower turned murky and ended in a scuffle on Thursday afternoon.

A police team reached the dharna venue to make the protesters see reason on the spread of coronavirus and lower their presence at the site.

Some youths working as volunteers however intervened and opposed the police move. This led to a scuffle between the cops and the youths. the protesting women too pitched in for the youths and started raising slogans against the government and the police.

Later, additional police force was rushed to the scene along with two senior police officers after which the situation could be brought control.

The protesters accused the police of taking oppressive measures and assaulting them. They also alleged that there were no woman cops in the team.

“They pulled down the tent under which we are sitting and also took blankets and other items during the scuffle,” they alleged.

ADCP (West) Vikas Tripathi denied that the police cane-charged the protesters. He said that a police team had gone there to make the protesters aware of the threat of coronavirus and prevent its spread by not assembling in large numbers.

“The team spotted youths assembled at the protest venue and asked them to leave the place. This resulted in a verbal spat after which the police initiated preventive measures to dispel the mob,” he said.

Communist Party of India (Marxists-Leninist) state secretary Sudhakar Yadav condemned the police action against women protesters and said that the Bharatiya Janata Party government was functioning in an autocratic manner.

Yadav said the policemen did not spare even elderly women at the protest site and caned them.

“Due to the cane-charge and stampede that followed, several women fainted at the protest venue,” he alleged.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/youths-scuffle-with-cops-at-anti-caa-sit-in-venue.html

All rooms on this floor, including the room where the customer stayed, have been vacated immediately.

The health check-up of all the employees working in the hotel was conducted by the doctors, in which all the employees were found to be healthy. The four suspected patients have been kept under surveillance and isolation.

It may be mentioned that no positive case of novel corona virus disease has been found in the state so far. The state government has strengthened the measures for monitoring and prevention of the disease. According to the information received from the State Surveillance Unit, 1,000 passengers arrived from the novel corona virus affected countries have been identified till date.

Out of these passengers, 541 have been kept in isolation in their homes and surveillance of 382 passengers has already been completed.

Samples of 43 suspected cases had been sent for investigation to NIV Pune, Indira Gandhi Government Medical College-Nagpur, AIIMS-Bhopal and NIRTH – Jabalpur, out of which 29 reports have been found negative and 14 reports are yet to come.

11,20-3-20,PM’s feasible protocol,"Microdots of codified lockdowns would work well in both confining and choking the virus rather than a national emergency

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a self-imposed janta or people’s curfew, rather a self-willed resolve to confine themselves to their houses between 7 am and 9 pm this Sunday, is perhaps a test run for stricter lockdowns in a rapidly changing Coronavirus scenario. Calling out to people to discipline themselves in a war-like situation and not get into panic mode, the PM’s national address was not just reassuring but preparatory to the way India would evolve its own battle against the virus threat. He geared us up for it. And at a time when global corporations are arresting slipping bottomlines with salary and job cuts, the PM’s call to set up an economic task force to alleviate woes was a much-needed balm against anxieties of our throbbing workforce. While the speech may have sounded altruistic, the fact is the Modi Government has a response plan in place and is priming and scaling us up to it should the need arise. For the outbreak in India is likely to mutate into an India-specific variant, one which frankly we have to combat given our resources and contexts. Ever since COVID-19 cases have started going up in India, there is a possibility of a real explosion of the infection given our porosity at many levels. The low ratio of testing means low data that is still not representative enough until we have more testing kits and centres that are broad-based. There are potential hotspots where a focussed vigilance, containment and lockdown protocol is needed. Our population density and cheek-by-jowl neighbourhoods mean cluster spores could multiply almost overnight and there is a real possibility of the infection just lying beneath the surface and eating into communities. Then there is the very Indian tendency to hide the truth of affliction to escape quarantine and stigma, like 100 suspected carriers fleeing a facility in Ludhiana. Although the Government says we have not entered Stage III, the fact is we have tested the lowest samples globally, about 6,000 to 7,000. Compare this with South Korea, which has a lesser population than Tamil Nadu but has tested 250,000. Now the Government has rationalised its existing testing infrastructure to broaden the ambit of samples to all kinds of pneumonic diseases. Some experts say that we may be dealing with a hydra-headed monster and there may come a time when sourcing its kill point would become a massive challenge. They maintain that some over-reaction is good in terms of ensuring preventing protocols and that along with improved testing infrastructure, which would still take about a week to operationalise, we should consider territorial and localised lockdowns. Which means that barring essential services of food, rations and hospitals and limited mobility permits for emergencies, citizens are to be house-bound. Various models have worked in their given contexts and we need to develop one that works for us. For example, there is the aggressive Wuhan model of forced isolation, there is London’s self-imposed exile, Taiwan and Singapore’s method of aggressive testing, contact tracing and social distancing. While India has several templates to adapt from, it has to adopt a reasonable and executable plan. But it has to be by order to impress upon the citizenry the seriousness of compliance and the importance of a drill. Which is why the PM’s call against hoarding of essentials and desisting from crowding hospitals unnecessarily made sense. We have shut all international flights for a week. Already worst-hit local administrations have been proactive to self-censor and contain the spread. Apart from the usual closure of public spaces, malls and institutions and social distancing protocols by mostly urban communities, each city is evolving a response plan particular to its context. Noida, one of the techie hotspots, is under Section 144 till March 31. Pune is initiating a rotational protocol of varied office times to avoid congestion and limiting office numbers to host not more than five employees at a time. Mumbai has already rolled out a graded traffic plan, closing some roads on alternate days to control crowds.

Perhaps, these microdots of lockdowns would work well in both confining and choking the virus rather than a national lockdown. The latter is a double-edged sword for a nation where there is a lot of indiscipline and fear about acceptance of the reality of the disease as a tameable crisis rather than a Doomsday nightmare. It could lead to a panic economy. Yet without a national directive, there’s no sense of crisis but a misplaced bravado. The PM’s national address was, therefore, much-needed. A virus-hit economy is already flying off the rails, the worst-hit being the unorganised sector and daily wage earners, who may have to disproportionately bear losses. The cascading impact is beyond guessable. India is caught between the devil and the deep sea — a virus on one side and extreme poverty on the other.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/pm---s-feasible-protocol-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/pm---s-feasible-protocol.html
12,20-3-20,Metal bird flu,"The aviation industry will take years to recover from the Chinese contagion

The news has been coming thick and fast and one should have expected it. After civilian air traffic in China collapsed by 80 per cent when the country went into lockdown, it was inevitable that air travel across the world would suffer as well. With nations imposing lockdowns and travel restrictions for foreigners, international air travel has effectively been cancelled. Other than a few flights here and there, mainly evacuation ones for citizens of various nations and planes carrying cargo, everything else has come to a standstill. Every major Indian airline has suspended international travel, other than very limited ones to neighbouring capitals like Dhaka and Kathmandu. Oddly enough, the US, one of the few countries from where unrestricted flights are still operating even as New York City has become a major outbreak hotspot, is still operating 28 non-stop flights every week into Delhi and Mumbai.

That said, the devastation among airlines has been massive and the fear of the virus catching at crowded airports has seen passenger confidence collapsing. Airlines across the world are not just cancelling flights but also grounding aircraft. Delta Airlines, one of America’s “Big 3” global airlines, has said that it will be grounding 600 aircraft. Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost airline, has said that from March 28, almost all of its 232 aircraft will be grounded. It was only inevitable that the contagion would spread into India as well, one of lower air traffic. Passenger demand has collapsed with 20 per cent fewer bookings on India’s largest airline, IndiGo. That is not counting the countless no-shows as people would rather their tickets go to waste. Even though the Government has “suggested” that airlines have a generous cancellation policy, it appears they will try and delay it. If the fear of the virus continues till mid-April, several Indian carriers will be looking at bankruptcy. Even the airline that has the healthiest balance sheet in India, IndiGo, has announced large-scale pay cuts across the board. Other airlines have sent back all the expatriate pilots on their rolls and are conserving cash assets. In addition, airlines are asking the Government for all sorts of assistance, from actual cash funds to more mundane things like removing mandatory flights and the slot allocation rules for the time being. Passenger confidence will rebound, a healthy air travel sector is a strategic necessity for a country as large as India and indeed for any large global economy. It is, therefore, imperative that the Government steps in to alleviate the crisis in the sector. This is an unprecedented time for global aviation and even its Indian equivalent. Where we will head from here depends on what the sector and the Government will do in the coming week.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/metal-bird-flu-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/metal-bird-flu.html
13,20-3-20,Govt keeping eye on anti-CAA sit-in: CM,"Amid threat of coronavirus spread in Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said that his government was keeping an eye on the ongoing sit-in by anti-CAA protesters and would take whatever steps were required at the appropriate time.

“We have already given powers to the Health department under provisions of Epidemic Diseases Act and it is our commitment to protect the lives of 23 crore population (of the state) at any cost. If people stay in their houses, it would be easier to control the virus at the second stage,” Yogi Adityanath said during an interaction with some journalists.

The chief minister admitted that coronavirus would have an impact on the national and state economies but said that UP was doing its homework well to meet the challenge.

“We are going to pay money to daily wagers who will lose employment due to the virus spread. The government has set up a three-member committee headed by Finance Minister Suresh Kumar Khanna to recommend money to be given to registered daily wagers and the committee has already submitted its report,” the chief minister said.

Yogi ruled out any shortage of foodgrains or other essential commodities and said that everything was being monitored.

“There is no shortage of sanitisers, masks or medicines,” he said.

When asked about opposition parties, who termed the three years of his rule as a big failure, Yogi said that they (opposition) had exhausted all weapons in the last three years and now they were going to palm readers and fortune tellers.

“In the last three years, the opposition did everything to derail our work but we focused on it. Now the opposition has become frustrated and are issuing contradictory statements showing their mindset,” he said.

The chief minister said that in 2022, the Bharatiya Janata Party would go to the people in a positive way, highlighting the achievements of the government and how it had changed people’s perception about the state.

“I have conveyed to the ministers and the BJP leaders that they should go to the people and make them aware of our achievements so that the anti-government tirade of the opposition could be countered,” he said.

Yogi said that he would be participating in a function wherein Ram Lalla would be shifted to an alternative home in Ayodhya on March 24, after which the construction of a grand temple would commence.

“The programme will be a brief one and will be telecast live,” he said.

To a poser if the government would bring any legislation to control population, Yogi said that the government was carrying out awareness programmes to educating families about two children norms.

“Presently there is no such policy decision on this matter,” the chief minister said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/govt-keeping-eye-on-anti-caa-sit-in--cm.html

However, a final call on the ceremony would be taken in a meeting of Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra trust to be held in Lucknow on April 4.

Well-placed sources said on Thursday that the date was tentative and a final decision would be taken on April 4.

The sources said that both the prime minister and the RSS chief would be invited for the ceremony while water from all holy rivers and mud from religious places would be brought there.

It has also been suggested that gold and silver bricks be used for bhoomi pujan.

The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had carried out the shilanyas (laying of foundation stone) of the Ram temple way back on November 9 in 1989.

Meanwhile, the idol of Ram Lalla would be shifted to an alternative temple on March 25, the first day of Navratri.

15,20-3-20,Akhilesh: UP has slipped in all development indices,"Hitting out at the Yogi Adityanath government, Samajwadi Party said that the last three years of the Bharatiya Janata Party rule in the state were the ‘worst years’ in the annals of Uttar Pradesh as it had slipped in all development indices as the government had failed to give any new project and instead inaugurated schemes launched during the previous SP regime.

However, the Samajwadi Party, which had announced to launch the 2022 assembly poll campaigning by holding cycle yatras from March 23, postponed it till April 22 in view of the spread of coronavirus.

“The present BJP government has failed to give anything new to the people. It has only inaugurated projects launched by the previous SP government,” SP chief Akhilesh Yadav told reporters in Lucknow on Thursday.

Akhilesh said that the BJP government had failed to take any decision which could impact lives of the people in a positive way.

“Take the case of spread of coronavirus. The government has not made any preparation. The hospitals lack facilities and medicines,” the SP chief alleged.

“SP legislatures went to Bundelkhand to assess the situation and it is tragic. In Mahoba district alone, 65 farmers have committed suicide due to financial problems. Besides, prices of fertilisers increased while cane dues are increasing with each passing day despite government claims that they made record payment of cane dues,” Akhilesh said.

The SP chief further said, “The BJP government should review its poll manifesto of 2017 and see what they had promised to the people and what they actually did. The state is reeling under goondaraj while corruption is at its peak. The government should also reveal the actual picture of Investors’ Summit and why banks are not giving funds to the government.”

Akhilesh charged that the BJP government was mum on several issues like why are youths in the state unemployed and when would the metro rail work start in Gorakhpur.

“The chief minister always dishes out lies. But the people have now deciphered the tricks of the BJP leaders and in 2022 Assembly polls, they will teach the BJP a lesson,” the SP chief said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/akhilesh--up-has-slipped-in-all-development-indices.html
16,20-3-20,Congress slams UP govt’s 3-year rule,"Congress leaders in UP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party government and advised Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to come out of the ‘self-praise’ mode and do something on ground.

Earlier, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had termed the three-year report card of the Yogi government as a “filled with lies”.

“The BJP government, which celebrated its third anniversary in UP on Thursday, has nothing to showcase as achievements and there are only failures,” said UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu while talking to media persons at the Mall Avenue UPCC headquarters in Lucknow on Thursday.

Accompanied by Congress Legislative Party leader in the Assembly, Aradhana Mishra, and Legislative Party leader in the Council, Deepak Singh, Lallu released a ‘White Paper’ on the three-year rule of the Yogi government and charged that while people of the state were suffering, the government was celebrating.

“Farmers’ suicide has increased as the promise of the BJP to double farmers’ income has turned out to be a political farce. Besides, unemployment has added to the woes of the people,” he said.

The Congress leader also raked up corruption in the government and alleged that all exams for recruitment were marked with irregularities while government departments were hardly working, leading to budget funds not being utilised.

Aradhana Mishra alleged that the BJP government had made tall claims on investments in the state. “But in reality, of the 1,045 MoUs signed during Investors’ Summit, only 9 to 10 per cent came down to the ground, which exposes the government claims,” she asserted.

Mishra further claimed that crime against women had increased in BJP rule and every hour, seven crimes were being committed against the women in the state.

Attacking the chief minister, Deepak Singh said that the government was busy in ‘propaganda politics’ and had done nothing but wasted public money to advertise false claims.

Singh said that in the name of realisation of losses during violence during anti-CAA protests, the Yogi government had spent more money to put-up hoardings than what was to be recovered from the accused.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/congress-slams-up-govt---s-3-year-rule.html

Maintaining that Gogoi's nomination has definitely caused eyebrows to be raised, he said any sensible person would be against such a move by the Government.

“It (Gogoi''s nomination to Rajya Sabha) clearly indicated that he had been useful to the current Government at the Centre,” Capt Amarinder said.

The Governments have to realise their responsibility, they cannot use institutions for political benefit, as appeared to be the case in Gogoi's nomination, said Amarinder, during a conclave to mark the completion of three years of his government.

The Chief Minister drew a distinction between Gogoi's nomination by the BJP-led Government less than six months after retirement as Chief Justice and former CJI Ranganath Mishra's election to the Rajya Sabha on a Congress ticket after several years of retirement from the same post.

""Unlike Gogoi, Mishra fought an election to win the RS seat, and that too some seven years after he retired as CJI,"" he said.

Gogoi was also entitled to get into politics, but he should have faced election after four to five years of retirement, said Capt Amarinder.

The State has also postponed all Board examinations of Classes X and XII till March 31, besides calling off all public dealings in the Government offices with immediate effect.

Already, the State has declared the closure of all educational institutions, shopping complexes, malls, museums, theatres, and local weekly kisan mandis to check the spread of coronavirus.

The decisions were taken during the meeting of Group of Ministers (GoM) taking serious note of the COVID-19 which is spreading its wings in the country, especially after the state recorded it first death. The GoM decided to take stringent actions to prevent the public to move out of their houses without any emergency.

“We have decided to put a ban on plying of all public transport, including Government and private buses, from midnight on March 20,” said the Cabinet Minister Brahm Mohindra folliwng the GoM meeting held to review the emergent situation in view of rise of suspected cases in the State.

“GoM has decided that there is urgent need to prevent people to come out of their houses without any emergency. For this end, we have decided to stop the operation of all public transport (government and private buses) from midnight on March 20 but the taxis and rickshaws have been exempted from the ban,” he said. In another important decision, the GoM has decided to increase the number of isolation wards set at different public, private hospitals and medical institutions and to strengthen the services by ensuring availability of medical and paramedical staff and adequate stock of medicines.

Similarly, routine OPD services in the hospitals have also been postponed but emergency services at all the hospitals and primary health centres (PHCs) will be continued 24X7. The GoM has also decided to close all Dental Colleges and Hospitals with immediate effect till March 31. The classes of first and second year students in Medical Colleges have been postponed while the classes of third and fourth years would be continued.

“Likewise, the classes of first year students in Nursing Colleges have been called off till March 31 but the classes of nursing students from second year onward would be continued,” he said. In case of any eventuality, the students of Medical Colleges in third and fourth year are being given first-hand training sessions to tackle with COVID-19 patients.

“GoM has also decided to restrict the gathering for any function like marriages and funerals up to 20 persons. Organizers of such functions have been advised to adhere to hand washing protocol and proper cleanliness,” he said.

Close on the heels of notification issued by the CBSE, it has also been decided to postpone all the Board examinations of 10th and 12th standard postponed till March 31.

Besides, the GoM has also decided to strictly implement the home quarantine protocol for all the NRIs, passengers who came from any country in last 15 days to remain in isolation at their homes up to 14 days.

It has also been decided to do mandatory stamping with indelible ink of all such NRIs and passengers in a bid to identify them in case they go out.

22,20-3-20,Capt moots testing by private hospitals,"Warning of a worsening COVID-19 crisis in the country, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amainder Singh on Thursday urged the Central Government to allow private hospitals and labs to conduct tests in order to ensure access to all the people.

Calling for a national level fight against the pandemic on a war footing, Capt Amarinder said that he would take up the issue of testing by private hospitals or labs with the Prime Minister on Friday during the latter’s proposed video conference with all the Chief Ministers.

With the number of CORONAVIRUS cases increasing, the Centre has to consider reviewing its policy, stressed the Chief Minister, making it clear that he did not agree with the current policy of the Government of India in this regard.

Given the fact that Punjab had private labs in all major cities, it was not logical for a corona suspect to have to travel to Chandigarh or some other place to get himself tested from a government facility only, said Capt Amarinder, adding that only in case of doubt should such a person be required to go elsewhere for a second test.

CAPT URGES CENTRE TO ALLOW DISTRIBUTION OF 20 MLN GRAIN STOCKS TO POOR

The Chief Minister also suggested that the Centre should allow the food stocks, currently stored in Punjab godowns, to be distributed to the poor whose earnings were impacted due to the Coronavirus outbreak instead of letting them rot in the storage areas.

Since the stocks belonged to the Government of India, it was in their purview to take a decision in this regard, he said, adding that the 20 million tonnes of food grains that Food Corporation of India (FCI) had yet to lift from the godowns could be put to better use by feeding the people not just in Punjab but wherever needed. Such a move would be a life saver for the people of India in the current crisis, he added.

Underlining the need for strong measures to check further spread of the COVID-19 disease, the Chief Minister said that his Government had already initiated a series of steps to fight the problem. The State’s financial crunch would not be allowed to impact the efforts of his Government, said Captain Amarinder, adding that all necessary funds would be made available to ensure adequate testing, isolation and treatment facilities.

EXAMS POSTPONED, SCHOOL STAFF RELIEVED TILL MARCH 31

Punjab Government on Thursday announced to postpone school examinations, besides relieving the staff of all schools till March 31.

The State School Education Minister Vijay Inder Singla said that to avert the threat of virus contamination, Punjab Government has decided to restrict the activities of all Government, semi-Government and private schools in the State. “Apart from postponing the examinations, the school staff has also been relieved with immediate effect,” he added.

The Cabinet Minister said that to curb the contamination of Covid-19, the State Government has been working tirelessly as the Chief Minister has also been personally reviewing the situation control the threat of the virus spread.

He added that the Education Department has also decided to voluntarily offer the school buildings for isolation wards as per the requirement in case of any critical situation. Once the health department requisites the building, it would be immediately evacuated, he said.

Singla said that apart from restricting the movement in the schools, an intensive awareness drive has also been launched in the state from Thursday onwards. The teams, led by Health Department staff and other officials, were visiting each and every household in villages and cities as well to make the residents aware of the coronavirus.

33,20-3-20,Riverside villagers of polluted Brahmani prone to COVID-19,"Even as the district administration of Dhenkanal has clamped Section 144 of CrPc to prevent coronavirus infection, it is quite apathetic to the growing pollution of the Brahmani river and the plight of the riverside villagers.

More than six lakh villagers of eight blocks residing at river banks of Brahmani in Dhenkanal district are affected due to Brahmani water pollution. And today, they are highly vulnerable to Coronavirus, said sources.

The interState river before entering to Dhenkanal district at village Kamalanga, has four distributaries (streams) called Sankha, Kura, Tikira and Nandira. During early 1980, fertilizer plant, ORICHEM, NTPC, Heavy Water Project of Talcher and Nalco of Angul even though used heavy quantity of pure drinking water from upstream of Bramhani, they discharged their dirty chemicals effluents to Brahmani through the Nandira nala.

Meanwhile, many industries among them have been closed and others have made their own arrangement of waste disposal, but no remarkable effort was made either by the Union Government or State Government to stop the mindless discharge of fluids when the river was just taken for granted.

Bramhani though has been categorised as ‘D’ grade polluted river, the Union Government had paid only Rs 2.13 crore out of a budget of Rs 24 crore made by an expert committee in year 1993-94. The State Government has spent only Rs 33 lakh during the year 1994-95 to clean the river water, which was inadequate.

Fishermen earning a living from Bramhani have lost their livelihood due to polluted water. Boat drivers(Keuta) have lost their jobs, after construction of the Sarangadhar bridge to link Kamakshyanagar with Dhenkanal.

For carrying minerals through Brahmani from Jajpur to Kendrapada, Britishers though had constructed an anicut at Jenapur and Jokadia during the Year 1860, but the anicut has been damaged due to lack of maintenance.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/riverside-villagers-of-polluted-brahmani-prone-to-covid-19.html

43,20-3-20,Odisha yet to boost tennis ball cricket despite talents,"Tushar Mahakud, a national player in Tennis ball cricket from Odisha team is a dejected lot.

He is unhappy as the game of tennis ball cricket is yet to be recognised by the State Government of Odisha despite the State teams have brought laurels.

Tushar was extremely sorry when he came across news that the Governor of Goa had invited to felicitate the winners of Tennis ball cricket players of Goa who won medals in the national school game federation held in Gorakhpur.

Though Odisha team won similar medals in many categories, yet no one bothered to felicitate these young budding players. Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had felicitated last year the team after winning national gold, said Tushar.

Former MLA Priyadarshi Mishra, adviser to the State tennis ball cricket took active role in the felicitation by the CM.

Tushar was born in Karanjia of Mayurbhanj district. Tushar’s parents Manoj Mahakud and Kabita Mahakud were quite apprehensive about son’s future due to stray cases of Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in their district which is one of the 15 LWE districts as notified by the Union Ministry of Home. They insisted Tushar to play the game and be an international figure, but the inordinate delay in getting due recognition and support from the State Government has left him in the lurch.

The Orissa Tennis ball Cricket Association (OTBCA) since its establishment in Odisha in 1996 promotes this game with the help of 30 district tennis ball cricket associations in the State. The OTBCA is affiliated to the Asian Tennis Ball Cricket Federation (ATBCA), the Tennis Ball Cricket Federation of India (TBCFI).

It is recognized by the Odisha Olympic Association and Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Govt of India and the School Game Federation of India, which is a matter of pride, said Chief Adviser, OTBCA, former Minister and MLAs Badri Narayan Patra.

The tennis ball cricket is being played in India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Srilanka, Kenya, Thailand, Hong Kong and Malaysia along with several countries in Asia and the world.

Various State Governments in India have recognized the game. The affiliated States are Goa, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhatisgarh etc, Patra said.

Recently, hundreds of players along with OTBCA officials including Patra, submitted a fresh proposal to recognize the game of tennis ball cricket stating that the Government of India has already recognized the game in serial number 48 out of 63 games recognized so far.

Sports Secretary Vishal Dev however was not aware of Government of India’s recognistion to this most popular game.

The game is played by second highest number in the higher secondary level games in Odisha, said general secretary of Odisha Tennis ball Cricket Association Sithil Kumar Panda.

Last year alone,1,246 college students in 89 colleges participated in the State level team selection in under-20 intercollege tournament category for the School Game Federation of India games held in UP. This game is less expensive and helps all youngsters from various economic strata to play.

In Odisha, young players in 24 districts with a membership of around 30,000 have enrolled as the members of this game.

Looking at the huge popularity of the game in Odisha, former bureaucrat and Bhubaneswar MP Aparajita Sarangi had written a letter to DG CRPF, New Delhi, to sponsor the game to enable mainstreaming of youths in various trouble- torn district.

State joint general secretary, OTBCA, Somanath Parida said with the recognition, weightage and patronisation by the State Government, thousands of young tennis ball cricket players would get the much-needed encouragement and achieve new feats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/odisha-yet-to-boost-tennis-ball-cricket-despite-talents.html
44,20-3-20,Politicians in Haryana restrict interaction with people,"Amid growing fears over the possibility of a Coronavirus outbreak, the elected public representatives of ruling party and the Opposition in Haryana have restricted their interaction with public in the State.

The State politicians said that they have cancelled their programmes and public meetings but people can meet them in case of urgency, they added.

State Home Minister Anil Vij who recently ordered the suspension of his Janata Darbar being held at his Ambala residence every Saturday and Sunday, said that thousands of people visit his Janta Darbar per day with their complaints. Given the Covid-19 scare, this could become a potential danger for the spread of the virus. “Since the Health Department had banned all community gatherings, Janta Darbars had also been postponed till further notice,” he added.

Haryana Speaker Gian Chand Gupta said that many public meetings were scheduled and all of them have been cancelled. ""People of my constituency can meet me in case of urgency"", he added

Congress MLA from Jhajjar, Geeta Bhukka said, “I am following all the guidelines and instructions issued by the State government regarding Coronavirus. Those people who come to meet me, are informed of the guidelines.” The Congress leader said,” Being a public representative, I cannot afford to ignore those in the Constituency. So I am in-contact with the people through phone calls or messages and social networking sites including What’s app message. At the same time, they have been asked not to visit her offices unless there is urgency.”

Haryana Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Om Prakash Yadav said that leaders were more vulnerable to contacting the virus as they had to meet a large number of people from different strata of society. “I have called off all planned events particularly in my constituency and across the State and is taking precautions while meeting people,” said Yadav.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/politicians-in-haryana-restrict-interaction-with-people.html
45,20-3-20,Race for SDC hots up Mayurbhanj politics,"The Mayurbhanj political barometer is rising high as the nomination to the Special Development Council (SDC) is to take place soon.

The name of Sananda Marndi is doing the rounds as he is a former Assembly Deputy Speaker. But the BJD rank and file are disenchanted owing to his lacklustre performances during last 2019 general elections when Sarojini Hembram was badly defeated by the unpopularity and infidelity of Sananda, who clandestinely changed his sides to BJP, as alleged.

The other name Dr Debasish Marndi is received critically among the BJD workers as Dr Marndi has proved incessantly fickle by switching over from JMM to BJD. He was also humbled ignominiously by the BJP candidate Biseswara Tudu who was elected to the Lok Sabha from these consistency in 2019 by a virtual sweep. “Debasish has also floated a new outfit called ‘Jay Mayurbhanj’ which aims at a search for his identity, safely ignoring the BJD legacy,"" confided a political observer of the district.

Srinath Soren, who miss the victory post by a whisker ( being humbled by 700 votes), is obviously active and is highly appreciated among the BJD workers and the general public. Srinath, a Biju – Naveen loyalist is a good Samaritan who is accepted by his friends and foes alike , owing to his transparency in public life and because of his non- controversial nature. In Mayurbhanj district there are two organisational posts, one for Rairangapur and the other for Baripada.

But Udala and its adjacent places in Mayurbhanj remain till date unrepresented for which there is a groundswell of anger among the BJD workers at Udala. The BJD workers here in Udala segment aspire for someone to ventilate their demand and their choice is unanimous for a relatively honest personality and a friend of the poor, a champion of Santhali language and culture, like Srinath who had proved his mettle during his brief tenure in past as MLA by accomplishing spectacular achievements for the masses of Udala.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/race-for-sdc-hots-up-mayurbhanj-politics.html

47,20-3-20,Need to act tough against Pak-backed terror: Capt,"Calling for a tough stance by the Central Government against Pakistan-backed terrorism, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday said that his Government was committed to ensuring strict action against those responsible for Bargari and other sacrilege cases.

“If the Akalis think we are sitting quiet on the sensitive sacrilege and other serious issues, they are sadly mistaken,” said the Chief Minister, adding, however, that he did not believe in engaging in ‘tu tu main main’ kind of war of words with them but wanted to remain focused on critical issues of state’s interest.

Capt Amarinder, speaking at a conclave on the completion of Congress Government’s three years in office, said that his focus had been on tackling drugs, gangsterism and political killings – all of which were rampant under the SAD-BJP rule, and this had been done effectively.

Asserting that the State Government will not allow Pak-backed terrorists to foment trouble in Punjab, the Chief Minister said that he had been urging the Central Government to be tough on Pakistan. “This cannot go on,” he declared, adding that Punjab is not Kashmir, and was well equipped to fight back.

The Army could continue fighting terror in Kashmir, but in Punjab, in addition to the BSF as the first line of defence at the borders, the 85,000 strong police force was well equipped to deal with any threat, he said, adding that the Army was also there for support as and when needed.

Taking a tough stance against Pak-sponsored terror, Capt Amarinder said that things like Pulwama attack and chopping of heads of the soldiers at the borders was not acceptable.

0“We have to be tough with Pakistan, they do not understand any other language,” he said, adding that he did not really understand the policy of the neighbouring country, which was fighting everyone on all fronts.

Citing the recent seizures of China-made drones, smuggling weapons and drugs from across the border into Punjab, Capt Amarinder said that large quantities of both had been recovered through the collective efforts of Punjab Police and the Special Task Force (STF).

Pointing out that with drugs being pushed into Punjab from Uri, Chamba, the Gujarat port, Nepal and Burma, via Delhi, the State had become a hub for narco terrorists, he said that the fight to eliminate the drugs completely was continuing on war footing.

Terming the gangster culture a result of popularisation of gangsterism through movies and television, the Chief Minister said that his instructions to the police force were clear – ask them to surrender and if they refuse to, then fight them and let them suffer the consequences.

He made it clear that the State Government had a “no mercy” policy against gangsters, who had a free reign during the Akali rule and were going around shooting anyone, including the police. But the police have now got the better of these gangsters, with nearly 2,500 in custody and 11 neutralised, he said.

‘EVEN I DON’T HAVE BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HALF OF PUNJAB CAN’T PRODUCE THEM’

Strongly opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC), and National Population Register (NPR) as absurd and unconstitutional, Capt Amarinder said that half of Punjab, including himself, could not produce birth certificates to prove their Indianness.

Pointing out that most people in Punjab came from Pakistan, Capt Amarinder asked if the Centre expected them to go to Pakistan to look for proof of birth. “Even I don’t have a birth certificate. These things did not exist when I was born,” said the Chief Minister, quipping that this would make him too a ‘doubtful character’ under the Government of India’s new census system.

Making it clear that his government was totally opposed to these exercises, Capt Amarinder said that while a routine census would be conducted in Punjab, it would not be based on religion, caste and creed.

Questioning what the BJP-led Central Government was trying to prove with these laws and documents, Capt Amarinder took strong exception to even former Army officials being declared non-Indians after fighting for the nation.

For 72 years, India has been a diverse country, with different religions, castes and creeds living together, as one, in the true spirit of the Constitution and its Preamble, the Chief Minister pointed out, adding that suddenly, “they want to break and fragment this nation, which is totally unacceptable”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/need-to-act-tough-against-pak-backed-terror--capt.html

50,20-3-20,"MCD closes Tax Department, extends period of rebate again","In view of the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD) has decided to keep the property tax section closed to the public. The corporation has also extended the period of 20 per cent rebate on property tax which was slated to end on March 20.

On Thursday, several taxpayers arrived to pay their property tax at the MCD but the section was kept closed to the people.

The officials of the corporation said that approximately one thousand people have been visiting the property tax section daily for the tax submission in the last few days which can prove to be a health risk in the current scenario. According to deputy municipal commissioner Rohitash Sharma, the property tax section was closed after MCD received the State Government’s advisory concerning the epidemic of coronavirus in the State.

These days most of the people come to deposit property tax , therefore, the tax section will remain closed till March 24 to regulate the number of people in the MCD building, said Sharma.

On being asked about the last date for the submission of property tax, Sharma said that Dehradun mayor Sunil Uniyal ‘Gama’ decided to extend the period of 20 per cent rebate in property tax for the locals from March 25 to March 31.

Though the tax department will remain closed, the sanitation and electricity sections will stay open for emergencies, said Sharma. He also added that people of Dehradun should submit the property tax through online mode rather than coming to the corporation, to prevent spread of coronavirus.

On being asked about the extension in the date for the submission of property tax without the period of rebate in April, Sharma said no decision has been taken yet by mayor ‘Gama’. It is pertinent to mention here that MCD had set the target of collecting the property tax of Rs 50 crore by the end of this month.

Till now, the corporation has collected about Rs 43 crore and was optimistic about achieving its target by March 31 but the chances of achieving this target might be affected by the measures being taken to prevent the spread of coronavirus",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-closes-tax-department--extends-period-of-rebate-again.html

53,20-3-20,Candid Notes,"Confident CM

Though the State sponsored jamboree on completion of three years in office of Trivendra Singh Rawat government in the Himalayan state was jeopardised by the threat posed by the novel Coronavirus, the Uttarakhand CM is exuberating greater confidence in his action and body language these days than any time during in his three year long stint. The declaration of Gairsain as summer capital of Uttarakhand which at least partially fulfilled long held aspiration of the people of the hill state reflected this self-assurance of his and underlined his ability to take tough decisions. Most recently, he also showed guts (though belatedly) to take the bold measure of removing reservation in promotion in government jobs. CM’s firm assertion that he has freed the fourth floor (CM office) from the clutches of mafia also underlies his unwavering confidence. Though there can be a debate on the achievements and failure of TSR government in these three years, the CM has remained more or less free from any personal taint. There is no doubting the fact that in these three years, TSR has been able to keep the bunch of perennial political troublemakers into a tight lease.

Combating Corona

Enough has been said and written about novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) which so far has spread to 159 countries of the world and which the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared as pandemic. The microscopic COVID-19 however has shown it to the human race- which in pursuit of excellence for its self defined set of goals had the delusion of having conquered the nature- in no uncertain terms about frailty and fallacy of its sense of superiority. Alternatively the scare created by the dreaded disease has also brought the human race closer and has again brought into fore the fighting spirit and never say die attitude of humans. Indian government has so far taken appreciable and bold measures in its pursuit of controlling the spread of disease in the country. Experts opine that next two weeks would be very crucial for a country teeming with 1.36 billion people. The key for success in this grave battle with an invisible enemy is public cooperation as it is the only way for stopping the community level spread of the virus. One should be extremely cautious without becoming panicky and adopt measures like regular hand wash, sanitisation and maintain social distancing. Any symptoms of the disease should be promptly shared with the doctors and their directives including the isolation or quarantine should be strictly followed.

Anticlimax

Overzealousness shown by a prominent politician belonging to the Congress party proved costly when the administration put him into quarantine at his home for going inside an isolation facility where a patient suffering from Coronavirus infection was recuperating. This politician who loves to remain in the thick of things and has an uncanny ability to grab space in media made the error of entering the COVID-19 ward of Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) hospital during a visit. As he usually does, the Netaji had informed media persons beforehand about his plans to conduct a reality check for preparedness of COVID-19. After the visit, the Netaji fired salvo on the administration for showing no concern and lacking in preparedness for combating the dreaded disease. However his attempts to garner political brownie points backfired when the administration sent him to quarantine for being exposed to the dreaded virus.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/candid-notes-candid-notes-2020-03-20.html

63,20-3-20,U’khand Govt restores 1st position to SC in roster,"In an apparent attempt to assuage the hurt feelings of the Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities, the Uttarakhand Government on Thursday restored the earlier practice of keeping the first position in recruitment roster for SC. This decision was taken in the meeting of the state cabinet on Thursday.

The State administration also promptly issued a government order (GO) for restoring the earlier practice of keeping the candidate of SC community on first position in recruitment roster. The order would remain enforced in new recruitment in jobs of Uttarakhand Government, educational institute, corporations and public sector undertakings. In another order the State Government decided to undertake a special recruitment campaign to fill the vacant posts of reserved categories.

These measures are being viewed as government’s attempt to win back the confidence of SC and ST. These communities were annoyed at the state government’s decision to remove the benefit of reservation in promotions on Wednesday.

Roster system

In the new recruitment, a roster system is followed. On September 11 last year, the Uttarakhand Government issued a new policy of reservation roster in government services, corporations, public enterprises and educational institutions.

Under which the first five places in the roster of new recruitment were kept for candidates of general category while the sixth position was earmarked for SC candidates.

In the pattern followed earlier, the first position was kept for SC candidates. Interestingly the decision on roster was taken on the recommendation of a cabinet committee headed by Yashpal Arya. When the SC, ST organisations raised furore on the new system, Arya publically stated that he was not taken into confidence on the issue.

Locals have objected to the gym being named after the actress in the Kanya Gurukul campus. Priest Ujjwal Pandit said that the inauguration of the gym in the name of an actress who has been in controversy is condemnable.

The facility should have been named after any of the great personalities who have passed out from this university or other inspirational figures.

Former president Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya students union Vikram Bhullar said that this is shameful and protests will be staged if the name of the gym is not changed.

65,20-3-20,Corona hits Uttarakhand tourism-based economy hard,"March is the month when the mountain state of Uttarakhand begins to move away from the long winter months towards a lot of activity and excitement regarding preparations for the tourist season whether it be pilgrim, adventure, wildlife or leisure tourism.

This year, the winter has been indeed long with more than 25 rounds of snowfall. The heavy rains and hail storms have affected the crops, causing alarm to farmers. Just as people were thinking of dealing with these conditions, the fear of the novel coronavirus took over and threw a pall of gloom on all tourism –related activities.

The Jhande ka Mela that gives a good boost to the economy of Dehradun every year had to be brought to an abrupt halt as it led to massive gatherings of devotees of the Ram Rai Darbar in the old city. It could have created great danger had it gone on for a month or so. The same fate has met the famous Purnagiri Mela of Tanakpur and Chaiti Mela of Kashipur.

And not just this, a shadow of uncertainty has now fallen on the many yatras that begin in the state from April onwards-the Char Dham Yatra, the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra and the Hemkund Sahib Yatra besides others. Nothing seems to be certain regarding all the major yatras and events in the state on which its economy is greatly dependent.

The Corbett national Park, Rajaji National Park , the Dehradun Zoo and other protected areas in the state have been closed till March 31 at the moment. Even temples like Siddhbali in Kotdwar where people gather in large numbers have been closed for devotees.

There is no chance that the state government wants to take as far as checking the spread of the virus is concerned. People have been advised to stay home as far as possible. As tourism involves a large number of people moving about at various destinations in the state, it has been hit badly just at the beginning of the tourist season. All cultural gatherings have been cancelled or postponed. People in the state are anxious about the consequences which these conditions will have for the tourism-based mountain economy. The hotel and restaurant business is at an all-time low with a bulk of the bookings being cancelled.

As there is still some time before commencement of major yatras, traders and local people are hoping against hope that the situation would improve by then.

Even if the virus is checked by then, people may not have liquidity to undertake the yatras as their livelihoods have been greatly affected by the closing down of economic activity.

Bookings at resorts and camps have been rapidly cancelled in great numbers and most people seem decided not to venture out this summer as anxiety and fear surrounds them the world over. Transporters, hoteliers, camp-site owners and the various traders whose livelihood depends on the tourist season are extremely worried as the fear of coronavirus for them has also brought to them the fear of running into huge losses.

The many boarding schools in the Doon valley that take their students to many camps and resorts during this time have all cancelled their plans.

So, in Uttarakhand these days, one can sense an air of gloom, anxiety, worry and a queer silence which may carry on for quite some time.

However, the hope that very soon-in April-things will begin to look up and perhaps, the losses can be made up to some extent. The Gods of the Devbhumi may shower their blessings on us after all.

Prayers were said at Jageshwar Dham for protection form the virus. And as Lord Alfred Tennyson wrote –“more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of”.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona-hits-uttarakhand-tourism-based-economy-hard.html

76,20-3-20,Let State Red Cross unit be rejuvenated,"On October 29 night, 1999, the Super Cyclone ripped through Odisha and created unprecedented havoc. Kharanta Tutha village was destroyed and the houses were damaged. Basanti Nayak and her husband Khirod took shelter under a tree.

Basanti Nayak was pregnant and was in extreme pain. Khirod took Basanti to the nearest Red Cross cyclone shelter. Immediately, the godown of the cyclone shelter was converted into a labor room. In the shelter a woman named Ambika Jena helped Basanti being a nurse, as she was experienced enough being a mother of five children.

The condition was so worse that the umbilical cord of the new born baby was removed with the help of a coin after sharpening it first. The baby took birth safely thereafter and as he spent the first week of his life in the Red Cross cyclone shelter his father Khirod and mother Basanti kept his name as “Red Cross”.

As per the Government of India report, the 1999 Cyclone was the biggest disaster in south Asia where 10,000 people and 3 lakh animals died. But 40,000 people could be rescued as prior to the cyclone, Odisha Red Cross was able to build 23 cyclone shelters in the coastal area.

In 1936, the Indian Red Cross Society, Odisha State Branch was initiated in our State. The Governors of Odisha were the ex-officio president of Red Cross State branch. From time to time, the presidents give appointment to the State secretaries for the state branch. In the leadership of the State secretaries, the State branch usually functions. Few years ago, the State branch was very active, as mentioned above. Till date, Red Cross State branch has completed 75 cyclone shelters. The State branch along with the cyclone shelters adopted villages, training the people in the field of disaster preparedness and management, first- aid response, youth leadership etc, organizing search and rescue operations, health camps, blood donation camps, conducting relief operations, blood grouping camps, ambulance service, Nirbana service, family counselling services and many more.

The State Red Cross was able to do these types of works with the help of life members and volunteers. There was a monthly life members meeting and from that meeting the secretary chose the active life members and build small different groups and committees like Fund Raising Committee, Relief Committee, Finance Committee, Adopted Village Committee, Purchase Committee etc.

The Red Cross State branch was also managing 55 blood banks in the name and style of Red Cross. But when the Indian Red Cross Society observes its centenary year, the Odisha State branch appears very tired. The organisation is active but the appointed secretaries do not have the determination to carry the organization forward. The president always gave appointment to either a retired person or the officers from the Health department those who have one or two years for retirement. In this case they do not have any interest to do the work; on the other hand, they just want to run the State Red Cross as a Government office.

Red Cross is a voluntary and also member based organization, and true development would happen if the volunteers and members gather together and discuss stuffs which they do not want to agree. So the State branch is on the verge of getting destroyed.

The Odisha Red Cross State branch is a branch of Indian Red Cross Society and Indian Red Cross Society is also a part of the largest humanitarian organization of the world. The renowned Nobel award winner Jean Henry Dunant is the founder of Red Cross. In his initiative the international Red Cross committee formed in 1863 and it was approved by every nations of the world in 1964 through Geneva Convention. Now Red Cross is working in more than 185 countries as the National Society. In our country it is working in the name and style of Indian Red Cross Society.

Now it is 100 years old. During the First World War in 1914, India had no organisation for relief services to the affected soldiers, except a branch of the St John Ambulance Association and by a Joint Committee of the British Red Cross. Later, a branch of the same committee was started to undertake the much needed relief services in collaboration with the St John Ambulance Association in aid of the soldiers as well as civilian sufferers of the horrors of that Great War. A bill to constitute the Indian Red Cross Society, independent of the British Red Cross, was introduced in the Indian Legislative Council on March 3, 1920 by Sir Claude Hill, member of the Viceroy's Executive Council who was also Chairman of the Joint War Committee in India. The Bill was passed on March 17, 1920 and became Act XV of 1920 with the assent of the Governor General on March 20, 1920.

In the 100th year of Indian Red Cross Society, it is a fact that the office bearers are not Red Cross minded or are not able to run the voluntary organisation in a team spirit. Election in Red Cross is the only solution to make it function in a democratic way.

89,20-3-20,Administrative Reforms Commission to take call on para teachers,"The Administrative Reforms Commission (ARC) will take a decision regarding the regularisation of services of the 65,000 odd para teachers – ad hoc teachers appointed under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) – and the Government will work in accordance with the ARC’s recommendation, Chief Minister Hemant Soren said during the Budget Session of Assembly on Thursday.

Replying to a question raised by AJSU Party legislator Sudesh Mahto about the Government’s future course of action in regularising the services of para teachers and regulating their recruitment, Soren said, “The Administrative Reforms Commission has been constituted, and it will take a decision regarding the regularization of services of the para teachers. The Government will work accordingly.”

During the Assembly proceedings, School Education and Literacy Minister Jagarnath Mahto said that the current Government will not use batons to silence the voice of para teachers – a jibe at the former Raghubar Das-led Government, which handled the para teachers’ stir with an iron fist. “We will not lathi-charge our para teachers; neither will we lock them up in jails. This Government is taking the matter seriously, and it will take concrete steps for addressing their issues,” he said.

Sudesh Mahto, however, did not seem satisfied with the answers. He said that the Government was not offering any concrete solution to the problems of para teachers, and only passing politically-correct remarks. “I was expecting a more straightforward answer to my question. Politically-correct answers will dilute the gravity of the matter,” he said.

Para teachers impart education to students in rural and semi-urban areas of the tribal state. Some of the schools, hardly a few kilometers from the State capital’s periphery are run by para teachers alone. These teachers often complain of irregularities in payment of their monthly honorarium, which is around Rs.10,000 for most of them.

Para teachers have been up n arms against the Government since years demanding better pay and regularization of services.

The latest in the series of protests by the teachers was a strike from November 16, 2018 to January17, 2019. On January 17, a delegation of the teachers met representatives of the Government and decided to end their strike after they were assured a pay hike of Rs 4,800 and set rules for regularization of their services, the teachers said.

Education Minister Jagarnath Mahto had earlier said that the Government will consider withdrawing the cases leveled against protesting para teachers during the former Raghubar Das-led Govt. On Thursday, he said that the State needs teachers and the Government knows how to treat them with respect.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/administrative-reforms-commission-to-take-call-on-para-teachers.html

The new system has been put into practice from this year with the help of the district administration to help truck owners, particularly local educated youths, in business to work without hindrances and manipulations of transport unions.

With “first come, first serve”, all Talcher coalfields have “disseminated a ray of hope among in-numerable defenceless and voiceless truck operators of Talcher as hassle-free loading and genuine freight will act as a sheet-anchor for their survival and sustenance,” read an e-mail received by the MCL CMD.

“We have received very positive feedback on ‘first come, first serve’ system placed for road sale of coal,” said the CMD, adding that the truck owners, particularly local youths in transport business, have become direct beneficiaries due to this system.

Educated youths of Talcher have entered into coal transportation as a source of alternate and all-weather employment to earn their livelihood.

96,20-3-20,Legislators demand 150% hike in MLALAD fund,"At least 15 legislators, during zero hour of the State Assembly on Thursday, demanded an increase in the Member of Legislative Assembly Local Area Development (MLALAD) fund from Rs 4 crore to Rs 10 crore annually – a development, which they said, would help the MLAs serve the local people better in the time of inflation.

Legislators Uma Shankar Akela, JP Patel, Kishun Das, Mathura Mahto, Amba Prasad, Aparna Sen, Indrajit Mahato, Kedar Hajra, Biranchi Narayan, Amit Yadav, Lambodar Mahto, Anant Ojha, Alok Chourasia, Narayan Das and Naman Kongari sought the increase in the MLALAD fund during the zero hour. “The MLALAD fund of Rs 4 crore is not enough to ensure all development works in the local area. I therefore request the Government to increase the MLALAD fund to Rs 10 crore annually,” said Congress MLA from Barkagaon, Amba Prasad.

The legislators who sought an increase in the MLALAD fund represented different parties in the house.

Many of them were from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which sits in the opposition in the Assembly. While seeking an increase in the MLALAD fund, some legislators on Thursday also cited the example of the Delhi Government, which in 2018 increased the MLALAD fund from Rs 4 crore to Rs 10 crore. “In Delhi, one MLA represents one lakh people and still their fund was increased. In Jharkhand, one MLA represents at least 3 lakh people, so our development fund should also increase,” said AJSU Party legislator Lambodar Mahto.

Currently, all legislators in the 81-member Assembly here get an annual fund of Rs 4 crore for spending on development works in their respective areas. The legislators may use the fund for developing infrastructure or repair works needed in their area.

An MLA may even use this fund for relief to survivors and victims of mishaps.

Some BJP legislators also staged protest outside the Assembly building on Thursday demanding probe into the alleged hunger death of Bhukhal Ghasi, an unemployed villager of Bokaro district who reportedly died due to hunger. BJP legislators also demanded job and Rs 10 lakh compensation to the family of Ghasi. The legislators stood outside the Assembly carrying posters highlighting Ghasi’s mysterious death and alleged inaction of the Government.

Ghasi, who died in the first week of March, is survived by five children – three daughters and two sons. The Bokaro district administration denied Ghasi’s hunger death and said that he was suffering from some disease. Ghasi’s ration card was in the name of his father, Ramu Ghasi. However, the card had expired after Ramu died, and Bhukhal did not get a ration card on his name.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/legislators-demand-150--hike-in-mlalad-fund.html

This time the summer vacations which are usually a month long will be cut short. Students will be assigned homework through the app and assessments will be conducted online for the time being,” said Ram Singh, Principal of Delhi Public School.

“The results, which were to be declared on March 26 in the school, will now be shared online with the parents and students.

99,20-3-20,Palamu police go for homemade handwash,"Palamu police are neo makers of homemade hand wash. The indigenous preparation has the backing of the SP Palamu Ajay Linda who has taken all the pains to ask his officials and cops down to the traffic constables to do all to keep safe, fit and healthy in time of this fear of coronavirus.

Linda said, “I have shared with my boys and officers on whatsapp to do all to take basic preventive measures in this regard.”

Sadar SDPO Sandip Kumar Gupta said, “Chainpur police station officer in charge Sunit Kumar and his team has prepared a homemade lotion of leaves of neem tree, some alum ( phitkaree) and camphor ( kapoor) which is proving a big hit.”

Sunit Kumar brought a bottle of his homemade lotion saying, “We got leaves of neem tree. We boiled it too hard with alum and camphor. We then left it to sedimentation and then we stir it and our potion is ready.”

Kumar even poured five to six drops of this lotion on the palms of the correspondent asking him to rub it.

The potion was too good with a friendly odour as well.

SDPO Gupta said, “Our Ramgarh police have prepared a similar lotion with charita a medicinal herb.

This shows that cops and officials are concerned about their hand wash.”

Inspector of Chainpur R R Shahi said, “As I am doubling up as sergeant major these days I am driving the order of SP Linda sir right from police drivers to officials to keep hands washed and not to touch anything metallic without any necessity.”

Revolver/pistol/ guns of all varieties are metallic substances and this virus has its favourite seat on metal or metallic substance said doctors in India and abroad and cops and officials have one of these by their waist.

Gupta said, “The Chainpur police station has kept a jar of water with soap for the visitors to hand wash.”

However Sunit Kumar said, “The visitors see these things but skip it and just come in great numbers to the inside of the police station. We ask them not to come in such gathering but their village ethos makes them come in numbers perhaps to show solidarity with the visitor.”

Apart from visitors not doing hand wash despite facilities made available it is the half sleeve uniform of the cops and the officials that is a matter of great concern.

Cops and officials are to wear half sleeve uniform on/ from March 16 butwhen it comes to sneezing in the bended elbow half sleeve uniform comes as a major stumbling block.

ADG Murari Lal Meena said, “It is true cops and officials are to wear half sleeve uniform called ‘asteen moora’ on/ from March 16 but it is a difficult time now because of this coronavirus fear and now sneezing is noticed the hard way and full sleeve called in police jargon as ‘bund asteen’ will be definitely too handy for any cop or official to use his bended elbow for sneezing or coughing either.”",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/palamu-police-go-for-homemade-handwash.html

Ranjit’s mother-in-law also used to harass him for money, according to Jagdish.

108,20-3-20,Urban waste management miserable in State: Poddar,"Rajya Sabha member Mahesh Poddar has expressed concern over the slackness being carried out in the matter of waste management and processing by various urban bodies of Jharkhand. Poddar raised the matter in Rajya Sabha and based on the reply received, he said that the situation of urban bodies of Jharkhand in the matter of waste management is dismal.

While answering Poddar's question, Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Urban Development, Housing and Civil Aviation, Hardeep Singh Puri said that in Jharkhand a total of 2135 metric tonnes of waste is produced per day, out of which a total of 1281 metric i.e. 60 per cent waste per day is processed only. Poddar said that the reply he got in the House is based on the information provided by the Urban Development Department of the state government and it may be different from reality. The situation in Goa, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh etc. is much better.

Poddar said that this is the situation when under the Solid Waste Management that is Solid Waste Management (SWM) Rules, 2016, all the statutory towns / cities of the country have been made compulsory to dispose of their solid waste in a scientific manner.

Under SWM Rules 2016, manure and bio-methanation methods are to be used for wet waste. Material recovery facilities for dry waste.

Refuse Dried Fuel (RDF) plants and waste-to-energy manufacturing plants are to be used.

The insulation method is to be used for processing for domestic hazards waste. But this system is not visible in any urban body of Jharkhand. As far as the Ranchi Municipal Corporation is concerned, there has not been any provision to store dry, wet and domestic hazards waste separately.

There is no shortage of money for waste management, Government of India provides adequate financial support. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission Urban (SBM-U), Central Assistance / Grant-in-aid is provided to the States / UTs up to 35% of the approved SWM project cost. So far, out of the allocation of Rs 7365.82 crore under SWM component, Rs 5109.82 crore has been released to the States / UTs.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/urban-waste-management-miserable-in-state--poddar.html

110,20-3-20,Noose ready for rapists-killers,"Delhi’s Tihar Prison authorities are all set for the execution of the four convicts, in Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, scheduled on Friday at 5.30 am. Several dummy runs have been done and officials are brushing up on details specified in the jail manual, said sources.

This is the first time that four convicts — Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Kumar Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Singh (31) — will be hanged together in Tihar Jail, South Asia's largest prison complex that houses more than 16,000 inmates.

Earlier, the hangman from Meerut Pawan Jallad had reported to the Tihar Jail administration on Tuesday evening to prepare for the exercise.

According to the jail manual, the jail superintendent will oversee the testing of the ropes and also inspect the gallows a day before the execution.

""This will be followed by a dummy execution — a dummy or a bag of sand weighing 1.5 times the weight of the prisoner will be hanged and dropped between 1.830 and 2.440 metres to test the rope"" stated the jail manual.

The execution, specifies the Delhi Prison Rules 2018, will take place in the presence of the superintendent, deputy superintendent, medical officer in charge, resident medical officer and the district magistrate or additional district magistrate.

""A guard of not less than 10 constables, warders and two head constables, head warders or an equal number from the prison armed guard, will also be present. The families of the prisoner will not be allowed to witness the executions. All other prisoners will be kept locked till the exercise is over and the bodies removed from the prison,"" stated the jail manual.

The manual specifies that a medical officer prepares a report four days ahead of the date of execution, mentioning the length of the drop to be given to the prisoner who is to be executed.

""Two spare ropes for each prisoner sentenced to death are kept in reserve. After testing, the rope and other equipment will be locked and sealed in a steel box and kept in charge of deputy superintendent. If the prisoner wants, a priest of his faith may be allowed. On the morning of the execution, the prisoner will be visited by senior officials, including the superintendent, the district magistrate/additional district magistrate and the medical officer, in his cell,"" the manual further stated.

""Any documents, including the will of the prisoner, can be signed and attested in the presence of the superintendent and the district magistrate or additional district magistrate. Just before entering the gallows-enclosure, a cotton cap with a flap will be put on the prisoner's face so he can't see the gallows,"" according to jail rules.

""The wardens will hold the prisoners and withdraw following a signal from the superintendent. After that, the hangman draws the bolt,"" the manual states.

The body of the executed prisoner is disposed of according to the requirements of the religion to which the executed prisoner belonged. It will be handed over the family following a post-mortem. An ambulance shall be used for the transportation of the body to the cremation or burial ground.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/noose-ready-for-rapists-killers.html
111,20-3-20,Court clears decks for hanging on Friday,"Resilience of law signifies inherent safeguards against human errors and not the weakness of law, a Delhi court observed on Thursday while addressing concerns over the efficacy of the rule of law due to the considerable time consumed by the judiciary in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case.

While dismissing a plea filed by three of the four death-row convicts seeking a stay on their execution, Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana said,""When would the convicts meet the Creator for their eternal penitence? The issue has been pestering the conscience of the community for past some time. The time consumed by the process of law has even led some diffident voices to timorously question the very efficacy of 'Rule of Law'.

""Let me inform all the suspecting souls that in this great land of Gautam Buddha and Gandhi, Rule of Law and not impetuous mob mentality, decides the fate of even the most wretched criminals and most abominable crimes. The resilience of law signifies the inherent safeguards against human errors and not the weakness of law"".

The convicts tried to delay the hanging by resorting to all kinds of tactics but in vain as the court on Thursday cleared the decks for Friday's hanging by dismissing the plea as no valid ground was brought to its notice to justify the stay of execution of death warrants.

On March 5, a trial court issued fresh death warrants for 5.30 am on March 20 for the execution of convicts Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

The warrants, which were issued for the first time on January 7, have been deferred four times earlier on the ground that they were yet to exhaust all the legal remedies.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless), was gang raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died after a fortnight.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case. The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

After the pronouncement of the order, Nirbhaya's mother said her daughter's soul will now rest in peace and she had got justice seven years after the gruesome gangrape and murder that shook the nation.""Finally the convicts will be hanged. Now I will get peace,"" Asha Devi said.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/court-clears-decks-for-hanging-on-friday.html
112,20-3-20,Convict Vinay's mother yearns to meet him for one last time,"With the hours ticking away inexorably, hope that her son will be spared the noose is fast slipping but, weary and angry, the woman stigmatised as ""Nirbhaya rapist's mother"" has one last ask — will she be able to get his favourite ""puri, sabzi, kachori"" meal to him?

Her son Vinay Sharma is one of the four men sentenced to be hanged in Tihar Jail at 5.30 am on Friday — seven years-three months after the night of December 16, 2012 when a young woman, who came to be known the world over as ""Nirbhaya"", the fearless one, was gangraped so savagely that she died a fortnight later.

With the hangman conducting a dummy run on Wednesday and the Delhi High Court rejecting yet another appeal by one of them, the execution of the four is all but certain after three postponements.

While the Supreme Court rejected Sharma's curative petition on January 14, his mercy petition was rejected by President Ramnath Kovind in February.

And the woman, who refuses to divulge her name and says she wants to be known only as ""Vinay Sharma's mother"" is increasingly more despairing.

The years of harbouring the realisation that her son is guilty in the horrific crime that made headlines across the globe and dealing with unrelenting media spotlight have clearly taken their toll.

""Who are you? What do you want? There is no one inside. My husband has gone out for work. I am Vinay's mother,"" said the woman outside her home in south Delhi's Ravidas Camp.

With its narrow lanes, shabby quarters and open sewers, the slum colony which represents the capital's seamy underbelly, just next to the upscale government colony of R K Puram in south Delhi, was home to four of the six men convicted of the crime.

And somewhere deep inside, a narrow, congested lane leads to the home of Vinay Sharma. The nameplate reads Hari Ram Sharma and outside is the mother of four, in her 50s but looking older beyond her years, washing clothes on a grimy surface. She doesn't let visitors enter.

""Kya likhoge tum? Kuch hota hai tumhare likhne se (What will you write now? Has anything happened till now with your writing?) If god wants he will be saved,"" she lashed out.

""It is all god's wish. Look at the coronavirus. It is god who decides everything -- who lives and who dies. It is beyond the control of any human. Neither yours, nor theirs,"" she said.

And then there is the glimmer of something resembling hope. ""The jail personnel in Tihar never allowed me to take food or any other thing. But if they allow, this time I would like to take some 'puri', 'sabzi' and 'kachori' for him,"" she asked.

Now, with the end near, she said she will soon be meeting her son in jail, for one last time. The 26-year-old will be hanged along with Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31). On March 5 this year, a trial court issued a fresh death warrant with March 20 as the date.

Of the other two convicted in the case, Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail in 2015 and the sixth, a juvenile, was sentenced three years of punishment in a reform home and released in 2015.

While the widowed mother of brothers Ram Singh and Mukesh Singh has left the locality and gone back to her family in Rajasthan, the families of Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta still live in the slum colony.

The family of Pawan Gupta sells fruits to make a living and refused to talk.

The Nirbhaya case hangs like a shroud over the colony, which looks like just another on a weekday morning -- men leaving for work, children playing, some women washing clothes, others standing around chatting idly. But mention 'Vinay Sharma' or 'Pawan Gupta' and it all changes.

The laughter switched to awkward silences and people began to look away when asked for information on the family.

""Who are you? No, we don't know anything,"" said a woman at the camp as she stopped other women from talking too.

And then some in a group standing close by shared their views, hesitantly at first and then more assertively.

One man forwarded the ""boys will be boys"" theory and the others quickly stepped in to say the sexual assault and murder of the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern -- gangraped on a moving bus -- is a ""horrific mistake"" that merits exemplary punishment.

""People here have been talking about Vinay, Pawan and the other convicts since the unfortunate incident took place on December 16. Publicly most talk in favour of the conviction, but there are a few who would also say things against the punishment and ask if this will end rape in India. Some also ask why other rape convicts were not executed,"" said a nearby tea-seller.

""But one thing we all strongly feel about is how our home has been painted as evil by the media and other big people,"" he added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/convict-vinay-s-mother-yearns-to-meet-him-for-one-last-time.html

Recently at a gram sabha meeting at Hiroli, a village panchayat located in Dantewada where there was a demand for closure of the mines and alleged they were not paid compensation by the state government.

Besides NCL, the other company whose works will be severely impacted is Adani Enterprises appointed by NMDC as a Mine Developer and Operator (MDO) for the mine in December 2018.” said sources in the government. While NCL is yet to respond to the demands, Adani conveyed that they came into picture after bidding in December 2018 and the gram sabha had approved in 2014.

But political sources said that the issue is due to emerging differences between Baghel and State Health Minister TS Singh Deo who was one of the contenders for the Chief Minister post when Congress decimated the BJP's 10 year rule.

“Singh Deo is considered to be the undisputed leader of mineral-rich Sarguja district where most of the mining area falls and has several times lodged his grudges to the party high command against incumbent CM. He had been eyeing for the CM post since Congress came into power. Singh has not heeded to the pleas and interest of the displaced people in mining area citing economic loss to the government, Baghel is all out to protect the interest of the farmers, tribals and affected people. With Adanis already a recognized MDO, connivance between political and business interests in Sarguja Ambikapur mine rich area cannot be ruled out,” said a state government official camping in national Capital to get resolve the crisis.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/c---garh-govt-sent-notice-to-ncl-over-mining-crisis.html

162,20-3-20,"Uddhav stresses on reducing crowd, enforcing work from home","Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Thursday laid stress on minimising crowds in Government and private offices, on board trains public transport buses and at places of worship and strict enforcement of “work from home” policy, and vowed to win “war against virus”, as the confirmed Coronavirus cases climbed to 49 in the State.

On a day when the Chief Minister addressed the people in the state live through social media and appealed to them not to panic and hoard essential commodities and drugs, the state authorities announced that they would screen people for Covid-19 at railway stations, Mumbai-Pune Express Highway and old Mumbai-Pune highway.

Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that if the people did not comply with the Government advisories and appeals to reduce crowds at public places, the state government would have no alternative but enforce a total lockdown in the State.

With four more persons testing positive for Coronavirus in different parts of the state on Thursday, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 rose to 49. Pune and the neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad have accounted for a maximum of 19 cases, the break-up of positive coronavirus cases elsewhere in the State is: Mumbai-11, Nagpur-4, Yavatmal-3, Navi Mumbai-3, Kalyan-3, Panvel-1, Thane-1, Ahmednagar-2, Aurangabad-1 and Ratnagiri-1.

In his social media address to the people across the state, Uddhav said: “What we are witnessing a world war against virus. With the full support of the people across the state, our government has been able to control the pandemic. We will make all-out efforts to win the war that we are waging in the state.”

The Chief Minister said that he had earlier in the day spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, who had promised him that the Centre would extend its support to Maharashtra. “I appeal to people not to panic and hoard essential commodities and drugs,” he said.

A day after his Government decided to restrict the attendance of employees in government offices to 50 per cent and asked the Railways and other public transport operators to limit the services to half the normal capacity, the Chief Minister once laid emphasis on minimising crowds at public places. “After our appeal to the people, the crowds at the places of worship have come down drastically. Though we have taken decision to reduce attendance at government and private offices, I still appeal to the people not to venture out of their home if there was no need. Wherever possible, work at home policy rigorously”.

“Though we are taken remedial measures in a satisfactory manner, we will have to take a lot of precautions since the virus is spreading fast,” the chief minister said.

Uddhav appealed once again to the people with symptoms of Covid-19 to take all precautions. “ The patients who have been stamped and quarantined at home not to step out of their homes,” he said.

Heaping praise on the doctors, medical staff and voluntary organisations engaged in fighting in what he called as “War Against Virus”, Uddhav said: “Our doctors, nurses, bus drivers and voluntary organisations are our soldiers. They are working day and night to help us out. Can’t we extend our co-operation to them by confining ourselves to our homes?”

Calling for fighting the pandemic in a united manner, the chief minister said: “The medical disaster that we are combating is independent of religion and caste that we represent. We have to fight the pandemic as one entity. We should not indulge in any mindless acts at this juncture. Immediately after the outbreak of Coronavirus in China, the government there took several stringent measures to combat the pandemic. No wonder that China has by and large tided over the medical crisis. We also have to tide over this crisis. I request the people to co-operate with the Government in our efforts to fight Covid-19. We shall also overcome this crisis”.

In a related development, the Chief Minister’s office tweeted: “CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has spoken to Hon’ble FM Smt @nsitharaman to consider the postponement for the following: 1. 31/3/2020 last date to file belated return for financial year 18-19 2. 31/3/2020 last date to file revised return for financial year 18-19”.

Meanwhile, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said that to prevent a rapid spread of the coronavirus, the Maharashtra Government was contemplating enforcing total lockdown in Mumbai.

“To ensure against rapid spread of Covid -19, we are considering a total lockdown in Mumbai. Currently, there is partial lockdown in Mumbai. If we choose to go in for a total lockdown, we should have an alternative system in place. If Mumbaikars do not comply with the advisories we have issued to them for reducing crowds, we will have no alternative but to enforce a total lockdown in Mumbai,” Tope said, while participating in an interactive programme organised by a leading Marathi television channel.

Meanwhile, Mumbai’s famed dabbawalas have suspended their tiffin box services till March 31.

163,20-3-20,Digvijay accuses K’taka CM of exerting pressure on police not to allow him to meet rebel MP MLAs,"Congress leader Digvijay Singh on Thursday accused Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa of putting pressure on the State police to not allow him to meet rebel party MLAs from Madhya Pradesh staying here.

Singh said he was confident of taking back most of the legislators if he gets an opportunity to personally talk to them. Accusing the BJP and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of “scripting and executing” the ongoing political crisis in the central Indian state, he appealed to the rebel legislators not to take any step that will favour the JP Nadda-led party.

“I have full sympathy with the DGP Karnataka as he is under tremendous pressure, and my allegation is that the pressure is from the Chief Minister of Karnataka Yediyurappa.

I charge Yediyurappa that he has pressurised the DGP, not to allow me to meet my Congress legislators,” Singh said.

Speaking to reporters here, he alleged police were not allowing him to meet, talk or send letters to MLAs, who are his voters in the Rajya Sabha polls,scheduled for March 26.

Terming the developments as “power game” that the BJP has scripted in the country, Singh said it was “conceived authored and executed” by the party under Amit Shah.

“You people call it as operation lotus, it is nothing but operation money bag. There are huge sums of money, it happened in Karnataka in the past.

I don't know how many of the 22 MLAs have taken the money, so I'm not levelling charge against them, but I have the phone recording of ex-BJP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan and ex-Minister Narottam Mishra offering money to Congress MLAs,” he said.

164,20-3-20,Police bust Hindu activist’s fake plan to gain political mileage,"Fifty-year-old Nandagopal, a businessman who is also the district level office bearer of Hindu Makkal Katchi, had everything, he aspired for. A successful businessman, Nandu as he was known, drove around in a swanky limousine and owned a beautiful house in Tirupur. He was a familiar face in all public meetings held across Tirupur thanks to the 24X7 news channels.

But Nandu aspired for more. When he saw armed commandoes from Tamil Nadu Police guarding senior office bearers like Arjun Sampath, the HMK president, he too felt the need of cops to surround him when he made his public appearances. It is a status symbol worth displaying, Nandu and his associates felt.

Though he tried to get the services of armed cops for his personal security, the District administration and the Government of Tamil Nadu were of the view that Nandagopal does not qualify to be guarded by commandoes. That’s when it happened. Last week, while he was on his way back from a party function, a group of people waylaid him and assaulted him which left Nandu ‘injured seriously’.

The Tiruppur Police probing the case were tense as instances of skirmishes between Islamists and activists of Sangh Parivar were on the high in the district following the recent murder of a Hindu activist. But the cops smelled a rat in the complaint filed by Nandagopal as they always ‘mistrust the obvious’ in all cases. The investigation by the police and questioning of Rudramoorthy, driver of Nandu at the time of attack, spilled the beans.

According to Superintendent of Police Disha Mittal, the attack was planned and conceived by Nandagopal and associates to gain political mileage and some cheap publicity. The driver confessed to the special teams probing the case that Nandagopal thought that the assault story would help him to get the ultimate status symbol, the armed police guards! But Rudramoorthy was not trained in answering the questions put to him by the police.

A case has been registered against Nandagopal for trying to disrupt public order and to create enmity between various religions. The HMK had called for a hartal to protest the attacks on its office bearers and activists by political rivals. But following the investigation by the police, the bandh call evoked no response.

On his part, Arjun Sampath, president, HMK, has ordered a probe by a team of independent professionals including a retired police superintendent into the affair. “If it is found that Nandagopal was staging a drama, he would be expelled from the organisation,” said Sampath.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/police-bust-hindu-activist---s-fake-plan-to-gain-political-mileage.html

The four passengers had arrived from Germany to the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport in Mumbai. Soon after their arrival, they had been ‘stamped’ at Mumbai Airport for a 14-day compulsory quarantine.

The train was stopped at Palghar, the four passengers were offloaded from coach Nos. G4 and G5 and promptly handed over to a medical team there.

Earlier, there were two more instances of suspected coronavirus patients jumping the quarantine from a medical facility in the state.

176,20-3-20,Coronavirus: Retailers seek 3 months grace period for paying statutory dues,"Retailers have urged the government to provide a three-month grace period for depositing statutory dues like GST, advance tax, income tax and provident fund as stores and malls are closed in several cities due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The Retailer Association of India (RAI) has asked the government to help the industry cope with the detrimental effects on their business amid the virus pandemic.

""Allow us 90 days of grace period for depositing all statutory dues, like Income Tax, Advance Tax, GST, ESIC, PF etc. For payments falling due between March 1 and June 30, 2020,"" RAI said in its representation to the government.

It has also sought moratorium of 120 days from banks on installments and interest payments on term loans and credit lines.

""Currently, the Retail Industry is under lock-down. With no revenue flow, the impact is significant... The entire consumption value chain will feel the impact of store closures,"" said RAI.

""There is urgent need for immediate economic stimulus to ensure continuity of retail stores and consumption in India,"" it added.

Meanwhile, the Shopping Centres Association of India (SCAI) has asked for GST rebates to offset the losses on account of lock-downs.

""The implementation of these measures can immensely help the shopping centres and industries... Which are already stressed due to the prevailing financial conditions, in mitigating the effects of this unforeseen and presently untreatable pandemic,"" SCAI Founder Chairman Amitabh Taneja said.

177,20-3-20,BofA sharply slashes India growth forecasts as global recession sets in,"Within two days, brokerage Bank of America Securities has sharply cut the June quarter growth forecast by 90 bps to a low of 3.1 per cent and the full-year India GDP target by 100 bps to 4.1 per cent for FY2021, citing an almost certain global recession due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

On Wednesday, Bank of America Securities India had sharply projected down its June quarter growth by 80 bps to 4 per cent and the March quarter of the current fiscal by 30 bps to 4 per cent, citing the coronavirus-driven shutdowns.

It had also pegged full-year FY2021 growth at 5.1 per cent citing a likely fall in global growth to a low 2.2 per cent.

And Thursday’s forecast is another 90 bps down from the previous projection for the June quarter growth and a full 100 bps for the full-year uptick from 5.1 per cent.

When it comes to the global growth, the same is downgraded by a whopping 180 bps to a paltry 0.40 per cent—all in a span of just two days.

Their house economists Indranil Sen Gupta and Aastha Gudwani expect the pandemic-driven lockdowns to run through end-April, crippling domestic economic activities across the value-chain—again a sterner warning from Wednesday’s projection of the lockdowns ending mid-April.

“We cut our growth forecast by a sharp 90 bps to 3.1 per cent for the June quarter of FY21 and by 40 bps to 4.7 per cent for the full-year. We also see the Reserve Bank cutting 100 bps, up from 75 bps (as of yesterday), in 2020,” the house economists said, adding “we are now calling for a global recession.”

They count the GDP impact on the shutdowns at 50 bps per month. “We estimate a month’s shutdown will cost about 50 bps of annual GDP” and expect the economy to come out only by FY2022 when GDP may print in at 6 per cent.

Explaining the rationale for the doom-scenario, they say a global recession is a reality due to the escalation in the Covid-19 pandemic and the general shutdown in India is seen extending further to the end of April and not mid-April.

Calling for a global recession, the brokerage has sharply cut the 2020 global growth forecast by 180 bps to 0.4 per cent—down from 2.2 per cent Wednesday. This will leave the US contracting 0.8 per cent and the global growth engine China plunging to a paltry 1.5 percent in 2020.

Penciling in a 100 bps rate cut through the course of 2020, they say this is needed as the real lending rates are still persisting at high levels for long now as falling demand is curtailing the pricing power of corporates further which in turn will longer the shutdown, speed up global recession.

“In response, we have added a fourth RBI policy rate cut by March 2021. We now see 25 bps cuts each on/before April 3, June, October and December,” they said.

They also warn that the down side risks for the country include elongation of the domestic shutdowns, weakening of corporate balance sheets at a time G-3 central banks are running out of ammunition.

They base their argument to the India troubles, despite it being a domestically-driven economy, to the fact that contagion does still travel through disruptions in financial markets as it was seen in 2008.

On the impact of the high real rates and the falling pricing power, given the steeply falling consumer demand, they said high real lending rates are likely to persist with falling demand curtailing corporate pricing power.

Although nominal MCLR has come down by 54 bps so far, on RBI easing the real MCLR has jumped by 67 bps with wholesale price inflation falling 120 bps.

“Therefore we now expect the RBI to cut rates by 100 bps in FY21 with inflation set to drop to 2.5 percent in 2H of FY21. We see a 25 bps cut each on/before April 3, June, October and December,” say the report, which also sees the RBI infusing USD 38 billion of durable liquidity in FY21 atop the USD 76.4 billion so far.

They also expect a reasonably strong rupee as the reasonably high forex reserves should prevent a speculative attack on the unit.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/bofa-sharply-slashes-india-growth-forecasts-as-global-recession-sets-in.html

181,20-3-20,Finance chiefs vie to inoculate world economy against virus,"Governments and central banks are injecting eye-popping sums into markets and applying emergency policy remedies as they try to salve the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the global economy.

The pandemic which has upended all normal life has seen markets crash as world growth faces its biggest crisis since 2008, and so far investors have largely shrugged off the stimulus efforts as the outbreak engulfs the West.

However, stocks in Europe and the US stabilised on Thursday following new initiative from the European Central Bank, which has faced criticism for not acting more aggressively so far, and another intervention by the Bank of England.

AFP surveys responses by major economies as the coronavirus has spread from China to infect the rest of the world, enforcing national lockdowns and crippling businesses.

After China, Europe is now the epicentre of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak and governments have scrambled to open the spending taps while also closing their borders.

The ECB announced late on Wednesday a surprise $820-billion scheme to buy government and corporate bonds, boosting funds in the system so as to help contain the economic damage from the virus.

The eurozone bank is reviving crisis-era measures to encourage bank lending to companies, but caused some disquiet last week by keeping its borrowing rates on hold.

Meanwhile the Bank of England cut Thursday its main interest rate to a record-low 0.1 percent from 0.25 percent, only eight days after having chopped the interest rate from 0.50 percent. It also plans to buy an additional $235 billion in government and corporate debt.

European governments have stepped up with their own plans, with Chancellor Angela Merkel warning Wednesday that Germany faces its biggest test since World War II.

Berlin has unveiled 550 billion euros in government-backed loans ""for starters"", and suspended legal obligations for firms facing acute liquidity problems to file for bankruptcy.

Britain its providing 330 billion pounds of government-backed loans to businesses, while France will guarantee 300 billion euros in loans to firms and has announced a separate aid package worth 45 billion euros to help businesses and employees cope.

In hardest-hit Italy, the government has promised to deliver a ""very strong injection of liquidity"" into the financial system to generate 340 billion euros in cash flows.

Spain plans to guarantee up to 100 billion euros in corporate loans.

Switzerland's central bank said Thursday it would intervene more strongly to stabilise its franc, while Norway is also considering intervention as the krone plunges.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 6.3 per cent, or more than 1,300 points, to close the day at 19,898.92, its first close below 20,000 since 2017.

The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 5.2 per cent to finish at 2,398.10, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 4.7 per cent to 6,989.84.

The Dow fell as much as 10 percent during the early afternoon, but stocks rallied somewhat near the end of the session as the US Senate passed a USD 100 billion emergency package for free coronavirus testing, sick pay and other benefits related to the crisis.

Economists are slashing their forecasts as more sectors shut down. A note from JPMorgan Chase projected US activity would shrink 14 per cent in the second quarter, while Europe's output would plunge 22 per cent.

""These outcomes are worse than were recorded during the global financial crisis or the European sovereign crisis,"" the note said of the second quarter.

Petroleum-linked shares suffered an especially brutal round as US oil prices plunged 24 percent to USD 20.37 a barrel, its lowest price since 2002 on a demand outlook that worsens by the day.

US automakers were another hard-hit industry, with General Motors losing 17.3 percent and Ford 10.2 percent as the ""Big Three"" shuttered their American production plants because of the virus.

IndiGo operates to 24 international destinations across airports in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, South Asia, China and Turkey.

“After the temporary suspension of all international operations for a week from March 22 announced by the government, IndiGo has grounded as many as 30 aircraft in its fleet. Most of these planes were deployed on overseas routes,"" the airline source told PTI.

IndiGo in a statement neither confirmed nor denied the number, saying that the situation remains fluid but added that some of its aircraft are underutilised.

""The situation remains fluid and it is not possible at this point to give a definite number,” IndiGo spokesperson said in a statement to PTI.

""Owing to government restrictions, IndiGo has had to cancel a number of international services and a proportion of our aircraft are underutilised,” the airline said.

184,20-3-20,"Tulsi Gabbard quits US Presidential race, endorses Biden","US congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard dropped out of the Democratic presidential nomination race on Thursday and immediately endorsed rival Joe Biden as flag bearer heading into the November election against President Donald Trump.

“Today, I’m suspending my presidential campaign and offering my full support to vice president Joe Biden in his quest to bring our country together,” the lawmaker from Hawaii said in an online video message.

“Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he is motivated by his love for our country and the American people.”

Her move leaves frontrunner Biden and leftist Senator Bernie Sanders as the final two candidates in the Democratic race.

Gabbard’s endorsement comes as somewhat of a surprise, given that she was a fierce supporter of Sanders in 2016 and supports his Medicare for All plan for a government health system to cover every American.

But Sanders is under mounting pressure to drop out after performing poorly in several recent primaries including three states swept by Biden this week.

“After Tuesday’s election, it’s clear that Democratic primary voters have chosen vice president Joe Biden to be the person who will take on President Trump in the general election,” Gabbard said.

Amid a wave of sweeping restrictions that have put Israel in near shutdown mode, Netanyahu has managed to postpone his own pending criminal trial, authorize unprecedented electronic surveillance of Israeli citizens and block parliament from pressing ahead with legislation aimed at pushing him from office.

The moves, on the heels of the country’s third inconclusive election in less than a year and under the shadow of Netanyahu’s corruption indictment, sparked leading opposition figure Yair Lapid to tell Israeli citizens that they “no longer live in a democracy.”

“There is no judicial branch in Israel. There is no legislative branch in Israel. There is only an unelected government that is headed by a person who lost the election.

You can call that by a lot of names, it isn’t a democracy,” he said in a recorded video.

The new coronavirus has spread to more than 100 countries, infected more than 217,000 people worldwide and killed more than 8,700.

186,20-3-20,Home is the new workplace,"With social distancing being the need of the hour following the outbreak of COVID-19, here are some CEO mantras to work productively. By Team Viva

It was in 1973 when Jack Nilles, a NASA engineer, coined the term “telecommuting”, which implies using electronics to work remotely. Who knew it would become a necessity or a medium of precaution today? In a time of Coronavirus or COVID-19, home has become the new workplace. Employees, managers and other office staff in metro cities — especially Delhi-NCR — are being asked to work from home to avoid movement and in turn, the spread of the deadly disease. However, making such a protocol work properly could be challenging. Here are a few mantras by different CEOs to do so efficiently.

Roma Priya, founder of Burgeon Law, believes that getting organised, being mindful of creating boundaries between work and personal life are the key to working from home efficiently. She says, “One needs to identify when to work and where to work without getting pulled into domestic chores or personal matters. Start your day early and stick to your regular working schedules every day. Laying out clear guidelines for employees will help employees meet deadlines and check the maximum items of his/her task list. Another important factor is to plan the breaks accordingly and not take leeway or stretch these breaks. One can also utilise the time spent on ordinary days commuting to and fro from work in favour of family time or self-care.”

This is the best option for organisations to ensure that only a few employees have travelled or are in contact with those who have recent travel histories, says Neha Bagaria, founder and CEO, Jobsforher. She adds, “Gather a cross-functional team together that includes business-line leaders, IT, HR, communications and facilities to plan for different scenarios and optimise execution to ensure that there is minimal impact on the business when everyone connects remotely. Ensure that employees have the required equipment at home.”

The absence of face-to-face communication could be frustrating and managing coordinations from different corners are taxing. It’s better to use sharing tools such as G-Suite (drive, sheets, docs, slides) to collaborate live on documents.

Narayan Mahadevan, founder of BridgeLabz, says, “The general notion about working from home is looked upon as less-productive as compared to regular workplace environment. However, if you give a defined start to the day and plan all the tasks as per a time-sheet, achieving targets will become easier. Taking short breaks while staying connected to your colleagues always helps in remote working culture. It’s important to set reasonable daily goals and not to multi-task to get the maximum output. Also, to map the progress, one should create and update a to-do list regularly.”

Well, the key driver of change in the way we work is technology, without which it wouldn’t have allowed us to complete tasks and attend meetings from anywhere in the world, points out Sandip Chhettri, chief operating officer, TradeIndia. He says, “We have developed proper reporting and tracking software to make sure our employees remain focussed on their work. We have also developed a Sales Force Automation App to monitor the activity of our SalesForce, which helps them to work remotely. Working from home not only benefits employees by eliminating their daily commutes but also increases productivity and leads to healthier lifestyles. It’s a win-win situation and employees have more flexibility.”

Shalini Sharma, CEO and founder of MUMYU, who has led two different ventures while working from home and taking care of kids from past eight years, says, “We are backed by a team of 450 WFH women employees and four mainline ones. A WFH setup can be exceptionally successful, only if well executed. The key is communication, which includes transparency among the team, proper flow of information, aggressive approach to connectivity and a regular follow-up. The actual work hours at home can actually turn out to be better than office set-up because of the home environment and support system. We should remember to not let the habit-breaking barrier take over. It takes almost 40 days to get into the habit of working from home but it only takes five to seven days to start falling in routine of it. If you can bear this transition time, you will get through the rest of it.”

Aarti Gill, co-founder of Oziva, says, “Work from home is usually not a very popular choice and implementing it could be challenging for many. However, while we are at it, given the need of the hour, implementing and following a couple of work etiquette remotely can help in efficient working. Most important and effective way to focus on work and be productive at home is treat it like your everyday routine and freshen up and dress and sit for work. You can also declutter and organise your space and turn it into a workstation. Be in touch with your colleagues online.”

Bharath Sastry, CEO of Vistaprint who worked from home for 1.5 years at the beginning of her career when she set up her own startup. She learnt along the way. She says, “It is is essential to be prepared with adequate equipment. Have proper infrastructure for yourself and team, namely laptops, wifi, video/ audio, a suitable chair and table at home.”

Moreover, creating an office-like set up is important. She says, “Work during the day exactly as you would do otherwise at office. Start off at the same time, go through your meetings and actions and end the day as you would do at the office.” And last but not the least is the element of trust when working remotely. “Believe that your team is also working), and trust me they will be,” she adds.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/home-is-the-new-workplace-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/home-is-the-new-workplace.html

It had always been my endeavour to be part of inspiring cinema. I’m very happy that for 10 years, filmmakers trusted me with their vision.”

‘After reading the script (Four More Shots Please 2), I was skeptical about how will they position something that's palatable but at the same time make a bold statement? Another big concern for me was the fact that I had to play a mother. I wasn't ready for this and I had the fear of being typecast into that role, which has happened in past.’

Janhvi said, “I have always had a bit of a sweet tooth. In fact, sometimes I love waking up to ice creams. Whenever my parents were happy with Khushi and me, they would spoil us with candies and chocolates. Which is why, I am happy to associate with the brand. It is such an innovative concept. I am sure it will soon become a crowd favourite.”

Matthew gives message of unity

Hollywood star Matthew McConaughey hopes something good can come out of COVID-19 crisis and that Americans can come together to end years of deep political division.

McConaughey made the observation in a video message posted on Twitter, as bars and restaurants remained shut across cities owing to the coronavirus outbreak, including in New York and Los Angeles.

After telling his followers to take care of themselves and not to “get paranoid” during the crisis, the actor delivered a message of unity. He said, “Let's do our due diligence and take the precautions we need to take care of ourselves and of those around us. Right now, more than ever before, we're more dependent on each other.”",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-03-20.html
188,20-3-20,Not just any speed breaker,"The Coronavirus outbreak has put a dampener on the Indian auto industry’s plans for 2020 and it might get worse before it gets better

The Indian automotive industry had a torrid time in 2019. With new safety regulations driving up prices followed by the need to meet the strict Bharat Stage 6 emission norms, the industry found sales collapsing. While certain models surprised with strong sales, the Kia Seltos, Hyundai Venue and the Maruti-Suzuki Ertiga stood out, several hitherto popular cars saw sales decline. As diesel and petrol prices moved towards parity levels and with BS6 impacting small diesel engines, the product mix of manufacturers was also defying planners expectations. There were some positives though, Hyundai-Kia group’s promotion of small, powerful turbo-petrol engines on their cars, consumers not just adopting automatics but also recognising the difference between types of technology as well as the move to safer cars.

However, the industry had hoped that as 2019 turned to 2020, the third decade of the millennium would be kinder to them. They lined up a whole slew of exciting new cars, from the second-generation Hyundai Creta and the fifth-generation Honda City to several new cars and brands showcased at the Auto Expo that took place in early February. But by then, word was already spreading of a new viral infection doing the rounds in China, the Wuhan fever or what we know as SARS-CoV-2 today. It almost led to the cancellation of the Auto Expo but with some safety measures in place including masks and enough hand sanitiser, the event carried on. It would not have been possible to have held such an event today.

Even six-seven weeks ago, speculation began to rise on whether the Chinese would be able to contain their ‘disease’; many of us who are frequent travellers doubted that. Gradually, it became a pandemic. Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom are all suffering from severe outbreaks but a few nations have suffered more like Italy and Iran. And where illness and death are concerned, the lack of sales is actually an irrelevance but the Indian auto industry really didn’t need this to happen in 2020, especially after the way it suffered in 2019.

Understandably, a few major media drives that were scheduled for this week itself, that of the Honda City and the Hyundai Creta did not happen. This, of course, has had a knock-on impact on the aviation sector and hotels. The automotive sector spends a lot on promotion and marketing. Thanks to the scare of the virus spreading and the talk of social distancing, very few people are visiting showrooms right now. While Hyundai India’s SS Kim told me at the launch of the new Creta that the company is bolstering online sales, the fact is that buyers would want to go check the newer cars at least at a showroom. On the Creta, for example, how will you experience the central arm-rest mounted touch controls for the Air Purifier, which is pretty cool. It is possibly worse for Honda, which unlike Hyundai did not even take part at the Auto Expo and thus, could not even showcase the new City.

While most of us are sure that things will tide over with regards to the virus sooner rather than later, I would warn folks not to treat March 31 as a sort of end-date. The auto industry will not get a reprieve for a while yet. One reason is the globalised nature of this industry and with the contagion continuing in Europe and the United States, the Geneva Motor Show will not be the only major show to get cancelled this year. Forget media drives, the movement of executives, men and materiel will come to a shuddering halt. And even if sales pick up, after a tepid 2019 and weak overall economic sentiment, 2020 already seems like a year best forgotten.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/not-just-any-speed-breaker-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/not-just-any-speed-breaker.html
189,20-3-20,A bubble of hygiene,"The fear of an infection revives demand for traditional French soap

Amid the rapid spread of the new coronavirus across Europe, the hallmark Marseille tradition of soap-making is enjoying a renaissance, as the French rediscover an essential local product.

Serge Bruna’s grandfather entered the then-booming business in the southern port city more than a century ago. His father followed suit, although the family enterprise was requisitioned during World War II, when soap was considered an essential commodity.

Today, Bruna sells soap from the same shopfront on Marseille’s Old Port — wearing a sanitary mask and skintight gloves. “Even though we work in a factory full of virus-repellent soap, it is good to take precautions,” he said.

Bruna’s Savonnerie de la Licorne, which runs four soap shops on the Old Port, a museum and a small factory in the heart of Marseille, has seen its shop sales increase 30 percent and delivery orders quadruple since Italy declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus.

Julie Dinot wears a mask as she attends to customers at the Savonnerie de la Licorne shop on Marseille’s Old Port in Marseille, Southern France. “We had fewer tourists or none at all in our stores,” he said. “On the other hand, (Marseilles residents) were much more frequent visitors and some even came to stockpile.”

The COVID-19 illness causes mild or moderate symptoms in most of those infected but severe symptoms are more likely in the elderly or people with existing health problems. The vast majority of those infected recover.

As the public rushed to buy supplies to last during a looming quarantine, Bruna and his artisans continued making soap by hand, filling the port-view shops as well as boxes destined for export.

With an abundance of local oils, soda and salt, Marseille boasts a lengthy tradition of producing the natural soaps once prized throughout Europe. But only a handful of businesses are still active.

Since French shops were ordered closed this week as a public health precaution, the Savonnerie de la Licorne now only carries out deliveries, supplying pharmacies across France and handling individual orders made online.

“I’m not sure that making our soaps is more important than before, but I would say that people who have lost the habit of using Marseille soap have all of a sudden rediscovered its properties,” he said.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/a-bubble-of-hygiene-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/a-bubble-of-hygiene.html
190,20-3-20,Digging in,"The food story has progressed and gone beyond the simple chicken tikkas and Chinese to a more evolved understanding and in-depth exploration of concepts like sustainable dining and stories behind each dish. By Team Viva

Indians have expanded their culinary boundaries in all directions. Taste and preferences changed along the way and the audacity of experiments rose. With growing urbanisation and millennials staying away from their families, dining at restaurants and cafes that reminded Indian foodies of a meal rustled up at home became the preferred choice. Decline in daily cooking at home due to changing social dynamics and attitude towards cooking has also brought about this transformation and thus powered this longing for ‘ghar ka khaana.’ However, these are just some trends that have created a new normal.

Reaching out to over 150 experts — chefs, thought leaders and food influencers across major cities — a report by Godrej provides on-ground insights on food trends from the four directions — north (Delhi), south (Chennai and Bengaluru), east (Kolkata) and west (Mumbai). Data has been collected from various celebrity chefs, home chefs, professional chefs, food bloggers, health professionals, media professionals, mixologists, nutritionists, restaurateurs, sommeliers, food producers, and many more, who shared deep insights about their respective areas of expertise.

North

Think of the north India and invariably Delhi crosses the mind first. The place is synonymous with butter chicken. This was the been the case, at least until a decade ago. But the past few years have seen a huge shift in the dining habits of north Indians. Regional cuisines have flourished. Punjabi, Sindhi, Khatri, Bihari, Muslim, Kayastha, Baniya, Bengali, North Eastern and even South Indian flavours are being explored in the metros and savoured in smaller towns.

While there is an entire new food universe that has mushroomed which includes concept kitchens, casual diners, clubs, pubs, breweries — you name it and they have it. However, as a region, the north continues to patronise dining out at restaurants and street food outlets but the home chef-driven pop-up concept never took off here.

Even though Delhi remains the epicentre and trendsetter when it comes to the food industry, but, the past few years have also seen smaller cities in the north discovering their own culinary identities. Lucknow is happy to pay a premium for Baghare baigan now, while Chandigarh continues to celebrate Sarson ka saag. Dehradun and Nainital have woken up to the beauty of Jakhiya aloo and Bhang ki chutney and Bihar’s Litti-Choka is setting tongues on fire. Delhi meanwhile is happy to indulge everyone — whatever their preference maybe.

Global warming and pollution have been issues in focus, and this has led to a big shift in focus on sustainability, demand for organic food and back-to-roots dining. Urban farmers are bringing long overdue focus on clean crops and millets; organic grains, and local ingredients are being celebrated, albeit at a niche level.

South

South India comprises the culinary diversity of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Here is a region steeped in rich culinary traditions that continues to influence the dining culture, alongside celebrating new age trends.

All across the South, there has been an inward focus and native micro-cuisines are being celebrated; from the Temple cuisine of Tamil Nadu, to the Gowda cuisine of Karnataka, from the Mapilla food of Kerala, to culinary traditions of Rayalseema in Telangana and more. Large scale movements like Karnataka spear-heading the revival of traditional millets recently or even Kerala’s jackfruit that has become synonymous with the global vegan trend, characterise the region’s food.

Dining, both in and out, have been dynamic here. Bengaluru, celebrates pan-Indian and global trends in equal measures, while adding it own innovative spins. You will find Donne Biryani on brewpub menus just as easily as you would find Nikkei-styled ceviches in Asian restaurants. Chennai, a bastion of traditional food cultures, is increasingly known for great Asian and Japanese cuisine options. Micro-brewing has taken the south, particularly Bengaluru by storm, with Hyderabad picking up pace. Across the Southern states provenance of food is being given importance, alongside a demand for both traditional and modern experiences for the diner to explore.

These experiences range from pop-ups by celebrity international chefs or home chefs championing a lesser known micro-cuisine. It includes thematic tables with story-telling; pairings with a range of beverages and even take-home chefs, pre-prepped food kits and more. Going back to roots with traditional home cooking, right down to the use of cookware particular to a dish or region is also common today.

East

As Eastern and North Eastern cuisines — be it Assamese, Bihari or Oriya — gain prominence nationwide, within the region, native cuisines are being revisited by home cooks and chefs alike, who are digging deeper into region’s culinary and cultural repertoire, breaking existing moulds, challenging stereotypes and presenting a fresh, more nuanced perspective on these cuisines.

Local ingredients and indigenous produce are coming into the limelight not just in the home-dining space but also in the restaurant kitchen. For instance, in Bengal the mounting interest in reviving and espousing the region’s mind-boggling indigenous rice diversity, has encouraged Kolkata restaurants to put a Tulaipanji or a Dudheswar on the menu, instead of the ubiquitous Basmati.

At the same time diners have also grown more inquisitive about the what, how, wherefrom and why of the food they eat. There’s also a growing proclivity for experiential dining with a focus on story-telling. The story behind the food — a slice of history, an anecdote or even a few words on the source of ingredients — is as important as the dish itself. The growing mindfulness around food has also encouraged the spirit of revivalism. Overall it seems that the key to move forward is to look back and dig deep.

West

How far we’ve come! We’ve moved on from Italian, Chinese and coastal cuisine — to Neapolitan, Cantonese, and seasonal sustainable seafood. And this not only in the busiest urban centres of western India, but also in Bhavnagar and in Raigarh, in Udaipur and in Mangalore.

Mumbai, as the commercial and culinary capital of the region, has been long known for its urbane dining scene. It’s a city that knows how to eat well, on and off the streets, at home and outside, in front of the television, at solo tables, at sit-down multi-course dinners, and at decadent half-day-long brunches. In recent years, we enjoy celebrity chef pop ups, we love being fed by talented regional home cooks, we enjoy fancy catering events that offer us flavours from across the globe. And we ask for and have all of this, without taking ourselves too seriously.

But delightful dining can be found beyond the Millenium city and all over the region. Ahmedabad has restaurants and traditional food festivals that are destinations unto themselves; Goa’s restaurant scene has never been more thrilling; Nashik is where we make some of our best wines; Jaipur recently had a chocolate festival.

And so it follows, that, in the last decade, we’re asking for more from our food industry, and we’re getting it. As purveyors and diners, we have access, talent, curiosity and interest. We have knowledge and pride in our regionality and in the quality of our ingredients, as well where they (and we) come from. Mumbai has Latin American and Ethiopian restaurants now, yes, but indeed, we also have Sindhi eateries and food festivals serving Assamese silkworm pupae right alongside our burgeoning craft beer and gin scene.

In the last decade, we’ve gotten better at understanding food, and we’re continuing to get better at understanding ourselves through what we eat.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/digging-in-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/digging-in.html
191,20-3-20,"Coronavirus: RBI to inject Rs 30,000 crore liquidity into market","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will inject liquidity of Rs 30,000 crore through open market operations next week to maintain financial stability in the system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The RBI has decided to conduct purchase of Government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for an aggregate amount of Rs 30,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 15,000 crore each in March, the central bank said in a statement. The auctions would be conducted on March 24 and March 30, it said.

It said, ""With the COVID-19 related dislocations, stress in certain financial market segments is still severe and financial conditions remain tight. The RBI's endeavour is to ensure that all markets segments function normally with adequate liquidity and turnover.""

The central bank infused Rs 10,000 crore through open market operations on Friday.

It will purchase securities with a coupon rate of 6.84 per cent (maturity December 19, 2022); 7.72 per cent (May 25, 2025); 8.33 per cent (July 9, 2026) and 7.26 per cent (January 14, 2029). The RBI said there is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of Rs 15,000 crore set for the operation.

The Reserve Bank reserves the right to decide on the quantum of purchase of individual securities, accept offers for less than or higher than the aggregate amount of Rs 15,000 crore (including due to rounding off) and also to accept or reject any or all the offers either wholly or partially without assigning any reason.

Earlier on Monday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has ""enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures"" needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

In two liquidity-enhancing measures, Das announced another round of $2 billion dollar-rupee swap on March 23, and in another measure, he said the RBI will continue to conduct the long-term repo operations (LTROs) of up to Rs 1 lakh crore as and when the market needs it.

On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for $2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling dollars.

On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth Rs 1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.

OMOs are money market tools to suck or inject liquidity into the system. When there is enough liquidity, the RBI resorts to selling of government securities to take out money supply, while it purchases the same when the market needs the money.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/coronavirus--rbi-to-inject-rs-30-000-crore-liquidity-into-market.html

198,20-3-20,The trick is ‘instant’,"The secret to a great Irish coffee is more than what you’d expect

Last summer, I travelled to Ireland to learn about Irish whisky, a spirit I knew relatively little about. The Irish drink I knew better was Guinness, which I enjoyed occasionally and use to make my favourite Chocolate Chocolate Cake. Turns out, I am not alone in my unfamiliarity with Irish whisky. Today’s Irish whisky industry is relatively young. It all but died out after Ireland gained independence from Britain in 1922. In 1980, there were only two distilleries, Bushmills and Midleton, makers of Jameson and other well-known brands. Today there are 31. Irish whisky, like other whiskeys today, is booming.

Distilleries now are making balanced and nuanced whiskeys that are best sipped slowly like a good scotch, bourbon or rye. Before I got to Ireland, I wondered if Irish coffee there is like German Chocolate Cake in Germany — an American creation. But almost everywhere we went, we were served an Irish coffee. And they were delicious. Way better than anything I had experienced in the States.

These Irish coffees were served in glass Irish coffee mugs, some plain, some fancy and one even cut crystal. The transparent glass and the mug’s telltale shape signaled that it was time for a pick-me-up.

Some versions of Irish coffee in Ireland were simple and plain, strong with whisky. Others had been accessorised with a sprinkle of cocoa or cinnamon and sweetened with vanilla-bean syrup, chocolate or caramel like a fancy coffee drink. They were all good, but for me, one stood out.

After lunch one day, we went to the Stag’s Head pub in Dublin. It sits at the end of a pedestrian street and has been a beloved part of the Dublin landscape for 250 years this year. It is a warm, convivial space, the perfect place to experience a neat Irish whisky with ½-pint of Guinness on the side — my favourite order during my trip.

After consuming my first round, I ordered an Irish coffee “in the name of research.” I was not disappointed. The coffee was flavourful but light, not bitter at all. It complemented and softened the sharp Irish whisky; when you sipped it through the rich pillows of fresh, thickened cream, the bite of the whisky was tamed, and it was heavenly.

The Irish Coffee was so exceptional that I asked the manager of the pub for the secret. He was hesitant at first to tell me, and then said I wouldn’t believe it. I anticipated that he was going to say it was Ireland’s exceptional cream. But that wasn’t it.

The secret to a great Irish Coffee, it turns out, is instant coffee. That’s right, the instant coffee you can get at the grocery store. He told me you can’t use coffee that is too strong, too flavourful or, in his words, too “good.” Those coffees will upset the balance of the drink.

So, you need instant coffee, Irish whisky and the best cream you can find, thickened but not whipped. Layer the coffee, whisky and cream in that order in a tall mug. In Ireland, they use a heatproof glass mug so you can see all the layers. I succumbed and purchased an Irish Coffee mug so I could recreate the experience at home, but you can serve it in any heatproof mug.

When I came home, I started making the Dublin pub’s Irish Coffee with instant espresso powder because that’s what I had on hand. A spoonful of the powder mixed with 5 ounces of boiling water made the base. I added 1 ounce of Irish whisky and a big dollop of thickened, heavy cream. It’s important that the water is boiling, because the cream is cold and will cool off the coffee as you drink it.

This Irish Coffee couldn’t be easier, feels like a treat, and is both relaxing and invigorating, a welcome change from hot tea and hot chocolate when you come in from the cold.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-trick-is----instant----2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-trick-is----instant---.html
199,20-3-20,Anderson fears virus could wreck English season,"England fast bowler James Anderson fears the global coronavirus pandemic could see the domestic and international cricket season abandoned completely.

The England and Wales Cricket Board are due to meet with the 18 first-class counties, possibly by teleconference, in a bid to see whether the existing structure for the 2020 summer can be maintained.

The County Championship is meant to start on April 12 but a delay looks increasingly likely given other sports have called a halt following British government advice to avoid mass gatherings.

“Cricket and sport is not the be all and end all but it is my livelihood, it’s all I know,” Anderson told the BBC’s Tailenders podcast.

“The season is unlikely to start. It’s still a little bit hazy as to what’s going to happen. There’s a chance we might not even bowl a ball this summer.”

Anderson made the last of his 151 Test appearances against South Africa in Cape Town in January before a broken rib saw him miss the last two matches of the series.

The 37-year-old was not selected for the Sri Lanka series in the hope he would be fully fit for the start of the home season. The Lancashire paceman, England’s all-time leading Test wicket-taker, added: “I feel a little bit anxious. Just the not knowing is giving me a bit of anxiety.”

England postponed their tour of Sri Lanka last week. They are next meant to play the West Indies in a three-Test home series, starting on June 4.

But if that is not possible, Cricket West Indies have offered to stage the series in the Caribbean.

“The Covid 19 has definitely thrown everything off track. The first focus would be to stay healthy and be safe during this period. As we’ve travelled so much, I am not going out and mostly sticking to staying at home,” Ponappa, a Red Bull athlete, was quoted as saying in a statement issued here on Thursday.

Ponappa, a two-time Olympian, is working on her finger power and would be doing racket drills in this period.

“In this day and age doing fitness at home to stay fit is possible. So definitely going to be doing exercises using loop bands and therabands and racket drills at home to stay fit and work on some finger power until we can get back on court,” she added.

202,20-3-20,Asian golfers could lose out if Oly go ahead,"The Olympics going ahead in Tokyo this year is “highly unlikely”, the boss of Asian golf said, and proceeding as planned could cost players the chance to qualify.

Asian Tour Commissioner and CEO Cho Minn Thant confirmed that all tournaments across the continent had been suspended until at least the end of May, in line with the US PGA and European Tours.

“I think everyone right now is more in a state of shock, just trying to figure out what they do with themselves,” said Cho, speaking from Asian Tour headquarters in Singapore.

With the prospect of scarcely any competitive golf before the Olympic rankings qualifying cut-off on June 22, Cho said it would be harsh on players from unheralded golf nations.

“Our plan initially was to have about 16 or 17 tournaments before the Olympic cut-off,” Cho said. “Today, we probably have only about four or five Asian Tour players eligible for the Olympics.”

On current rankings, only Thailand’s Jazz Janewattananond and Gunn Charoenkul, the Indian pair of Rashid Khan and Udayan Mane plus Miguel Tabuena of the Philippines would represent the Asian Tour in the 60-strong Tokyo field.

“Given the amount of golf that was left to be played, we were hopeful that more players from nations like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines would have the opportunity to get into the Olympics over the next two or three months,” said Cho.

“Obviously, that’s not going to happen.

“I can understand why they would want to push forward with the Olympics — there’d be huge revenue ramifications on the economy of Japan — but it seems highly unlikely now in my opinion.”Cho said that he hadn’t yet heard of any players suffering financial hardship but acknowledged that a long layoff could have an impact.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/asian-golfers-could-lose-out-if-oly-go-ahead.html
203,20-3-20,"Oly could be delayed, admits athletics chief","World athletics chief Sebastian Coe admitted on Thursday that the Tokyo Olympics could be moved to later in the year by the coronavirus outbreak, but said it was too early to make a definitive decision.

International Olympic Committee chairman Thomas Bach said earlier this week that starting on schedule on July 24 remained the organisation’s goal.

But Coe, who is a member of the Tokyo Olympics Games Coordination Commission, conceded in an interview with the BBC that a delay was possible.

“That is possible, anything is possible at the moment,” said Coe when asked whether the Games could be postponed to September or October.

“But I think the position that sport has certainly taken, and it was certainly the temperature of the room in the conversation I had the other day with the IOC and our other federations, is that nobody is saying we will be going to the Games come what may.

“But it isn’t a decision that has to be made at this moment.”

Coe, who played a pivotal role in securing the Olympics for London in 2012, said postponing the Games until 2021 could present problems.

“That seems on the surface of it an easy proposition, but member federations actually avoid Olympic years often to have their world championships,” he said.

Britain’s retired four-time rowing Olympic Gold medallist Matthew Pinsent called for decisive action.

“On a global front we have other priorities and I think the Olympics should at the very least be saying we should postpone or indeed just cancel at this stage and we’ll talk about postponement later on,” he told the BBC.

“I just don’t think there’s much of a choice at this stage.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/oly-could-be-delayed--admits-athletics-chief.html
204,20-3-20,Aus firm as ex-official says Games impossible,"Australian Olympic chiefs on Thursday reaffirmed plans to send athletes to Tokyo 2020, even as a former top official warned it looked impossible to hold the Games.

Australian Olympic Committee chief Matt Carroll said his organisation was doing everything possible to “fulfil the dreams of Australian athletes in incredibly difficult circumstances”.

“The AOC does not live in a bubble,” he said, after a worldwide phone conference with IOC president Thomas Bach.

“There is a global health crisis. We recognise that people are suffering. Things are changing every day and we must adapt.”

“We gain confidence from the IOC’s overriding principles regarding staging the Games. Namely, to protect the health of everyone involved and support the containment of the virus,” he added.

His comments came as Australia’s chef de mission at the London 2012 Olympics, Nick Green, told the Sydney Morning Herald he doubted the Games can proceed as planned.

“A couple of weeks ago, I was as confident as everyone else, saying the Olympics would go ahead, no problem,” said Green, an Olympic rowing champion.

“I’m pretty robust about it but I don’t have the same robustness in my thinking now. I actually can’t see how the Games can go ahead, to be frank.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-firm-as-ex-official-says-games-impossible.html
205,20-3-20,"Don’t have tournaments, trials till April 15: Ministry advises NSFs","The sports ministry on Thursday advised all national federations to refrain from conducting tournaments and selection trials till April 15 besides asking them to ensure that Olympic-bound athletes are isolated from anyone who is not a part of their training camp.

“All sport organisations and their affiliate units are advised against holding any sports events, including competitions or selection trials till 15th April, 2020,” the ministry said in a letter to the Indian Olympic Association and NSFs, including the BCCI.

It also asked federations to not allow any non-camper athlete, coach or support staff in Olympic training camps without following proper quarantine protocols for COVID-19.

The ministry’s two-point directive states: “No exposure to athlete be allowed from outside in the campus where training is underway.

“No coach, technical/support staff athlete etc presently not in training camp and not staying in the training campus be allowed to interact or mingle with trainee athletes without following quarantine protocols.”

Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju said all precautionary measures are in place to ensure that athletes are protected by the deadly virus.

“We will ensure that no athlete, coach or support staff travel so as to avoid coming in contact with anyone. Any mass gathering is completely prohibited,” he said.

“We have made exceptions only for those who have qualified for the Olympics or are very close to qualifying. They are very, very critical because if they miss their training, then it will have a huge impact on our preparations for Tokyo Olympics,” he added.

“For that also, outsiders are prohibited and strict guidelines are being issued to ensure that.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don---t-have-tournaments--trials-till-april-15--ministry-advises-nsfs.html

207,20-3-20,Team management understands importance of my playing style: Pujara,"Cheteshwar Pujara finds the constant fuss over his strike rate a tad unfair and wants to clarify once and for all that he has got full backing of the team management which understands the “importance” of his style of play.

In the age of slam-bang cricket, Pujara brings delight to the purists of the game by batting on and on without worrying too much about the strike-rate. But to appreciate someone who epitomises patience in Test cricket is may be asking for too much from the “millennials”.

Last week, the soft-spoken 32-year-old from Rajkot found himself at the receiving end again on social media as he laboured his way to 66 off 237 balls in the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal.

To his credit, he overcame fever and throat infection to share a game-changing stand with Arpit Vasavada, helping Saurashtra to their maiden title on the basis of first innings lead.

Whether it is playing for Saurashtra or India, Pujara is used to constant chatter around his strike-rate.

“I don’t think there is too much talk (on the inside). In media, it is described differently but the team management has been backing me on this completely. There is no pressure from the captain, coach or anyone else,” Pujara, who is currently getting much-needed family time due to the COVID-19 outbreak said.

“I just want to clarify that when it comes to strike rate people start pointing towards team management’s take on it but there is no pressure on me at all. The team management understands my style of play and its importance.”

For someone who averages 48.66 in 77 Tests, perception counts for little.

“The question that was asked on social media (during Ranji final) was ‘why am I taking so long to score X number of runs’? Whether I pay attention to that, no, I don’t. My job is to make sure that the team wins at all times.

“People have this tendency to pinpoint one person but it is just not about me. If you look at any Test series where I have scored runs and taken little bit of time, the opposition batsmen, most of them, have consumed same number of balls.

“I know I can’t be a David Warner or Virender Sehwag but if a normal batsman takes time there is nothing wrong in that.”

The entire batting unit had a tough time in New Zealand with the 0-2 loss in Tests marking the end of the international season. Pujara collected five half centuries this season, including one in New Zealand, but could not add to his 18 hundreds.

“People expect big knocks from me. I always challenge myself to score a 100 but to average close to 50 in Tests means you are scoring a half-century almost every second innings.

“My standards are always high and I am not satisfied with the season that I had but I would not call it bad one at all.”

With uncertainty over the upcoming county season in the UK due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Pujara has no game time lined up in the near future. The biggest international assignment for him this season is the tour of Australia and he can’t be more fired up for that.

Rather than focusing on the loss in New Zealand, Pujara looked at the Australian challenge, especially after India’s historic triumph Down Under last year. “It is one of the most important series for us.”

On playing a full-strength Australia this time, he said: “They (Smith and Warner) are important players but if we played the way we played in the last series, we should be able to beat them.

“Fast bowlers have to be fresh and ready for that series and I am sure their workload will be managed. Best part about the tour is that we recently played in Australia (2018-19). I feel that is the biggest advantage for us.”

Pujara acknowledges that no team, including India, is doing consistently well overseas and picked the reducing pool of quality Test cricketers as the reason for this trend.

“The importance of limited overs cricket has increased significantly. You are not getting too many quality Test players. Earlier, there was a lot of importance given to a Test series. Players used to take ample rest before that. Now we see so many injuries during the season.

“If you look India, Australia, England, the pool of players will be not more than 20-25 whereas if you talk about 10 years ago, India used to have 30-50 players who were ready for Test cricket. I am not saying there are no players available. But if they are ready for Test cricket or not, that is the question.”

Over the past 24 months, India have lost Test series in England, South Africa and New Zealand. Pujara said the batsmen’s shot selection could have been better in New Zealand where they were completely outplayed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/team-management-understands-importance-of-my-playing-style--pujara.html
208,20-3-20,Aus cricketers risk getting massive financial jolt,"Australia’s ODI skipper Aaron Finch has said that his country’s cricketers risk getting a massive financial jolt if the IPL and their home season are halted by the COVID-19 pandemic but they have to accept the situation as “we’re all in this together”.

Cricket Australia has already said that it may review the NOCs given to the players for IPL and now the government has imposed unprecedented travel restrictions, which are likely to jeopardise the Australian players’ participation in the postponed T20 league. The event which was to start on March 29, has now been set for April 15.

“That’s the risk you take when you have the revenue-share model, when the organisation takes a hit then so do we. We understand we’re all in this together,” Finch told radio station SEN.

“I’m sure in the long run, everything will be back to normal at some stage. It’s just hard to say when.”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a blanket “do not travel overseas” advisory that will remain in place indefinitely, to help contain the coronavirus pandemic.

At least 17 cricketers have lucrative IPL contracts and a number of off-field positions are also at stake. Australia are also scheduled to host India for a Test series and the men’s T20 World Cup later this year.

Finch, who was scheduled to join India skipper Virat Kohli at the Royal Challengers Bangalore, acknowledged the travel advisory and expressed helplessness in this extraordinary situation.

“We’ve never seen anything like this. That (travel advice) has changed over the last couple of hours. That could change in two weeks or three weeks, it’s hard to plan anything,” he said.

Pacer Pat Cummins had become the highest-paid cricketer during the IPL auction while Steve Smith, David Warner and Glenn Maxwell also grabbed lucrative deals.

Ricky Ponting is head coach of the Delhi Capitals, while current men’s team assistant coach Andrew McDonald has the reins for the Rajasthan Royals.

Former Test batsman Simon Katich is coach of the Kohli-led RCB and is assisted by Tasmanian Tigers chief Adam Griffith.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-cricketers-risk-getting-massive-financial-jolt.html
209,20-3-20,Better if Olympics are postponed: Gopichand,"India’s chief badminton coach Pullela Gopichand believes the Tokyo Olympics should be postponed given the unprecedented crisis that the world is facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“I have my doubts about the Olympics. It is not like it is far away. The preparation has to start now. So, the IOC has to take a call now for everyone to relax,” Gopichand said.

“I think, in the present scenario, with the health scares and all the travel restrictions and all, it is a tough time and at the moment the whole world is thinking about health and safety for its citizens, so I think given the situation it is better if the Olympics are postponed,” he added.

The Badminton World Federation was severely criticised for conducting the All England Championship earlier this month, despite the rapid spread of the deadly disease.

International players, including Saina Nehwal, slammed BWF saying players’ safety was compromised for financial gains and Gopichand also didn’t mince any words.

“Definitely, I think it was a wrong decision on BWF’s part to put the players at risk by hosting the All England,” said Gopichand, who is currently in self-isolation after returning from Birmingham.

There have been calls to extend the Olympic qualification period, which ends on April 28, following the postponement of a number of Olympic qualifiers.

Gopichand, however, feels there are no easy answers and BWF is in a tough spot.

“I think BWF is in a tough spot, any decision will be criticised. When you extend Olympic (qualification) period, you are talking about a lot of things like accreditations, visas, support teams, local associations.

“So it is not easy and there are constraints. Unfortunately it is an unprecedented situation, so we have to follow whatever decision they take.”

The SAI-Gopichand academy in Hyderabad has been shut down till March 31 to contain the virus following the directive of the Telangana state government.

Asked if it will affect the preparations of the Olympic-bound players, Gopichand said, “The players who had come from All England via various places like Dubai, they have to be quarantined. They don’t have any tournaments in April, so till the time it is a two week break from training it is fine. If it extends further then we will have see.

“The players also need some rest, so it is better to stay home and work on fitness.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/better-if-olympics-are-postponed--gopichand.html
210,20-3-20,Indian women’s hockey team plays fearlessly now: Navneet,"The COVID-19 pandemic notwithstanding, the Indian women’s hockey team is going ahead with its plans to resume “intense training” from next week, with striker Navneet Kaur eying an outing at an Olympics which look doubtful at the moment.

The team is grouped in Pool A for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games where they will play against top ranked teams such as the Netherlands, Germany, Great Britain, Ireland apart from South Africa.

“We will play our first match against the Netherlands at the Olympics and quite frankly, we are really excited to play against them because we have not faced them in the past,” an optimistic Kaur said.

“We don’t fear playing against these teams and are focused on preparing well. We are currently undergoing a week-long recovery which involves light gym session, stretching and swimming pool recovery.

“Resting well is also emphasised before we resume intense training from next week,” she added.

She attributed the Indian team’s upswing in recent times to a “change in attitude”.

“Apart from winning important matches, I think there are a lot of other factors that have contributed to this change and one of them being chief coach Sjoerd’s style of play.

“He likes aggression, he has instilled that belief in us that we are a team that can play with good speed in our attack,” she said.

“The chief coach always tells us it’s not over until the last whistle. Even during the half-time of the Olympic Qualifiers, he said we will begin the third quarter as though the scores are 0-0. We have been instilled with that fighting spirit,” she explained.

Fitness had been one of the key factors in the team’s recent performance and Kaur says the team has great awareness about fitness, recovery and diet.

“I also believe our improvement in fitness has been another big factor. Every girl (including new comers) is aware of the importance of fitness, recovery and diet,” added Kaur who scored 10 goals last year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/indian-women---s-hockey-team-plays-fearlessly-now--navneet.html

“Consequently, all matches currently scheduled until 17 May are on hold. FIH will keep on monitoring the situation closely, following the recommendations of the World Health Organization and the decisions of the public authorities.”

214,20-3-20,"In self-isolation, I have found some freedom: Mary Kom","The COVID-19 pandemic has isolated her from the world outside but iconic Indian boxer M C Mary Kom says the forced slowdown of life as usual has also redefined the meaning of freedom for her.

Mary Kom has self-isolated at her Delhi residence since returning from the this month's Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Jordan where she booked herself a second Olympic berth.

The precautionary measure was necessitated by a training trip to Italy before landing in Jordan even though the entire Indian team got COVID-19 negative certificates from the IOC.

""I am chilling, doing my exercises, taking care of my fitness and playing with my children after being away from them for almost one month,"" Mary Kom told PTI in an interview.

""That's the best part of this isolation, I am with my family through the day without having to think of anything. My appeal to everyone is don't panic, try and stay at home if you can and spend time with your family,"" she said.

""In my case, I have felt a sense of freedom with this isolation. I have realised that I am not feeling the stress of a daily schedule right now.""

The six-time world champion is also a sitting Rajya Sabha MP. Does she miss not being in Parliament when it is in session, given that she is among the most regular MPs?

""I hope to attend the last few days of the session. My isolation is till end of this month. Parliament will function for a few more days after that,"" she said referring to the schedule of the ongoing budget session which runs till April 3.

""Right now, all I know is that my children are very happy. For 10-15 days, they have got their mom and that too without any interruption,"" she quipped.

Relaxed she might be at home but Mary Kom said she understands the fear of the virus outbreak, which has killed more than 9,000 people globally.

In India four have died so far and the number of positive cases stands at more than 190 now.

""My children, out of innocence, ask me, 'mama this virus will stay na?' They are happy being at home playing and missing school but I know how serious it is. It is a scary situation and I hope everyone follows the health guidelines. It is crucial that everyone does,"" she said.

""That's the only way we can save ourselves. Everyone has to be careful,"" she added.

""The precautions that I am taking include not giving appointments to anyone right now,"" she further stated.

A five-time Asian champion besides being a gold-medallist at the Commonwealth and Asian Games, Mary Kom would be competing in her last Olympic Games if it goes ahead as scheduled in July-August in Tokyo.

There are growing concerns about the Games' fate with several current and former athletes demanding that IOC put their safety first. The IOC, however, has resolutely stated that the quadrennial showpiece will go ahead on time despite the current crisis.

""I don't think the Games will be postponed or cancelled. It is too huge an event to be shifted just like that. It will cause chaos. In any case, it's not in my hands. So, it's better I don't say much,"" she said.

But will the current situation, in which travel restrictions by most countries have nearly brought the world to a halt, have a bearing on her preparations for Tokyo?

""Some planning is required. I haven't yet made up my mind, Training here is also pretty smooth. There is nothing missing. We will see how the situation is in the next couple of weeks before deciding on whether going outside is an option,"" she explained.

""Till then, everyone please stay at home and don't forget to wash your hands,"" she laughed.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/in-self-isolation--i-have-found-some-freedom--mary-kom-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/in-self-isolation--i-have-found-some-freedom--mary-kom.html
215,20-3-20,4 Nirbhaya convicts executed in Tihar Jail,"The four men convicted of the gang rape and murder of a Delhi woman on December 16, 2012 were hanged in the darkness of pre-dawn on Friday, ending a horrific chapter in India's long history of sexual assault that had seared the nation's soul.



Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am for the savage assault in an empty moving bus on the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who came to be known the world over as Nirbhaya, the fearless one.



This is the first time that four men have been hanged together in Tihar Jail, South Asia's largest prison complex that houses more than 16,000 inmates.



The executions were carried out after the men exhausted every possible legal avenue to escape the gallows. Their desperate attempts only postponed the inevitable by less than two months after the first date of execution was set for January 22.



In last-gasp attempts, one of the convicts knocked on the doors of the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court just hours before the hanging.



In an unprecedented late-night hearing that began at 2.30 AM and lasted an hour, a Supreme Court bench dismissed his last plea.



Finally, the four convicts were hanged at 5.30 am, Director General of Tihar Jail Sandeep Goel said.



After the execution, Nirbhaya's mother told reporters that justice has finally been done and women will definitely feel safer now.



""We will request the Supreme Court to issue guidelines so that no one can adopt delaying tactics in such cases in future,"" she said at her house.



""Our wait for justice was painful and agonising. We appeal for observing this day as Nirbhaya 'Nyay Diwas' (day of justice),"" Nirbhaya's father said.



After raping and brutalising the woman, the men, one of whom was a juvenile at the time, dumped her on the road and left for dead on the cold winter night. Her friend who was with her was also severely beaten and thrown out along with her. She was so severely violated that her insides were spilling out when she was taken to hospital. She died in a Singapore hospital after battling for her life for a fortnight.



Six people, including the four convicts and the juvenile, were named as accused.



While Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail days after the trial began in the case, the juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.



The road to the gallows was a long and circuitous one, going through the lower courts, the High Court, the Supreme Court and the president's office before going back to the Supreme Court that heard and rejected various curative petitions.



The death warrants were deferred by a court thrice on the grounds that the convicts had not exhausted all their legal remedies and that the mercy petition of one or the other was before the president.



On March 5, a trial court issued fresh death warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am as the final date for the execution.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/4-nirbhaya-convicts-executed-in-tihar-jail-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/4-nirbhaya-convicts-executed-in-tihar-jail.html

""This is the victory of whole country. We have to now create a strong system,"" she said in a tweet.

The four convicts --- Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) --- were hanged at 5.30 am.

Tweeting ""Satyameva Jayate"" (truth alone triumphs), Maliwal said justice has won after a long wait of seven years.

217,20-3-20,"Justice has finally been done, women will feel safer now: Nirbhaya's mother","Justice has finally been done and women will definitely feel safer now, Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said after four men convicted of gang rape and murder of her daughter were hanged at Tihar Jail on Friday.

Talking to reporters at her home in Dwarka, she said justice was delayed but not denied, and added they would continue their fight for justice for India's daughters.

""We will request the Supreme Court to issue guidelines so that no one can adopt delaying tactics in such cases in future,"" she said, referring to the execution of death warrants being deferred thrice by a court on various grounds.

She said women will definitely feel safer after this execution and it will also make parents teach boys to behave with women. ""After a long agonising wait, my daughter has got justice,"" she said.

""After the Supreme Court hearing last night, I came home and hugged a portrait of my daughter and told her - 'beti nyay dila diya tumko',"" Asha Devi said, adding, ""March 20 should be celebrated as Nirbhaya Nyay Diwas (day of justice). This day will be written in history books.""

Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) were executed at 5.30 am for the savage assault in an empty moving bus on the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who came to be known the world over as Nirbhaya, the fearless one.

Hours before the execution, Gupta approached the Supreme Court to challenge the rejection of the second mercy petition by the president. In an unprecedented late-night hearing that began at 2.30 am and lasted an hour, an apex court bench dismissed his plea, paving the way for the execution.

The bench also refused to pass any direction allowing Gupta and Akshay Singh meet their family members before they were sent to the gallows.

""Our faith in Constitution or judicial system was getting shaken, but that trust has been restored. This hanging will send a stern warning to criminals to dare not commit such acts,"" Asha Devi said.

""My daughter will now rest in peace,"" said the emotionally overwhelmed mother, appealing to all mothers to report sexual assault cases in family and society to support the daughters.

Nirbhaya's father Badrinath Singh said he and his wife haven't slept a wink, awaiting justice.

""We haven't slept the whole night, running from high court to Supreme Court late night. But, finally, the moment has arrived. Our village in Ballia will now play Holi,"" he told PTI outside their home.

""Our wait for justice was painful and agonising. We appeal for observing this day as Nirbhaya Nyay Diwas ,"" he said.

Women gathered outside the Dwarka home of Nirbhaya's parents did a countdown as the time of the execution of the four convicts neared.

This is the first time that four men have been hanged together in Tihar Jail, South Asia's largest prison complex that houses more than 16,000 inmates. The executions were carried out after the convicts exhausted every possible legal avenue to escape the gallows. Their desperate attempts only postponed the inevitable by less than two months after the first date of execution was set for January 22.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/justice-has-finally-been-done--women-will-feel-safer-now--nirbhaya-s-mother-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/justice-has-finally-been-done--women-will-feel-safer-now--nirbhaya-s-mother.html

221,20-3-20,Greece hand over Olympic flame,"Greece on Thursday handed over the Olympic flame to Tokyo 2020 organisers at a ceremony held behind closed doors.

In the absence of spectators, Olympic gymnastics champion Lefteris Petrounias ran a lap with the flame and Olympic pole vault champion Katerina Stefanidi lit a cauldron inside the all-marble Panathenaic stadium, where the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.

The flame was then handed to Tokyo 2020 representative Naoko Imoto, a swimmer who competed in the Atlanta 1996 Olympics. Imoto, a UNICEF representative, was reportedly a last-minute appointment as she already lives in Greece and did not have to travel from Japan.

Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou in a statement said the ancient Olympic values of “concord, goodwill, brotherhood... are the weapon to use” against the virus.

Last week’s flame lighting ceremony in ancient Olympia was also carried out without spectators as Greece registered its first death from the virus.

“Regretfully the COVID-19 outbreak made us take hard decisions and change our initial plans. We deeply regret that you... were not able to travel to Greece and join us here today,” Greek Olympic Committee chairman Spyros Kapralos said, addressing Tokyo organisers absent from Thursday’s ceremony.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/greece-hand-over-olympic-flame.html
222,20-3-20,"AFI cancel Indian GP, postpone Fed Cup","The Athletics Federation of India on Thursday cancelled the Indian Grand Prix hours before it was to begin, paying heed to the government’s directive.

The event was scheduled to be held at NIS Patiala.

Next month’s Federation Cup National Senior Championships (April 10-13), a qualifying event for the Tokyo Olympics, has been postponed to a later date.

The development came after hours after the Sports Ministry advised all national federations to refrain from conducting competitions and selection trials till April 15.

Indian athletics’ High Performance Director Volker Herrmann said that the AFI will have to abide by the government’s directive.

“The Indian GP at Patiala will not be held on Friday. It is unfortunate for the athletes who are trying to qualify for the Olympics but the health of Indian people is more important than sports. So, with regret we took the decision to cancel the first Indian GP on Friday. The second GP (also to be held in Patiala on March 25) has also been cancelled,” Herrmann said.

“All sporting events has been suspended till April 15 and the AFI respects the government’s decision in the larger interest of the country and the health and well being of its people,” the German added.

Asked about the status of the Federation Cup, scheduled for April 10-13 in Patiala, he said, “There is no other way for the AFI than respect the government’s decision. Since the suspension of all sporting events remains till April 15, the Federation Cup is postponed.

“We will try to hold the Federation Cup in May or June, depending on the situation (of the COVID-19 pandemic). We cannot say now when it will be held but we have to still keep the options open as the Olympics is still on.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/afi-cancel-indian-gp--postpone-fed-cup.html
223,20-3-20,Athletes returning from high-risk COVID-19 affected nations will be quarantined: Rijiju,"Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Thursday said athletes arriving back from high-risk COVID-19 affected countries will have to be in mandatory quarantine but refused to be drawn into speculation surrounding the IPL and the Tokyo Olympics.

Spelling out the protocol for athletes arriving from the most-affected countries China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Spain, France and Germany, Rijiju said they will have to follow what has been mandated for everyone else.

“Athletes who are coming back from countries which are very prone to coronavirus will be quarantined as per the government provisions. There will be no exceptions. Anybody who has come from abroad is being put in isolation and athletes also have to adhere to it,” Rijiju said while talking to reporters.

Currently, chess ace Viswanathan Anand has self-isolated in Germany after travel restrictions delayed his return to India. Wrestler Vinesh Phogat and javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra are among the sportspersons to have cut short their training stints in parts of Europe to head back due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

They have put themselves in isolation after returning.

He was also asked about Indian boxers, who have been seen at public events since returning from the Asian Olympic Qualifiers in Jordan after training in Italy before that.

“They have been tested and given coronavirus negative certificates by the International Olympic Committee. They are not in any danger but it is advisable that they stay in isolation,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/athletes-returning-from-high-risk-covid-19-affected-nations-will-be-quarantined--rijiju.html
224,20-3-20,Bayern set cyber-training sessions,"Keen to avoid unnecessary travel while maintaining social contact, Bayern Munich have set up ‘cyber-training’ sessions where players work out together online by following exercises streamed from the club’s headquarters.

“We all have to try to deal with the situation in a positive way,” Bayern coach Hansi Flick told the club’s website.

“Yesterday (Wednesday) at 11 am, we had our first ‘Cyber Training’, where the team were coached remotely. Everyone was motivated, everyone did very well.” The state of Bavaria has not yet introduced mandatory confinement measures, but Bundesliga leaders Bayern have decided to keep their players at home in order to best respect the instructions from health authorities.

Flick contends that keeping players in touch on a regular basis is just as essential as the training itself.

“It will be important that we are in contact with one another daily. The whole group is there for training,” said Flick, who directs the sessions which players can follow via their tablets.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bayern-set-cyber-training-sessions.html
225,20-3-20,English football extend shutdown till April 30,"The shutdown of English football was extended until at least April 30 on Thursday after the Premier League and English Football League (EFL) held crisis meetings.

“We’ve collectively agreed that the professional game in England will be further postponed until no earlier than Thursday 30 April,” said a joint statement by the English Football Association, Premier League, EFL, players and managers’ bodies.

UEFA’s decision to postpone Euro 2020 for 12 months earlier this week could allow games to be completed over the summer if strict restrictions on travelling and mass gatherings to halt the spread of COVID-19 are lifted in time.

The leagues still hope to finish the season once play can be restarted rather than accepting the current standings as final or declaring the campaign null and void.

“We’re united in our commitment to finding ways of resuming the 2019-20 football season and ensuring all domestic and European club league and cup matches are played as soon as it is safe and possible to do so,” added the statement.

Even if play can commence in early May, that could mean matches stretching beyond the June 30 goal UEFA agreed on for finishing the season on Tuesday.

The end of June is when many players’ contracts and loan deals expire. However, the English authorities are putting no limit of when the 2019/20 season must be finished by.

“The FA’s Rules and Regulations state that ‘the season shall terminate not later than the 1 June’ and ‘each competition shall, within the limit laid down by The FA, determine the length of its own playing season’.

“However, The FA’s Board has agreed for this limit to be extended indefinitely for the 2019/20 season in relation to Professional Football.”

One option could see the end of the 2019/20 and beginning of the 2020/21 come together with no time for an off-season break.

“Players may need to get their summer break in now before we finish what was the 19/20 season and roll it right into the 20/21 season without a break,” Brighton striker Glenn Murray said.

“Everyone loves sport, everyone loves watching football but I really think the right decision was made in bringing it to a halt.

“At this moment in time it’s pretty irrelevant, people’s health is first and foremost. Once we get over this crisis we can look at sport and getting the Premier League and Football Leagues back in action.”

The sudden shutdown, though, could have long-lasting consequences for many lower league clubs worrying if they will even be able to survive the next couple of months with no income from gate receipts.

A £50 million ($58 million) short-term relief package was announced by the EFL to help stricken clubs on Wednesday.

However, there has so far been no bailout from the Premier League to ensure those further down the pyramid survive.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/english-football-extend-shutdown-till-april-30.html
226,20-3-20,F1 move up mid-season break,"Formula One will observe its mid-season shutdown in March and April instead of late summer due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, while the organisers of the 24 Hours of Le Mans have announced a postponement of the iconic endurance race from June to September.

“In light of the global impact of the COVID-19 currently affecting the organisation of FIA Formula One World Championship events, the World Motor Sport Council has approved a change to the 2020 FIA Formula 1 Sporting Regulations, moving the summer shutdown period from July and August to March and April and extending it from 14 to 21 days,” the Federation Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) said in a statement.

The F1 season was supposed to begin last Sunday in Melbourne with the Australian Grand Prix, but the race was called off just before the start of free practice.

China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, had already postponed the Chinese Grand Prix. Upcoming races in Bahrain and Vietnam have likewise been put on hold.

“All competitors must therefore observe a shutdown period of 21 consecutive days during the months of March and/or April. The change was supported unanimously by both the F1 Strategy Group and F1 Commission,” the FIA said.

The rules require the teams to forgo all race and car-related activity during the shutdown and are even barred from communicating with each other about anything pertaining to performance.

Advancing the shutdown creates the possibility for holding some postponed races in July and August.

Automobile Club de l’Ouest, which organises the 24 Hours of Le Mans, said on Wednesday that it decided, based on consultation with the FIA and the World Endurance Championship (WEC), to postpone the 88th edition of the race from June 13-14 to September 19-20.

“Postponing the 24 Hours of Le Mans from the original dates in June is now the most appropriate way forward in the current exceptional circumstances,” club president Pierre Fillon said.

Putting off the Le Mans event will require adjustments to the WEC and European Le Mans Series (ELMS) schedules.

“It is the right decision to delay in light of the current situation. We are now working on revising our WEC and ELMS calendars for the remainder of this season, and for the WEC’s Season 9, which was due to start in September 2020. We will come back to you in the coming days with more news for both the FIA World Endurance Championship and the European Le Mans Series,” WEC and ELMS chief Gerard Neveu said.

The 24 Hours of Le Mans, first run in 1923, is traditionally held during the 24th week of the year.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/f1-move-up-mid-season-break.html
227,20-3-20,IOA confident of on-time Tokyo Olympics,"Skepticism is sweeping through the world but the Indian Olympic Association on Thursday backed the IOC’s assertion that the upcoming Tokyo Olympics will weather the COVID-19 pandemic and be held on time without a glitch.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Tokyo Games organisers are adamant that the Games will start on July 24 as scheduled despite the coronavirus pandemic crippling health care systems and destroying economies across the world.

“The coronavirus is creating havoc throughout the world but we are hopeful it will be contained in one or two months. It has already been controlled in China, the epicenter of the disease, and we are expecting the Olympics to be held without any hindrance on its scheduled time,” a senior IOA office-bearer said.

“But having said that IOC is our parent body, we will have to abide by what the IOC decides. If the IOC says the Olympics will go on we will have to participate irrespective of any threat,” he said.

The IOC’s stance has angered many athletes, who have accused it of putting them at risk. Some officials have also expressed their apprehension.

Responding to the criticism, the world body on Wednesday conceded that there are no easy solutions for the current situation.

The pandemic has wreaked havoc on Olympic preparations of athletes, including those from India. Several qualifiers have been suspended and training trips abroad are off the table thanks to travel restrictions.

The IOA admitted that country’s preparations have been hit hard but should the Games happen, it is nonetheless expecting an unprecedented double digit medal haul from the athletes.

“Yes, it is true our preparations have been hit with many Olympic qualifiers, Test events and preparatory camps abroad being postponed or cancelled because of the coronavirus,” the official said.

“But it is not just India, every country is facing the same situation so, the impact is same for every competing nation. So, our expectations still remain the same — 10 or more medals in Tokyo,” he asserted. He said the IOA is closely monitoring the situation with all the stakeholders in the country.

“We are monitoring all our athletes’ preparations as well as their well-being.

We are also closely working with the Government of India, Tokyo Games orgainsers as well as IOC in this tough time,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ioa-confident-of-on-time-tokyo-olympics-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioa-confident-of-on-time-tokyo-olympics.html
228,20-3-20,Kamal Nath resigns as MP CM,"Over 15 months after he took over as the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath resigned from the top post on Friday.

His move comes a day after the Supreme Court directed that a floor test be conducted in Madhya Pradesh Assembly to prove that the Congress government led by him enjoys majority in the House following the rebellion by 22 MLAs of his party.

Nath submitted his resignation to Governor Lalji Tandon at the Raj Bhawan here this afternoon.

""He submitted his resignation to the governor,"" a Raj Bhawan official told PTI.

In his resignation letter, Nath said, ""In my 40-year- long public life, I have always done politics of purity and valued democratic norms and given priority to it. But what transpired in the last two weeks is a new chapter of devaluation of democratic values.""

In the letter, he also congratulated new chief minister of the state and said he will also extend help in the development of the state.

Before submitting his resignation, Nath addressed a press conference, where he announced his resignation.

During the press conference, he also accused the BJP of killing the democratic values by conspiring against his government and blamed former Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia for the current political crisis in the state.

""I have decided to submit my resignation to the governor. But I will continue to work for the welfare of the people...I did the politics of value,"" he said.

""I took over as the CM on December 17, 2018. During my political career, I have always believed in development. I was given an opportunity for a period of five years to give a new identity to the state,"" he said.

""The BJP didn't like the people-centric works carried out by my government during our 15-month rule, so they kept conspiring against me,"" he said.

Nath alleged that 22 Congress MLAs were held captive in Bengaluru by the BJP, which has been witnessed by the entire country.

""BJP killed the democratic values by conspiring,"" he said.

""I have proved my majority on the floor of the House several times during the past 15 years...But the BJP betrayed the people of state by destabilising the government,"" he said.

Nath mentioned the works carried out by his government during the last 15 months, including the farm loan waiver and development of cow shelters.

""BJP betrayed the farmers by conspiring against me,"" he said, claiming that 400 promises made in the election manifesto were completed in 15 months.

He said the BJP was afraid of the success of his government.

Blaming Scindia for the ongoing political crisis in the state, Nath said ""BJP colluded with Maharaj (Scindia) for killing democracy and my government.""

Earlier this month, Scindia quit the Congress and joined the BJP. Twenty-two Congress MLAs, who were loyal to him, had rebelled and resigned.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court had ordered the Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker to conduct a floor test by 5 pm.

After Speaker N P Prajapati accepted the resignation of 16 rebel Congress legislators on Thursday night, the Kamal Nath government was reduced to minority with 92-MLAs in the 230-members house. The resignations of six others had been accepted earlier.

Similarly, the strength of the house also reduced to 222, trimming down the majority mark to 104.

In this situation, the BJP has the majority mark with 107.

On Friday morning, the speaker said that he has accepted the resignation of BJP MLA Sharad Kol (Beohari).

But, Kol said that he had applied for withdrawing the resignation submitted earlier. This has further reduced the number of BJP MLAs to 106, but well above the majority mark in current strength.

While the BSP has two members in the House, theSP has one. Besides, them there are four Independents. All these MLAs BSP, SP and independents- had extended their support to the Congress during the formation of government.

In the renewed situation, these MLAs are yet to clarify their stand.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/mp-cm-kamal-nath-announces-his-resignation-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/kamal-nath-resigns-as-mp-cm.html

236,20-3-20,"One of Indian football's greatest, PK Banerjee dies at 83","PK Banerjee, a footballing colossus of his time and a raconteur for life, died here on Friday aged 83, having dribbled and dazzled for a good part of his mind-boggling 51 years of service to the game.

He was suffering from respiratory problems due to pneumonia and had an underlying history of Parkinson's disease, dementia and heart problem. Banerjee, who was on life support at a hospital here since March 2, breathed his last at 12:40pm.

He is survived by daughters Paula and Purna, who are renowned academicians, and younger brother Prasun Banerjee, a sitting Trinamool Congress MP.

Born on June 23, 1936 in Moynaguri on the outskirts of Jalpaiguri in West Bengal, Banerjee's family relocated to his uncle's place in Jamshedpur before partition.

The 1962 Asian Games gold-medallist's best days as a player coincided with Indian football's golden era. He scored 65 international goals in 84 appearances for the national team.

His contribution was duly recognised by FIFA which rated him as India's greatest player of the 20th century, bestowing him with the Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.

From his debut for Bihar in the Santosh Trophy as a 16-year-old in 1952 to a stint as Mohammedan Sporting coach 51 years later, Banerjee takes leave as one of India's greatest.

A member of the holy trinity, that also included Chuni Goswami and Tulsidas Balaram, Banerjee was the last surviving scorer of the 1962 Asiad gold-winning team.

Another one his bright moments with the national team was a fourth-place finish at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, where India beat Australia 4-1.

In the final of the 1962 Asiad, India prevailed in front of a hostile crowd angered by chef de mission Guru Dutt Sondhi's remark that it was 'Jakarta Games', for barring countries like Taiwan and Israel.

Banerjee scored the opener in that game.

He was captain of the Indian team that last played the Olympics in Rome 1960.

He retired as a player in 1967 after being laid low by recurring injuries. But then went on accumulate a staggering 54 trophies as a coach.

He pulled off a heist as Mohun Bagan coach when they famously held New York Cosmos 2-2 in an exhibition match starring Pele in 1977.

The star of Indian football when the sport was at its peak, Banerjee never played for Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, representing Eastern Railways all his life.

""Chakri charle khabo ki (What will I eat, if I quit),"" was Banerjee's famous answer to not playing for the 'Big Two'.

Having started off his Kolkata club career with little success at Aryan FC, Banerjee was rejected by Mohun Bagan after a ""disastrous"" exhibition match against the legendary T Aao-led Manipur.

In Aryan too, he was an ""outcast"" and then coach Dasu Mitra would shower him with the choicest of abuses, something, Banerjee said, had played a part in shaping his career.

""I was seriously thinking of leaving Kolkata and returning to Jamshedpur when Bagha Shome, one of the most respected coaches then, offered me a job in the Indian Railways and an opportunity to play for the Eastern Railway.""

The rest, as they say, is history.

A FIFA-certified coach, Banerjee had a coaching career as illustrious as his playing one, beginning with Bata SC and Eastern Railway.

Having struck gold as a player, a young 35-year-old Banerjee was made a joint India coach with G M Basha, and they delivered a bronze at the Bangkok Asiad in 1970.

Within a year at the helm, Banerjee guided India to a joint triumph at the Singapore Pesta Sukan Cup in 1971.

East Bengal won five CFL titles on the trot under his tutelage.

He also delivered at Mohun Bagan, guiding them to a treble -- IFA Shield, Rovers Cup and Durand Cup -- in 1977.

He was coach of the Mohun Bagan that famously held the then Soviet Union team, Ararat Yerevan, in the 1978 IFA Shield final.

Back at East Bengal, Banerjee oversaw their famous 4-1 win over the arch-rivals in the 1997 Federation Cup semifinal",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/one-of-indian-football-s-greatest--pk-banerjee-dies-at-83-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/one-of-indian-football-s-greatest--pk-banerjee-dies-at-83.html

241,20-3-20,Hafiz Saeed undergoes angioplasty at Lahore hospital,"Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed underwent angioplasty at a hospital here after he complained of chest pain, officials said on Friday.

Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, was last month sentenced to 11 years in jail in two terror financing cases. The 70-year-old fiery cleric was arrested on July 17 and is lodged at the high-security Kot Lakhpat jail here.

“Saeed on Thursday complained of chest pain. Doctors at the Kot Lakhpat Jail Lahore examined him and termed it angina pain. They referred him to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) where he underwent the procedure of angioplasty,” an official of the Punjab government told PTI.

After the procedure, Saeed was shifted to coronary care unit (CCU) of PIC. “Saeed is likely to be shifted back to jail on Saturday,” the official said. The founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba has been kept in the hospital in high security.

Lahore's anti-terrorism court Judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta sentenced Saeed and his close aide Zafar Iqbal to five and a half years each and imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 in each case. A total of 11 years sentence will run concurrently.

The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror financing in different cities of the province.

Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the US, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice. He was listed as a terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.

The US welcomed the conviction of Saeed and described it as an ""important step forward"" for Pakistan in meeting its international commitments to combat terror financing and not to allow non-state actors to operate from its soil.

The crackdown on Saeed's outfit last year followed a warning by the international terror financing watchdog to Pakistan to deliver on its commitments to curb terror financing and money laundering.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hafiz-saeed-undergoes-angioplasty-at-lahore-hospital-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/hafiz-saeed-undergoes-angioplasty-at-lahore-hospital.html

244,20-3-20,"Portable device detects cough, can predict pandemic in making","A team of US researchers has invented a portable surveillance device powered by machine learning called 'FluSense' that can detect coughing and crowd size in real time, analyse the data to directly monitor flu-like illnesses and influenza trends and predict the next pandemic in the making.

The 'FluSense' creators from University of Massachusetts Amherst said that the new edge-computing platform, envisioned for use in hospitals, healthcare waiting rooms and larger public spaces, may expand the arsenal of health surveillance tools used to forecast seasonal flu and other viral respiratory outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or SARS.

""This may allow us to predict flu trends in a much more accurate manner,"" said study co-author Tauhidur Rahman, assistant professor of computer and information sciences.

Models like these can be lifesavers by directly informing the public health response during a flu epidemic.

These data sources can help determine the timing for flu vaccine campaigns, potential travel restrictions, the allocation of medical supplies and more.

The 'FluSense' platform processes a low-cost microphone array and thermal imaging data with a Raspberry Pi and neural computing engine.

It stores no personally identifiable information, such as speech data or distinguishing images.

In Rahman's Mosaic Lab, the researchers first developed a lab-based cough model.

They then trained the deep neural network classifier to draw bounding boxes on thermal images representing people, and then to count them.

""Our main goal was to build predictive models at the population level, not the individual level,"" said Rahman.

From December 2018 to July 2019, the FluSense platform collected and analyzed more than 350,000 thermal images and 21 million non-speech audio samples from the public waiting areas.

The researchers found that FluSense was able to accurately predict daily illness rates at the university clinic.

According to the study, ""the early symptom-related information captured by FluSense could provide valuable additional and complementary information to current influenza prediction efforts"".

Study lead author Forsad Al Hossain said FluSense is an example of the power of combining Artificial Intelligence with edge computing.

""We are trying to bring machine-learning systems to the edge,"" Al Hossain says, pointing to the compact components inside the FluSense device. ""All of the processing happens right here. These systems are becoming cheaper and more powerful.""

The next step is to test 'FluSense' in other public areas and geographic locations.

""We have the initial validation that the coughing indeed has a correlation with influenza-related illness. Now we want to validate it beyond this specific hospital setting and show that we can generalize across locations,"" said epidemiologist Andrew Lover.

Rahman added: ""I thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilize this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends"".",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/portable-device-detects-cough--can-predict-pandemic-in-making-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/portable-device-detects-cough--can-predict-pandemic-in-making.html

Fitch had in December 2019 projected India's growth at 5.6 per cent for 2020-21 and 6.5 per cent in the following year.

In its Global Economic Outlook 2020, Fitch said the number of people affected by coronavirus will keep rising in the coming weeks but that the outbreak will remain contained. However, there are downside risks to this scenario.

""Supply-chain disruptions are expected to hit business investment and exports. We see GDP growth to remain broadly steady at 5.1 per cent in the fiscal year 2020-2021 following growth of 5.0 per cent in 2019-2020,"" Fitch said.

For 2021-22, Fitch projected India's growth to be 6.4 per cent.

""The outbreak of the virus is hitting sentiment, while local governments have rolled out measures to contain the spread of the virus, such as closing schools, cinemas and theatres. While India's linkages with China (e.G. Trade and tourism) are modest, manufacturers in India are heavily reliant on key Chinese intermediate inputs – especially of electronics and machinery and equipment,"" Fitch said.

249,20-3-20,"Trump cancels in-person G7, summit to be held via video-conference","President Donald Trump has scrapped this year's in-person G7 summit set to be held in the US in June due to the coronavirus crisis and will instead hold the high-profile event through video-conference, the White House has said.

The decision comes as countries around the world seal their borders and ban travel to stop the fast-spreading COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed over 9,000 lives so far.

The G7 summit is the latest high-profile event to be cancelled as anxiety over coronavirus puts an end to political gatherings, sports events and musical festivals around the world.

In view of the ongoing coronavirus crisis that has gripped the entire world in an unprecedented way, the G7 summit scheduled to be held at Camp David from June 10-12 has been cancelled so that leaders of these countries can devote their time and energy in addressing the public health challenge, the White House said on Thursday.

""In order for each country to focus all of its resources on responding to the health and economic challenges of COVID-19 and at President Trump's direction, National Economic Council Director and US Sherpa for the 2020 G7 Larry Kudlow has informed his Sherpa colleagues that the G7 Leaders' Summit the US was set to host in June at Camp David will now be done by video-teleconference,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere said in a statement.

""The White House also informed the other G7 members that in order to continue close coordination, the President will convene the leaders' via video teleconference in April and May just as he did this week,"" Deere said.

Early this week, Trump had a video-conference call with G7 leaders, whose members are the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.

In a joint statement, after the video-conference, leaders of G7 acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic was a human tragedy and a global health crisis, which also posed major risks for the world economy.

""We are committed to doing whatever is necessary to ensure a strong global response through closer cooperation and enhanced coordination of our efforts. While current challenges may require national emergency measures, we remain committed to the stability of the global economy,"" they said.

The leaders expressed their conviction that the current challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic needed a strongly coordinated international approach based on science and evidence, consistent with democratic values, and utilising the strengths of private enterprise.

The G7 leaders said they were committed to marshalling the full power of their governments to coordinate on necessary public health measures to protect people at risk of COVID-19; restore confidence, growth, protect jobs, support global trade and investment and encourage science, research and technology cooperation.

In another statement, Deer said Trump spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France and discussed the latest developments and efforts to combat coronavirus.

""The two leaders agreed to continue close cooperation on resolving the pandemic and minimising its economic impact, in coordination with the G7 and other international partners. The two leaders also discussed telecommunications security and European migration issues,"" he said.

A total of 218 people have died in the US due to the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic, while there are 14,299 confirmed infected cases in the country. Coronavirus cases have been reported in all the 50 States in the US and District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico.

Globally, the death toll from the virus has risen to over 9,800 with more than 232,650 cases in 158 countries and territories.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trump-cancels-in-person-g7--summit-to-be-held-via-video-conference-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/trump-cancels-in-person-g7--summit-to-be-held-via-video-conference.html
250,20-3-20,"Italy overtakes China with most virus deaths, California goes on lockdown","Italy has surpassed China as the country with the most deaths from coronavirus as California, home to more than 39 million people, was placed under lockdown in the most drastic containment measure yet by a US state.

President Donald Trump said meanwhile that the United States is fast-tracking antimalarial drugs for use as a treatment and lashed out at China for not informing the world earlier about the original outbreak.

China for its part reported on Friday a second day with no new domestic cases since the virus appeared in the central city of Wuhan in December, before spreading worldwide.

While there was a glimmer of hope in China, several nations tightened their borders and imposed lockdowns, trapping tens of millions of people in their homes.

And the UN chief warned ""millions"" could die if the virus spreads unchecked around the globe.

World leaders also unleashed nearly a trillion dollars to prop up the teetering global economy, only to see the once-in-a-century pandemic seemingly spiral further out of control.

The death toll soared in Europe as Italy announced another 427 fatalities on Thursday, taking its total to 3,405, according to a tally compiled by AFP from official sources.

China has officially reported 3,245 deaths from the virus, which can cause respiratory failure, particularly in the elderly.

France reported 108 more deaths over the last 24 hours, bringing the total number to 372.

Globally, the death toll from the virus has risen to over 9,800 with more than 232,650 cases in 158 countries and territories, according to the AFP tally.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday of the virus's potentially devastating effects.

""If we let the virus spread like wildfire -- especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world -- it would kill millions of people,"" Guterres said.

The number of infections and deaths in the rest of the world has surpassed those in China, which appears to have staunched the virus with strict measures including a complete quarantine of Wuhan since January.

Trump, who has come under fire for his response to the crisis, charged Thursday that the world was paying for China's lack of transparency about the outbreak there.

""It could have been contained to that one area of China where it started. And certainly the world is paying a big price for what they did,"" he said.

Trump said US authorities were fast-tracking antimalarials chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use as a coronavirus treatment, making them available ""almost immediately."" The drugs are synthetic forms of quinine, which has been used to treat malaria for centuries.

As the toll surged in Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the national lockdown, which has been copied around Europe, would be prolonged to April 3.

France also mooted extending its two-week lockdown ordered this week by President Emmanuel Macron, as the interior minister blasted ""idiots"" who flout home confinement rules and put others at risk.

In Argentina, President Alberto Fernandez announced a ""preventative and compulsory"" lockdown from Friday to March 31, while Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state will close its famed beaches as well as restaurants and bars for 15 days to try to contain the pandemic.

California Governor Gavin Newsom said the state's lockdown would begin Thursday evening in a ""recognition of our interdependence."" In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country could ""turn the tide"" on coronavirus within 12 weeks -- but only if people heed advice to avoid social contact.

The disease continued to hit high-profile figures with EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, Monaco's Prince Albert II and at least a half-dozen NBA players in the United States among those testing positive.

Also falling victim to the pandemic was the G7 summit in June, which was meant to be hosted by Trump at the Camp David presidential retreat near Washington. The group of seven wealthy democracies will now meet via videoconference.

With countries paralysed by the pandemic and stock markets imploding, policymakers this week unleashed a wave of measures to shore up the global economy.

The European Central Bank announced a 750-billion-euro bond-buying scheme, dubbed the ""big bazooka."" In the United States, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Congress to pass a USD 1-trillion emergency stimulus package.

Wall Street finished higher Thursday following a volatile session as investors weighed the government stimulus measures against some of the first data pointing to a sharp US economic slowdown.

European stocks staged a rebound on the stimulus news, although Asian markets took another beating.

The battle is only just beginning across the rest of the world, with the shadow of the virus lengthening across Africa.

The Nigerian mega-city of Lagos announced it would shut its schools while Burkina Faso confirmed the first death in sub-Saharan Africa.

Russia reported its first death and even the Pacific nation of Fiji said it had its first case.

252,20-3-20,Janata curfew on Sunday,"PM urges people to stay at home, avoid panic buying, sets up anti-coronavirus economic task force

In his much anticipated address to the nation on Thursday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged people to observe social distancing to reduce the spread of coronavirus and called upon them to observe “Janata Curfew” on Sunday, March 22, from 7am to 9pm by staying inside home, barring those working in essential services sector.

In his 30-minute long television address, Modi reiterated there is no need for panic buying of commodities and asked people not to hoard any item like medicines or food or essential commodities and also avoid hospital visits related to routine checkups.

Modi said that the COVID-2019 pandemic has affected more countries than those affected during the World Wars. Giving the example of a “blackout” during times of war, Modi appealed to people to exercise caution regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic and said citizens over 60-65 years must not step out of their homes.

“People should observe janata curfew. Which means it is a curfew imposed on people, by themselves, for themselves. Avoid travelling out of the house unless it is essential travel. On Sunday, while you are observing the janata curfew, at 5 pm, for five minutes, we must stand outside our houses or in our balconies and clap for those in essential jobs working for us during this pandemic,” Modi said praising the services of professionals like doctors, nurses, medical staff, police, media and others.

“I request the countrymen to avoid visiting hospitals for routine checkups. If you have appointment for any non-essential surgery, please postpone for one month. We should keep in mind that pressure should not come on hospitals,” Prime Minister Modi said.

Urging people to give their time for a few weeks, Modi said every citizen should make others aware of the corona pandemic. The Prime Minister said that while world powers are struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, developing countries like India will find it a big challenge to tackle and curb the infections.

“You might think that you are fine and you will continue to roam around, but that is not right according to me. You have a responsibility to your fellow citizens to take care,” he said.

Modi also strongly advocated the measure of social distancing, and advised staying away from crowds. He also said that companies must allow employees to work from home.

Modi said that “resolution and restraint” are the most important principles in fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic. “Resolution and restraint is very important in combat against this global epidemic. As citizens, people need to strengthen their resolve to follow the advisories issues by State and Central Governments to fight,” he said.

The coronavirus pandemic has also affected economies across the world, the Prime Minister said, adding that the Centre has constituted a ‘COVID-19 economic task force’ which will take decisions regarding the economy in the duration of fighting the pandemic.

“The Government has decided to constitute COVID-19 Economic Response Task Force under Finance Minister. The task force will remain in regular touch with all stakeholders, take their feedback and make decisions accordingly,” he said.

He also appealed to people to allow those in service like domestic helps to take off, and also not cut their pay if they are not able to come to work.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/janata-curfew-on-sunday-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/janata-curfew-on-sunday.html

India will cut itself off from the rest of the world to tackle the coronavirus outbreak as the Government on Thursday took extreme measures ranging from banning all international commercial passenger flights from landing here from March 22 for one week and asking the States to enforce work from home, even in private sectors.

The Government also directed suspension of concessional travel, except for students, patients and divyang.

In the meantime, the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) postponed Class X and XII examinations, which were to start from Thursday itself.

In the meantime, the States continue to report the viral cases which surged to 197 including four fatalities, the latest one from Punjab on Thursday. There were more than 20 fresh cases in last 24 hours with Chhattisgarh and Chandigarh reporting their first COVID-19 patients early on Thursday.

The Centre has requested the States to enforce work from home for private sector employees, except for those working in emergency and essential services.

“State Governments shall issue appropriate directions so that all citizens above 65 (other than for medical assistance) except for public representatives or Government servants or medical professionals are advised to remain at home,” the Government statement noted.

To reduce huge gatherings, all group B and C category of Central Government employees will be asked to attend offices on alternate weeks, and there will be “staggered timings” for all employees.

The move comes after the Central Government allowed its 50 per cent employees to work from home and remaining to have staggered working hours. The Ministry said the Pharmaceutical Department and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs have been asked to take necessary action against anyone charging exorbitant prices for masks, sanitisers and health-related materials.

On the steps being taken on the international front, Joint Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, Dammu Ravi said 201 Indians were evacuated from Iran on Wednesday. “On March 21 Air India would be going to Rome to bring back students or any Indians stranded there. The flight would return on March 22,” said Aviation Ministry Joint Secretary Rubina Ali. The Ministry also stated that Air India will be mounting a 787-Dreamliner to Rome on March 21 to evacuate stranded students and other travellers.

Even as it remained evasive on the cause of the positive case reported from Tamil Nadu, Union Health Ministry said there was no community transmission so far in the country and the fourth death reported from Punjab was that of an elderly person who had co-morbid conditions like diabetes and had cardiac issues.

Amid the rapid spread of the virus, several parts, including Kashmir Valley headed towards a virtual lockdown with the administration restricting movement of people in several parts and banning all public transport in Srinagar city.

254,20-3-20,"Finally, the last dawn for Nirbhaya’s rapists","The four death-row convicts of the December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case will hang on Friday at 5.30 am inside Tihar jail where they have been lodged since their arrest.

Ram Singh, the elder brother of convict Mukesh, who was arrested along with the four other accused — Vinay Sharma, Akshay Singh, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Kumar — had committed suicide in the jail, while a juvenile, who subjected the 23-year-old paramedic girl to unimaginable physical torture, was freed after getting a mild punishment of three years in a Juvenile Remand Home in the national Capital.

Earlier, a Delhi court on Thursday dismissed the plea of three of the convicts seeking stay on the execution.

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Dharmender Rana dismissed the plea of Akshay Kumar, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma seeking stay on the death penalty, who wanted further delay in hanging claiming that the second mercy plea of one of them was pending.

The court was informed by the public prosecutor that second mercy pleas of Akshay and Pawan were rejected on the ground that the first such plea was entertained and considered on merit.

He told the court that advocate AP Singh, counsel for the convicts, was giving false information stating second mercy plea of Pawan was pending and said that all the convicts have exhausted their legal remedies.

Singh also said convict Akshay’s wife has filed for a divorce in a city court in Bihar which was pending, to which the special public prosecutor said any other petition does not fall under the purview of legal remedy in the case.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday refused to entertain the plea of Mukesh, who challenged a Delhi High Court order which rejected his claim that he was not in the city when at the time of crime on December 16, 2012.

A Bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna said the convict has exhausted all his legal remedies and no fresh evidence can be entertained at this level.

The Bench said it does not find any merit in the plea and it cannot be entertained.

The Delhi High Court had on Wednesday said there were no grounds to interfere in the detailed and reasoned order of the trial court. On Tuesday, the trial court dismissed Mukesh Singh’s plea and asked the Bar Council of India to appropriately sensitise his counsel.

The Supreme Court on Thursday also dismissed death-row convict Akshay Kumar’s plea challenging the rejection of his second mercy petition by the President.

A Bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna said no ground was made out in Akshay’s plea for judicial review of the decision rejecting mercy petition.

Akshay had filed the second mercy petition on Wednesday which was rejected by the President on Thursday. He had filed his first mercy plea on January 29 which was rejected on January 31.

On March 5, a trial court had issued fresh death warrants for March 20 at 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of convicts Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

However, takeaway and home delivery services from the eating joints will continue.

Social, cultural and political gatherings with more than 20 people are not allowed across Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

“Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has asked all Government departments, autonomous bodies and PSUs to segregate activities and suspend non-essential services,” Kejriwal told the media.

Non-essential Government services will be discontinued from Friday, he added. “We have succeeded in keeping coronavirus at the containment stage and it is not at community level,” he said.

The CM also asked those directed to undergo quarantine to follow rules or strict action may be taken against them. The coronavirus has claimed one life in Delhi and infected 10 people.

Kejriwal said, “Stay at home as much as you can and work from home. I want to appeal to the private sector institutions to allow their employees to work from home.

“Senior citizens are the most vulnerable of all, and I want to appeal to all the senior citizens to stay at home and avoid going out at all hours.

256,20-3-20,Gogoi takes oath as RS MP amid Opp’s jeers,"Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Thursday took oath as a nominated member of Rajya Sabha amidst chant of “shame, shame” and walkout by the Oppositions MPs.

This is the first time ever that the House witnessed slogan shouting and walkout during an oath taking. House Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu ordered that the slogan shouting will not go on record.

“It is very unbecoming of members of Parliament. No, this is not the way. Nothing will go on record. (It is) very unfair, very unfair,” Naidu said as Opposition members greeted Gogoi with chants of “shame, shame”.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who was among the first to greet Gogoi when he entered the House minutes before the proceedings began, said what Opposition members did was grossly unfair.

After taking oath, Gogoi walked up to the chair to greet Naidu, who responded to his greetings with folded hands. Naidu said members have the liberty to express their views outside the House on the issue.

“You know the Constitutional provision, you know the precedent, you know the power of the President (to nominate a member to Rajya Sabha). You should not do anything in the House. Whatever views you have you are at liberty to express outside,” he said.

Gogoi was nominated to Rajya Sabha by President Ram Nath Kovind in the vacancy created after the retirement of KTS Tulsi. Earlier, Gogoi entered the House from the Chairman’s chamber and greeted members present with folded hands.

During Gogoi’s 13-month tenure, the Supreme Court delivered landmark judgements in the Ayodhya case, on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, the entry of women in Kerala’s Sabarimala temple and the Rafale jet deal along with Assam’s National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The Congress has argued that Gogoi’s nomination to Rajya Sabha “within four months” of his retirement will shake the confidence and faith people have in the independence of the judiciary. The party has also tried to distinguish between Gogoi’s nomination and that of some of his predecessors’ entry into the Rajya Sabha “six to seven years” after their retirement.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/gogoi-takes-oath-as-rs-mp-amid-opp---s-jeers-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/gogoi-takes-oath-as-rs-mp-amid-opp---s-jeers.html
257,20-3-20,Coronavirus: Indian-American doctors seek total lockdown and self-quarantine of US,"Concerned over the rapid spread of the deadly coronavirus across the US, an influential group of Indian-American doctors has urged the federal and State governments to enforce a total lockdown and self-quarantine of the entire nation to flatten the curve of COVID-19 infections.

A total of 218 people have died in the US due to the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic, while there are 14,299 confirmed infected cases in the country. Coronavirus cases have been reported in all the 50 States in the US and District of Columbia as well as Puerto Rico.

Globally, the death toll from the virus has risen to over 9,800 with more than 232,650 cases in 158 countries and territories.

""American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin or AAPI urges the federal, state and local governments and policy makers to advocate for more immediate and severe action to prevent the crisis from becoming unmanageable,"" said Suresh Reddy, AAPI president.

Representing nearly 100,000 physicians of Indian-origin in the United States, AAPI is the largest ethnic medical association in the country.

AAPI members are concerned over the growing COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on its society, healthcare system and economy, Reddy said.

""While applauding our fellow healthcare workers, including physicians, nurses, EMS, paramedics, medical assistants, and healthcare professionals, we are saddened that many of these heroes are being infected with COVID-19 while treating patients and often without personal protection equipment, endangering their safety and that of their families,"" Reddy said.

""We urge the authorities to provide the much needed equipment, testing and facilities enabling them to be isolated and treated, which will reduce our healthcare workforce at precisely the time we need them to be healthy and treating patients,"" he said.

Since the coronavirus outbreak in China's Wuhan city in December, AAPI has had several meetings.

""In our efforts to contain and prevent this pandemic, we are recommending that the authorities across the nation implement and enforce a total lockdown of the nation, social distancing, and enforce self-quarantine of the total population, as has been practised in other countries in order to flatten the infection curve,"" said Deeptha Nedunchezian, chair of AAPI's COVID-19 Response Task Force.

Arunachellum Einstein, member of the AAPI's COVID-19 Response Task Force, said, with as many as 222,642 confirmed corona-virus cases across the world, nearing 10,000 confirmed cases in the US alone and with nearly 10 per cent of those tested for the coronavirus confirmed to be positive for the virus, AAPI is alarmed with the current response from the authorities.

""We are seeing that the rate of infection for COVID-19 in the United States is doubling every 48-72 hours. For each diagnosed case, recent data shows that there are likely 10 undiagnosed carriers who can further infect the population, Einstein said.

Sudhakar Jonnalagadda, president-Elect of AAPI, expressed great concern over the current rate of infections, saying it will have a materially adverse effect on both the senior populations and fellow physicians and healthcare workers who are on the front lines fighting the infection.

""It's essential to create a wholesale expansion of free COVID-19 testing available in order for identifying asymptomatic carries and then isolating them,"" he said.

Anupama Gotimukula, AAPI vice president warned that if the current trend continued without effective action: ""we would likely only see an effect on infection rates in 5-6 days, which means we could expect a tripling of infections and deaths in the interim.""

During the COVID-19 national emergency, which also constitutes a nationwide public health emergency, covered health care providers subject to the HIPAA rules may seek to communicate with patients, and provide telehealth services, through remote communications technologies.

""We appreciate regulations that remove HIPAA requirements for telemedicine to allow easier adaption and implementation,"" said Ravi Kolli, AAPI secretary.

AAPI is urging the government to make telemedicine to be allowed for services and enforce that all insurance companies and government systems reimburse for services provided by medical professionals in these critical times.",india-abroad,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--indian-american-doctors-seek-total-lockdown-and-self-quarantine-of-us-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india-abroad/coronavirus--indian-american-doctors-seek-total-lockdown-and-self-quarantine-of-us.html

No new domestically transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus disease were reported on the Chinese mainland on Thursday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said.

China achieved a new milestone in its efforts to contain the spread of the COVID-19 in the last three months by reporting zero cases on Wednesday.

However, the NHC said on Friday that it received reports of 39 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases on the Chinese mainland on Thursday, all of which were imported taking the total of confirmed cases of people coming from abroad to 228.

Of them, 14 were reported in the Guangdong Province, eight in Shanghai, six in Beijing and three in the Fujian Province. Provincial-level regions of Tianjin, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and Gansu each reported one case.

260,20-3-20,Salman Khan: 'Karan Arjun' is a special film,"It was 1995 when Salman Khan and Shah Rukh Khan shared screen space together for the first time in the film ""Karan Arjun"". Whether it was the 'Mere Karan Arjun ayenge' dialogue or the songs or the actors' performances, the Rakesh Roshan directorial became a huge hit for several reasons.

Reminiscing about the film's 25 year long journey, Salman said: ""'Karan Arjun' is a special film. It is the first time that Shah Rukh and I came together on-screen. I have so many beautiful memories attached to this movie. 'Karan Arjun' is a complete entertainment package and even 25 years after its release, fans can sit together with their families and enjoy it.""

The film also featured Raakhee Gulzar, Kajol and Mamta Kulkarni in the lead roles.

Rakesh Roshan too shared his experience of working on the iconic film.

""When I had written 'Karan Arjun', I knew I had to write a different kind of a story from all the work I had done. Reincarnation as a topic was doing the rounds since the black and white era but when I decided to make a film on the theme but using two brothers, I faced a lot of criticism and rejection. So, I wrote the movie with a different lens like that about a mother-son bond.

""I had immense belief in the story and somehow knew that my audience would feel and believe every dialogue narrated by the characters. The reaction the movie received then and even today is still overwhelming. The fact that a mother's dialogue like 'Mere Karan-Arjun aayenge' got the status it has, is all because of the conviction it was delivered with. If at that time they returned from an unimaginable place, it would have been accepted by the audience. Conviction is the one element that is behind the success of the movie and the milestone being celebrated today,"" Rakesh added.

As ""Karan Arjun"" completed 25 years a few months ago, Zee Cinema will air the movie to celebrate the milestone.

263,20-3-20,Xiaomi stops work on its own chipsets: Report,"Chinese handset maker Xiaomi has pulled the plug on its custom in-house chip project, which was developed by the Pinecone division.

Xiaomi's first proprietary processor -- the Surge S1 -- made headlines back in 2017 as it pushed the Chinese handset maker into the elite group of tech companies like Samsung and Huawei that could develop their own processors.

However, after the Surge S1, we didn't hear much about its chip development progress. The latest information from China suggests that Xiaomi has likely abandoned its chipset project, Gizmo China reported on Thursday.

There were reports that Xiaomi would show off the Surge S2 at MWC 2018 but it never happened.

According to industry insiders, Xiaomi is focusing its attention on other projects which are not as complicated or expensive as developing an application processor. Instead of making smartphone processors, the company is looking to develop low power Bluetooth, RF chips, and other peripheral components, the Gizmo China report added.

Xiaomi's own Surge S1 was essentially a basic 28nm chip that featured stock ARM hardware -- eight Cortex-A53 cores and a quad-core Mali-T860 GPU.

268,20-3-20,China says Trump trying to 'shift blame' for pandemic,"Beijing accused US President Donald Trump on Friday of trying to ""shift the blame"" for the global coronavirus pandemic in an escalating row between the two powers.

Trump charged Thursday that the world is ""paying a big price"" for China's lack of transparency on the outbreak when it emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year.

China has been criticised for suppressing information and punishing whistleblowers during the early stages of the contagion, which an AFP tally shows has now killed nearly 10,000 people with more than 232,000 cases worldwide.

""Some people on the US side are trying to stigmatise China's fight against the epidemic, and shift the blame onto China,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.

""This approach ignores the great sacrifice made by the Chinese people to safeguard the health and safety of humankind, and slanders China's major contribution to global public health."" Geng said China has shared data with the US throughout the health crisis.

The exchange marked an escalation in the bitter war of words between China and the US over the past week.

China's announcement this week of mass expulsions of American journalists sparked a media freedom row that coincided with Trump's ramped-up usage of the term ""Chinese Virus"", which he claimed was in response to Chinese misinformation suggesting that the virus originated in the US.

In recent days, Chinese state media has been heavily critical of Trump.

The nationalistic Global Times claimed in several op-eds that his rhetoric is fanning the flames of global xenophobia and anti-Chinese sentiment.

Trump has defended his description of the virus, saying it was ""not racist at all"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/china-says-trump-trying-to--shift-blame--for-pandemic-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/china-says-trump-trying-to--shift-blame--for-pandemic.html

Users on social media users called her ""irresponsible"" and ""uneducated"" when they got to know that she has reportedly attended several high-profile parties and events after arriving in the country.

""Kanika Kapoor's episode just shows that stardom and money and privilege doesn't guarantee minimum common sense. Their irresponsible behaviour can upset the fight against #coronavirus which till date has been reasonably contained in India,"" a user tweeted.

Another one even asked police to arrest the ""Baby Doll"" singer.

""Horrible Behavior!!! She should be arrested,"" the user added.

Condemning her negligence, a user called her ""uneducated"".

270,20-3-20,At least 24 Afghan security forces killed in insider attack,"At least two dozen Afghan security forces were killed Friday in an insider attack on their base in southern Afghanistan, officials told AFP, as fighting raged in the war-weary country while efforts to start talks with the Taliban stalled.

The pre-dawn attack in Zabul province comes as Afghanistan is grappling with several crises including an increase in Taliban violence that has thrown a supposed peace process into turmoil, mounting coronavirus cases, and a political feud that has seen two men claim the presidency.

The attack in Zabul saw several ""infiltrators"" open fire on their comrades as they slept, according to provincial governor Rahmatullah Yarmal, in one of the deadliest attacks since the US signed a withdrawal deal with the Taliban last month.

The pre-dawn raid targeted a joint police and army headquarters near Qalat, the provincial capital.

""In the attack, 14 Afghan army forces and 10 policemen were killed,"" Zabul provincial council chief Ata Jan Haq Bayan said. He added that four other Afghan service members were missing. ""The attackers had connections with the Taliban insurgents,"" Bayan said.

They fled in two military Humvee vehicles, along with a pickup truck, weapons and ammunition. Yarmal confirmed the toll to AFP.

The Taliban did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zabul province, bordering Pakistan, has long been an insurgent stronghold and was the holdout for former Taliban supreme leader Mullah Omar, who died in 2013. The Zabul attack comes just a day after Afghan Defence Minister Asadullah Khalid called on the Taliban to commit to a ceasefire as a way of tackling the novel coronavirus, which observers fear is spreading unchecked through the impoverished country. Khalid also said Afghan forces should assume a more aggressive ""active defence"" posture against the Taliban, who have continued attacks across the country since signing a deal with the US on February 29.

The continued uptick in violence comes as the US continued to plead with leaders in Kabul to press forward with efforts to engage with the Taliban while resolving their political crisis that has divided the government.

In a tweet marking Nowruz -- the Persian New Year -- Zalmay Khalilzad, the US negotiator who brokered the Taliban deal, called for Afghan leaders to take advantage of the ""historic opportunity for peace"" and work with the Taliban to contain the coronavirus.

Both the Taliban and Afghan government in Kabul continue to bicker over a proposed prisoner swap that was set to pave the way for the opening of talks between the two sides.

The US-Taliban deal said the Afghan government, which was not a signatory, should release 5,000 Taliban prisoners before ""intra-Afghan"" talks start.

President Ashraf Ghani, however, has agreed only to release 1,500, with the remaining 3,500 to be freed as negotiations begin. The Taliban have rejected the offer and the government's release of prisoners did not begin as decreed on Saturday.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/at-least-24-afghan-security-forces-killed-in-insider-attack-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/at-least-24-afghan-security-forces-killed-in-insider-attack.html
271,20-3-20,Acid test for Kamal Nath’s confidence today,"Beleaguered Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamala Nath got just 24 hours to win back the 16 rebel Congress MLAs as the Supreme Court on Thursday directed Madhya Pradesh Assembly Speaker NP Prajapati to convene a special session of the House on Friday for conducting the floor test of the Kamal Nath-led Congress Government. The test must be concluded by 5 pm, the SC said.

A division bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and Hemant Gupta ordered video recording and possible live streaming of the Assembly proceedings when the floor test is conducted.

The bench directed the police chiefs of Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka to provide security to the 16 rebel Congress MLAs if they choose to appear in Assembly for trust vote.

The bench also ordered that the Assembly will have a single point agenda of the floor test and no hindrance is to be created for anyone. It asked the State Assembly Secretary to ensure that there is no breach of law and order.

Earlier in the day, the SC suggested that the Speaker should interact with the rebel Congress MLAs through video link or the court can appoint an observer to allay the fear that the legislators are in captivity. However, the Speaker refused to accept the proposal.

The bench said it can create conditions to ensure that “exercise of volition” of the rebel MLAs is “truly voluntary”.

“We can appoint an observer to Bengaluru or some other place so that the rebel MLAs can connect with the Speaker through video conferencing after which he can decide,” the bench said.

It also asked the Speaker whether any inquiry was made on the resignation of the rebel MLAs and what decision he has taken on them.

Senior advocate A M Singhvi, appearing for the Speaker, said the day court begins to give time-bound direction to the Speaker, it will be constitutionally problematic.

The counsel appearing for Governor Lalji Tandon told the bench that Nath was “sitting aside” in the turn of events and it is the Speaker who is “leading the political battle” in court. The bench asked all the parties how the decision of a Speaker in matters of resignation and disqualification of MLAs affects the floor test.

It said the constitutional principle which emerges is that there is no restraint on trust vote because of resignation or disqualification being pending before the Speaker. It said, therefore, the court will have to flip around and see whether the Governor acted beyond the powers vested in him.

During the hearing, the bench said that if the Government loses the majority when the Assembly was not in session, then Governor has the power to direct the Speaker to summon the Assembly.

“What happens when the Assembly prorogues and the Government loses its majority, then the Governor can call the Assembly,” the bench said.

Singhvi said the Governor has very limited power with regard to functioning of the Assembly and he can only summon, prorogue and dissolve the House, but he cannot intervene into the functioning of Assembly which falls under the purview of the speaker.

The Governor cannot ask the Speaker you should do this, you should not do this, it is beyond his power, he said.",pioneer-exclusive,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/acid-test-for-kamal-nath---s-confidence-today-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-exclusive/acid-test-for-kamal-nath---s-confidence-today.html

Meanwhile, a 69-year-old Italian tourist who had ""recovered"" from the novel coronavirus died at a private hospital in Jaipur after suffering a massive cardiac arrest late on Thursday night, SMS Medical College principal Sudhir Bhandari said.

As coronavirus continued its upward trajectory across the country, the Centre and the state governments faced double-barrel challenge --strengthening its check and prevention mechanism, to contain the spread of the virus and addressing public panic leading to hoarding essential items.

Despite appeals to not hoard items, long lines were seen at grocery stores, pharmacies and other outlets selling other essential stuff, throwing the caution of ‘social distancing' to the wind.

Meanwhile, Traders's body, CAIT said its members across India will keep their establishments shut on Sunday in response to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a self-imposed 'janata curfew'. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said all the malls in the national capital will be closed in view of COVID-19 threat, except for grocery, pharmacy and vegetable stores in them. The Delhi government also issued an advisory for the private sector to allow their employees to work from home till March, and asked people, particulary senior citizens, pregnant women and those affected with hypertension and diabetes, to remain at home.

279,20-3-20,"Coronavirus: RBI to inject Rs 30,000 cr liquidity into market next week","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will inject liquidity of Rs 30,000 crore through open market operations next week to maintain financial stability in the system in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak.

The RBI has decided to conduct purchase of government securities under open market operations (OMOs) for an aggregate amount of Rs 30,000 crore in two tranches of Rs 15,000 crore each in March, the central bank said in a statement.

The auctions would be conducted on March 24 and March 30, it said.

It said, ""With the COVID-19 related dislocations, stress in certain financial market segments is still severe and financial conditions remain tight. The RBI's endeavour is to ensure that all markets segments function normally with adequate liquidity and turnover.""

The central bank infused Rs 10,000 crore through open market operations on Friday.

It will purchase securities with a coupon rate of 6.84 per cent (maturity December 19, 2022); 7.72 per cent (May 25, 2025); 8.33 per cent (July 9, 2026) and 7.26 per cent (January 14, 2029).

The RBI said there is no notified amount against any of these securities within the aggregate ceiling of Rs 15,000 crore set for the operation.

The Reserve Bank reserves the right to decide on the quantum of purchase of individual securities, accept offers for less than or higher than the aggregate amount of Rs 15,000 crore (including due to rounding off) and also to accept or reject any or all the offers either wholly or partially without assigning any reason.

Earlier on Monday, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said the regulator has ""enough policy tools and stands ready to take any measures"" needed to help the economy tide over the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

On March 16, the RBI conducted the first dollar-swap for USD 2 billion under which the central bank buys rupee from the market by selling dollars.

On the LTROs, it has already conducted four rounds worth Rs 1 lakh crore operations since February 14, after announcing it at the February 6 policy review.

OMOs are money market tools to suck or inject liquidity into the system. When there is enough liquidity, the RBI resorts to selling of government securities to take out money supply, while it purchases the same when the market needs the money.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus--rbi-to-inject-rs-30-000-cr-liquidity-into-market-next-week-2020-03-20.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/coronavirus--rbi-to-inject-rs-30-000-cr-liquidity-into-market-next-week.html

Dushyant Singh, an MP from Jhalawar-Baran, also came to the breakfast and interacted with the other MPs. Just two days before this, on March 16, Dushyant Singh had returned from Lucknow after attending Kanika Kapoor's party.

As soon as the news of Kanika Kapoor testing coronavirus positive came on Friday, Vasundhara Raje and Dushyant Singh announced going into self-isolation. But as the news spread, the other MPs who had attended the breakfast got scared. Former Union Minister and Mirzapur MP Anupriya Patel, who was present at the President's breakfast, has also announced going into self-isolation.
