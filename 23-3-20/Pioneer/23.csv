0,23-3-20,Expedite law enforcement,"While a detailed analysis of the Delhi riots would be carried out to fix accountability, there’s a need to usher in the much-delayed reforms in the police and the criminal justice system

Following the recent riots in the national capital, a wholesome praise of the Delhi Police in Parliament by Home Minister Amit Shah should not lull the force into a sense of complacency. For, earlier, the Supreme Court had observed that the violence in Delhi could have been prevented had the police acted independently. The apex court Bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and KM Joseph went on to comment, “Unfortunate things have happened. The problem is the total lack of independence of police.” Very strong words as these were, though only in the nature of obiter dicta, they were widely covered by the print media, aptly reflecting the prevailing state of affairs in the Delhi Police. The Minister of State for Home informed Parliament of the steps taken by the Delhi Police to restore normalcy.

Nevertheless, after the recent appointment of SN Shrivastava as the new Delhi Police Commissioner, it was expected of the force to undertake a detailed analysis of how the riots were handled so as to rectify the weaknesses. In our criminal justice system, police happens to be the fundamental element and the very first point of interface with the public. It is from here that perceptions, right or wrong, are created about the mechanics of delivery of justice.

Earlier, the top court had refused to hear any plea pertaining to the Delhi riots as it observed that these would appear before the Delhi High Court. What transpired at the High Court made national news. The High Court judge, who initially heard the matter and passed urgent orders, was transferred midnight, an ignominy usually meant for errant district officials. On the other hand, the very next day, the Chief Justice of the High Court adjourned the matter for a few weeks. In the face of severe criticism, the Supreme Court had to step in and issue directions to the High Court to list Delhi riots cases on March 6 but again, it was delayed by a few days.

Every action/inaction on the part of the police vis-a-vis its duties towards the public is justiciable. The higher judiciary, in particular, is held in great awe and feared. It also exercises a great deal of moral authority over the system. Any question or query by them in the interest of the public not only sets the right tone and direction for the police but also acts as the guiding principle for future handling of similar situations. As such in the prevailing situation in Delhi, where it was a question of life and death besides home and hearth, the need was for intervention from any level as the police was generally found wanting.

A comparison with the situation post the communal riots in Muzaffarnagar, just a few months before the General Elections of 2014, readily comes to mind. The Supreme Court had handed over a scathing indictment to the State Government. It went on to say, “The State Government was negligent and failed to protect the fundamental rights of the people.” Also, soon after the riots, it intervened and directed the Uttar Pradesh Government to give equal compensation to the victims of all communities. Now much later, riot cases like these are in the process of being systematically withdrawn and where ever the trials are in progress, large numbers of witnesses appear to be turning hostile. Though it is not for the first time that riot cases are being withdrawn but in the matter of communal riots, setting a wrong precedent one after another does not help prevent recurrence and should invite positive judicial intervention.

The initial inaction and delay on the part of the police appears to have sent a wrong message among the rioters. This issue has been extensively debated and commented upon. This became a major factor in leading to a very high toll in the riots. There are numerous instructions and case studies on the subject of handling riots by the police. A calibrated use of force is generally recommended for the dispersal of unlawful Assemblies. However, the situation is different in respect of communal riots where the police is expected to straightaway come down with a heavy hand and bring the situation under control, without waiting for any instruction.

In Delhi, considering the availability of resources, in the normal course, it should be possible to handle a riotous situation in a matter of hours. In the instant case, this did not happen as lumpen elements continued to dominate the force, resulting in a heavy toll. It is not as if the force is unaware of the tactics. For instance, just the other day, by its very swift action and reaching out to people, the Delhi police was able to curtail the spread of rumours and was able to prevent a serious clash in West Delhi area.

It is now understood that a very large number of cases have been registered and a few thousand have been detained. This should have a salutary impact. It is, however, surprising that in spite of the public order being seriously impaired, there has been no detention so far under the National Security Act. There is no dearth of technological resources available to Delhi Police but these can never be a substitute for human intelligence. While developing assets in right places requires a lot of time and patient handling, the role of beat and field staff of the police station would continue to be most important.

The Supreme Court is held in high esteem by all of us. Being the custodian of our Constitution and all the ethical and moral values attached therewith, a responsibility is thus cast on it all the time to uphold the rule of law. Soon after he assumed office, as the Chief Justice of India, Sharad Arvind Bobde had asked various States to file affidavits by February, with suggestions for reforms in the criminal justice system as well as the police.

This matter has been pending since long and needs to be addressed most expeditiously. While the usual post-mortem of the riots would be carried out and accountability would be fixed, it has been felt that we also have an opportunity to usher in the much-delayed reforms in the police as well as the criminal justice system.

1,23-3-20,"Denial, the worst solution","The ‘nothing will happen to us’ brigade partied as if there’s no tomorrow. Except tomorrow will be a huge problem

In South Korea, medical investigators are telling us the story about “Patient 31” of the SARS-CoV2 virus. This middle-aged woman member of a cult in that country behaved very differently from the first 30 patients. She did not isolate herself and instead went around her daily routine, which was to recruit new members into her order. It has turned out that she can be traced back to 80 per cent of South Korea’s 8,000 plus cases. Who will be the “Patient 31” in India? Will it be Kanika Kapoor, the Bollywood songstress who did not self-quarantine and instead went around partying in Lucknow and Kanpur? Will it be the bureaucrat’s son in Kolkata who did not isolate himself? Will it be the man in Kasaragod, Kerala, who met his MLA and attended a football match? Will it be all those who fled quarantine and bled into the community? Will it be the learned illiterates, who have taken advantage of their status in society to hide their condition and selfishly avail the best resources while infecting the many others lesser privileged than themselves? These are people who have been diagnosed with having the virus, not even counting the thousands of others advised to self-quarantine and instead are moving around or the countless others who actively lied on their self-declaration forms or had an aspirin before immigrating into India to reduce their temperature. The viral outbreak has made a couple of things clear, and this is clear across the world. Most humans are selfish and stupid. One cannot expect them to be responsible, especially the entitled international traveller. Sure, there can be a sense of panic and people who want to avoid being under quarantine by the Government. These are people who are scared of using Indian-style toilets, for example. Others do not want to curtail their social lives. All that people are being asked to do is stay under house arrest for a few days, cook their own food and drink their own drink. Yes, we might all be social creatures and many of us might want to eat, drink and be merry but do not be as stupid as those youth who are busy hunting for deals as airlines cancel flights. This will be a trying and tragic time. At the rate things are going, thousands will be infected and many people will die. This will not just be an inconvenience to the wealthy and entitled because their helps lost a parent or their factory shut down for a month or so. Being in denial and thinking that nothing will happen to you, like the Madhya Pradesh unit of the BJP taking out huge rallies, is simply asinine. India’s huge population density will work against it. It is critical that every one of us takes the situation seriously. If you have come back from abroad, stay at home. If you feel respiratory distress, go to a hospital. Do not be in denial about the situation. Denial is a killer.

This is why the Government’s containment protocols should now get aggressive. The testing sample spike notwithstanding, which is multiplying overnight, it takes no rocket science to understand that community-level transmission has begun already, faster than we think because of untamed human behaviour. But even these conditions do merit hotspot or staggered lockdowns to break the chain of transmission. The choice is ours to make. In the end, self-disciplining, self-isolating and social distancing can make the crucial difference between us becoming an Italy or at least closer to China. Remember in India, the existing health infrastructure would not be able to absorb the onslaught the way the Chinese have done by setting up facilities overnight and installing disinfecting tunnels for those out on the streets. So we have no option but to rely on non-pharmaceutical approaches to containment. There is actually no choice. Either we do it ourselves or have a military-like emergency imposed upon us.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/denial--the-worst-solution-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/denial--the-worst-solution.html
2,23-3-20,One and only PK,"The legendary footballer will always remain the pioneer for whatever little Indian football has achieved today

Not many in today’s generation would relate to the legendary Pradip Kumar Banerjee, PK as he was known, but he was one of the charismatic footballers of his times when this sport had its golden run in India. So much so that he was even recognised as the greatest Indian footballer of the 20th century by FIFA. Few can match his record even today, that of two Olympics (Melbourne 1956, Rome 1960), three Asian Games (58, 62, 66), gold medallist as a player and a bronze holder as a coach (1970 Bangkok). And at a time when European football was a dream than a reality, PK’s pace, power and grace were much talked about. When he played, football had a five-forward system. But he could double up as both a right-winger and a centre forward, an unmatched skill that got him 65 goals in 84 matches for the national team. Many from his generation would agree, even in those competitive times when European players struggled to create a niche for themselves, he crafted his own convincing identity. The legend, who left us last Friday, rose early in his life and became a superstar both as a player and a coach, making the best use of the other talents he possessed of an administrator and commentator. In that sense, he came well before his time, a perfect combination required for the professional football circuit in current times. For many in Kolkata, who relished the spectator version of the sport during world cups — one of the reasons that Brazil and Argentina continue to be their favourite teams — PK was the only Indian hope despite the proliferation of local clubs and the abundant pleasures of what is called para (nighbourghood) football.

Throughout his association with the English game, he wore all his hats with distinction, of course at different times in history, showing he could reinvent himself with the times. Making his debut early at the age of 15, after completing basic schooling, he started playing for the Eastern Railway, where the field set-up was purely amateurish and offered very little in terms of remuneration. Even in stressed times, when he had to support seven of his siblings, he did not allow this responsibility to overturn his passion for football. Hereon, he climbed the rungs of the famed Calcutta Football League and won the title in 1958. He became a member of the holy trinity, which included the likes of Tulsidas Balram and Chuni Goswami. The trio dazzled together and helped Indian football team reach newer heights. Even after retirement, there was no stopping PK. As coach, he had game-reading ability, on-field strategy variations and man-management skills. He could boost a player’s confidence where there was no hope left. He had the unparalleled ability to motivate players with his careful selection of words laced with metaphors and anecdotes. Yet when Indian football did get the commercial benefits with its domestic leagues, PK wasn’t happy. For somebody who rose from the streets, he lamented the decline in local football and standards. He believed not in the pomp and show but talent born of real-life circumstances. For that was original, rather than adaptive. And till his dying day, he wanted to encourage the right spirit of the game.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/one-and-only-pk-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/one-and-only-pk.html
3,23-3-20,Coronavirus clears roads... and skies too,"As the nation shifts abruptly to lockdown mode to fight the deadly novel coronavirus, with people staying indoors on Sunday on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘Janata Curfew’, there has been an unexpected result —the clear blue sky.

“Many of the actions the people are taking to fight the coronavirus, like self-imposed ‘curfew’ or working from home, will have an additional benefit of reducing carbon footprint, besides breaking the virus transmission chain. This will help in reduction of individual’s production of greenhouse gases thus significantly curbing emission. This in turn could help in improving the air quality,” said Narendra Nath, a scientist with the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board.

He said that the air quality had improved across the state and one could see the difference. “The sky is blue, which is a pleasant surprise for environmentalists. And this phenomena is visible all across India,” he said.

In Lucknow, the air quality index at noon on Sunday was 61 – it otherwise remains over 200.

Nath’s statement was dittoed by Anumita Roychaudhry, from the Centre for Science and Environment. “This is a crisis induced change which has forced people to go for ‘Janata curfew’ (people’s curfew) or allow them to work from home. Vehicular traffic is off the road across the country. The pollution-producing industries are closed and this will reduce carbon footprint,” she said.

Roychaudhry said that satellite pictures had shown reduction in pollution in China and Italy after lockdown was imposed in these countries. “The pictures for India are not available now but surely they will show a positive impact (of lockdown) on the country,” Roychaudhry said.

In just a few weeks, millions of people have been put into quarantine and regions locked down to reduce the spread of coronavirus. In India, events are being cancelled and travel plans dropped. Universities, schools and workplaces have been closed and workers both in public and private sectors have been asked to work from home.

Air pollution in India is a serious health issue as it contributes to the premature deaths of two million Indians every year.

Of the most polluted cities in the world, 21 out of 30 were in India in 2019. Fifty-one per cent pollution is caused by industries, 27 per cent by vehicles, 17 per cent by crop burning and 5 per cent by Diwali fireworks.

Shashank Bharadwaj from Transportation Research Procedia says that traffic congestion on roads not only increases fuel consumption but also leads to increase in carbon dioxide emissions, outdoor air pollution as well as increase in exposure time of the passengers.

“With vehicles off the roads during ‘Janata curfew’ and people preferring to work from home, the carbon dioxide emission has gone down, which is a good sign,” Srivastava from Pollution Control Board said.

Shachindra Sharma, a Noida-based environmentalist, said that the actual effects on greenhouse gas emission depended upon where one actually stayed. “People living in National Capital Region (NCR) travel long distance to go to their work place. Similar is the case in Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai and Pune which have very high traffic density. Their everyday travel takes a toll on the environment,” he said

“It is early to predict but we can expect a decline by around 1 per cent in carbon emission this year, which is a good sign,” he said.

In 2015, the Government of India, together with IIT-Kanpur, had launched the National Air Quality Index. In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Programme’ with tentative national target of 20-30 per cent reduction in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations by 2024, considering 2017 as the base year for comparison. It will be rolled out in 102 cities that are considered to have air quality worse than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/coronavirus-clears-roads----and-skies-too.html
4,23-3-20,Spread awareness of coronavirus: AKY to folk artistes,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav appealed to the state’s folk artistes to publicise in local dialects ways for prevention of the spread of coronavirus.

In a statement issued in Lucknow on Sunday, Akhilesh Yadav said, “The large-scale migration of people from big cities to their respective villages has added to the threat of spread of coronavirus. In this scenario, the dangers of the disease have increased. I appeal to folk artistes of the state to publicise ways to prevent the spread of the virus in various dialects like Awadhi, Braj and Bundeli through different media of communication, including mobile phone.”

The SP chief added that this would help the common man in understanding the gravity of the situation and ways of protecting themselves from the contagion in a simple manner.

5,23-3-20,Corona: Guides hit hard as tourists inflow declines,"The two-month-long anti-CAA protest protests by Muslim women at Hussainabad Clock Tower coupled with the outbreak of coronavirus and subsequent lockdown has aggravated the crisis for 75 guides hired by the Hussainabad Trust.

The anti-CAA protests resulted in a sharp decline in tourist inflow to the historic imambaras and the work for guides has come to a grinding halt after the outbreak of coronavirus, severely impacting their incomes.

The Hussainabad Trust is the custodian of many landmark properties like Chhota Imambara, Bara Imambara, Picture Gallery and Hussainabad Clock Tower, and employs 75 guides who double up as security personnel.

The Hussainabad Trust is also the custodian of pension fund and gives pension or wasika to the descendants of the Nawabs of Awadh.

For the tourist guides, security duties take up eight hours and they squeeze in another four hours as guides. Each tour takes slightly over an hour and a group of tourists can give as much as Rs 300 as tip to them. It is this money which helps them sustain their families, as their salaries are a meagre Rs 4,500 per month.

This figure is much below the minimum wage fixed by the state government. As per Uttar Pradesh Minimum Wages Notification of October 2019, the minimum wages for unskilled labours in the state is Rs 318.42 per day. Thus, 25 days’ work in month fetches an unskilled labourer Rs 7,960.

In the present scenario, however, with the tourist attractions shut till March 31, guides are struggling to sustain their families.

Lucknow-based advocate Syed Mohammed Haider Rizvi, who had written to the district magistrate and Labour Welfare department to draw attention to the plight of the guides, said, “The salary that these guides get is in no way sufficient to provide for their children’s education or even nutritious food.”

The guides had submitted a petition to the chief minister’s office in July 2019, asking for payment of minimum wages to them.

Haider’s application draws attention to that petition and also demands that a scheme for education and medical needs of children of these guides be put in place. He has also asked for mandatory health insurance for the guides.

A guide at Bada Imambara, Asif Hussian (40), said that the Hussainabad Trust’s guidelines forbid them from doing any other work while in its employment.

“When I started work ten years ago, I used to get Rs 2,100. Till about two years back, we used to get a 9-10 per cent hike based on inflation and our salaries were raised to Rs 5,858 per month.”

The state government has announced the payment of sustenance wages to daily wagers so that they do not go out to seek work, thus risking infection. On Saturday, the government also announced a slew of other measures to aid the financially weakest during the period of uncertainty created by Covid-19. These include free ration to 1.65 crore people listed under Antyodaya and MGNREGA schemes and Rs 1,000 through DBT (direct benefit transfer) to 20.37 lakh labourers registered with Labour department.

However, for the guides employed by the Hussainabad Trust, there is no safety net in place.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/corona--guides-hit-hard-as-tourists-inflow-declines.html
6,23-3-20,"Tribals urge CM not to implement CAA, NPR","Tribals under the aegis of social organisations like Campaign for Survival with Dignity (CSD), Odisha Nari Samaj and Jan Jagran Abhiyan held as many as 402 gram sabhas and passed resolutions urging the State Government to stop implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register for Citizenship (NRC).

The gram sabhas were held in 15 districts. While 13 States have passed resolutions against the CAA, NPR and NRC, it is for the first time that gram sabhas have passed such resolutions in Odisha.

Soon after the resolutions were passed in the villages, a memorandum was sent Chief MNinister Naveen Patnaik and the district Collectors of the 15 districts, said CSD convening body member Narendra Mohanty.

The districts where gram sabhas were held are Ganjam, Gajapati, Sundargarh, Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Kandhamal, Balangir, Bargarh, Keonjhar, Sambalpur, Kalahandi, Mayurbhanj, Jharsuguda and Jajpur.

Terming the CAA, NPR and NRC as ""anti-people and anti-tribal”, CSD convening body senior member Pradeep Sahoo demanded that the Odisha Government pass a resolution in the Assembly against “the regressive decisions of the Central Government.”

“STs and SCs constitute 40 per cent of Odisha’s population. The Dalit and tribal communities have faced a long-lost battle with displacement for the sake of development, landless problems and natural disasters like Cyclones Phailin and Titli. So, providing birth certificate and land documents is a major issue to prove citizenship,” said Jan Jagran Abhiyan president Madhusudan Sethi.

Out of 402 gram sabhas, the highest 65 were held in Ganjam, the CM’s home turf, followed by 56 in Sundargarh and 53 in Malkangiri district, informed Mohanty. .

10,23-3-20,Going for broke,"In a country with our population density to claim that hundred per cent source identification or tracking is even feasible is akin to believing in Santa Claus

We are going through a time of uncertainty, fear and gloom, though stories of human resolve, courage and sheer determination do give us hope for the future. We live in unprecedented times of which we have no previous experience, little knowledge and even lesser understanding. There are none here who have survived either the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 that killed 33 million people (including approximately six million from the sub-continent) or the Bengal famine of 1942 that killed 10 million. What is, however, absolutely clear is that we are in a global war against an unforgiving and unseen enemy who respects no borders, ethnicity, class, age, religion or caste.

If we are to beat this enemy, not just physically but psychologically, socially and economically as well, we have no choice but to work together as a global community and act with compassion, forbearance and courage not just in our own self-interest but for the community at large. It finally boils down to this, if we are to call ourselves civilised. Most importantly, the time for political posturing or playing games is way past. In war, as is often said, there is no place for the runners-up.

If the information available in the public domain is to be believed, the Government has done a sterling job in limiting infections and fatalities for now, through its rapid response. Unfortunately, the figures being bandied about are coming in for increasing scrutiny for a variety of reasons. The question of what is the policy governing testing and how many tests are being done is at the crux of the controversy.

As per information available in the public domain, the existing capacity to test for the virus is 500 per day, which is being ramped up in the coming days. Thus, at present only those coming from affected countries are being screened and if their condition seems doubtful, are being tested. Those cleared in screening are expected to undergo either supervised or self- quarantine before being allowed to mingle. Tests are also being done on those who may have fallen sick after coming in contact with someone returning from abroad. In addition, the Government has also done 800 tests as on date on random patients across the country who, are at present admitted in hospitals with acute respiratory disorders.

On the basis of these tests having turned up negative the Government insists that there have been no cases of community spread. Therein lies the rub, as many known positive cases, leave aside those who are asymptomatic, have deliberately escaped from quarantine, no doubt infecting those they may have subsequently come in contact with, who in turn will infect others, which is what community spread is all about. In a country with our population density to claim that hundred per cent source identification or tracking is even feasible is akin to believing in Santa Claus. Of course, there is the possibility that the Government is aware of the true picture and hiding it from the public to avoid any onset of panic.

If that be the motivation, the Government is making a huge error as most of us are well aware as to what is happening in different parts of the world. As a matter of fact, conservative studies on the subject suggest that actual cases are about ten times the numbers that have been identified and given that the cases are doubling every three days, the number of people infected will be 1,024 times the present number within a month as simple mathematics suggests. This in our context, with total identified cases as 169 as on March 19 that has increased by one-third along expected lines on the March 20 will, in all likelihood, range between 1.7 lakh and 17 lakh by April 19, depending on which figures we wish to believe, if we do not take further steps that are needed to halt the spread. From within these numbers, as seen elsewhere, 15 per cent will require Intensive Care Unit facilities and two-three per cent will not survive.

The problem with hierarchies and the bureaucracies that run them is that they abhor vacuums, as that condition requires them to assert themselves, avoid accountability for obvious reasons and can only think and act linearly given their long-standing ethos and organisational architecture. An emergency of this kind requires lateral thinking, taking of risks and forceful interventions, all of which fall in the realm of the political leadership that now needs to step forward, provide clear directions, impart the momentum required and most importantly, accept accountability. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi has certainly shown his interest in assuming a leadership role his known dependence on the bureaucracy is a distinct disadvantage at this time.

Thus we have adopted the bureaucratic playbook to tackle the issue. As a result our response has been bureaucratic, admittedly much quicker but still along plodding linear lines with each agency and department attempting to show how efficiently they are handling challenges that they face. Forget the “All of country” model that is absolutely necessary, we have not even been able to put an “All of Government” approach in place. This is best brought out by the Prime Minister’s address to the nation on March 19. It was a motivational talk with no substantive future course of action being announced, except for a voluntary one day national “Janta (public) curfew”, which probably will be a harbinger of tougher measures in the future. In all truth, the time for motivational talks is long past, what we now need is a general who will lead us into battle. Moreover, such an approach is unviable, because by the time we take the next step another week would have passed and numbers of those infected quadrupled, adding to avoidable stress on our healthcare system and to fatalities.

It is essential that our political leaders and the average citizen comprehend the nature of the beast that we are at war with and face facts that have either emerged from experiences elsewhere or are peculiar to our situation. First, there is no getting away from the fact that we have a population of 1.3 billion and the cost of testing and providing the necessary support facilities are humungous. Obviously, no Government, whatever its efficiency, can ever provide cover for all our citizens. Second, social distancing, which include forcible quarantine, despite its flaws, appears to have emerged as the only viable alternative for keeping the Coronavirus under check and in reducing the rate of infection, till a suitable remedy is found.

The world around us has completely changed and yet we seem to be living in a time warp, hoping to avoid having to face the dragon that has felled much of the world. Let us face reality and accept that in these circumstances there is no time for half measures. Imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC, as has been done in some places, or hoping to enhance testing facilities in the coming days, which in any case is unavoidable, are measures that are simply not enough and are just too little and too late. In military terms, we need to launch an immediate blitzkrieg and in fact, have little choice but to immediately adopt measures that the Chinese and Italians did only as a last resort.

It is essential that a nationwide curfew for a minimum of 14 days be declared soonest along with other measures such as reducing the frequency of mass transit systems, banning taxis and only permitting minimum essential personnel to move out of their homes.These measures must be strictly implemented by deploying the military, assisted by the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF), on the streets. While these are harsh and desperate measures with dire economic implications, we have no option, as we will otherwise find ourselves overwhelmed with the possibility of serious social disruptions.

Undoubtedly, the biggest problem will be faced by those whose very livelihood is dependent on their daily earnings. As in any major natural disaster this would require the Government to provide the requisite relief to all those impacted at their place of residence. This in effect requires that the armed forces be fully mobilised and deployed and tasked for conducting internal security and humanitarian and relief operations.

Time is of the essence here and discussions and committees have little meaning now and in fact these measures needed to have been implemented yesterday.

To enable the military to mobilise and deploy would require a minimum of three-four days, in which time we must remember, the numbers of those infected would have doubled. Implementation of such measures with a warning period will also allow citizens to stock up on essentials. For those who believe that such drastic action is uncalled for, would do well to study the impact of a graduated response in countries like Italy, Spain, the United States and France. By going for broke, if nothing else, we would certainly avoid much of the stress that the healthcare infrastructure of those countries were put through, infrastructure that we are woefully short of and have little ability to scale up.

11,23-3-20,Use telehealth services now,"As the Coronavirus pandemic grows, the Govt must actively endorse and advertise telehealth helplines to keep people away from hospitals

The COVID-19 outbreak has brought nearly the whole world to a standstill, forcing people to find remote ways of performing their daily duties, purchases and tasks. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was said to be “tele-governing” the country in quarantine after his wife tested positive for the Coronavirus. As remote working is being adopted on a large scale and workplaces open work from home alternatives for their employees in an unprecedented way, remote healthcare is another area whose use is surging.

The world over, healthcare systems have reported an increase in patients opting for the telehealth route to access physician consultations and keeping in step with this surge, healthcare organisations are expanding the use of telehealth to safely screen and treat patients for Coronavirus. In doing so they are doing the responsible thing and are trying to contain the spread of the infection. In the US, many (AI) Artificial Intelligence-based telehealth services providers have reported a significant jump in the volume of virtual visits ever since the Coronavirus scare caught the country.

In fact, in a bid to promote the use of telehealth, US President Donald Trump announced that his administration was waiving some federal rules to make it easier for more doctors to provide care remotely using video chats and other services. Many telehealth providers in India, too, have witnessed a nearly 100 per cent surge in patients’ online visits. This trend is particularly visible in metropolitan cities as internet penetration and awareness of these services is more here as the urban population is used to the concept of videoconferencing, “face timing” and “skyping” to keep in touch with colleagues around the country and world and their families too. Hence, more and more telehealth centres are being put to use by people in urban areas and they are screening patients and offering them consultation and advice through video links.

Mainstreaming telehealth to tackle a public health crisis: Globally, as healthcare systems stand overburdened and overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the pandemic, conventional healthcare is finding it impossible to address the disaster. With hospital beds and Intensive Care Units (ICUs) being in grossly insufficient numbers, doctors in severely-hit countries are having to opt for the triage system. In India, where healthcare systems are already overburdened, a large outbreak will spell further disaster. It is important therefore to act in time to leverage the use of alternative processes like telehealth and turn them from stop-gap arrangements to mainstream interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic will go down in history as a turning point in the journey of telehealth, given the fact that it is the first time that the use of telehealth is being co-opted on a large scale to address a public health crisis. Telehealth will act as a major cog in the wheel of Coronavirus management and containment.

Treating home quarantined patients and containing the spread: From testing to treating and isolating, our healthcare resources are scarce for every part of the treatment process for COVID-19. All people with symptoms can neither be tested immediately, nor can all of them be admitted to hospitals. Similarly, administered quarantine facilities will also turn grossly insufficient once cases spiral to stage-II. Therefore, keeping as many sick people as possible out of hospitals is a major component of managing the Coronavirus contagion. Across the world, most infected people with mild to moderate symptoms have been asked to self-quarantine themselves at home while hospitals are taking in only the seriously-ill patients needing artificial respiratory support. This is where telehealth services will have to be leveraged in a major way in monitoring and advising such people. The Governments in partnership with private players must actively endorse and advertise telehealth helplines and encourage people to seek consultations through the remote mechanism. If every individual with a fever or a cough rushes to a hospital or clinic, it may wreak havoc on the healthcare system. Moreover, a number of these patients may be suffering from just the seasonal flu. Taking the telehealth route will help in filtering and shortlisting the most serious patients who need hospitalisation. Doctors can check the patients’ symptoms through teleconferencing and advice them about medication, precautions, as well as tests required and refer them to a healthcare facility in case their symptoms aggravate. Arrangements must also be made for pathologists to be able to collect samples from home.

Addressing other health issues remotely: At a time when all healthcare resources have been consumed in addressing the Coronavirus threat, a large number of patients, with other health conditions, be it chronic diseases or acute conditions requiring medical help, are at a loss. Not only is there lack of resources to address their needs but they, too, face the risk of contracting the dreaded infection while travelling to clinics and hospitals. Telehealth is a safe and effective route for this group of patients as well. Telehealth providers and hospitals must make specialists in different domains available to patients through telehealth services. This will ensure that patients with other health conditions requiring medical support are not ignored.

12,23-3-20,"Small, green homes are the charm for millennials","With globalisation, career advancement is moving professionals across cities and countries. Millennials are opting to buy small apartments as they are the fastest sellers on the resale market and provide the security and investment advantages of homeownership

Millennials are redefining the residential market in India and affordability and job mobility are the biggest factors affecting this sentiment. With rising urbanisation and soaring property prices in the prime real estate markets, millennials that do choose to invest in a house are increasingly looking at smaller apartments for their first home purchase. Globally, small apartments have been popular because they witness perennial demand from young working professionals who are always on the move. This trend is only recently gaining traction in urban India as young professionals migrate in large numbers to metropolitan cities for employment opportunities. A small apartment offers an acceptable trade-off between convenience and affordability and millennials prefer to own cosy, convenient and cost-effective homes. They attribute high value to flexibility, instead of settling in one location for an extended period. With globalisation, career advancement is moving professionals across cities and countries. Small apartments are the fastest sellers on the resale market so they provide the security and investment advantages of homeownership to the millennials.

While Mumbai leads the demand for studio and one bedroom, hall and kitchen (1-BHK) apartments, other metropolitan cities are joining the push towards 1-BHK and studio apartments to accommodate their growing migrant population. For young adults, studio apartments provide a popular alternative to conventional one 1-BHK and 2-BHK units. A studio apartment in India typically consists of a living area, a kitchenette and a bathroom. Combined with affordable property rates, studio apartments also offer reduced commuting times, due to their central location and low cost of maintenance. The inclination towards small apartments is so widespread that the average size of flats in metro cities has reduced over the last five years. The top seven Indian cities collectively saw average apartment sizes shrink by nearly 17 per cent between 2014 and 2018.

A major factor contributing to the shrinking home sizes across cities in the country is the rising demand for budget-friendly housing. With property prices rapidly increasing, builders have been reducing flat sizes to align their offerings with a wider homebuyer audience. This has largely been driven by young adults choosing affordability, convenience and connectivity over an abundance of space.

There is a growing focus on the affordable housing sector among both homebuyers and builders. Attracted by growing job opportunities in metropolitan cities, consumer demand for affordable housing has increased exponentially.

Affordable housing projects were given a major impetus in the Union Budget 2017-18 by being granted infrastructure status. The ‘Housing for All’ initiative aims to build 20 million affordable housing units across India by 2022. Since the affordable housing sector is the most incentivised segment for all stakeholders, many reputed builders are launching such projects.

Trust and ease of purchase also influence millennial homebuyers’ purchasing decisions. The Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) has the potential to be the most significant policy intervention in the real estate sector. The overall goal of RERA is to protect the interests of homebuyers in an efficient and transparent manner. Its implementation has introduced much-needed formality to the sector and boosted homebuyer confidence. Under RERA, builders will have to provide a timeline for construction and delivery which has been verified by a valid authority. Without approval, builders are not allowed to promote or sell any project. This has effectively weeded out unscrupulous players from the market and allowed only credible builders to flourish — to the advantage of all homebuyers.

The reduction of Goods and Services Tax (GST) on under-construction and affordable housing properties is also a significant fillip for the real estate sector. These initiatives have encouraged house ownership among young professionals. Tax relief measures have also increased disposable income for such homebuyers, Furthermore, many banks are targetting the millennial demographic as the primary customer base, thus making it easier to obtain home loans, which carry additional tax benefits.

There is a growing trend among millennials towards energy-efficient and sustainable homes. They are aware that homes with reduced water and energy consumption, enhanced air quality, use of natural lighting and decreased carbon emissions have a significant impact on their health and that of their families. There is a concerted effort by builders to offer homes that optimise the use of local materials, minimise their impact on the local ecology and most importantly, are built to reduce power, water and material requirements.

As homebuyers and builders shift their focus towards environmental responsibility, the availability of green amenities is on the rise in the country including solar panels, rainwater harvesting facilities, waste management and high-efficiency lighting. Combining value-for-money, convenience and eco-friendliness, high-rise gated communities are fast becoming a popular option for millennials. Because, living in these gated communities has many advantages including strategic location, security, amenities and neighbourly appeal. Many communities offer amenities that are designed to provide an improved lifestyle for residents and increasingly, reputable builders are investing in modern, luxury facilities including clubhouses, fitness centres, swimming pools, spas, playgrounds and sports facilities. They are even integrating smart automation systems for added convenience and comfort.

Owing to the improved regulatory policies and rationalised tax structure, millennial homebuyers have a reinvigorated interest in the sector. The revived consumer confidence has stabilised the real estate market and laid the foundation for massive growth.

The Mahasagha stated that usually the Utkal University authorities constitute Board of Studies in different subjects taught in the university and its affiliated colleges separately. The Board of Studies prepares syllabi for the university courses of studies and appoints examiners to evaluate answer scripts.

Accordingly, the Utkal University authorities took the Director, Deputy Director (Technical), Head of PMR Department and Training Coordinator of NIRTAR as members of the Board of Studies in Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy for the current academic session and this created severe discontentment among many educationists of the State. They wrote a letter to Vice-Chancellor Prof SM Patanaik expressing their protest.

“The posts of the Director and Deputy Director of NIRTAR are administrative posts and the persons holding these posts, being administrators, can contribute in no way to the deliberations of the Board of Studies. The post of Training Coordinator is non-existent in NIRTAR,” they wrote.

While a delegation of educationists led by Prof Dinesh Prasad Patnaik met the VC and handed over the letter to him, a ABRSM led by Odisha convenor Dr Pabitra Kumar Ratha met Governor and Chancellor Prof Ganeshi Lal and apprised hi of the issue.

Then, a three-member committee of senior Professors formed by the VC conducted an investigation. On the report of the committee, the Director and three others of NIRTAR were removed from the Board of Studies and a new Board was formed, informed ABRSM Odisha convenor Narayan Mohanty.

28,23-3-20,Water key to mitigating climate change effects,"The history of human civilisation reveals that water supply and civilisation are almost synonymous. Water resources are sources of water that are potentially useful and essential for existence of life. Several uses of water include agricultural, industrial, household, recreational and environmental activities. The majority of human uses require fresh water which is scarce.

About 97% of the water on the earth surface is in the ocean and only 3% is fresh water. Slightly over two-thirds of this is frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The remaining 1per cent unfrozen fresh water is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction present above ground which is suitable for human consumption.

The seas and oceans are the products of gigantic acid-base titrations during the early stages of formation of earth. Sea water contains about 2,000 times more dissolved salts than fresh water. The constant pH of sea water (8.1±0.2) all over the globe is due to ion exchange equilibrium of dissolved cations with silicate phase in the marine sediment. It is estimated that 8% of worldwide water use is for domestic purposes.

These include drinking water, bathing, cooking, toilet flushing, cleaning, laundry and gardening. Basic domestic water requirements are at around 50 litres per person per day, excluding water for gardens. Drinking water is water that is of sufficiently high quality so that it can be consumed or used without risk of immediate or long term harm. Such water is commonly called as potable water.

In most developed countries, the water supplied to domestic, commerce and industry is all of drinking water standard even though only a very small proportion is actually consumed or used in food preparation.

It is estimated that 70% of worldwide water is used for irrigation, with 15%-35% of irrigation withdrawals being unsustainable. It takes around 2,000-3,000 litres of water to produce enough food to satisfy one person's daily dietary need. This is a considerable amount, when compared to that required for drinking, which is between two and five litres.

Major industrial users of water include hydroelectric dams, thermoelectric power plants, which use water for cooling, ore and oil refineries, which use water in chemical processes, and manufacturing plants, which use water as a solvent. Water withdrawal can be very high for certain industries, but consumption is generally much lower than that of agriculture. Overexploitation of water use will cause the depletion of water resource from both surface and underground water.

The United Nations designated March 22 as the World Water Day in 1992 at the Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro. This year's theme, 'Water and Climate Change', explores how water and climate change are inextricably linked. Water plays a pivotal role in how the world mitigates and adapts with the effects of climate change. Water is the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change.

Climate change intensifies this cycle because as air temperatures increase, more water evaporates into the air. Warmer air can hold more water vapour, which can lead to more intense rainstorms, causing major problems like extreme flooding in coastal communities around the world. According to the World Health Organisation, increasing temperatures on the planet and more variable rainfalls are expected to reduce crop yields in many tropical developing regions, where food security is already a problem.

It is estimated that by 2040, one in four of the world’s children under 18 – some 600 million in all – will be living in areas of extremely high water stress. One of the most effective ways to protect children in the face of climate change is to safeguard their access to safe water and sanitation. The World Water Day has seen an increase in the quantity and quality of education initiatives within schools and universities, to raise awareness of the importance of conserving and managing water resources.

42,23-3-20,Online education in time of corona and beyond,"Unforeseen disasters can sometimes unleash the unimaginable situations, albeit unwittingly. Today businesses, economies, nations and human lives are reeling under coronavirus’ impact. Globally, the education of 300 million students has been disrupted. Almost every hour there are reports of shutdowns of educational institutions and schools.

But there’s a flip side to this dismal development: Online education businesses are registering a spike worldwide, and carbon footprints have dipped significantly as people are working out of homes and corporates are offering free online courses for employee upskilling. It’s new-age-education in the time of Corona!

Nearly 600,000 students travel overseas for their higher education every year. With COVID 19 the prospect of that happening anytime soon, is bleak. Online education be their savior at this critical time when the Coronavirus scrounge ravaging geographies.

There are some key challenges in the online education segment that cannot be resolved without active participation of all stakeholders—state and central governments, academic experts, industry, students and faculty. Some key developments include: Ensuring robust online access to faculty and students with live streaming facility, outsourcing, collaborating with apps and tapping into in-house technologies to facilitate online learning. The other factors include adapting courses to online mode with necessary tweaks and improvisation, facilitating lecture playbacks, harnessing live feedback, training faculty and students with a simple and effective communication plan. Is India prepared to handle these? Yes, because we have tremendous technology expertise and political will to tide through. Besides Digital India initiative, the recent move by our government to encourage more FDI in education, provide Rs 3,000 crore for skill development and recognize foreign online degrees for Indian students is a strong indicator, of this.

Let’s look at the India picture on online education. This segment is expected to leap from $ 247 million in 2016, to approximately $ 1.96 billion by 2021. That is a compound annual growth rate of 52%. The number of users enrolled for various online learning courses is estimated to grow to 1.6 million in 2016 to 9.6 million by the end of 2021. Indians are the second largest consumers on MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) like Coursera. Government initiatives like SWAYAM, E- Basta, E-Pathshaala, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyaan ( RMSA) etc. are furthering the spread of online education.

In India, the online education revolution has been brewing for a while, with rapid global technological advances in the backdrop. Conservative academic leadership, archaic regulations and lack of understanding has held it back. It is unfortunate that a crisis like the one we are facing now was needed to bring this issue in the forefront. In the current situation universities and institutions are scrambling to find solutions to problems created by themselves. In contrast several leading universities globally have seamlessly transitioned to online learning. My daughter who is pursuing a Psychology Honors degree at Kings College has returned to India (yes under quarantine now) and is learning online like her global peers, without any disruption. The college has also indicated that the assessment and evaluation would be done online too. That shows progressive thinking. Incidentally Kings college is ranked in the top 50 universities in the world!

Progressive educational institutions are rising to the challenge and setting inspiring examples of generous leadership. In wake of the current situation, a leading international online education player, is making its over 3,000 courses free for students, worldwide. This means students get access to 95 percent free data from top universities like Yale, Michigan and Johns Hopkins.

Few Indian institutions that have been able to successfully incorporate online learning include Pearl Academy, the country’s premier design school, where undisrupted learning is happening despite the education lockdown. Another university that comes to mind is University of Petroleum and Energy Sciences (UPES) based at Dehradun where learning continues through online medium. It’s clear that Pearl Academy and UPES had unlocked their mindsets many years back which enables them to make a seamless transition. What did these two institutions do differently? They recognized the need far ahead of others and made sure that right investments were made in technology, training of faculty and students. Myths around online learning were removed, high quality content was created and partnerships with global players like Coursera was forged to ensure a top-notch student experience. Students at Pearl and UPES have access to nearly 3,600 courses from top global universities like Brown, Duke, Michigan, Insead, NYU etc.

Both Institutions rather than going for free off the shelf learning systems invested in Blackboard which is the gold standard in online learning. These initiatives have paid off and today these two institutions are functioning seamlessly while others struggle. This learning can be replicated in other institutions across India, with government support. This includes setting basic paraments in online learning like–Strategic planning, outlining expectations from students and faculty, ensuring digital equilibrium, establishing daily flexible routines for students and faculty, planning courses and delivery, assignments and evaluations. India can do it!

We are in an interesting stage. We have all the drivers and the need for online education. Consider the following which have a significant bearing on online education in the future:

*** India has about 3.5 million students in higher education and around 900 universities catering to this need. In 2030 we will have around 14 million students that’s a 4x increase. To cater to this, we will need four times the number of universities, colleges and teachers – will we be ready? Can we be ready without online education playing an instrumental role in this.

***Centennials act, behave, consume and learn differently. They have the same romance with Phones and tablets that we have with books. Let’s acknowledge that and allow them to learn the way they want and not force our way of teaching. Learning on demand is a reality that we need to accept. According to UK India business council report, 75% of Indians online are under the age of 34, and almost half of them are under 24.

*** By 2022, India faces a potential shortage of 250 million skilled workers across sectors – EY/FICCI report)- Online has the potential to fill the gap substantially.

*** Convergence in HE & Corporate e-learning needs: Large number of corporates to embrace MOOC at the cost of proprietary-developed content for internal learning.

The opportunity for online learning is now. Corona virus has given a unique opportunity to drive deep impactful changes. Educational institution who still resist this change are less likely to grow. Radical change is needed in mindset, policy and conviction. We have welcomed technology in every sphere of our life and it has made a tremendous positive impact. Our digital natives are ready to dive into the fray for online learning too.

It’s the time to change perceptions and myths about online education. The government should take a note of this and invest in making an online education policy that allows access, focuses on quality and enables the country to reach a gross enrolment ration in the high 70s which will transform the country forever. Corona may be the catalyst but the openness to online learning and teaching should not end with Corona. The conversation needs to continue with tangible action on the ground to make a difference. An educated society is a liberated one and it is time we give wings to India. Wings of change through technology.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/online-education-in-time-of-corona-and-beyond.html
43,23-3-20,Afflictions of the Mind,"Bhagavad Gita has discussed in detail various evils which cause the human suffering. It has also been analysed as to why do these afflictions arise and how can they be managed.

Lord Krishna has identified lust, anger and greed as the three culprits which lead to one’s downfall. Hence, in shloka 16.21, He has termed them as three entry gates of hell. Further, He has cautioned that they lead to degradation of the soul and, therefore, should be abandoned.

In the next shloka i.e. in shloka 16.22, He has again emphasised the need for overcoming these vices. It is stated that the one who is freed from these three gates of darkness, he does what is good for himself ; and thus attains to the supreme destination.

Gita has examined as to why and how do the evils arise. It has been explained in shlokas 2.62 and 2.63 that thinking about sense objects produces attachment towards them. Attachment breeds desire, and non-fulfilment of desire leads to anger. And anger breeds delusion which leads to loss of memory and, in turn, decline in intelligence. Destruction of intelligence leads to one’s ruination.

These two shlokas have analysed the functioning of human mind very precisely. Depending upon whether one gets pleasure or pain from an object, he develops a like or dislike for that object. Object here obviously includes a person or any other thing that impacts the concerned senses and the mind. Such like or dislike i.e. attachment gives rise to desire - desire to get that object or to get rid of it.

Desire has the potential of giving rise to many ills. When it becomes excessive, selfish, unreasonable and beyond any control ; it then degenerates into lust. The lust shows itself in many forms - the urge for sexual excesses, the craving for wealth, physical impulses, hunger for social prestige and the drive for power etc. etc.

Unfulfilled desire results in anger and fulfilled desire leads to greed. When deluded by anger, one loses touch with reality and creates a false impression about himself and his situation. Delusion leads to loss of memory i.e. in the moments of anger one forgets the lessons learnt from the past experiences. Thus, one fails to discriminate between right and wrong. Such destruction of intelligence results in one’s downfall.

As is evident from the above discussion, all the three vices described here originate from the same source i.e. likes and dislikes and the consequent desires. The likes and dislikes and the resultant desires, though the root cause of all the vices, are not evil in themselves. Problem is created only when one is swayed by them.

Mischiefs of lust have been elaborated in shlokas from 3.36 to 3.39. When asked by Arjuna as to what impels man to commit sin even against his own will, as if by force ; Krishna replied that sin is committed due to lust. The lust is born of the mode of passion (rajas guna) and it later emerges as anger. It is all-devouring and most sinful enemy of man. Lust envelops the wisdom of the wise. It is their constant enemy because like fire, it has an insatiable appetite.

In shlokas from 3.40 to 3.43, it has further been explained as to where does the lust reside and how can it be controlled. It has been stated that the lust resides in senses, mind and the intelligence. Through them, it clouds the wisdom and deludes the embodied soul. As a result, one becomes a slave of the lust and is prepared to do anything to satisfy it. To break the stranglehold of the lust, one (the embodied soul) must manage the mind through intelligence and must not let the senses become slaves of lust. The senses must be controlled from the very beginning.

In other words, one should always remain vigilant and should not let his intelligence be carried away by lust.

Lust, anger and greed have been termed by Krishna as three gates of hell because they have the potential of generating many other similar evils. They keep on festering in the mind and prepare a fertile ground for other vices to grow there.

Ignorance, fear, arrogance, false ego, hypocrisy, doubting nature, excessive pride, anxiety, malice and envy, hate, ill will and enmity towards others ; and harshness are some of the other afflictions which have been identified in different shlokas of Bhagavad Gita. They continue to trouble the mind in one way or the other.

The importance of bringing the evils under control has also been emphasised in shloka 5.23 wherein it has been stated that the one who becomes capable of withstanding the urge of lust and anger before giving up his body i.e. in this very life, he is a yogi and he alone is a happy man. Though only lust and anger have been mentioned here in this shloka, it obviously applies to all the vices.

To summarise, the more a person is released from the clutches of evils, the more he becomes pure and capable of realising inner peace. He experiences joy from within.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/afflictions-of-the-mind.html
44,23-3-20,"Punjab orders lockdown till Mar 31, total 21 positive cases","Sec 144 imposed; hospitals, pharmacies, banks, ATMs, media, petrol pumps, groceries, e-commerce exempted

With the State recording eight more positive cases of deadly Coronavirus in a day, Punjab Government on Sunday ordered a state-wide lockdown from Monday 6 am till March 31 as an emergency measure to tackle the worsening COVID-19 situation.

All essential services, including electricity, water and municipal services, banks and ATMs, media, postal and courier services, departmental stores, supermarkets and all other daily needs, hospitals, nursing homes, doctors, chemist shops, optical stores and pharmaceuticals manufacturing, petrol pumps, LPG gas, among others will be available during the shutdown.

The State Government has clarified that there will be “no curfew” during the lockdown period, but restrictions under Section 144 will be imposed preventing an assembly of more than 10 persons in a public space at any given time.

Earlier, there was a complete and partial lockdown in seven Coronavirus-hit districts of the state. However, employees of essential services such as banks and post offices and government employees would work on a rotation basis, which will not be more than 50 per cent of the strength in their offices.

Among the departments excluded from the shutdown were medical, health, police, jails, transport, electricity and water.

At the same time, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh appealed to all residents to observe all health safeguards, especially frequently washing hands, and to avoid leaving their homes unless there is an acute emergency.

“You can play the most vital role in preventing further transmission of the disease by not stepping out,” said Capt Amarinder in his appeal to the people, adding, “During this period, all commercial establishments and shops shall remain closed except those dealing in essential commodities like food, grocery, medicines, etc.

All essential services such as water supply, sanitation and electricity shall be maintained. Restrictions on public transport imposed earlier will continue till March 31.”

To ensure strict implementation of restrictions under Section 144, DGP Dinkar Gupta said that extra forces were being deployed in all districts.

The Chief Minister said that those residents, who have recently returned from abroad, are required to undergo home quarantine and report to the nearest Government health facility in case there is onset of any symptoms. The local community must also assist the administration in enforcing this in larger public interest, he appealed.

Capt Amarinder also appealed to trade and businesses not only to ensure adequate supplies of essential commodities but to avoid hoarding and profiteering of any kind. “It is important that we provide these commodities to our people at reasonable prices,” he said, warning that government “will not allow anyone to take undue advantage of the situation for their personal gains”.

In the official notification, the Chief Secretary ordered shutdown of all establishments to break the transmission chain of contagion of COVID-19 “for which it is necessary to prevent or minimise close contact amongst all persons”.

“Henceforth, all Deputy Commissioners or District Magistrates would issue orders under section 144 of CrPc or under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, for shutdown of all establishments except those providing essential services or items in districts from Monday, March 23, (6 am) till Tuesday, that is March 31 (inclusive),” the Chief Secretary notified, which was followed by individual notifications by the respective DCs of all districts.

The Chief Secretary’s notification stated that each DC may add any other essential item or service to the list as per local requirements to minimise disruption and ensure essential supplies. It has been clarified that the DCs will allow all ancillary activity for each item of essential services, such as delivery of newspapers by hawkers.

At the same time, the Health Department has clarified that during lockdown period, all private establishments such as shops, offices, factories, workshops etc but excluding godowns and warehouses, shall remain closed.

Further, no public transport services (passenger) including operation of taxis or auto-rickshaws etc shall be permitted except transport of all kinds to and from hospitals, airports, railway stations, bus terminals or bus stands.

In this context, it said that specific routes to be allowed in districts shall be decided by respective DCs.

Transport Department may operate essential skeleton services of State Transport Undertaking to ensure essential services, it said adding that all inter-state commercial passenger transport (buses) shall be closed.

The Health Department has also made it clear that strict home quarantine, for 14 days (excluding the day of arrival in India), shall be observed by all foreign returnees (who landed in India on or after March 7, 2020) and their contacts or other persons at risk, as decided by the District Administration.

All such foreign returnees shall also mandatorily contact the District Administration (on 104 or 112) and register themselves for home quarantine and download the COVA Punjab Mobile App), failing which they shall be liable for legal action.

48,23-3-20,Silver lining to COVID-19 is that it is preventable,"The Covid-19 pandemic is a challenge to human lives, health care system and the global economy. It is also a challenge to our mental well-being, as individuals and as a society. It has infected more than 2,55,000 people globally killing more than 10,000 with the number constantly rising.

Psychologists and psychiatrists are seeing many cases coming with signs of distress who are worried about Covid-19 infection and its consequences.

Sushil came to me for counselling and therapy with a sense of unease and paranoia in recent days. He was scared of dying of coronavirus, feeling delusional about microbes all around him beckoning him. He had insomnia and considerable anxiety. Stress is caused by fear of the disease compounded by social isolation as Governments are shutting down schools, offices, cinema halls and malls to restrict social interactions. Many psychiatrists cite an increase in requests for anti-anxiety medicines from patients or an increase in the dose of these medicines.

Covid-19 is a global pandemic which may have hazardous effects on human health. Its effects may range from a mild attack with negligible or mild symptoms to severe symptoms and sometimes death which may be seen in a small percent of cases, especially among the elderly and the medically compromised. People are stressed and come to us for treatment with anxiety, panic, hoarding, paranoia, aggression and depression.

Many have anti-social behaviours like anger, frustration and irritation. But the silver lining with covid-19 is that it is preventable. Prevention is the best possible cure for coronavirus infection— and can keep full blown corona infection at bay.

First and foremost there is extreme fear in the mind of people and the cause of this fear is that they are consciously or subconsciously linking the infection to immediate or subsequent death.

This is a myth which needs to be broken as it has been seen that 97% coronavirus infected patients have been found to recover with or without treatment which if given is just a symptomatic form of treatment, and only about 3% succumb to it— these are the patients who have uncontrolled diabetes or have other coronary or heart disease or respiratory disease or are old or have other medical complications.

The need of the hour is to pay attention to the preventive measures. We should be aware and take adequate preventive measures like frequent hand washing, social distancing, not touching our face frequently, and keeping surfaces clean to contain the contagion. Dry cough and fever could be symptoms of coronavirus so one should consult a doctor when experiencing this. However, there is a cluster of other infections like—sore throat, rhinitis, laryngitis, bronchitis, asthama - which resemble a corona infection and are also very common and prevalent today.

To be able to cope well and be safe we need to have a sane and stress-free mind. Many are suffering from extreme fear and emotional psychological and behavioral health effects. Social media is also proving to be a culprit in adding up to our stress levels now. It is full of posts and videos about coronavirus and some of these posts and memes are adding fuel to the fire of our psychological distress. Do not pay heed to these posts but to rely on authentic data from reliable sources like the WHO or UNICEF or Government notices, for correct information. Follow whatever your Government wants you to do as your cooperation with the Government at this stage can stop the further spread of this disease. A stressed mind decreases our immunity and makes us more vulnerable to the virus attack.

Lets be kind, cautious, courteous, considerate, caring and compassionate to others in these testing times. Meanwhile let us take advantage of this break from going out which we have got and focus on being happy and spending time with our friends and family. Lets plan and visualise good things and times ahead which we plan to do in future. Let us clean up our rooms closets, exercise and do all that we can do to build up our health and immunity. Lets remind ourselves that this time which we are spendig at home with our family has come as a blessing in disguise to us—let us be happy and make the most of it.

We need to focus on having a positive mindset, limit our social media time, soak in positive happy information, music ,movies, do yoga ,meditate ,see the rising sun, laugh and spread cheer all around us.

The Covid-19 pandemic is an opportunity to re-emphasize and reset our core values which we have all overlooked when all was going well. So lets reorganise our daily life and thoughts and make a daily effort to be stress free think positive be positive so that we can cope adaptively with the present situation and come out stronger from it. Together we must and we can.

To improve coping skills, limit screen time and news intake to once or twice a day and stay abreast of new guidelines but avoid news that triggers your panic button.Watch happy movies or video chat with family. Connect more deeply with Nature because now you have the time to do so. Look after your plants and pets.

Acknowledge your anxious thoughts rather than repressing them, then move on quickly.Tell yourself as soon as you notice that you are going into the anxiety zone—I am not going to go there now—and move on to other things. Health workers also exhaust themselves in such a crisis and they too should follow a stress management technique or they will have nothing to give to their patients except an empty hand and heart. Pray if you like and have faith and trust in God. Spirituality increases our resilience and makes us more self confident.

However, institutions and shops providing essential services and goods related to health, food and other items will remain open.All district magistrates have been authorised to take decisions according to the local situation. All citizens are requested to remain in their city and locality.

The villagers should not come out of the villages except when very necessary. Rawat said, “I would like to tell the people that maintaining social distance is the most effective way to stall the spread of coronavirus.

The administration is alert in all places across the state. I have full faith that like citizens fully supported the Janata Curfew called by PM Narendra Modi, they will support us for the safety of the nation, state and their families.

The curfew till March 31 will not be applicable only on essential services. The Government will deposit Rs 1,000 each in the account of all registered labourers so that they are able to procure essential needs. I assure them that the Government will ensure that nobody remains hungry. Sanitisation is underway across the State.

57,23-3-20,Janata Curfew successful across State,"The Janata Curfew was observed successfully in Dehradun and other parts of the State on Sunday. At 5 PM, citizens clapped, blew conch shells and banged plates in support of the health and other workers involved directly in tackling the pandemic situation. Governor Baby Rani Maurya and Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat also participated in this activity at their respective residences. The governor thanked the public for its cooperation and also appealed the citizens to follow the lockdown conditions implemented by the State Government till March 31.

In towns across the state including Dehradun, the roads were deserted as citizens remained indoors. While most of the people appreciated this move, some were skeptical about the effect of the curfew in breaking the chain of further spread of coronavirus.

According to Rudrapur resident Harish Bora, “The Janata Curfew was a smart decision by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and if further extended, we will completely support the decision.”

“It is good that our PM did not impose the curfew on the citizens but asked them to observe it voluntarily. It is a right decision but I do not think that all the people understand the gravity of the spread of coronavirus. Some people are still wandering around on the roads for apparently no reason. Therefore, I think the government should have imposed a compulsory curfew for all so that everyone will have to abide by it,” said Lokesh Sharma, a school teacher from Rajpur.

However, there were some who questioned the move. “The Janata Curfew is not logical at all. People cannot stay at home for weeks without job, salary or ration. The administration can help few people to manage the basic necessities like food or medicine but cannot pay the labourers who are dependent on their daily wages. The administration should understand that social distancing can be maintained even without a curfew,” said Rashid Khan, a store owner in Dalanwala. According to several locals who earn their livelihood as daily wagers or by selling vegetables and other items, the curfew hit them hard and if the condition is extended, they would face dire circumstances.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/janata-curfew-successful-across-state.html

65,23-3-20,Coronavirus may reach you through air also!,"People may acquire the deadly coronavirus through the air, a new study has suggested.

The scientists have discovered that the virus is detectable for up to three hours in aerosols, up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel. An aerosol is a suspension of fine solid particles or liquid droplets in air or another gas.

""This virus is quite transmissible through relatively casual contact, making this pathogen very hard to contain,"" said James Lloyd-Smith, a co-author of the study and a UCLA professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. ""If you're touching items that someone else has recently handled, be aware they could be contaminated and wash your hands.""

The study attempted to mimic the virus being deposited onto everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting by an infected person through coughing or touching objects, for example. The scientists then investigated how long the virus remained infectious on these surfaces.

The study's authors are from UCLA, the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Princeton University. They include Amandine Gamble, a UCLA postdoctoral researcher in Lloyd-Smith's laboratory.

In February, Lloyd-Smith and colleagues reported in the journal eLife that screening travelers for COVID-19 is not very effective. People infected with the virus — officially named SARS-CoV-2 — may be spreading the virus without knowing they have it or before symptoms appear.

Lloyd-Smith said the biology and epidemiology of the virus make infection extremely difficult to detect in its early stages because the majority of cases show no symptoms for five days or longer after exposure.

""Many people won't have developed symptoms yet,"" Lloyd-Smith said. ""Based on our earlier analysis of flu pandemic data, many people may not choose to disclose if they do know.""",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/coronavirus-may-reach-you-through-air-also-.html

67,23-3-20,Anti-Virus steps clean air,"As the nation shifts abruptly to lockdown mode to fight the deadly novel coronavirus, with people staying indoors on Sunday on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for ‘Janata Curfew’, there has been an unexpected result —the clear blue sky.

“Many of the actions the people are taking to fight the coronavirus, like self-imposed ‘curfew’ or working from home, will have an additional benefit of reducing carbon footprint, besides breaking the virus transmission chain. This will help in reduction of individual’s production of greenhouse gases thus significantly curbing emission. This in turn could help in improving the air quality,” said Narendra Nath, a scientist with the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board.

He said that the air quality had improved across the state and one could see the difference. “The sky is blue, which is a pleasant surprise for environmentalists. And this phenomena is visible all across India,” he said.

In Lucknow, the air quality index at noon on Sunday was 61 – it otherwise remains over 200. Nath’s statement was dittoed by Anumita Roychaudhry, from the Centre for Science and Environment. “This is a crisis induced change which has forced people to go for ‘Janata curfew’ (people’s curfew) or allow them to work from home. Vehicular traffic is off the road across the country. The pollution-producing industries are closed and this will reduce carbon footprint,” she said.

Roychaudhry said that satellite pictures had shown reduction in pollution in China and Italy after lockdown was imposed in these countries. “The pictures for India are not available now but surely they will show a positive impact (of lockdown) on the country,” Roychaudhry said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/anti-virus-steps-clean-air.html
68,23-3-20,Maharashtra comes to standstill,"The “Janata curfew” called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi brought the otherwise bustling country’s commercial capital and other parts of Maharashtra to a standstill on Sunday, even as one more Covid-19 infected person died and 10 others tested positive in the state and the Uddhav Thackeray government announced its decision to clamp prohibitory order under section 144 of Cr PC in the entire state from the midnight till March 31.

Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra reverberated to the sounds of clapping, chiming of bells, drumming up of plates and other utensils and blowing of Shanks (Conch shells) indulged in by citizens from walks of life to express their gratitude towards doctors, nurses and all other medical professionals battling with the pandemic across the country.

Responding to a call by the Prime Minister, the people came out in the balconies of their flats, terraces of their buildings at 5 pm, in front of their chawls and displayed their appreciation towards doctors and other medical professionals engaged in the treatment of Coronavirus patients in the country. Though the engagement was meant for just five minutes, so enthusiastic were the people that they clapped and indulged in other acts of appreciation for nearly ten minutes at many places. Some people even sang bhajans and shouted patriotic slogans.

Hours before the citizens across the state – responding to “Janata Curfew” called by the Prime Minister -- voluntarily confined themselves all through the day at their homes to check the spread of Covid-19, Coronavirus raised its ugly head in the state, as a 63-year-old infected man died at HN Reliance foundation Hospital late on Saturday night.

“A 63-year-old male patient, who had been admitted to private hospital on March 19, died at 11.03 on Saturday. The patient, who was a positive Covid-19 case, had chronic history of diabetes, high blood pressure and Ischemic heart disease and he developed Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), leading to his death,” a statement issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said.

With the latest death, the total number of Coronavirus related deaths rose to two in Maharashtra. Earlier, a 63-year-old disease-infected had died at the Kasurba Hospital on March 17.

With ten more fresh cases, the total number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in the state jumped to 74 on Sunday. Of the fresh infected cases, six are from Mumbai (which includes one case from Navi Mumbai), while the remaining four are from Pune. “Of the ten new cases, five persons have had history of international travel and the remaining five have contracted the virus through contact with infected persons,” State Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.

In a major development to check what he called “multiplication and spread” of Coronavirus in the state, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced the clamping of prohibitory orders under section 144 of Cr PC banning the assembly of five or more persons in all urban areas of the state from this midnight till March 31 and further decreased the employees’ attendance limit in government offices from the earlier 25 per cent to 5 per cent.

Addressing the people across the state through social media shortly after the Railway Ministry announced the closure of long-distance and suburban train services, Uddhav said: “We have entered a most critical period as far as the spread of Coronavirus is concerned. It is important for us to check the spread of the Coronavirus in the state. There would not be suburban train services in Mumbai from tomorrow. We have also ordered close down of state transport and private buses. The intra-city buses will be operation only for those engaged in essential services”

“However, we have spared the sale of essential goods, food grains, vegetables, drugs and electricity from the prohibitory orders. Similarly, banks and stock exchange will function normally,” he said.

The CM appealed once again to the people with history of international travel, who have been stamped for quarantine, not to stir out of their homes for the next 15 days. “It is necessary for the family members of these people to keep away from the “stamped” people even while living at the same home. Those quarantined should consult the doctors, if they find symptoms of Coronavirus in them”.

Meanwhile, State Health Minister Rajesh Tope announced that the “Janata Curfew” called by the Prime Minister would be in force in the state till 5 am on Monday.

73,23-3-20,Troops’ movement suspended,"The Central paramilitary with a strength of 10 lakh personnel have ordered immediate suspension of movement of troops for any kind of travel, including leaves or routine work, and directed them to ''be where they are'' till April 5 to check coronavirus outbreak in their ranks.

The forces have also asked all jawans and officers to fill up a declaration form to State that none of their family members have travelled to any foreign destination in the recent past and in case someone has, they need to undergo medical test or put into isolation on a case-to-case basis, officials said.

The directive has been issued by the headquarters of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and National Security Guard (NSG) in order to ensure prevention of a mass outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in their ranks. These forces are tasked for a variety of internal security roles including counter-terrorism, anti-insurgency, securing vital installations and border guarding duties.

The troops live in close proximity in dedicated camp areas and even one COVID-19 positive case among them can potentially infect hundreds of colleagues in a short time. This has led the Union Home Ministry to issue directives to the forces to ensure that no one travels for routine duties, goes on leave or comes back from leave to join duty till April 5, they said, adding the order will be reviewed after April 5.

The CISF, the designated force for securing vital installations including airports and VIPs, issued a directive on Saturday stating: ""In order to cut down travel risk to prevent the possibility of spread of the disease during travel, the competent authority has directed that all personnel who are already on leave and likely to join duty before April 5 may be asked to extend leave till April 5. ""This may be ensured by intimating affected personnel over phone by respective leave sanctioning authorities"".

Two days back, the BSF had similarly cancelled the movement of all its troops and officers.The over 2.5 lakh personnel-strong border guarding force, primarily tasked to guard the Indian borders with Pakistan and Bangladesh, has said violation of these directives will invite action against those who undertake the journey and their commanders who approve such movements.

The BSF order stated: ""It is categorically clarified that there should not be any movement of manpower with regard to leave, training, courses, temporary duties etc, upto April 5.""The order said these directives are meant for ""strict compliance"".

The force also asked all its commanders to extend the leave of off-duty jawans and officers till April 5 ""with immediate effect, to avoid unnecessary movement from their home town to place of duty"".

The order said such personnel should be informed about the extension of their leaves on their personal telephones so that there is ""no communication gap"" and such personnel do not begin their journeys.

It has also been ordered that officers and sub-officers who are undergoing a training course ""should be kept at the respective centres"" till April 5 and if required their courses should be extended in order to stop them from travelling to their homes or offices.

The CRPF was the first to issue a detailed order to restrict all non-operational movements of the force's personnel till April 15. Other forces have issued similar orders,

In case of a emergency, the leaves will be granted for a period of not less than 30 days. The Union Home Ministry recently directed that all non-emergency leaves of paramilitary personnel should be ""cancelled"" in order to minimise the risk of contracting coronavirus during travel and they should get into ""battle mode"" to combat the pandemic by ensuring personal and public safety.

82,23-3-20,Induced supply covered under ‘force majeure’ says Govt,"The government has given relief to companies from facing penalties over non-fulfilment of their contractual obligation with business partners because of disruption in supply lines in COVID-19 affected countries including China.

An office memorandum issued by the finance ministry has clarified that COVID-19-related disruptions should be considered as a case of natural calamity to herefore 'force majeure' clause could be invoked for non-performance of contractual obligations.

Force majeure means extraordinary events or circumstances beyond human control such as act of god, war, riot, etc. A force majeure clause in a contract frees both parties from contractual obligation when prevented by such events. Finance ministry had directed all ministries to treat disruptions due to the virus outbreak as case of natural calamity, providing relief to government contractors in February.

The rule also applied to private contracts. But there were doubts whether force majeure clause could be invoked, if the disruption in supply chains was due to spread of coronavirus in China or any other country.

With 80 districts with confirmed cases of coronavirus announcing lockdown till March 31 most establishments and companies will have to shut their operations that could result in businesses not fulfilling their contractual obligations. Unless force majeure clause is invoked, such non-performance is penalised.

The disruption in business operations is not the only issue now as several suppliers are also facing delays in getting shipments from countries such as China. This open gates for penalties that would be avoided now by invoking force majeure clause.

Force majeure clause does not give a blanket protection against any non-fulfillment of contractual terms. It also depends on the mutually agreed upon events and obligations to be covered by this clause. But with Covid-19 outbreak being considered a natural calamity, the clause can be legally invoked.

Force majeure does not absolve a party's non-performance entirely but only suspends it for the duration of the FM. The firm has to give notice of force majeure as soon as it occurs and it cannot be claimed ex-post facto. If the performance of a contractual obligation under force majeure is delayed for a period exceeding 90 days, either party can terminate the contract without any financial repercussions.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/induced-supply-covered-under----force-majeure----says-govt.html

SBI, the lead banker, will get Rs 300 crore from the resolution of this account, sources said. Punjab National Bank (PNB) will write back about Rs 100 crore from this, sources said, adding that other lenders like Bank of Baroda and Canara Bank too will be able to show cash recovery from this account. All the lenders will recover a total of Rs 770 crore from this account during the last quarter which is considered difficult due to outbreak of coronavirus.

This will add to the profitability of banks in the current quarter and should help in absorbing the new provisions made during this year, sources added.

The case of JSL was referred to the CDR framework in 2009 when the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) did not exist.Earlier this month, JSL announced its exit from CDR framework. The company received a letter from the consortium of CDR lenders to this effect on March 4. ""Pursuant to this, existing CDR lenders have realised the full recompense of about Rs 275 crore in cash, which will add to their income in the current fiscal itself.

“Additionally, JSL has fully redeemed the outstanding Optionally Convertible Redeemable Preference Shares (OCRPS), which were issued to the lenders in June 2017, and has paid around Rs 558 crore, taking the aggregate realisation of lenders to around Rs 833 crore,"" the company had said in a statement.

Earlier, the promoter group entity had infused equity and subsequently JSL issued Non-convertible Debentures (NCDs) worth Rs 400 crore to Kotak Special Situations Fund (KSSF) and the fund mobilised assisted JSL in redeeming the OCRPS. ""KSSF has also acquired approximately 5 per cent equity stake in JSL through the secondary market, which demonstrates increased investors' confidence in the company's operations and growth outlook,"" it had said.

94,23-3-20,WORLD steps up restrictions,"From Italy to India to the United States, Governments rolled out tougher measures to halt the rapid spread of the coronavirus pandemic as global cases surged past 300,000 on Sunday and Asia braced for a possible second wave of infections.

Nearly one billion people are already confined to their homes around the world as countries race to contain the ballooning outbreak by imposing unprecedented lockdown measures, shutting shops and businesses and sealing borders.

The pandemic has sparked fears of a global recession, prompting governments to unleash gigantic emergency measures to avoid an economic meltdown.

More than 12,000 people have died from the virus worldwide, with the situation increasingly grim in Italy, the new epicentre of the disease which first emerged in central China late last year before marching across the globe.

Countries in Asia now worry infections could once again mount on their shores as travellers return from badly-hit parts of Europe, a continent under siege by the pandemic, with more than 150,000 declared cases.

Italy has now reported more deaths than mainland China and third-placed Iran combined, and it has a death rate of 8.6 percent among confirmed COVID-19 infections -- significantly higher than in most other countries.

The death toll in the Mediterranean nation of 60 million spiked to more than 4,800 -- over a third of the global total.

Lockdown measures have done little to stem new infections and deaths and the government announced the closure of all non-essential factories in a late-night TV address.

Police patrolled the deserted streets of Rome Sunday, while checks were also carried out on beaches after local officials complained people were defying orders to catch some time in the sun.

In his weekly prayer -- now being streamed live to avoid crowds gathering -- the Pope urged all Italians to follow isolation measures.

“Let us do the things that the government asks us to do for the good of us all,” Pope Francis said.

Similar shut-in measures have been rolled out in badly-hit Spain and France, where helicopters and drones were being deployed to ensure crowds do not gather in parks or along river banks.

Spain saw a sharp spike in deaths again Sunday -- a 30 percent rise bringing total fatalities to 1,720 -- while France saw its death toll mount to 562 on Saturday.

Britain is also ramping up its response in the wake of steadily rising cases and deaths after the government was criticised for failing to take stricter measures sooner.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Sunday urged 1.5 million people most at risk from the virus to stay home, as he warned the numbers of infections and deaths “are very stark, and they are accelerating”.

Pubs, restaurants, theatres and leisure centres had already been closed across the country, and the government said it could give police, public health and immigration officers extra powers to contain the outbreak.

China reported its first local infection in four days on Sunday. While the number of cases in the mainland has slumped dramatically since the crisis began, there are fears in Asia of “imported” cases from other hotspots like Europe.

Thailand reported its highest daily rise in cases, taking its total to nearly 600, while Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia have also reported a spike in cases after numbers had plateaued earlier.

Millions of people in India were confined to their homes Sunday as the country went into lockdown with a one-day nationwide “self-imposed curfew”.

Normally bustling streets in the capital New Delhi and the financial hub of Mumbai were mostly deserted and most shops shuttered.

“If this helps stop the spread, then the government can think of extending it for two to three more days,” said Jaiveer Singh, a security guard at Delhi’s Lodhi Gardens park, largely empty on Sunday.

Tighter restrictions are now in place elsewhere in Asia, with Australia shutting its borders to foreigners and non-residents and Pakistan suspending international flights.

More than a third of Americans were meanwhile adjusting to life in various phases of lockdown, including in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. Other parts of the United States are expected to ramp up restrictions as well. “This is a time of shared national sacrifice, but also a time to treasure our loved ones,” US President Donald Trump said. “We’re going to have a great victory.” New Jersey on Saturday followed several states in telling residents to stay indoors.

In neighbouring New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo warned that the disruption is likely to last for months, not weeks. The US Food and Drug Administration also approved the first coronavirus test that can be conducted entirely at the point of care for a patient and deliver results in 45 minutes.

Vice President Mike Pence and his wife tested negative for the coronavirus, his press secretary tweeted Saturday. The couple had taken the test after one of Pence’s staffers contracted the illness.

The pandemic has bludgeoned global stock markets, and the United States -- the world’s biggest economy -- is preparing a huge emergency stimulus package that could top USD 1 trillion.Several European countries have already announced their own stimulus packages to stave off economic collapse.The coronavirus has infected more than 1,100 across Africa too, where healthcare systems are limited and social distancing measures are difficult in crowded cities.

The Middle East also remains on high alert, where Iran which suffered a major outbreak reported 129 deaths on Sunday. But the Islamic Republic has refused to join the rest of the world in imposing heavy restrictions.

El Salvador joined several central and South American countries in imposing quarantine measures on Saturday, as Colombia announced its first coronavirus death.

While the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are the hardest hit by the virus, the WHO has warned that young people are also vulnerable.

Accurate COVID-19 figures are difficult to reach because many of the victims suffered from other illnesses, and infection rates are uncertain because of a lack of testing in many countries.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/world-steps-up-restrictions.html

With 1,785 being treated in intensive care units for the virus, there is mounting concern about overcrowding at hospitals.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned late on Saturday that Spain’s outbreak, already among the harshest in the world, would continue to worsen. “We must prepare ourselves emotionally and psychologically for very hard days ahead,” he told the nation in a televised address late on Saturday. “We have yet to receive the impact of the most damaging wave, which will test our material and moral capacities to the limit, as well as our spirit as a society,” he added.

104,23-3-20,Arrival of virus in Gaza raises fears about vulnerable areas,"The arrival of the coronavirus in the Gaza Strip, an impoverished enclave where the health care system has been gutted by years of conflict, raised fears Sunday the pandemic may soon prey on some of the most vulnerable populations in the world.

Authorities in Gaza, which has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since the Islamic militant group Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007, confirmed its first two cases overnight, in returnees who had come from Pakistan.

An outbreak could wreak havoc on the Palestinian territory, which is home to over 2 million people, many living in cramped cities and refugee camps.

There are similar concerns about a catastrophe if the virus turns up in war-torn Syria, Libya or Yemen.

The virus causes only minor flu-like symptoms in most people, who recover in a matter of weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with underlying health problems. Severe cases are often only able to breathe with respirators.

Abdelnasser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization's Gaza office, said the territory only has 62 ventilators, with all but 15 already in use. He estimates the territory needs 50 to 100 more to address an outbreak. With its current capacity, he estimated Gaza's hospitals can handle the first 100 cases if they come in gradually.

""If there is a spread to hundreds, this will cause a challenge to the health care system,"" he said. Gaza's isolation likely delayed the arrival of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 300,000 people worldwide and killed more than 13,000. More than 90,000 people have recovered.The pandemic has halted or disrupted travel across the world. On Sunday, long-haul carrier Emirates said it would suspend all passenger flights beginning Wednesday.

A 15-year-old was reported to be in critical condition and 16 others were injured, authorities said. The European seismological agency, EMSC, said the earthquake measured 5.3 and struck a wide area north of the capital, Zagreb, at 6:23 a.m. (0523 GMT) Sunday.

The epicenter was seven kilometers (four miles) north of Zagreb at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles). Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the earthquake was the biggest in Zagreb in the last 140 years. Many buildings in the capital cracked and walls and rooftops were damaged. Downtown streets were littered with debris. Concrete slabs fell on cars and chimneys landed in front of entrances.

“Panga brings to life the tug-of-war between passion and responsibilities in the most idealistic way possible,” Kangana said.

“The film begs to answer the question — for how long will women have to sacrifice their dreams to build a perfect family, and who says we can't do it all? It's a film that is close to my heart and I'm certain many women across the country will relate to it,” she added.

‘When you act in a film, you don’t know what that film is eventually going to do but the success of Hichki helped a lot of people understand that it’s never an actor’s personal life that can trigger any kind of failure or success. It all depends on the content is and your intentions. And Hichki was made with purest intentions which can be seen as well.’

109,23-3-20,Hidden figures no more,"Kirti Kulhari, Sayani Gupta, Maanvi Gagroo and Bani J talk about how the second season of Four More Shots Please! presents women who are flawed yet own their personalities with pride. By Team Viva

Gaining colossal fame among the netizens, Four More Shots Please! became the first all-women protagonist Indian web series, where their struggles against an unfair life, their jealousy, need for validation and a search for love, took the centrestage.

The makers of show have finally announced the release of its second season, starring Kirti Kulhari, Sayani Gupta, Maanvi Gagroo and Bani J. The show revolved around four best friends who tell the world to pay a little more attention to what women truly want. The second season is set to show their new mistakes but also that how they love each other more fiercely and choose themselves over society’s improbable demands.

Kirti, who plays a divorcee and a single mother, Anjana, says, “The concept of the series intrigued me from the first day. My excitement has doubled since the time we started the shoot of second season. I believe that this show will make each viewer see a little bit of themselves in every character. I really hope they will be able to connect with them, personally.”

Umang, played by Bani J, is all about taking life one casual hook-up at a time. She owns her sexuality and falls in love with a woman who isn’t ready to come out of the closet yet. Talking about her character, Bani says, “I’ve said this a couple times before that it felt serendipitous to me that I was approached to play Umang. It wasn’t because she has an affinity to lift weights but because of her journey, her story and this unshakable conviction with which she does things in her life — uprooting herself from home, being in love, being herself. The more time I get to play and be Umang, the more I am completely able to understand and create her. It’s an unusual and quite a cool experience for me — being able to play the same character for seasons in a go. It’s hard to explain but I think when people watch it, they’ll know it.”

For Maanvi, life has come full circle with this second season. She says, “The show, particularly Siddhi (her character), is very close to my heart. After being a part of it, I can now better understand Siddhi and her actions. She is a relatable person and acts as an inspiration each time she turns her weaknesses into her strengths. The show is certainly our labour of love.”

Sayani or the workaholic Damini feels great to come back in a familiar environment. She adds, “There is a special charm in reuniting with old co-actors and makers. The show has surpassed pre-conceived notions that a show made by women on women would be just about male-bashing. The show celebrates women who are different, not only in their looks but also personalities. They are flawed but they own it. It also celebrates women with agency, which is the need of the hour, and the fact that every girl should have the right to choose her life’s course, backed my education and strive for financial independence.”

110,23-3-20,Manage the spike,"Home internet jammed up? Try these steps before upgrading

With so much of the workforce — and their families — now cooped up at home to combat the spread of the novel Coronavirus, it’s not a huge surprise that home internet is showing the strain.

If you’ve had a business videoconference stutter while the teenagers at home play Call of Duty online, or found yourself unable to stream the news while your spouse uploads huge data files for work, you’ll have a good idea of the problem.

Is there a bandwidth problem?

The internet’s core is managing the spike in traffic just fine, experts say. It has massive capacity to handle Netflix, YouTube, Zoom and other streaming services.

True, Netflix has just throttled down its video quality in Europe at the request of authorities there. But the company already stores its programs on servers close to users’ homes already and there’s no evidence that it’s clogging networks.

If the internet is so sturdy, why does my home connection stutter?

The problem partly lies in the so-called “last mile,” the link that connects your home to the ultra-high speed internet backbone.

Most homes get their internet from cable companies and thus connect to the broader network via coaxial cable, a legacy of the cable TV era. These connections provide faster “downstream” speeds to your home than “upstream” speeds back to the internet. Since videoconferencing sends equal amounts of data both ways, simultaneous sessions can clog the upstream channel and disrupt service for everyone.

If that happens, one quick solution is to have some family members switch to audio-only, which conserves bandwidth. This also applies to anyone in multiplayer online games, where — per a wag on Twitter — the banter between players often resembles conference calls with occasional shooting.

You could also order a service upgrade, although that might not be strictly necessary. Some providers are temporarily offering more bandwidth, particularly for families with school-age children, in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

The relatively few households with their own direct fiber-optic connections have the same bandwidth in both directions and shouldn’t experience serious hiccups.

Does my home network need an upgrade?

It might. Start with your internet modem, the device that most likely has a coax cable connecting it to your wall. Your internet provider often rents the modem to you.

If it’s several years old, it’s probably time to ask your provider if upgrading the modem’s internal software, or replacing the modem entirely, will help. Older modems often can’t deliver the full bandwidth you’re paying for to you.

Next up is your Wi-Fi router. If you have cable, it may be built into your modem. If you haven’t already, try moving it to a more central location in your home or apartment; that will ensure bandwidth is distributed equally.

Or you can add more access points and distribute Wi-Fi with a “mesh” network. Newer routers let you add several satellite stations that boost your signal throughout the house, though you might have to arrange that with your provider.

One more possibility: You can connect some devices directly to the router with ethernet cables instead of using Wi-Fi. This may improve the performance of videoconferencing.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/manage-the-spike-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/manage-the-spike.html
111,23-3-20,The Corona deal,"Although the pandemic threat has caused the global economy to be in free fall, it doesn’t mean that organisations have to pause their operations and wait for the storm to blow over before businesses can get back on track, says Raman Singh

Tomas Pueyo published a blog in which he offered an extensively stats-backed analysis of why politicians and business leaders need to proactively address the Coronavirus pandemic. He also provided containment as well as mitigation strategies to accelerate their implementation in corporate settings but not before laying bare the stark reality of the COVID-19 outbreak:

The coronavirus is coming to you.

It’s coming at an exponential speed:

gradually, and then suddenly.

It’s a matter of days.

Maybe a week or two.

When it does, your healthcare system will be overwhelmed.

Your fellow citizens will be treated in the hallways. Exhausted healthcare workers will break down.

Some will die.

They will have to decide which patient gets the oxygen and which one dies.

The only way to prevent this is social distancing today.

Not tomorrow.

Today.

That means keeping as many people home as possible, starting now.

In the very next line, he asserts that people in top positions, including business leaders, have both the power and the responsibility to mitigate the consequences of the global pandemic, if not exactly avert it completely. In fact, leading global organisations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon and Twitter have already issued a work-from-home notification for their employees. At last estimate, 328 tech companies in the US joined the staying home club. It is high time that Indian organisations follow the suit and enact social distancing policies effective immediately.

Technology to the rescue: How Cloud-enabled tools can drive remote working

Even before the outbreak of COVID-19, the tech-driven paradigm shift towards new-age business communication models beyond email, calls and text messaging was already on full swing. According to market research, with the emergence of Cloud-enabled and mobile-optimised communication tools, the global percentage of people preferring to work from a remote working environment is expected to rise by 38 per cent.

Despite the advent of advanced Cloud-based enterprise tools, a majority of organisations are still using generic voice-centric implements (such as premise-based PBXs) to enable easy interaction within their company. Hence, to effectively drive greater business communication experience, enterprises need to leverage the power of collaborative, mobile-first Unified Communication as a Service (UCaaS)-based tools. Such tools can empower businesses to shift the telecommute traffic entirely to the digital realm, enabling them to provide their employees with a safe and secure working facility that is free from location constraints.

Such an approach can make a huge difference during times of crises such as the current Coronavirus pandemic, when practicing social distancing ought to be everybody’s utmost priority. As organisations are rapidly taking cognisance of this fact, the following are some of the tech-enabled strategies that they can utilise to activate a seamless remote working environment for the benefit and safety of their employees and society at large:

Video conferencing as compared to in-person interactions

When people are being advised to go into self-quarantine to avoid getting infected or further spreading the virus, the option to attend in-person meetings naturally goes out of the window. One option that professionals then have is to conduct meetings over calls or text messages. However, this method, too, can be easily snubbed in favour of video conferencing which undeniably offers a more immersive experience than a simple phone-centric interaction.

Facilitating mobile PBX connection

A PBX (Private Branch Exchange) is a switch station for telephone systems. It consists mainly of several branches of telephone systems and it switches connections to and from them, thereby linking phone lines. Leading market players can enable an organisation to begin their journey towards the Cloud destination. One of the salient features of such a transformation is the virtual phone system that is seamlessly integrated with the existing PBX phone system in an organisation. Such a tool can empower employees to communicate with each other via the PBX system but by using their own mobile phones, irrespective of where they are located.

Integrating customised interactive voice response system (IVR)

Using this feature, organisations can customise an appropriate voice response greeting for any and all incoming calls that they receive. Besides, tech-enabled supplements can even facilitate the option of capturing the number and voice mails of a caller in case the user is unable to respond. This frees a professional working from home from the unnecessary hassle and compulsion of answering every incoming call under duress.

Although the pandemic threat has caused the global economy to be in free fall, it doesn’t mean that organisations have to pause their operations and wait for the storm to let up before businesses can get back on track. Thanks to the intervention of Cloud-based tech tools, professionals no longer need to visit their offices to engage in business transactions.

By adopting the aforementioned strategies, organisations can now enable their workforce to do it from a remote working environment, including their homes. And this, now more than before, has emerged as the most appropriate option available to business leaders to ensure the safety of their employees in the face of the unfortunate disruption while keeping their business processes in sustained motion.

112,23-3-20,Climate control,"If we wish to go back from the brink and return to a life of harmony with nature, we need to realise our spiritual identity and values, says Rajyogi Brahmakumar Nikunj Ji

A few centuries ago, no one worried about climate change because there was no reason to do so. But as humans extracted more from nature and dumped an increasing amount of waste, including highly toxic substances, the ecological balance began to get disrupted. This process has accelerated over the decades and brought us to the present situation, where, according to some experts, the entire human race faces extinction in the near future.

Climate change and global warming are sometimes thought of as things that will happen in the future. But scientists are finding increasing evidence that the planet is changing now. And that people must take a large share of the blame for this phenomenon. They further explain that excessive carbon emissions from industries, air pollution, use of CFCs, deforestation and extreme use natural resources have depleted the ozone layer. This has trapped solar radiations inside the earth’s atmosphere. As a result, the earth is heating up, which has begun to trigger a chain of natural upheavals like floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and landslides in recent times.

To prevent such an eventuality, humans need to work on themselves. Man does not need to master nature. The human soul is the master of all that is material. It is when the soul begins to identify itself with the body that it comes under the influence of matter and vices. Many centuries ago, when human souls had self-awareness and divine qualities, nature was their obedient servant. The elements of nature made life more pleasant and enjoyable in that era, which is known as paradise or heaven in religious texts. No natural calamity ever occurred because humans and nature existed in complete harmony, each respecting the other. The divine beings of that world were free of vices, they never exploited nature. Instead of being environment-friendly, they had a truly friendly environment. Humans began to exploit natural resources, gradually harming the environment. In return, nature, too, ceased to obey souls who had lost mastery over themselves. As the influence of the vices grew, so did the plunder of nature. What was once a harmonious relationship turned more into one between an exploiter and the exploited. This process, over time, has brought us to the present impasse.

The Prime Minister of India, in his speech at UN, said, “We can achieve the same level of development, prosperity and well-being without necessarily going down the path of reckless consumption. It doesn’t mean that economies will suffer; it will mean that our economies will take on a different character. For us in India, respect for nature is an integral part of spiritualism. We treat nature’s bounties as sacred. Yoga is an invaluable gift of our ancient tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; a holistic approach to health and well-being. It is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with yourself, the world and the nature. By changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, it can help us deal with climate change.”

Now, if we wish to go back from the brink and return to a life of harmony with nature, we need to realise our spiritual identity and values. Such awareness will make us naturally eco-friendly and send out a positive energy that will bring the elements of nature into harmony with us again. If a critical mass of humans begin to live with this spiritual awareness, nature will become our friend, and humanity will look at a golden instead of doubtful future.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/climate-control-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/climate-control.html
113,23-3-20,One leaf at a time,"Find joy indoors in troubled times through plant parenting

I have spent my first full week of isolation carefully observing one of my houseplants. Dylan, as my fiancee and I so fondly call her, has been growing new leaves at an uncharacteristically rapid rate.

It might be the longer hours of daylight. But I imagine Dylan’s new zest for life also comes from the increased attention we’ve paid to her and the rest of our houseplants now that we’re with them in our apartment 24/7. At a time when so little feels under control, one thing we know is up to us is the survival of these living things we have committed to taking care of. We check on them more. We give them more water. Sometimes, we just stare at them, taking in the beauty and comfort they provide.

When we first decided to take the leap into plant ownership, before the outbreak of the coronavirus, I simply wanted to brighten our apartment. I’d been sprucing up the place with flowers but had grown tired of spending money on something that would die within days or weeks. I had no idea how much joy the plants would bring me or how much fun I would have learning to care for them.

Now, every morning at a time when I might usually be kissing my fiancee goodbye as she heads off to school, I amble over to where Dylan sits on the windowsill and smile at her buds, which seem to have doubled in size each day. These new ones are a bright, bold green.

My plants help satisfy a dog-size hole in my heart. Of course, they don’t return love the way a dog would, and I promise I am fully aware they are not sentient beings. But they do make the apartment feel brighter, warmer and cozier. They need me, and that feels good.

The first thing we did when we brought the plants home was name them. We did it to be silly, yes, but it also felt instinctual. We had spent an entire weekend carefully selecting them from two different stores, and we hoped to keep them in our lives for many years.

Naming something, of course, breeds connection. I began to greet them when I came home, and I started speaking to them like they were more pet than plant. I have purchased spray bottles and plant food and a watering can and newer, prettier pots because my plants, of course, deserve the best.

Molly gazing at one of her new house plants, which she named Dylan. Molly, right, and her fiance Meredith celebrate the purchase of one of their new house plants. Plant parenting, it turns out, is no easy task. Though they are indeed difficult to kill, it takes effort to keep them looking bright, shiny and healthy. I am still learning to care for them, but especially now, I love the work of doing so. It brings comfort, consistency.

Early in our plant parenthood, we left town for the weekend. When we got home, we encountered disaster. Dylan was a mess. Almost all her shiny red-green leaves were browned, crumpled and scattered across the floor. A few still hung limply from her now-muted green stem. The rest of our houseplants were fine, but I was convinced she was a goner. Still, I grabbed the watering can and sprang into action. I gave her as much water as I could without drowning her. I placed my phone beside her and blasted music just in case that could help. I prayed she liked Taylor Swift.

The next morning, Dylan looked better. Her stem stood straighter and her remaining leaves had unfolded. Within days, little buds grew where the leaves had been lost. I couldn’t believe it. She was going to make it. Dylan has never looked quite the same since that weekend. Her frame has always looked a little barer. But now, it seems, just when we need her to most, she is ready to grow again.

What I wouldn’t give at a time like this to have a dog, to wake up to a furry, goofy, joyous face, to someone who doesn’t understand at all what’s happening and whose world has only grown fuller because humans are spending more time in it. But for now, caring for our plants will simply have to do.

We are clinging to the little things that bring us joy. Sometimes, it’s the jokes on “Grace and Frankie.” Other times, it’s a video happy hour with friends. Right now, it’s the sprouting of new leaves.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/one-leaf-at-a-time-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/one-leaf-at-a-time.html
114,23-3-20,Serie A club Brescia warn of plague,"The president of Italian football club Brescia who are based in the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic said it was time to cancel the Serie A season because of ‘the plague’.

Serie A basement dwellers Brescia are destined for relegation — should the matches ever play out to their logical end in May.

No ball has been kicked in anger in the football-mad country since March 9 because of an outbreak that bore down on Italy from China last month.

The nation of 60 million is under a lockdown that could well run for many more weeks.

Some big Italian clubs have been discussing the idea of resuming practise in preparation for possible matches behind closed doors.

But Brescia president Massimo Cellino told the Corriere dello Sport newspaper that people who were thinking of playing during a crisis were deluding themselves.

“Everything has to be moved to the next season. It is time for realism, gentlemen. This is the plague,” Cellino said.

Brescia is one of the cities in Italy’s northern Lombardy region around Milan most heavily hit by the killer disease.

Lombardy’s death toll surpassed 3,000 on Saturday.

The region of around 10 million has reported more than 25,000 infections — about as many as officially counted in Spain.

“You can no longer play this year. Think about the next one,” said Cellino.

Yet some Italian clubs with title aspirations are planning to resume training next week.

Second-placed Lazio — just a point behind perennial champions Juventus — has said they wanted to resume training as early as Monday.

Italian media speculate they might postpone it until after the ban on public gatherings formally expires on Wednesday. Sixth-placed Napoli also aired plans to start training next week.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has already indicated that all the ban and closures will be extended for weeks if not months.

Cellino appeared to firmly back Conte's approach.

“This season is finished. Anyone who wants this cursed (title), take it. It is closed. Finished. And I am not saying this because Brescia is last in the standings,” the club president said.

“We are last because we deserve it.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/serie-a-club-brescia-warn-of-plague.html

The latest correspondence came as Kim observed the firing of tactical guided weapons over the weekend, drawing criticism from South Korea, as nuclear talks remain deadlocked.

In a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, Kim’s sister and senior ruling party official, Kim Yo Jong, praised Trump for sending the letter at a time when “big difficulties and challenges lie ahead in the way of developing ties” between the countries.

In the letter, she said Trump explained his plan to “propel the relations between the two countries ... And expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work,” an apparent reference to the global coronavirus outbreak.

She said her brother expressed his gratitude for Trump’s letter.

North Korea has repeatedly said there hasn’t been a single case of the coronavirus on its soil.

Some foreign experts question that claim and say an outbreak in the North could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its poor medical infrastructure.

Last month, the State Department expressed concerns about North Korea’s vulnerability to a potential coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to support efforts by aid organizations to contain the spread of the illness in the North. A senior Trump administration official said Sunday that Trump sent a letter to Kim that the official said was consistent with Trump’s efforts to engage global leaders during the pandemic. The official said Trump looks forward to continued communications with the North Korean leader.

“We cannot afford complete lockdown as it will create massive unrest,” he said, adding that the situation in the country is not as bad as in Italy or France.

“If the condition was similar to that of Italy, I would have imposed a lockdown,” he said.

He urged the people to follow the policy of self-isolation and stay inside their homes. He said the government was constantly watching the situation and all necessary measures will be taken accordingly.

The government on Saturday suspended all international flights for two weeks and curtailed train services to curb the spread of the virus, which has turned into a major global crisis.

Official data issued by National Disaster Management Authority showed at least 646 confirmed coronavirus cases.

On Saturday, the public relations officer (PRO) to the Sindh health minister told the media that the number of COVID-19 patients in the province has surged to 392. Throughout the day, the local media outlets quoted the new figures which took the nationwide tally of COVID-19 patients to 745.

The massive spike in numbers created alarm and sent the people panicking. However, late in the night the PRO revised the figures downwards to 292 citing a “counting error”.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/imran-khan-rules-out-complete-lockdown--says-it-will-create-chaos.html

A cargo flight containing more than 6 million medical items arrived Sunday in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.

The supplies from Ma, the founder of China’s e-commerce giant Alibaba, will be distributed to African countries in need of supplies to battle the spreading COVID-19 pandemic.

An Ethiopian Airlines cargo flight from Guangzhou, China arrived with 5.4 million face masks, 1.08 million testing kits, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 protective face shields, according to Ethiopian officials and the Jack Ma Foundation.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last week pledged to distribute the supplies to other countries in Africa.

120,23-3-20,Virus advances around the world as medical supplies dwindle,"The virus pandemic advanced Sunday after the US and Europe reported soaring new cases, prompting a scramble in some regions to set up additional hospital beds and replenish much-needed medical supplies.

Italy announced its biggest day-to-day increase of infections, which rose by 6,600 with nearly 800 new fatalities from the virus that causes COVID-19. The country’s total death toll of more than 4,825 has surpassed the number of deaths in China, where the first cases emerged late last year.

In the US, where multiple states have ordered residents to stay indoors, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the government is “literally scouring the globe looking for medical supplies.”

Health care workers from Oklahoma City to Minneapolis sought donations of protective equipment. Staff at a Detroit hospital began creating homemade face masks for workers. Even rural hospitals were strained as people increasingly felt the pandemic closing in.

In the farming community of Vidalia, Georgia, Dr. Robert Wagner said medical staffers at his emergency room are wearing face masks for their entire 12-hour shifts and changing in and out of full protective gear every time they see people considered a potential coronavirus case — all while dealing with a regular flow of patients injured in car crashes and suffering chest pains or other maladies.

They are testing an increasing number of patients for the virus and worried that the 50-bed Meadows Regional Medical Center could eventually become overwhelmed.

“There’s definitely this underlying fear in the community. You can see it,” he said.

121,23-3-20,Turn back the clock,"Analog wristwatches are making a comeback as designs inspired by different eras and traditions of bygone years are the new trend among discerning buyers, says Sakshi Sharma

Analog watches possess an elegance that will always transcend the contemporary utility of digital ones. Not surprisingly, despite the contemporary utility and features of smart watches, designer watch brands have revived collections that are inspired from different eras of history.

These history-themed watches have made watchmakers delve in the past for inspiration. They no longer limit themselves to simply documenting a 24-hour day. They are blending nostalgic design cues from the past with modernity in order to create the perfect timekeeping devices, both in terms of form as well as function. These designs, in a way, keep the love and trend of watching your wrist at frequent intervals alive.

Favre-Leuba, a Swiss watch brand, has brought together two eras that have shaped history — 1960s, the era of exploration and new beginnings and 2010-2020s, the time of high-tech discoveries. There are some special elements from the two eras that were merged while curating the new collection. Philippe Roten, CEO, says, “All the elements from the 1940s to 1970s that were distinct from the time were taken up in the current collection. The shape of the case, the bridge on its side view, the tetradecagon (14-corner) special bezel, the bold hands, as well as the indices are the most prominent ones. Our collectors and connoisseurs from the mid-1900s look for these elements in the designs even today. The Bathy case from 1968 is what is noticed in the Raider collection of the current times, while the hands of the vintage Deep Blue are also taken up across the new line. The bridge on the side of the cases in our Favre-Leuba Raider and Chief collection is what we symbolically depict as a mark of the merging of the two eras.”

The Tudor North Flag Swiss watch, which derives its name and design inspiration from the British North Greenland Expedition of the early 1950s, in which members of the expedition team wore circa-1952 Tudor Oyster Prince models, have revived their “tool watches,” which used to be instrumental in carrying out the exploratory mission at some of the earth’s harshest climatic conditions.

The Patek Philippe Calatrava Pilot Travel Time 5524 is an “unconventional” watch that has the look of an early-20th-century pilots’ watch. Its dark navy blue dial, inspired by the body paint of 1930s’ American fighter planes gives it an aesthetic touch. The vintage brown calfskin leather strap with contrast top-stitching, relates to the leather belts worn by pilots in the 1930s.

Cartier’s iconic Tank watch, which was first created in 1917 by founder Louis Cartier, was inspired by the Renault tanks that were present at the Western front during the World War I. After multiple re-interpretations in the intervening decades, it is now available in 41 variations, with combinations of yellow gold, white gold, pink gold and steel. With a large, rectangular and recognisable tank motif at its centre, the history-inspired watch continues to represent classic design and nostalgia and gain momentum in the market.

There are watches inspired by the traditional jewelleries, which reek of national heritage and history, too. Nebula by Titan have watches crafted in gold, as they blend watch-making with the rich Indian heritage in jewellery making. “Over the past few years, we have witnessed a rise in the demand of timepieces inspired by Indian roots. More people are opting for intricate yet elegant timepieces. Blending old-world charm with contemporary design has been very well received by the audience,” says Kanwalpreet Walia, marketing head, Titan Watches.

We can attribute various reasons for the rising trend. Philippe says, “Launching watches inspired by history has become a welcome idea in the industry because consumers are appreciating it. This trend is further increasing with various brands and businesses entering and building on the pre-owned and refurbished watches of dominant brands, an initiative launched by many retailers through their own boutiques or also through the online channel.”

The need of reviving the old classics lies in the fact that the resonance and glory of the design and its story from the bygone era evokes nostalgia and emotions. Also, by examining the core attributes of heritage, the new owners can maintain and extend their heritage to future generations through a watch, the elegance of which never fades away. All this helps the brand to maintain a higher connect with consumers. It is for their potential that they are termed as “sleeping beauties.” Philippe says, “The legitimacy that the brand gains, when showcasing its vintage models and old classics, has led to its revival. When you revitalise a classic it also reduces the task of starting from the scratch as the basic layout for a highlight is already available.”

While one might confuse these history-themed watches to be vintage, they do not come back in the exact same form as they have been in the past. The size of the case, the shape of the lugs, the design of the dial and much more are modified to fit in as per the current trends. “All such minor changes are done to suit the current times. In the past, the sizes used to be a bit smaller, between 38 mm to 40 mm. The lugs are now a bit bolder while the dials are a little more vibrant in their look than the ones from the yesteryears. These changes can be noticed by a discerning buyer. Though there are changes in the style and pattern but the charisma of styling is still predominant in the design language. In the current times where many products are getting commodified and losing that special unique appeal, the old classics set trends and emerge as icons. This is what people long for — the genuine craftsmanship and true design values,” says Philippe.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/turn-back-the-clock-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/turn-back-the-clock.html

“Fortunately, we are perfectly fine. Thank you for your messages.”

Italian champions Juventus said that Dybala had been self-isolating since Wednesday.

“He will continue to be monitored. He is well and is asymptomatic,” said the club in a statement.

124,23-3-20,COVID-19 has failed to hamper preps: Reid,"The Indian men’s hockey team chief coach Graham Reid believes eight-time champions India are better placed than their opponents when it comes to preparation for the Tokyo Olympics, as unlike other nations the deadly COVID-19 hasn’t hampered their training program.

It is obviously disappointing that India won’t be able to travel to Germany and England for their FIH Pro League matches after the competition was put off till May due to the spread of the disease, but Reid tried to look at the positives in these trying times.

He lauded the steps taken by the Sports Authority of India (SAI) and Hockey India (HI) amid the ever-rising danger posed by the coronavirus outbreak.

“The authorities were quick to take action and isolate the SAI Centre. We are isolated but we can carry out our normal schedule. Things are very smooth. We can’t control the virus but we can control our environment,” Reid said from SAI South Centre in Bengaluru.

“Things are changing on a daily basis but one of the great thing is our ability to continue training which other countries don’t have. Australian players are based with their families and train in Perth. Argentines have a centralised program but I don’t think they are training at the moment where as, our entire group is together.

“We have 32 campers here and we can play competitive hockey against each other. We are playing internal games in international tempo. We are playing different styles of hockey everyday. One day, we are playing like Germany, the next day like Australia,” Reid added.

“We are continuing what we can do best that is, play hockey in a closed and safe environment. We’re still waiting to hear from Hockey India and the government on their recommendations in the wake of the serious crisis. Definitely, we will have reorganise our Olympic preparation schedule,” the 55-year-old Australian said.

Reid said postponement of the Tokyo Olympics because of the pandemic is a possibility, but hoped against it.

“I have no comment to make whether Olympics should be postponed or not, it is up to the IOC and Tokyo Games organisers. But Olympics is something special, every athlete dreams to be a part of the event some day,” he said.

Things are gloomy everywhere in the wake of the pandemic but Reid and his boys have managed to keep their motivation level high and the coach believes India can finish on the podium in Tokyo, provided they play according to their capability.

“In these circumstances you have to maintain positive mental attitude. The boys gel in each other’s company and the Olympics is certainly enough motivation,” Reid said.

“We now have belief after playing 3 Pro League matches against top 3 teams in the world. Olympics is different but if we play our best, everything is possible.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/covid-19-has-failed-to-hamper-preps--reid-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/covid-19-has-failed-to-hamper-preps--reid.html
125,23-3-20,"IOC says Olympics postponement an option, cancellation 'not on agenda'","The International Olympic Committee said Sunday that postponing the 2020 Olympics is one of its options as the world grapples with the coronavirus pandemic, but that cancellation of the Tokyo showpiece was ""not on the agenda"".

The IOC has faced strong pressure to push back the Games, scheduled from July 24 to August 9, from sporting federations and athletes worried about the health risk as the COVID-19 global death tally went past 13,000 on Sunday.

IOC president Thomas Bach said a decision on when the Games take place would be made ""within the next four weeks"".

""Human lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the Games,"" Bach wrote in an open letter to athletes.

""We have, as indicated before, been thinking in different scenarios and are adapting them almost day by day.

""A final decision about the date of the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 now would still be premature,"" he said.

Bach explained that the IOC was discussing its options with health authorities and stakeholders.

""We are confident that we will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks."" He made clear that there would a Games in Tokyo at some point.

""Cancellation would not solve any problem and would help nobody,"" Bach said. ""Therefore it is not on our agenda.""

Thumbs down

The idea of holding the Games on schedule has drawn a swelling chorus of objections.

On Sunday, nine-time Olympic track and field champion Carl Lewis, as well as the head of French athletics added their voices to the US and French swimming federations, the US and Spanish athletics federations, the Norwegian Olympic Committee and past and current athletes.

Sprinter and long jumper Lewis, who won gold at four different Olympics, told Houston television station KRIV that he backed calls for postponement.

""I just think it's really difficult for an athlete to prepare, to train, to keep their motivation if there's complete uncertainty. That's the hardest thing,"" he said.

""I think a more comfortable situation would be two years and put it in the Olympic year with the Winter Olympics (Beijing 2022) and then make it kind of a celebratory Olympic year."" World Athletics, the governing body of track and field, said they were ""ready to work with the IOC and all sport on an alternative date"".

""World Athletics welcomes discussions with the IOC to postpone the Tokyo Olympic Games and wrote to the IOC earlier today to relay this feedback from its Area Presidents, Council and athletes,"" it said in a statement.

On Saturday, World Athletics president Sebastian Coe told AFP that the sporting world was in ""uncharted territory"".

""I don't think we should have the Olympic Games at all costs, certainly not at the cost of athlete safety,"" Coe said.

Britain's Dina Asher-Smith, the world 200m champion, said she was frustrated by the IOC's four-week window.

""So wait... Does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training - whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway,"" she tweeted.

US media reported on Sunday that American athletes had voted during a virtual town hall with US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) officials and given Tokyo the thumbs down.

Almost three-quarters of the 300 athletes who met online with USOPC supported delaying the Games, USA Today reported.

In all, 70 percent of the athletes supported a postponement with another 23 percent saying it would depend on the consequences, according to details supplied by a member of the USOPC Athletes Advisory Council.

'Really selfish'

Almost a quarter wanted a decision no later than April 15, while 18 percent wanted an immediate decision.

""I feel the IOC is being really, really selfish in trying to push it,"" US hammer thrower Gwen Berry said.

""And there's no need to push it."" US swim and athletics trials to determine the nation's two largest Olympic delegations are set for June.

""The right and responsible thing to do is to prioritise everyone's health and safety and appropriately recognise the toll this difficult situation has, and continues to take, on our athletes and their Olympic Games preparations,"" said USA Track and Field chief Max Siegel.

""For those reasons, USATF is respectfully requesting that the USOPC advocate to the IOC for the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games.""

On Sunday, the USOPC, noting the ""enormous ambiguity"" faced by athletes attempting to prepare for Tokyo, called Bach's pledge to decide on possible postponement in four weeks ""progress"".

""Having spent countless hours communicating with IOC leadership and our peers around the world, we know the difficult obstacles ahead and we are all appreciative that the IOC has heard our concerns and needs, and is working to address them as quickly as possible.""

The head of the French athletics federation said postponement was inevitable.

""Everyone agrees that the Games cannot be held on the dates planned,"" Andre Giraud said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/ioc-says-olympics-postponement-an-option--cancellation--not-on-agenda--2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/ioc-says-olympics-postponement-an-option--cancellation--not-on-agenda-.html

131,23-3-20,My fallout with Taylor is bad stain on NZ cricket: McCullum,"Describing his fallout with Ross Taylor a “bad stain for New Zealand cricket”, former skipper Brendon McCullum attributed it to a race for captaincy between the two in 2011 and admitted that they still aren’t the best of friends despite mutual respect.

Taylor, who is still active in international cricket, took over the captaincy after Daniel Vettori stepped down from the position following the 2011 World Cup.

“It put some pressure on my friendship and relationship with Ross. I have a lot of development and under-age cricket with Ross. I was the captain of the U-19 team and Taylor was my vice-captain. We’ve always got on really well,” McCullum said in a Sky Sports Podcast.

However, after a 1-1 draw in a Test series in Sri Lanka in 2012, it emerged that Taylor had issues with then coach Mike Hesson. That followed series defeats in South Africa, the West Indies and India.

“We had to go for an interview for the job. It was about presenting the map for the future of New Zealand cricket to a panel. I don’t really know what we were doing.

“If I had my time, I would’ve said ‘No I’m not going to come and go through the process, you appoint Ross as captain and then we’ll see what unfolds from there.’

“It’s a bad stain for New Zealand cricket and put pressure on Ross and me. Then it led me to eventually take over the captaincy from Ross,” said McCullum.

McCullum said that he and Taylor are still not the best of friends but he has a lot of respect for New Zealand’s all-time highest ODI run-scorer.

“We are not best friends. I have an immense amount of respect for him. He has a lovely family and a great career. He is at peace and content in his personal life. He has done really really well,” said McCullum.

Taylor was given the option of remaining the Test captain with McCullum leading the limited overs sides but he declined.

“I was asked if I wanted to take over the role of New Zealand captain in all three formats. So initially, I told them I would get back to them. I needed to think long and hard thought it.

“I knew it would be a major controversial decision. I knew it could have major ramifications on NZ Cricket, and also on my time as a player,” he said.

“I sat down with my wife, and said ‘you are the best equipped to do it if it doesn’t work out, it doesn’t work out, but you’re the best equipped to do it’. So I gave them a call and said I would do it,” he added.

McCullum eventually took over in all formats in December 2012 and stayed in the role until his retirement in 2016.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/my-fallout-with-taylor-is-bad-stain-on-nz-cricket--mccullum.html
132,23-3-20,Virat is best batsman in world: Chanderpaul,"Former West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul has said India captain Virat Kohli is the best batsman in the world at the moment and also his favourite.

Chanderpaul was in India a few days back for the Road Safety World Series 2020, but it was postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak. “Obviously, it’s Virat Kohli. He has been working on all the aspects of his game, and the results are showing. He is working hard on his fitness; he works on his skills. You see him putting in the hard work, and he is one of those guys who always wants to do well. He’s proven it, day in and day out. You have to give credit to him for that.

Yet again, it all depends on how well you perform on that day because, in the T20 format, anybody could win on that day. We always have a lot of match-winners, that’s the good thing about us.”

“With the power hitters, good bowlers they play a major part in the shorter format. So, we still have one of the best T20 squads around. But we still have to go out and play well to win matches. Don’t take anyone lightly, play as hard as we can, and we will win,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/virat-is-best-batsman-in-world--chanderpaul.html
133,23-3-20,All efforts will go waste if Olympics is cancelled: Mirabai,"A wary Mirabai Chanu has only one prayer on her lips that the Tokyo Olympics goes as per schedule despite COVID-19 pandemic otherwise all her efforts of winning an Olympic medal will go down the drain.

For the last four years, Mirabai has laboured for a successful Olympic outing but all she can think right now is about the fate of the July 24 to August 9 Tokyo Games, which could be postponed.

“If the Olympics doesn’t happen all our efforts for the last four years will all go to waste. I don’t want it to cancel, I am praying to god every day. I just wanted a get an Olympic medal for myself,” Mirabai said.

Calls for postponing the Tokyo Games till the virus is contained is also increasing with several athletes lashing out at the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) advice to continue training at a time when governments across the globe are calling for social-distancing.

However, the two-time Commonwealth Games Gold-medalist, who has already sealed an Olympic quota, wants the quadrennial event to go as planned.

“The pressure (of winning a medal) has changed to the Olympics should not be cancelled. That’s all I’m thinking. The rest, training, etc I am not tensed about right now.

“Even if it’s postponed there will be a lot of problem because a lot can change in a short period of time for us,” she added.

Weightlifting’s Olympic qualifying schedule has also gone haywire. The International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) had to cancel five continental championships, including the Asia event.

The Asian Weightlifting Championships which had been relocated from Kazakhstan to Tashkent in Uzbekistan was the last tournament before the Olympics for Mirabai. She had missed out on a Bronze medal by a whisker here last year.

The Manipuri, who has consistently bettered her personal best, had aimed to improve her total effort of 203kg (88kg+115kg).

He said a media bulletin issued earlier on Monday by the state government put the number of cases at 30.

Rajender said it has come to the notice of government that some foreign returnees, who are supposed to be in quarantine at homes, were moving out of them.

Government would definitely take action against those who did not follow government guidelines, he said.

Such persons would be located with the help of cell phone tower locations, he said.

He appealed to the people to complain if any foreign returnees in their apartments, localities or villages did not follow the government guidelines.

The Health Minister appealed to the people to ensure strict compliance with the lockdown directives for effective containment of the virus.",top-stories,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/number-of-covid-19-cases-in-t-gana-rises-to-33-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/top-stories/number-of-covid-19-cases-in-t-gana-rises-to-33.html

154,23-3-20,"Exercise to update NPR, census likely to be put off","The exercise to update the National Population Register (NPR) and the first phase of the Census 2021, scheduled to begin from April 1, are likely to be deferred for an indefinite period due to coronavirus pandemic.

While a formal order on this effect is expected within a day or two from the Home Ministry, discussions are going on at the highest level of the Government and in all probability, the NPR and house listing phase of the census work will be deferred till the threat of the coronavirus is over. The Union Cabinet has approved Rs 3,941.35 crore for the NPR exercise.

The exercise to update NPR and the housing listing phase of the census is scheduled to be carried out across the country from April 1 to September 30. Last week, the Home Ministry had said the preparation for the census 2021 and updation of the NPR was at its peak.

The Ministry said this after a conference of the Directors of the Census Operations on status of preparatory work around Census 2021 and NPR updation. There has been opposition from several State Governments to the NPR and some of the Assemblies even adopted resolutions expressing reservations on the exercise.

The States which have been opposing the NPR include Kerala, West Bengal, Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Bihar. However, most of them also said they will cooperate with the house listing phase of the Census. The objective of the NPR is to create a comprehensive identity database of every usual resident in the country. The database would contain demographic as well as biometric particulars, they said.

The notification for the house listing census and NPR exercise came recently amid furore over the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The home ministry officials said most of the states have notified provisions related to the NPR.

The NPR is a register of usual residents of the country. It is being prepared at the local (village/sub-town), sub-district, district, state and national levels under provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955 and the Citizenship (Registration of Citizens and Issue of National Identity Cards) Rules, 2003.

The data for NPR was last collected in 2010 along with the house listing phase of the Census 2011. Updating of this data was done during 2015 by conducting door to door survey. While updating the register in 2015, the government has asked details like Aadhaar and their mobile number.

This time, the information related to their driving licence and voter ID card may also be gathered, the officials said, adding that PAN card details will not be collected as part of this exercise. Though information regarding the place of birth of parents will be sought, it is up to the residents whether to respond the question as it is voluntary.

For the purposes of the NPR, a ‘resident’ is defined as a person who has lived in a local area for the past six months or more, or a person who intends to reside in that area for the next six months. The law compulsorily seeks to register every citizen of India and issue a national identity card.

The demographic details of every individual are required for every usual resident: name, relationship to head of household, father’s name, mother’s name, spouse’s name (if married), sex, date of birth, marital status, place of birth, nationality (as declared), present address of usual residence, duration of stay at present address, permanent residential address, occupation, educational qualification.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/exercise-to-update-npr--census-likely-to-be-put-off.html
155,23-3-20,Asia ramps up efforts after 2nd wave of infections,"From Australia’s Bondi Beach to the streets of New Delhi, authorities across Asia ramped up efforts this weekend to stem the coronavirus amid fears of a second wave of infections in places where outbreaks had appeared under control.

Tighter travel restrictions were imposed in several countries while Malaysia deployed its army to enforce a lockdown as the number of cases in the region soared past 95,000 — a third of the world’s infections, an AFP tally shows.

Outside China — where the virus was first detected in December and infected more than 80,000 people — South Korea is the hardest-hit country in Asia with over 8,500 cases. While the number of infections in China has been falling for weeks, other countries are seeing the toll gather pace as the highly contagious virus takes hold.

Cases rose by roughly a third in Thailand overnight to nearly 600, fueling scepticism about claims in neighbouring Myanmar and Laos of zero infections. Three doctors treating virus patients in Indonesia died, taking the country’s death toll to 48 with 514 confirmed infections. Most cases are in the capital of Jakarta where businesses have been ordered to close for two weeks.

After shutting its borders to foreigners and non-residents, Australia has told citizens to cancel their domestic travel plans too as the number of cases topped 1,300.

Bondi Beach and several other popular swimming spots were shut to the public after crowds of sunbathers defied a ban on large outdoor gatherings.

Pubs, casinos, cinemas and places of worship will be shuttered for up to six months from Monday. Pakistan suspended international flights in a desperate bid to prevent the virus spreading in a country. Officials in Sindh — the country’s second-most populous province — ordered a provincial lockdown effective midnight.

Pakistan has reported 5,650 suspected cases, 646 confirmed infections, and four deaths from the virus.

156,23-3-20,6 Indians stuck at Dubai airport for 4 days,"Six Indian nationals were stranded at the Dubai aiport for the past four days after they werent allowed to board their connecting flight to their home country over coronavirus fears, it was reported.

The men flew into Dubai from various European countries on March 18. They were supposed to take an Emirates flight to New Delhi later that evening, reports Gulf news.

However, they couldn't get onto the plane as the same day India imposed a ban on all passengers arriving from Europe.

Since then, the men have been stranded at Terminal 3 of the Dubai Airport.

""We don't know what to do. We have been sleeping on airport benches for three nights now. I don't know how long this stalemate will continue. Initially there were seven of us but one of the passengers flew back to France on Sunday as he was tired of waiting,"" said Deepak Gupta from Delhi who flew in from Bupadest on March 18.

Another passenger, Ajmer Singh from Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, said he's on the edge of a nervous breakdown.

""Our situation is really bad and it doesn't look like improving any time soon. Our families are worried about us. I am desperate to go home,"" he told Gulf news.

The passengers said they have contacted the Indian Consultate in Dubai for help several times but haven't heard back from them.

Neeraj Agrawal, head of chancery and consul (Press, Information and Culture) at the Indian Consulate in Dubai told Gulf News they were trying to resolve the issue.

""We are aware of the case. Unfortunately, given the current scenario, there is only so much that we can do at this stage. The airport hotels are full so we can't accommodate them there. We can't fly them to India either. That said, we are in regular touch with the airlines and local authorities to relieve the plight of stranded men,"" said Agarwal.

157,23-3-20,Snacking on almonds may help suppress between-meal hunger: Study,"Snacking on almonds may lower the hunger drive between the meals as compared to consuming savoury crackers with equivalent energy, according to a study.

The research, published in the journal Nutrients, provides new evidence to support the impact of almonds on satiety.

Choosing foods that enhance satiety -- those that help sustain feelings of fullness -- can be helpful in weight management, noted the researchers from the University of Leeds in the UK.

They found snacking on almonds also led to suppressed unconscious desire to consume other high-fat foods, which could be useful in a weight management strategy.

The study did not see a difference in the total day-long calorie intake with the almond snack but did see a reduction in calories consumed during the lunch meal eaten two hours after the snack.

The research also found that the satiety quotient -- measure of the satiating capacity of foods relative to energy content -- was stronger immediately after eating the almonds than crackers, and participants perceived the almonds to be a healthier snack.

""The findings show that almonds suppressed between-meal hunger, but also reduced the reward value of other high energy foods,"" said lead researcher of the study Professor Graham Finlayson, from the University of Leeds.

""This makes it less likely that they would be tempted to eat these foods when faced with them outside of the controlled laboratory situation,"" Finlayson said.

He noted that consumers associate almonds with successful weight management which could help keep them on track with their intentions to eat a healthy diet.

The research examined the effect of consuming almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to an energy and weight-matched comparator snack (savoury crackers) or the equivalent weight of water.

In the study, 42 female participants aged between 26 and 34 years ate a fixed breakfast and then a mid-morning snack. The researchers assessed appetite sensations, energy intake, food hedonics (liking) and consumer perceptions.

The study found that people who snacked on almonds as a mid-morning snack reported a lower overall hunger drive compared to crackers with equal calories or water.

There was no difference in 24-hour energy intake in the almond group compared to the cracker or the zero-energy control condition, the researchers said.

However, the study did see a reduction in calories consumed during the lunch meal eaten 2 hours after the almond snack, they said.

According to the study, almonds suppressed hedonic preference or implicit wanting to consume other high-fat foods and demonstrated a higher satiety quotient (SQ) than crackers.

Almonds were perceived to be a healthier snack food, which aligns with successful weight management, the researchers said.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/snacking-on-almonds-may-help-suppress-between-meal-hunger--study-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/snacking-on-almonds-may-help-suppress-between-meal-hunger--study.html

Weinstein has been kept in medical isolation at the Wende Correctional Facility, reports aceshowbiz.com.

A source told Press-Republican newspaper that the producer is sick in prison, but officials at the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision are yet to confirm the story. They have just revealed that two inmates at the Wende facility have tested positive for COVID-19.

Meanwhile, Weinstein celebrated his 68th birthday behind bars on March 19 after he was transported to the maximum-security prison, following a few days at New York's Bellevue Hospital and also spending some time at the medical unit at Rikers Island prison, New York. He had complained of heart issues.

159,23-3-20,'Little upset with China' over coronavirus: Trump,"US President Donald Trump has said he is ""upset"" with China over its late sharing of information on coronavirus.

""They should have told us about this,"" Trump told reporters at a press conference in the White House on Sunday.

""I'm a little upset with China. I'll be honest with you, because as much as I like (Chinese) President Xi (Jinping) and as much as I respect and admire the country,"" he said.

Trump said soon after he received information about the spread of the deadly viral infection in China, he wanted to send US medical team there. However, China did not allow.

Without specifying any timeline, Trump said he had spoken to President Xi ""specifically"" about sending US team to China, however, ""he doesn't want this... This is not something that he wants"".

The US president said it is ""out of pride"" that China didn't ""want us to send people"" and ""they didn't really respond"".

Reiterating that America's relationship with China is ""very good"", Trump said, ""I wish they (had) told us three months sooner that this was a problem. We didn't know about it. They knew about it and they should (have) told us. We could have saved a lot of lives throughout the world.""

Meanwhile, the US and Chinese officials continued with their war of words over coronavirus on Twitter.

""Since early January, the CCP has retaliated against its citizens and journalists in China for making information public, launched disinformation campaigns around the world, and limited the international community's access to valuable public health information,"" the National Security Council of the White House tweeted.

On March 20, Morgan Ortagus, spokesperson of the US State Department, tweeted, ""By Jan. 3, Chinese authorities had already ordered #COVID19 virus samples destroyed, silenced Wuhan doctors, and censored public concerns online. @SpokespersonCHN is right: This is a timeline the world must absolutely scrutinize.""

Responding to the tweet, Hua Chunying, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said China has been updating the US on coronavirus and its response since January 3. On January 15, the US State Department notified Americans in China about the US Centre for Disease Control's warning against the coronavirus. ""And now blame China for Delay? Seriously,"" she said.

China, Hua tweeted, has treated COVID 19 as highly pathogenic virus according to the law on prevention and treatment of infectious diseases.

""As WHO stated, China identified the pathogen in a record short time and shared genetic sequence with the world, which helped others with epidemic response,"" she said.

However, Ortagus denied her remarks.

""Nonsense. You call it 'highly pathogenic' now, but last month your officials blocked a WHO report from calling COVID19 a 'dangerous pathogen',"" she said, tagging a link of a 'Financial Times' article on the topic to buttress her argument.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/-little-upset-with-china--over-coronavirus--trump-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/-little-upset-with-china--over-coronavirus--trump.html

163,23-3-20,75 districts under lockdown,"As COVID-19 cases mount to 396, trains, Metros shut across India

After the success of the janata curfew on Sunday, the Government has decided to suspend all inter-State buses, passenger trains and Metro services across the country till March 31. At the same time, authorities have decided to completely lockdown 75 districts except essential services where coronavirus cases were reported as several States announced extraordinary measures to check the spread of the disease which has left 396 infected and seven dead.

The three casualties reported on Sunday were from Bihar, Gujarat and Maharashtra. A 38-year-old man with a kidney ailment and recent travel history to Qatar died at AIIMS-Patna and a 67-year-old man died at a hospital in Surat in Gujarat, state officials said. The Union Health Ministry was yet to confirm the deaths were caused by coronavirus. Another death was reported from Mumbai of a 63-year-old man.

Even before the Government order, several States like Punjab, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra went for complete lockdown with an aim to break the chain of COVID-19 transmission.

The Union Health Ministry has asked the States to earmark a certain number of hospitals to exclusively treat COVID-19 patients. The Railway Ministry has urged the people to “postpone all journeys”, a day after three incidents involving 12 people were reported as they were found to be travelling on trains despite being instructed to go for quarantine. All of them tested positive.

Soon after the Centre and State Governments following a meeting led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to completely lock down 75 districts across the country where coronavirus cases have been reported, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director Balram Bhargava told reporters here that a lockdown was the most essential aspect to the break the chain of transmission as of now.

“Each State has pledged that they will earmark hospitals exclusively to treat COVID-19 patients,” Bhargava said. “For example, in Delhi, AIIMS’ division of National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Jhajjar (Haryana) — which has around 800 beds — would be used only to treat COVID-19 patients,” he said.

Bhargava stated that 60 private labs had registered so far to conduct coronavirus tests. He said India is capable of conducting 10,000 coronavirus tests a day and conducted 5,000 tests last week. Speaking to the media, Bhargava said the testing capacity could be increased above 10,000, if needed.

“It’s important that indiscriminate testing is not done. Those returning from abroad should go for isolation,” he said.

In view of no let up in the Covid-19 cases, the Government gave an order to procure 1,200 new ventilators, said Health Ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal. He talked about the steps taken to contain the virus that has claimed over 13,000 lives worldwide. The decisions were taken at a high-level meeting of chief secretaries of all States and the Cabinet Secretary and the Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, officials said on Sunday.

In the meeting, it was decided to suspend all train services till March 31, including suburban rail services. However, goods trains are exempted. All metro rail services were also suspended till March 31, the officials said. Subsequently, the railways announced suspension of all its 13,523 passenger trains from March 22 midnight to March 31 midnight and said only goods trains will run during the said period. The suspensions also include all suburban train services.

The railways had already trimmed down its services on Friday by cancelling a majority of trains. However, it had allowed all trains that had already started the journey to continue. “No train except goods trains will run till 2400 hrs of March 31. However, a bare minimum of suburban services and the Kolkata Metro Rail service will continue to run till 2400 hours of March 22. Thereafter, these services will also be stopped till 2400 hours of March 31,” a spokesperson of the Indian Railways said.

The trains that had already commenced their journey prior to 4 am on March 22 will run up to their respective destinations, the railways said, adding that adequate arrangements would be made for the passengers during the travel and at their destinations. “To ensure the essential supplies in various parts of the country, movement of goods trains will continue,” the Railway Ministry said in a statement.

The State Governments have also been asked to allow only essential services to operate in districts with confirmed COVID-19 cases. The focus should be on closure of all activities except essential services such as hospitals, telecom, medicine shops, provision stores etc. “Establishments/factories engaged in manufacturing and distribution of essential commodities like medicines, vaccines, sanitizers, masks, medical devices, their ancillaries and support services etc., should be exempt from these restrictions,” the Government advisory said.

164,23-3-20,India stops in its tracks to fight Coronavirus,"Residents express gratitude to service providers as asked by PM Modi

Call it resolve of the nation or fear of the unknown, India on Sunday exhibited a remarkable show of unity to enforce the “janata curfew’ in the fight against the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. The country’s streets and highways, markets and plazas, railways stations and bus stands wore a deserted look and an eerie silence engulfed the nation, broken only by a medley of sounds in the evening as people rang bells, blew conches and clapped to express appreciation for medical and other staff who are on the frontline of the battle against the scourge.

From children to the elderly, common people to VIPs, all came out in balconies, lawns and terrace of their homes as the clock struck five, following an appeal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to show gratitude to doctors, paramedics, police and other personnel associated with essential services when the country was observing an unprecedented “janta curfew” on Sunday to check the spread of the virus.

Modi thanked the people for the gesture. Taking to Twitter, he said it is an expression of gratitude by the people and also the sound of the bugle declaring the first success in the long battle ahead.

“With this resolve and patience, let’s restrict (social distancing) ourselves as part of this long battle,” Modi tweeted in Hindi with the hashtag “jantacurfew”. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath rang a bell while his Haryana counterpart Manohar Lal Khattar along with the staff and security personnel deployed at his residence were beating ‘thalis’.

The 14-hour “janata curfew” got underway at 7 am , signaling a determined push by the Modi Government to involve people in a massive exercise to enforce the social distancing theme to take on the invisible enemy. All markets and establishments except those dealing in essential goods and services are closed for the day.

In the national capital, roads were deserted with barely some private vehicles and buses plying. Vendors were off the roads in the morning hours with people confining themselves to their homes.

Ahead of the start of the curfew, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “In a few minutes from now, the #JantaCurfew commences. Let us all be a part of this curfew, which will add tremendous strength to the fight against COVID-19 menace”.

He said the steps to be taken now will help in the times to come.”Stay indoors and stay healthy,” he said on Twitter.

The Railway minjistry had already announce to take the traisn off ythe tyrack while most states had also enforced complete ban on movement of buses and public transports. Asa result roads were deserted barring stray vehicles.

Call it fear of the unknown or resolve of a naion to defeat the deadly scourage, the nation exhibited an unprecedented dhow of unity in enforcing the “curfew”. There will few occasion in the history of post-independence India, when the country witnessed such an unprecedented shutdown were people and the government were equally involved.

In Kolkata, the usually bustling Esplanade, and Dalhousie areas, besides airport and railway stations wore a deserted look as people stayed indoors to support the prime minister’s call.The Eastern and South Eastern Railway cancelled all mail/express trains originating from the two zones between 4 am and 10 pm on Sunday but will run skeletal local train services on the day.

Commercial capital Mumbai observed the restrictions on Sunday with the usually bustling western and eastern express highways and other arterial roads wearing an empty look and people staying indoors to support the curfew.

In Madhya Pradesh where four districts of Jabalpur, Rewa, Seoni and Narsinghpur have been placed under lockdown, roadside shops and eateries remained closed in the state on Sunday.

The ‘Janata curfew’ call received a good response in Gujarat as the entire state was in a self-imposed lockdown to fight the coronavirus. Streets were empty and shops and business establishments remained shut in the state. Roads, railway stations and airports in the state’s four major cities - Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot -wore a deserted look on Sunday morning.

Tourist destination Goa followed the curfew call with streets and beaches off the road. Except for essential services, everything else including bus services, commercial establishments, restaurants, markets and places of worship were shut and people remained home.

Cutting across party lines, chief ministers and others leaders have urged the people to follow the self-imposed curfew, noting that “social distancing” was key to breaking the chain of transmission, as the number of coronavirus cases rose to 324 on Sunday.

States like Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan and Bihar have announced either complete or partial lockdown till the month end.

PM Narendra Modi had on Thursday called for the ‘Janata curfew’ from 7 am to 9 pm on March 22, saying no citizen, barring those in essential services, should get out of their houses, and asserted that it will be a litmus test to show India’s readiness to take on the coronavirus challenge.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/india-stops-in-its-tracks-to-fight-china-virus-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/india-stops-in-its-tracks-to-fight-coronavirus.html
165,23-3-20,"Lockdown not enough, focus on detecting infected: WHO","A World Health Organisation’s top emergency expert on Sunday said “lockdown” measure initiated by several countries were not enough to prevent the spread of coronavirus and focus should be on detecting the infected people.

“What we really need to focus on is finding those who are sick, those who have the virus, and isolate them, find their contacts and isolate them,” Dr Mike Ryan said in an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

“The danger right now with the lockdowns ... if we don’t put in place the strong public health measures now, when those movement restrictions and lockdowns are lifted, the danger is the disease will jump back up.”

Much of Europe and the United States have followed China and other Asian countries and introduced drastic restrictions to fight the new coronavirus, with most workers told to work from home and schools, bars, pubs and restaurants being closed. India too on Sunday asked the States to allow only essential services to operate in districts with confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Ryan said that the examples of China, Singapore and South Korea, which coupled restrictions with rigorous measures to test every possible suspect, provided a model for Europe, which the WHO has said has replaced Asia as the epicentre of the pandemic.

“Once we’ve suppressed the transmission, we have to go after the virus. We have to take the fight to the virus,” Mr Ryan said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/lockdown-not-enough--focus-on-detecting-infected--who.html

Jason Reitman's father, Ivan Reitman, had directed the original ""Ghostbusters"" films which featured Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as parapsychology professors who hunts ghosts.

175,23-3-20,Merkel quarantined ahead of measures to stiffen German economy,"Chancellor Angela Merkel was on Sunday in quarantine after meeting a doctor who tested positive for the novel coronavirus, as Germany further tightens rules on public gatherings and plots a taboo-breaking package of support for Europe's top economy.

News of Merkel's potential exposure to the virus came minutes after she announced a ban on public gatherings of more than two people and further infection control measures.

""The Chancellor has decided to quarantine herself immediately at home. She will be tested regularly in the coming days... (and) fulfil her official business from home,"" spokesman Steffen Seibert said in a statement.

Merkel had been slated to lead a cabinet meeting Monday to sign off on a 822-billion-euro ($882 billion) slew of measures to support Europe's top economy through the shutdowns of public life designed to slow the infection's spread.

The infected doctor visited Merkel on Friday to vaccinate her against the pneumococcus bacteria.

It could take some days to determine whether the 65-year-old chancellor is herself infected as ""a test would not yet be fully conclusive,"" Seibert said.

Merkel showed no apparent symptoms of ill health in Sunday's televised press conference.

During her 15-year term in office the chancellor has largely enjoyed robust health, although she suffered repeated shaking spells in public appearances during a summer 2019 heatwave that were never fully explained.

In response to the tremors, she chose to sit on a chair when receiving guests with military honours outside the chancellor's office in Berlin. Previously the veteran leader broke her pelvis in a cross-country skiing accident in 2014.

It was not immediately clear whether Merkel will isolate herself in a rarely-used official residence in the top floor of the chancellery building or at her personal flat in Berlin's museum district.

Wearing one of her trademark block-colour blazers, she had been seen doing her own shopping at a local supermarket late Saturday, buying items including wine and toilet paper.

If conservative leader Merkel were incapacitated, her role would be filled by vice-chancellor and finance minister Olaf Scholz of her junior coalition partners, the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).

Scholz last week isolated himself at home with a heavy cold, but tweeted a day later that he had tested negative for the coronavirus.

Earlier Sunday, Merkel had announced still-tighter restrictions on public gatherings after a telephone conference with regional leaders that aimed to get Germany's 16 federal states into a common policy.

The closure of schools and non-essential shops had already been announced.

Businesses like massage studios and hairdressers where people come into close contact will also be shut.

And restaurants will be closed across Germany except for takeaway food.

The measures slated to last initially for two weeks, will be imposed by individual states, which will decide when to roll them out.

Merkel appealed to citizens' ""reason and empathy"" in implementing the contact restrictions, saying she had been ""very moved"" by how closely people had stuck to less stringent measures implemented in recent days.

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany's disease control authority, said early Sunday the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had grown by almost 2,000 in the previous 24 hours, to 18,610.

So far 55 Germans have died of the disease.

Germany's all-out support to the economy on the cabinet agenda Monday includes hundreds of billions of euros in potential support for companies and workers.

Much of it will come in the form of state guarantees for bank loans to business and easier access to short-time working and unemployment benefits.

But Berlin also plans to blow through a constitutional rule that limits the size of the federal budget deficit in any one year, with around 156 billion euros in new borrowing.

Ending the crisis ""comes first"", Merkel has said, adding ""we will see at the end of that where our budget stands"".",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/merkel-quarantined-ahead-of-measures-to-stiffen-german-economy-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/merkel-quarantined-ahead-of-measures-to-stiffen-german-economy.html

The device costs Rs 13,999 for the base variant, which 4GB RAM and 128GB memory. The top variant of the phone, which features 6GB RAM and 128GB storage space is priced at Rs 16,999.

Here is what we think about the smartphone after using it for a week.

In terms of design, the device scores decent marks. It packs a 6.59-inch full-HD (1080x2340 pixels) display with a notchless full-screen design.

The display is sharp and is good enough for gaming and content streaming. Moreover, it is bright enough even in harsh sunlight.

It looks fresh from the front thanks to its pop-up camera. The rear panel is made out of plastic and has a glossy finish, like most of the mid-price segment smartphones.

The three camera lenses are housed in a vertical strip, the USB Type-C port, speaker, and 3.5mm jack are at the bottom, while the SIM tray is at the top.

Coming to the cameras, the device has a triple camera setup with 48MP main camera with f/1.8 aperture and a large 1/2-inch CMOS sensor.

There is a secondary 8MP super wide angle camera with f/2.4 aperture and a 120 degree ultra-wide-angle lens, and a third 2-megapixel depth camera with f/2.4 aperture.

The camera performed really well in presence of proper light, while it struggled a bit in absence of decent amount of light.

Camera features include AIS Super Night Mode, AI Video Stabilisation, and more.

Photos captured using the night mode exhibited better details and colours were brought out more. The contrast and the dynamic range are above average.

The phone also has a 16MP front camera with f/2.2 aperture inside the pop-up selfie module.

The front camera is decent enough to produce good selfies to post them on Instagram.

In terms of performance, the smartphone comes with a new Kirin 710F SoC.

The phone is available in two variants, with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

The general performance of the phone is decent. Browsing social media, watching movies, clicking photographs, and messaging are all smooth.

During the review, we also played two popular heavy titles like PUBG and Call of Duty without any issue at Medium graphics settings.

On the software side, the Honor 9X runs EMUI 9.1 based on Android Pie.

The smartphone comes equipped with a sufficiently long-lasting 4,000mAh battery.

On regular usage, with social media usage and a couple of hours of music streaming the device lasted for around two days on an average.

Conclusion: Honor is trying its best to make a long-lasting mark in this price segment and with this smartphone, the manufacturer has once again pushed itself to attain a solid footprint.

At the given price point, Honor 9X is a good bet for those who are looking forward to buy a phone with pop-up camera.",technology,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/honor-9x--sturdy-mid-range-smartphone-with-an--x--factor-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/technology/honor-9x--sturdy-mid-range-smartphone-with-an--x--factor.html

200,23-3-20,Major suppliers say shortage of ventilators due to worldwide demand amid coronavirus outbreak,"Some of the major suppliers in the country have said that they have acute shortage of ventilators stock in view of the increasing demand worldwide amid the coronavirus outbreak.

Officials sources said the views were communicated at a recent review meeting held by Union Health ministry with around six to seven major international and national suppliers to assess their supply position, manufacturing capacity as well as the feasibility of importing ventilators.

""The meeting was held to assess the availability of ventilators in the country, including the local manufacturing capacity as well as supply through import.

""The companies stated acute shortage of stocks at hand, citing they had sent ventilators to other countries due to increasing demand among coronavirus-affected patients. Some quoted very few stocks in hand and have sought some time to supply the machines,"" a source said.

Some Indian companies also said the ban on the entry of commercial airlines in India would lead to paucity of components required to assemble ventilators.

Meanwhile, the Union Health ministry officials on Sunday said an order to procure 1,200 new ventilators has been placed and depending on the number cases, the number of isolation beds and ventilators will be ramped up across hospitals in the country.

According to sources there is an estimated 30,000 ventilators in India with every state having a varying number.

As the number of coronavirus cases soared to over 400, the Union Health ministry has asked hospitals and medical education institutes to procure sufficient number of ventilators and high flow oxygen masks to be prepared for any possible influx of patients.

""Hospitals must procure sufficient numbers of ventilators and high flow oxygen masks in preparation for future requirements.

""All hospitals must ensure that they have adequate trained manpower and resource pools for ventilator/ ICU care,"" an advisory issued by the ministry last week stated.

Health ministry officials said only five per cent of the total affected patients require critical care as they go on respiratory failure and need to put on ventilators while rest recover with supportive treatment.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/major-suppliers-say-shortage-of-ventilators-due-to-worldwide-demand-amid-coronavirus-outbreak-2020-03-23.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/major-suppliers-say-shortage-of-ventilators-due-to-worldwide-demand-amid-coronavirus-outbreak.html
