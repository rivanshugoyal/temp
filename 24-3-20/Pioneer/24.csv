0,24-3-20,No more shifting goalposts,"As Coronavirus attacks the manufacturing sector, the Govt’s farm policy will have to be more consistent to help kickstart the economy

In spite of the best efforts of the Government since 2014, manufacturing growth has not picked up in the country. It is not likely to do so in the near future, too, due to the global economic meltdown brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this scenario, agriculture is expected to remain the main source of livelihood for over 50 per cent of the Indian population in the foreseeable future. Therefore, a vibrant agricultural sector is vital for India’s employment and growth story. However, the Narendra Modi Government has not witnessed any significant recovery in the farm sector despite the fact that the Centre came out with numerous schemes aimed at it since 2014. Given the multiplicity of schemes and fund constraints, priorities shift from year to year and new schemes invariably garner more funds, while old schemes flounder. Also, there is a very obvious lack of research on the ground before suggesting and approving a scheme for implementation. Take for instance the river interlinking scheme which cost $87 billion at the time of the launch. Once interlinking of 60 of India’s largest rivers is completed, it is expected to help end farmers’ dependence on rainfall, bring millions of hectares of cultivable land under irrigation and help generate thousands of megawatts of electricity. Even though water is listed as entry 17 in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the NDA initiated work for linking the Betwa and Ken rivers which pass through Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh quickly. The work is nearly complete but there is no word on when it would be operational. In fact, no substantial fund is being allocated to start work on linking other rivers. Of course, linking of the Godavari and Cauvery figures in the report of the Task Force of the Department of Economic Affairs under National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) projects but there is no mention of linking of other rivers, like the mighty Brahmaputra, in the NIP’s vision document.

Doubling the Farmers’ Income (DFI) is another scheme that was launched by the Centre and in the Union Budget, the Finance Minister announced a 16-point action plan for this. It included measures to provide growers access to distant markets through trains (Kisan Rail) and flights (Krishi Udaan). Here, too, the plan did not take into account the abundance of farmers with small and medium-sized holdings, whose only worry is to get a remunerative price for the produce in the nearby market and not be exploited by traders. The DFI committee has made multiple recommendations for achieving its goal by 2022 but most of these instructions are the outcome of a top-down approach at the Union Government level, even though much of these policy decisions need to be implemented by State Governments. Moreover, only some of these recommendations pertain to particular States and these are to be identified after examination at the ground level, which was not undertaken in the committee’s deliberations. Finally, even though committee reports provide estimates of the investment required for DFI, no attempt has been made to sequence the fund needs. After all, given the monetary constraints for investment and time limitation, the top priority should have been to identify the most binding constraints for DFI State-wise and allocate funds accordingly. Given the fund limitation, even the Union Government has only been able to undertake a few of these recommendations. In fact, the largest chunk, Rs 75,000 crore, of the farm budget for 2020-21 went to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan), another newly-launched scheme for providing cash support to farmers.

Last year, the Union Government launched Jal Jeevan Mission under which all rural households are expected to have piped water supply by 2024. No doubt, it is an excellent scheme given that the rural population suffers significantly from water/vector-borne diseases. However, given the water stress in India, it is not clear where the supply would come from. As one recalls, the NITI Aayog’s recently-released report argues that India is not only facing the worst water crisis in history, this will aggravate over time. By 2030, the country’s water demand is projected to be twice the available supply, implying severe water scarcity for hundreds of millions of people and an eventual over six per cent loss in the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Moreover, the States which would be hit the hardest by the water crisis contribute to nearly 20-30 per cent of our agricultural output. Ideally, in view of the impending water crisis, the Government should have provided more incentives to those who cultivate less water-incentive crops in water-deficient States. However, no such steps have been taken though the DFI committee has advocated them. Since growers overuse water due to the absence of water meters and free power to the farm sector, there are only two ways to tackle this water crisis. In the short-run, provide more incentives for cultivating less water-incentive crops and in the long-run, large investment should be undertaken to expand “per drop, more crop” schemes with increased use of technology. The Government must realise that it is best to stick to a few schemes over a period to reap their benefits. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely that the economy will pass through a recession. Since agriculture is a vital source of livelihood, it is the responsibility of the Government to increase farm incomes as this would raise demand and help kickstart the economy.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/no-more-shifting-goalposts.html
1,24-3-20,The first line of defence in a pandemic,"Despite potential hazards, healthcare professionals always maintain a state of calm and readiness for performing emergency tasks during outbreaks without being concerned for their own safety or well-being

At a time when the COVID-19 outbreak has forced most people around the world to hunker down and go into self-isolation, distancing themselves from everyone socially and professionally, there are people who are putting themselves at risk and who are pulling out all stops to fight the pandemic and stall its deathly march across the globe. These soldiers in the war against Coronavirus are the doctors, nurses, paramedics and other healthcare workers who are putting their own lives at risk and fulfilling their duty and moral obligation like true professionals. Acknowledgement of the selfless service that the medical community is providing to people around the world and in India by world leaders and citizens alike, helps to bolster their confidence and motivates them to work with greater zeal.

It was heart-warming to hear all the clapping and ringing of bells and beating of drums and thalis by people across the country on March 22 at the behest of the Prime Minister to acknowledge the yeoman’s service being provided by the media, police, doctors, nurses, other healthcare workers, and so on.

In times like this, when social distancing is becoming imperative, the role of doctors has again come to the fore and it is vital that doctors remain closer than ever before to their patients. Their professional commitment demands that doctors remain at the beck and call of patients.

So, what defines a doctor in these situations? No doubt it is a mix of skills such as leadership, managing uncertainty, problem-solving, risk-taking, professional judgment and a grasp of clinical situations based on a deep understanding of the area of practice. Most importantly, their much-required confidence and assurance of survival to the patients is the most important element.

During the last few decades, we have witnessed many disease outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), H1N1 flu virus (Swine Flu) and Nipah virus among others. All these required quick responses from healthcare providers and the whole world have seen how Indian doctors have proved their professionalism, be it on the ground in India or playing a critical role abroad. Our Government places huge faith in its healthcare professionals and keeps sending medical teams abroad as well. Doctors are among the first to observe patients suffering from the attack of a deadly disease, especially as initial signs and symptoms may be subtle or mimic common disorders, prompting victims to contact their primary care physicians.

In its initial stages, a contagion like COVID-19 may not be obvious as healthcare systems sometimes are not fool proof enough due to their limitations and may not always detect suspicious patterns. In the majority of cases, early symptoms are vague and readily mistaken for more common upper respiratory infections such as influenza and staphylococcal enterotoxin B or viral gastroenteritis, which take a heavy toll on a nation’s health.

Depending on the agent and its mode of transmission, the population density and access to healthcare, it can be days or even weeks before anyone can recognise the problem. As early response may be crucial in containing the problem and minimising resultant morbidity and mortality, doctors play a vital role in recording data and developing the response system for later reference. The doctors, therefore, are first to become aware of a problem and are pivotal in initiating and guiding the public health response. It is they, who have to remain vigilant about general trends and patient flow in their clinics and communicate the same to the health authorities to formulate the right strategy at the national level.

In an emergency situation doctors are required to go beyond their routine responsibilities. They have to carry out exhaustive jobs in a stressful environment as witnessed in China, Italy and France which are now the epicentres of disease spread. Despite the potential hazards, healthcare professionals always maintain a state of calm and readiness for fulfilling the planned emergency tasks in these situations without being concerned for their own safety or well-being. Early responders, doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals during these times require protection as well. Since they care for both patients who are suffering from Coronavirus as well as the regular patients, they could inadvertently spread communicable agents rather quickly, especially to vulnerable members of the population. Therefore, in the interest of the nation, it is essential that healthcare professionals adequately protect themselves. In fact, all hospital personnel, including regular employees, volunteers and temporary staff, should follow the highest level of personal protection from infection and other risks to their safety and the same degree of access to occupational health services.

Anxiety among staff confronted with a crisis involving the COVID-19, a highly contagious infectious disease, is to be expected and requires active management through personal protective procedures and psycho-social support.

There is also a chance that the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital staff may be adversely affected by circumstances not necessarily or not directly related to the crisis, such as an illness or a conflict between family and work commitments. During an emergency of this scale, there could also be the need for additional personnel for providing specialised care to meet the likely increase in numbers of patients seeking admission to the hospital. Arrangements must be made to meet such eventualities so that there is enough time for the healthcare professionals to rest and re-energise. Provisions for requisitions have to be made to the armed forces for getting their personnel to meet emergency situations.

In these trying times when most of us want to stay within our comfort zones to beat the Coronavirus, health professionals are putting their armour on and attacking it with full force. Let us give more power to these heroes who will eventually save the world.

2,24-3-20,SP urges Centre to relax time for filing tax returns,"With the 2019-20 fiscal drawing to a close on March 31, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav urged the Centre to announce relaxation in time for filing tax returns as the country was fighting the deadly novel coronavirus.

“Businessmen, salaried employees and chartered accountants have the burden of the final week of financial year along with that of coronavirus. The government should immediately announce relaxation without any extra fines or charges and also relax rules for filing returns,” Akhilesh said in a tweet on Monday.

The SP chief demanded that the government announce measures to dispel fears of “tax terrorism” on business community and common tax payers.

On coronavirus, Akhilesh said, “We should not only pay heed to the advice of international community of doctors and scientists but should also learn from the mistakes of those countries who grievously suffered from the pandemic through huge loss of lives.”

“The Union government should issue a White Paper to dispel myths and uncertainties over the pandemic dominating the minds of common man. The government should also assure that it is abiding by recommendations of World Health Organisation, like social distancing and isolation for preventing the spread of the virus and make elaborate arrangements accordingly,” the SP chief said.

Reiterating his demand for relief to workers employed in unorganised sector and daily wagers, Akhilesh said that the government should rope in voluntary organisations for providing relief to the poor who were worst affected by the lockdown.

The SP chief further said that in view of the grave situation caused by the corona pandemic, the government must take immediate measures to tone up performance and delivery of public health services and provide more testing kits for the public.

He said that if the lockdown was to be prolonged, then the government must prepare for ensuring availability of essential commodities and prevent black marketing.

The UP government has clamped lockdown in 17 districts — Agra, Lucknow, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Ghaziabad, Moradabad, Varanasi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Bareilly, Azamgarh, Kanpur, Meerut, Prayagraj, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Pilibhit, Saharanpur and Jaunpur.

Meanwhile, the birth anniversary of socialist ideologue Ram Manohar Lohia was celebrated in the SP state office here in a simple ceremony on Monday.

3,24-3-20,CS asks dist officials to keep tab on people returning from abroad,"Chief Secretary RK Tewari on Monday issued fresh directives to district magistrates and district police chiefs of 16 locked down districts through an 11-point circular on preventing the spread of coronavirus.

The circular has directed the top district officials to keep a close tab on persons who have returned from foreign lands in the last fortnight and ensure that they are kept in isolation and tested.

The district authorities have been asked to seek cooperation of village pradhans, aganwadi and ASHA workers in identifying such persons and use public address system to apprise people of the do’s and don’ts during the lockdown and that they should stay indoors.

They have also been asked to ensure that PDS shops had sanitisers and soaps for hand cleaning.

The chief secretary also asked officials to prevent assembly of five or more persons and prevent morning strolls in parks and streets.

They have been asked to launch a vigorous sanitation drive and prevent accumulation of garbage.

The officials have also been asked to ensure that employees of services exempted from lockdown do not face difficulty in reaching their workplaces. Also, officials have been directed to oversee that nurses and para medical staff are able to visit individual homes for providing medical services without hassles.

For ensuring availability of essential commodities to people, the officials have been directed to use carts and other medium for easy availability of milk, vegetables and other commodities in each mohalla/area.

To prevent black marketing of essential commodities and medicines, officials have been asked to monitor their prices and in case of over pricing, take deterrent action and apprise the secretary of Food and Civil Supplies of the action taken.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/cs-asks-dist-officials--to-keep-tab-on-people--returning-from-abroad.html
4,24-3-20,CM asks people to follow guidelines,"Following reports of violation of lockdown imposed for preventing spread of coronavirus, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked people to follow the guidelines in letter and spirit and help the police in maintaining law and order else the administration would act tough on violators.

“You should save yourself and your family by staying inside your homes and follow government rules and regulations to fight coronavirus. The lockdown has been announced for keeping you and your family safe,” the chief minister said in a tweet on Monday.

Yogi said, “I again appeal to the people to stay indoors and take the guidelines seriously. This is a global health crisis. We can fight it by staying inside our homes.”

Later, in a statement the chief minister said that the situation in Uttar Pradesh was under control and no fresh cases had been reported on Monday.

He claimed that there were 31 Covid-19 positive cases in the state out of which 11 had recovered and returned to their homes and the rest were stable and recovering.

The chief minister also said that he would hold a meeting with traders and medicine wholesalers on Tuesday and see whether home delivery was possible for vegetables and medicines.

“We have over 4,000 PVR vans. If we get support from traders we can go for home delivery of vegetables and medicines,” he said.

Yogi again reiterated that people coming from other states should self-isolate themselves and in case of emergency they should immediately contact 112, 102 or 108 emergency numbers.

“This is a crisis situation but we will emerge victorious. For this people should join hands and support the administration by following the guidelines,” he said.

The government has issued strict warning to the violators and asked the district authorities to register FIRs against them and even take them into custody.

A report said that in Ghaziabad, 55 people were booked under relevant sections on Monday when they came out of their houses without any specific reasons.

In Meerut, 24 people were booked, 50 vehicles seized and 450 vehicles challaned

The administration came into action after reports started pouring about people violating lock- down guidelines and venturing out of their houses to have a dekko. At many places, including in Meerut, Saharanpur, Noida, Ghaziabad and Lucknow, people had heated exchange of words with the police personnel.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to the twitter, asking people to stay indoors. He said that people were not taking the restriction seriously and asked the state governments to ensure proper lockdown.

After the prime minister’s tweet and chief minister’s directive, the administration went into an overdrive.

A high-power meeting was held at UP Police headquarters at Signature building in Gomti Nagar, where DGP HC Awasthi and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi reviewed the situation. They directed the district magistrates and district police chiefs to take stern action against those violating the lockdown and also seal inter-state borders.

“No one would be allowed to enter or leave the districts which have been locked down. People should realise that this has been done for their benefit. They should stay in home and stay safe,” Awanish Awasthi said.

The districts under lockdown are Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Moradabad, Agra, Prayagraj, Aligarh, Bareilly, Varanasi, Meerut, Azamgarh, Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, and Lakhimpur Kheri.

5,24-3-20,Lockdown in Jaunpur also,"Jaunpur became the 17th district of Uttar Pradesh where the state government ordered lockdown after a man was found infected with coronavirus, an official said.

The government official said that a 30-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia tested positive for novel coronavirus infection on Monday.

“The test was carried out in a laboratory of IMS, Banaras Hindu University, and it was positive. He has been put in isolation and the family members are being quarantined. Tests of the people who came in contact with him are also being carried out,” he said, adding that following this lockdown was ordered in Jaunpur..

Earlier, lockdown was ordered in Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Moradabad, Agra , Prayagraj, Aligarh, Bareilly, Varanasi, Meerut , Azamgarh , Muzaffarnagar, Saharanpur, and Lakhimpur Kheri. Pilibhit was added to this list after a 45-year-old woman, who returned from Saudi Arabia after attending Umra, tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have an interaction with people of Varanasi, his parliamentary constituency, on coronavirus on March 25.

In a tweet on Monday, the prime minister said on March 25 at 1700 hours he would interact with the people of his Varanasi constituency through video conferencing.

“If you have any questions then write it on the comment section of Narendra Modi app,” he said, asking people to join his interaction programme.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/lockdown-in-jaunpur-also.html

The officers forgot that the prime minister had urged people to clap, ring bell, blow conches from balcony or premises of their respective houses, keeping themselves self-quarantined.

After the controversy erupted, Member of Parliament from Pilibhit, Varun Gandhi, posted a tweet demanding action against the two officers.

“While many people, including myself, are on self-quarantine and India battles Covid-19 on a war footing, the conduct of the DM and SP of Pilibhit is callous and irresponsible. Times like these need mature conduct like the PM advised. I urge action against those who violated the Janata Curfew,” tweeted Varun Gandhi, reacting to the viral video.

Sources said that the government had sought a detailed report and action was likely to be initiated against the two officers.

On Sunday evening, while people across India clapped, rang bells and blew conch shells in response to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for thanking those at the forefront of fight against the coronavirus, Pilibhit’s DM Vaibhav Srivastava and SP Abhisekh Dikshit instead of ensuring compliance of Janata Curfew led a procession of local people who were seen clapping and blowing conch shells, on Sunday evening.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/dm-and-sp-of-pilibhit-face-the-axe.html
7,24-3-20,Rebuild from ground zero,"We are at that moment in history that will test national leadership by gauging how efficiently Governments react with compassion, speed and scale. We have to ride it out collectively

This Sunday, on March 22, sharp at 5 pm, we witnessed a rare tryst when the entire nation gathered on their balconies and rooftops to applaud the valorous bravehearts who have been endangering their lives to serve the rest. The clamour of gongs reverberated like a celebration, reminiscent of some medieval time in history. Except that this solemn and collective chiming of bells and conch shells was happening in a war-like situation of utter morbidity to fight back the black swan, COVID-19, which has struck lives and livelihoods with unprecedented ferocity.

The Armageddon of 2020 is more perilous than the localised terrorist strikes of 26/11, the Great Depression of 1929, the financial apocalypse of 2008 or any other one-time shocker, devastating human lives and financial resources. The spread of the pandemic has left the medical fraternity and policy-makers confounded on how to deal with the crisis because the contour of this upheaval is a biological beast and has nothing to do with the principles of economics. Yes, we are all together and, hopefully, six months from now, this, too, shall pass.

We stand at that moment in time when we have been compelled to self-reflect and re-strategise from the confines of individual isolation: How do we cope by rebuilding from the free-fall of economies; insulate ourselves from being afflicted by the disease; the shock of ensuing job losses; and worst, the emotional aftermath of feeling vulnerable and so close to death? The $87 trillion global economy propels on the simple principle of “one person’s spending being the other person’s income” as the underlying driver of any business activity. With the world in shutdown mode, the economic impact of social distancing is at present unquantifiable as the risks to life cascade into financial risks that will reverberate for at least a year until a medical solution is found.

Restricting physical movement has damaged the demand-supply economics much beyond what a cyclic slowdown or a recession could erode, lowering forecasts of global growth to 1.25 per cent. Prolonged growth below two per cent is classified as “recession” by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with shrinkage in every parameter: From lowered industrialist production to a slowdown in trade to tighter capital flows, less of oil consumption, heightened unemployment rates and lowered per capita investment and consumption.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry, e-commerce platforms and any digital business that delivers products and services online to the customer confined at home as has been the case for video streaming services like Netflix, online grocery stores, Ed-tech, e-health and fintech, among others. While other sectors such as the real estate, airlines and telecom were gasping for life much before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, even the few erstwhile profitable sectors have now been pushed to the brink. This will all precipitate India’s banking crisis even deeper with a likelihood of turning even positive net-worth firms into non-performing assets (NPAs).

India’s response is in sync with the rest of the world in having to resort to fiscal expansion while simultaneously lowering revenue target expectations to perhaps the lowest ever. The anticipated shortfall cannot be now made up through disinvestment targets but will have to depend on the deficit being made up through the windfall gains of roughly $50 billion through oil arbitrage. If the 2008 financial crisis eroded a decade’s global growth and earnings, COVID-19 will globally regress national and individual gains even deeper and longer, elevating sovereign and corporate debt to even higher levels than they stood historically.

But who put the world into mass quarantine? Once the chaos settles and a cure is found, China must be held accountable by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and international trade bodies for keeping the outbreak under wraps, which squandered precious five weeks that could have alerted the world to take proactive measures. According to a Supreme Court Advocate, GV Rao, “In international/domestic environmental laws, there is a ‘polluter pays principle.’ Similarly, China must be forced to provide free medical aid and economic reimbursements to all countries affected by the virus.” Especially as China profitted the most through global trade in the comity of nations. As the culprit nation, it deserves international sanction and economic isolation. Because even acts of genocide or terrorism stand pale in comparison to the havoc wrought by Corona’s contagion and contagiousness.

This is serious and re-read this point please: I state that China’s wilful opacity on this issue is tantamount to mass murder. Because near-fatal outbreaks can originate from any country. But the host nation has a moral obligation to not wilfully obfuscate facts that can jeopardise the very survival of humanity. As the Chinese economy will be the first to recover and rise, thereby having the lead in redefining its predominance in the world order, we need to diminish our over-dependence for supplies of intermediate goods for pharmaceutical and electronics from it or any single nation. Ideally, the culprit must be ostracised economically for a near war-like crime.

These are testing times for the Indian Government to display how it will deliver on ease of living and ease of doing business, in line with the best practices being pursued by Canada and the US among others, as most nations are moving towards offering a universal basic income. Exceeding fiscal deficits no longer matters as policy-makers now need to tear up conventional theories of economics that are outdated and salvage livelihoods by offering financial relief commensurate with the economic costs of the crisis. The downside is that even when the most developed economy like the US disburses $1,000 to all adults, people will spend it only on necessities and conserve the rest. This will not spur the demand cycle.

The Government’s task force under the Finance Ministry will, of course, address sectoral concerns of the largest afflicted unorganised sector, hospitality and tourism, which employs 40 million people. Restaurants account for 7.3 million jobs, aviation has more than 3,50,000 employees, ride hailing services have five million driving partners, cinema and entertainment cover eight million and online food delivery companies employ 5,00,000. Real estate, the second biggest employer after agriculture, is expected to take a hit of 35 per cent.

But the essence for the Government is in speeding up the response time to effect payouts to businesses; to ease liquidity for the crippled NBFC and MSME sectors; provide cash payments for hawkers, vendors and daily wagers; and food distribution and emergency shelters to the unorganised and vulnerable sections in need of financial aid with immediacy.

Aside from ensuring freer flow of working capital, the Government is now expected to take its fiduciary duties seriously by under taking the role of a standing guarantor for a portion of the wages for businesses affected by the crisis and those unable to operate, offering a lifeline to citizens by lowering taxes as also the rates of utilities; extending loan tenors and relaxing bad-debt norms for small firms; and speeding up direct cash transfers to eligible Jan Dhan holders and for MNREGA wagers dependent on construction activity that has slowed down.

This is a moment in history that will test national leadership by gauging how efficiently Governments react with compassion, speed and scale. This is not a moment to lose in our attempt to recalibrate and resurrect from ground zero, as it were. We have to ride it out individually and collectively till we inch back to pre-crisis levels, reminding ourselves with optimism that even war-time losses never precluded strong economic bounce-backs.

8,24-3-20,Slowing the virus,"Drugs like chloroquine, which the US, France and now India have approved, are stopgaps. Research needed for vaccine

As nations, India included, have gotten into a lockdown as part of a protocol to break the chain of infection, all isolation can do is to buy some time to develop an antidote or at least a containment drug. This is the real war against time as scientists and doctors across the globe are trying out all kinds of permutations and combinations. A virus trial poses severe challenges. First, the disease load ebbs by the time a drug has been created and is waiting to be tested through trials on affected subjects. Delayed clearances and approvals for safety and use mean the drug may be ready but does not have enough demand for a commercial rollout. Considering the heavy funding that goes into such research, a drug has to make economic sense before it can be manufactured. Sometimes the cure, even when rolled out, may be specific to one wave of outbreak and a virus mutation may not render it as effective in the second wave. Coronavirus poses an even more serious challenge — nobody knows its character, speed of mutation and changing transmittable capacities. And given the trail of devastation and deaths, it is giving us very little time to think. Which is why the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) solidarity project offers a slim ray of hope in arresting the virulence at least. As of now, it has approved the use of existing drugs to arrest severe deterioration in conditions because developing compounds from scratch is time-consuming. There is the drug combination already used against HIV. There’s a malaria treatment first tested during World War II. And the new anti-viral against ebola. The WHO study, which could include many thousands of patients in dozens of countries, is putting together a global database of hospitals that can log in patient responses to various drug regimes and establish a pattern of response.

Frankly, repurposing existing drugs is a workable option at this stage because they are already approved for other diseases and are safe. Some experts are also looking at unapproved drugs that have performed well in animal studies with earlier strains of Coronaviruses, which have caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Besides, these drugs can be prophylactics, much needed to protect healthcare workers and others at high risk of infection. Also treatment time could be reduced, easing the pressure on critical medical infrastructure and making sure that more can access facilities and get succour. The HIV combo failed in a small study in China but has been successful in other parts, including Thailand and in Jaipur here. The WHO, therefore, believes a large trial with a greater variety of patients is warranted. The malaria drug chloroquine has been found to work on respiratory cells. It increases the endosomal PH required for the virus-host target cell fusion, limiting the virus takeover of the body. In SARS-Coronavirus, chloroquine was found to interfere with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of the virus. This isolated the bug. Though not acting on the virus per se, it is strengthening host systems and preventing the former from latching on to them. This is believed to halt the virus in the preliminary stages and arrest complications like pneumonia. Also, chloroquine molecules do not lose their effectiveness, both pre and post-infection. They increase the volume of zinc ions in the host cell to inhibit the virus. Remdesivir, the anti-viral, intravenous medicine for ebola, has had lab-level success and is being used in human trials. In the end, these are still just proactive but preventive steps and a global research and sustained funding is needed to tame the Coronavirus, which keeps on appearing in a deadlier form year after year. Conspiracy theories of bio-warfare strategies and big pharma complicity apart, COVID-19 has shown why nobody can be safe or be around to claim the benefits of such offensives. The world economy has tanked and humans have hopefully realised that they themselves could become the virus. A good beginning has been made between Governments on cooperative research. May be the altruism will not last once the crisis ebbs but one thing is clear, if a rapidly mutating virus can still wipe out humanity and flus continue to be pandemics in our timelines, then we clearly have not done enough to cure our minds of the invincibility of being the supreme race. All we need to be is just human, and as Indians, strictly comply with lockdown and distancing.

Even as several national Governments were groping around in the dark to figure out what the impact of the SARS-CoV 2 epidemic would be, some parts of the sports world were quick to react. European football quickly shut down games once a few players were infected with the virus and then proceeded to even postpone its flagship European Championships scheduled for this summer. The National Basketball Association was the first major American professional sports championship to shut down after one player was diagnosed with COVID-19. And then everything began to fall like a house of cards. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which was tone deaf to fans, imploring it to cancel the Indian Premier League (IPL), postponed the tournament till mid-April. It now looks as if it will not go ahead at all. Australia and New Zealand’s One-Day international sides played a match without an audience but quickly cancelled the series. The English summer cricket season, too, might be put on hold.

In the midst of all this, as sports lovers know, this is an Olympic year with the summer games scheduled to go ahead in Japan’s capital Tokyo. While Japan has been extremely proactive in preparing for the games, both the local organising committee and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have been grappling with what to do — to cancel or postpone the games. The IOC’s steadfast stand of going ahead with the games until today is being increasingly seen as an act of arrogance and stubbornness. Or is it that like the IPL, it is worried about the sponsors and broadcaster commitments? Of course, common sense should come into play even if the contracts are tightly worded because no commercial contract in any sector has a pandemic clause built into it unless, of course, it is the insurance industry. Qualifying tournaments have not been able to take place due to border closures, athletes cannot train due to social distancing. While Japan has been saved by the worst of the virus so far, bringing 50,000 athletes, officials, journalists, broadcasters, technicians and politicians from across the world to one spot would be a disaster waiting to happen. May be we will be able to check the Wuhan contagion by then but we cannot assume that. Nor should the IOC. If it continues to dig its heels, it will be hosting a game that will be attended by none. This way, it will destroy every last shred of its credibility.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/postpone-the-games-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/postpone-the-games.html
10,24-3-20,A system failure,"The bailout given to Yes Bank, using public money, emboldens banks to continue with their game plan. The Govt and the RBI must do everything to give a body blow to this attitude

Much before the crisis at the beleaguered Yes Bank reached a flashpoint [when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on March 5, 2020, superseded its Board, appointed ex-Chief Finance Officer (CFO) of the State Bank of India (SBI) as its administrator and imposed a moratorium for a month on critical operations such as sanction of fresh loan, renewal of existing loans, Rs 50,000 ceiling on withdrawal of money per account] some depositors had already sensed it coming.

They withdrew about Rs 18,000 crore during the first six months of the current year (deposits declined from Rs 2,27,000 crore as on March 31, 2019 to Rs 2,09,000 crore as on September 30, 2019); of this, Rs 16,000 crore were withdrawn during July–September, 2019 alone. Thereafter, the withdrawals leapfrogged to Rs 72,000 crore till the moratorium came into effect on March 5, 2020, the current level of deposits being Rs 1,37,000 crore.

At the core of the crisis is the surge in non-performing assets (NPAs) — a jargon for the loans that have turned bad raising serious doubt about their recovery. As per results for the third quarter of current year, the NPAs are Rs 40,000 crore. At this level, the bank was on the brink of collapse. Had things continued as usual, each one of the remaining depositors would have rushed to withdraw his/her money lying in the bank. Given the mammoth shortfall in available capital, this would have led to utter chaos. The RBI intervention averted it.

Meanwhile, the Union Government has approved a scheme for the ‘Reconstruction of Yes Bank — 2020’ under which the SBI has committed to invest Rs 6,050 crore for 49 per cent shareholding and private sector banks viz. HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank and so on, promising to put in about Rs 3,950 crore taking the total capital infusion to about Rs 10,000 crore. With this, the moratorium was lifted on March 18 when the new Board took over. Under the new ownership and management control, whether or not, the bank will be able to stem the exodus of depositors, restore confidence and start normal operations, one time will tell.

Meanwhile, it is necessary to analyse as to how the Yes Bank came to such a pass; in fact, look at the big picture as to how in a span of two years, three other financial entities viz. Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FC) and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Limited (DHFL) were pushed towards bankruptcy. At a fundamental level, we need to look at the manner in which the bank sanctions a loan and to whom it is given namely, the borrower.

Let us consider three possible scenarios viz. First, the bank has conducted due diligence, carefully assessed the viability of the project/venture for which loan is to be given, convinced itself about the credibility of the borrower and taken adequate security/collateral against the loan. Second, it has granted loan in a cavalier fashion without conducting due diligence and assessing project viability, at best seeing in some cases, whether or not the borrower has a licence. Third, while, granting the loan, the management only looks at the gain that will accrue to it at personal level under what is termed as “quid pro quo.”

A loan given under category one could go bad under an external environment becoming adverse. For instance, dumping of steel by Chinese producers in the Indian market a couple of years back or withdrawal of the Generalized Scheme of Preferences or the global economic slump accentuated by the Coronavirus and so on. These are all factors beyond the control of the borrower which could change for the better and with policy support from the Government, the stress on loan can be eased.

The loan given under the second category is potentially vulnerable as at the time of sanctioning it, the bank simply did not bother to conduct due diligence and determine whether the underlying project is viable. Still, there could be an unusual chance it is able to generate adequate cash flows to amortise the loan — possibly based on an implicit assumption that there was no malafide intent.

Coming to category three, a loan given by the bank top brass with an intent of self-aggrandisement is bound to go junk as the person taking it has no intent of returning it. The probe currently underway by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) points to several loans given by the Yes Bank in this category. Two such cases that have been widely reported include a loan of Rs 3,700 crore extended to DHFL in lieu of the latter returning the favour by giving Rs 600 crore to shell companies owned by daughters of the ex-Chairman of the bank. Second is the loan of Rs 1,900 crore extended to the Avantha group in lieu of the benefit of over Rs 300 crore given by the latter to the wife of the ex-Chairman for purchase of a posh bungalow in New Delhi.

The agencies have reportedly unravelled 78 shell companies owned and controlled by the kin of the ex-chairman and used for laundering the proceeds of corruption. From this alone, one gets an idea of the magnitude of bribe money in the deals, manifold gain to the borrower (in the cited cases, the ratio is 6:1) and corresponding loss to the bank in NPAs. There is no way any loss being the result of a “quid pro quo” arrangement between the bank top brass and borrower, could be recovered.

Add to this, NPAs due to loans given to Reliance Communications Limited (RCL), Jet Airways, Cox & Kings and so on. The capital loss on both these counts may well be in excess of Rs 30,000 crore.

The project ‘Reconstruction of Yes Bank — 2020’ is an attempt to plug this big hole created in the bank’s balance sheet by the dubious actions of the promoter and irregularities at the management level. To the extent, it remains unplugged (so far, the total commitment is just about Rs 10,000 crore; which consortium members are forced to keep invested for three years, the SBI’s whole contribution and private investors 75 per cent), even after reconstruction, the bank will remain vulnerable.

Here, we need to recognise that the problem is systemic. All other entities (having gone bankrupt) had given loan under the third category. For instance, Rs 6,500 crore loan given by PMC to Housing Development and Infrastructure Limited; tens of thousands of crores in dubious loans given by IL&FS which landed in dozens of shell companies owned by the top brass of the former and so on.

There is a lurking fear that this could be the tip of the iceberg. In that scenario, we could be staring at a big jolt to the financial system. The RBI and the Government need to change gears. Instead of bolting the stable after the horses have fled, they need to be proactive and focus more on “preventive” measures.

They should use surveillance powers to actually see things happening and pre-empt the chances of dubious loans being sanctioned — instead of waiting for the balance sheet and audit report to be finalised. If need be, the Banking Regulation Act should be amended. The Yes Bank episode clearly demonstrates that proactive regulatory intervention on “real time” basis is far more crucial than even governance reforms in banks. It also shows that lowering of Government shareholding in public sector banks to below 50 per cent or privatisation in plain words is not a panacea for the latter’s ills. Irrespective of whether a bank is owned by a State or private entity, the managements are prone to playing with public money. This attitude is propelled by lack of timely supervision on one hand and absence of punishment commensurate with the crime on the other.

The bailout given and that, too, using public money (resurrection of Yes Bank involves 60 per cent of capital infusion by the SBI which is majority-owned by the Government) emboldens them to continue with their game plan. It is, therefore, incumbent upon the Government and the RBI to do all that is necessary to give a body blow to this attitude. Otherwise, the banks will continue to remain vulnerable to manipulation by the top management including by the founder/owner for adding to personal riches.

11,24-3-20,Ram Lalla idol to be shifted to makeshift temple on Mar 25,"The shifting of the Ram Lalla idol from the dilapidated tent to a makeshift bullet-proof temple will be a low key affair and will be attended by district officials and saints at Ayodhya on Wednesday.

The decision was taken in view of coronavirus scare in the country and the lockdown in 17 districts of the state.

Earlier, the Ayodhya administration had planned an elaborate programme at Ram Janmabhoomi and it was to be attended by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and the functions were to continue for five days.

On Monday, Ayodhya officials said that a brief programme would be held around 4 am on Wednesday when the idols would be shifted to a makeshift temple.

Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust general secretary and Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader Champat Rai said in Ayodhya that a small function would be organised for shifting the idols because the entire country was gripped by coronavirus scare and hence the programme was curtailed.

Chief priest of Ram Lalla temple, Acharya Satendra, also said that the idols would be shifted as per ritual after two days of religious programme.

However, there is plan to hold bhoomi pujan of Ram temple on April 30, which is likely to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat. A final call on whether the function would be held with fanfare or not would be taken at a meeting of Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust on April 4.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ram-lalla-idol-to-be-shifted-to-makeshift-temple-on-mar-25.html

26,24-3-20,Stop mineral transport during lockdown: K'jhar locals to admin,"In the wake of worldwide united effort to fight against the spread of coronavirus pandemic, there is a growing demand by the locals here that the district administration put a brake on the movement of trucks in the mining sector in the lockdown period of seven days.

Sources revealed that Joda-Barbil of Keonjhar district being the mining hub of the country, it receives thousands of trucks from different parts of the country like Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and even from Bangladesh daily to transport iron ore and other minerals.

In the context of coronavirus, the presence of drivers and helpers whose number is said to be double of the trucks has heightened the risk of spreading the infection and so there is panic among the locals over the matter.

It is alleged that the drivers and helpers not only enter to the different mines but also come in contact with local people through hotels , grocery shops, medicine shops, medicals and garages etc. If no action is taken to check the entry of those outsiders who are vulnerable to spread of the Coronavirus, they may pose a big risk.

Ashish Singh, a local truck owner of Joda, demanded that the district administration take immediate steps to stop the moment of trucks. Like wise , Congress leader Ashok Thackar of Barbil alleged that not only was risk of infection due to the inflow of people from different parts to Keonjhar but also it would spike the demand for different sanitised items like mask and other consumables ,leading to black marketing of the items.

He recalled that in the year 2015 when Barbil-Joda was in grip of dengue, the role of then Collector of Keonjhar Dr Tirumallanaik in fighting against the epidemic was still fresh in the mind of the people.

Secretary of the Barbil Truck Owners’ Association Chandraprasad Gupta and Jashwavanta Singh of Braja Minerals said they were transporting the iron ore as per approval of the mining office and would stop doing so when asked.

When Contacted, Joint Director of Mines of Joda Circle Salil Kumar Behera said there were orders to stop the transportating but the same was not executed. However, RTO, Keonjhar Nirmal Mohanty told there was a plan to introduce the odd-even system to check the movement of trucks.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stop-mineral-transport-during-lockdown--k-jhar-locals-to-admin.html
27,24-3-20,Posters outside 400 houses of self-quarantined residents,"The Ranchi District Administration has pasted posters outside at least 400 houses of people on self-quarantine across the State capital and its suburbs – an initiative aimed at cautioning trespassers and visitors beforehand that the residents of the house might be carriers of Novel Coronavirus, officials said on Monday.

While the Government has enforced a lockdown across the State in the wake of COVID-19 on Sunday, the District Administration’s decision of pasting posters was implemented in the urban areas of Ranchi on Monday.

The initiative of the administration assumes significance as several thousand people have returned to Ranchi from States where cases of Coronavirus have been reported.‘Home under quarantine. Keep milk bag/ courier/ food packet/newspaper outside. Do not go inside at any cost,” said one of the posters pasted on the main gate of a house at Harmu Housing Colony in Ranchi. Ranchi Deputy Commissioner Rai Mahimapat Ray said that objective behind pasting posters was not to scare people, but to prevent the spread of the virus in the city.

“If any person is found entering the houses where people are in self-quarantine, the person will also be examined and quarantined,” said Rai, adding that if a person spots such movement in houses that have warning posters

on their entry gates, then he or she should inform the district administration about it. “You can dial 181 or 104 and inform us. We have screened around 4000 people by now,” he said. He also urged the people of the State to be cautious and pay special attention to their hygiene.While the number of people infected by Coronavirus in India crossed the figure of 400 by Monday, Jharkhand is among the few states that have not yet reported any positive case of the lethal virus.

COVID-19 – a mysterious virus that has killed more than 15,000 people and affected 3.5 lakh across the globe – has, however, swung the health machinery here in action. Several trains and buses have been cancelled, and the Government has directed all people travelling to Jharkhand from affected States to stay in self-quarantine for at least 14 days.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/posters-outside-400-houses-of-self-quarantined-residents.html

45,24-3-20,Behavioural change key to fighting coronavirus,"There are many concerns related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. While effective evidence based treatment and prevention measures are being developed, they are in the very early stages. The disease is spreading fast affecting lots of people in all most all countries.

Although considerable proportions of patients are recovering, death rates are alarmingly high. There is a genuine reason for the alarm and need for a concerted effort to deal with the situation. It is good to see that the Governments are taking proportionate and timely actions balancing the impact on various aspects of life.

However, as the disease is new and knowledge base regarding its effective control is developing, current measures and available resources are observed to be only partially effective.

Change in behaviour is important to control this virus and it is needed quickly. Following professional and medical advice regarding this is an extreme necessity. Unless contact with others is avoided and poor hygiene is not addressed, it will be difficult to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

It is especially important not to believe or act on the rumours, circulating in the media. Sometimes these appear so convincing that people just follow them blindly without checking, clarifying or challenging them.

There are many false reassurances in the social media about preventing the infection or remedies, which are damaging. The problem is huge numbers of people become affected by these rumours and put themselves and others at risk.

There are many reliable sources for information on Coronavirus, e.g. World Health Organisation and Professional Medical Societies, which should be followed. It is so important for one’s own self and for the community people follow the right advice from the professionals.

Authorities and media have great responsibilities to see that only evidence based information is provided to the public. In the case of a new disease such as COVID-19, when the information is changing fast, it is important to remain updated regularly.

In this scenario, it is understandable that people are stressed and anxious. People are fearful of getting infected with the virus; worried about arranging basic necessities of life, their work, family members especially those are elderly and away.

Stress can present in various ways and it is essential to identify stress symptoms and manage these before they deteriorate further affecting life. Usual symptoms are constant worry over one’s own health and that of the family; problems in concentration, sleep, appetite, increase in substance use, deterioration in the existing illnesses.

There may be fear of death and panic, emotional exhaustion, frustration, hopelessness, etc. As the secondary stresses such as joblessness, financial problems, deaths related to COVID-19 become more prevalent, most people will have additional problems.

Older persons, children, mentally ill people are more vulnerable, even the healthcare providers treating patients with COVID-19. These people need prioritised support. It is important to identify and practice suitable relaxation techniques, taking regular breaks from work and usual routine, finding time to engage in different activities, connecting with close people are some of the general principles of managing stress in this challenging period.

Remaining glued to TV with repeating contents of stories may not be helpful. Media can provide relaxation ideas and programmes of exercise and various activities at home to help the situations.

It will be a while before the effective treatments and preventive vaccinations are available to everyone. Till then, change in behaviour regarding social contact and maintaining hygiene both by individuals and community may be able to stop the spread of coronavirus. In that context, everyone has a role to play.

84,24-3-20,Curfew with ‘no relaxation imposed,"With Punjab reporting two more corona positive cases on Monday and amidst reports of people defying lockdown orders from across the State, the Government on Monday imposed a “continuous” and “24 hours a day” curfew with “no relaxations” till further orders — becoming the first state to take an unprecedented step to deal with the situation arising out of the spread of deadly coronavirus.

The Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh, after reviewing the situation with the Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh and Director General of Police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta, announced full curfew with no relaxations “to tackle the prevailing war-like situation”.

Following this, the Deputy Commissioners issued orders accordingly in their respective districts bringing into effect the imposition of curfew. As per the orders, no relaxation has been provided, and any person required to be given relaxation will be so allowed specifically for a given period and purpose only with the Deputy Commissioner’s permission.

The “extreme and exceptional measure” in the battle against COVID-19 came in the wake of the apprehensions that the fatal virus may infect many people, especially keeping in view the reports that some persons contracted the infection at Hola Mohalla celebrations in Sri Anandpur Sahib earlier this month which was also attended by the corona-positive Baldev Singh who died on March 18.

“After lockdown came into effect, we received reports of people moving freely, not adhering to orders properly...shops were opened at many places and people were busy shopping and even on roads despite repeated requests to stay at home. Flag marches were also held at many places, even police forcibly closed down shops…But, considering this, it was felt that curfew is the only means to keep people indoors,” a senior government official told The Pioneer.

Soon as the orders were passed, there was a complete ban on movement. The Deputy Commissioners, in each district, had been authorized to issue passes, which would be time-specific and destination-specific. Only those with the passes would be allowed to move around, said the official.

Even for essential services, including doctors, chemists, and daily goods shops, it was mandatory to apply for permission, and they could run their operations only after that.

CM, in a video address to the people of Punjab, appealed to them to voluntarily adhere to the curfew imposed “in the larger interest of the state” while also warning of strict action against its any violation.

“I am forced to take this extreme step in the interest of the state,” said the CM pointing that he had received reports that people were moving around normally in towns, mohallas, and cities despite the lockdown that became effective this morning.

Appealing to the people for cooperation, CM said that the violation of lockdown by the people was “unacceptable” and it was the responsibility of the Government, and his duty as its head, to “save Punjab”.

Making it clear that the curfew would be continuous, spanning 24 hours a day, the Chief Minister said that only those with emergent needs would be allowed to go out, after taking due permission from their respective DCs, whose mobile numbers would be shared with the public.

“Difficult decisions need to be taken in difficult times,” said the Chief Minister, adding that it had become necessary to impose and enforce the curfew to survive these tough times. “Please listen to me, and bear with me,” he appealed to the people, emphasizing, “We must work shoulder to shoulder to fend off the crisis we are all facing”.

The State Government, in a revised order, further scaled-down the staff in government offices. The orders applied to the state headquarters and the district level offices. The heads of departments have been asked to keep skeleton staff as per the requirement.

As the BJP legislative party meet held in Bhopal on Monday evening, senior leader Gopal Bhargav proposed Chouhan’s name and several MLAs, including former Minister Narottam Mishra, seconded his name. Soon after central observers — Vinay Sahastrabuddhe and Arun Singh, attending the meeting through video conferencing announced that Chouhan has been named the leader of BJP Legislative Party.

Chouhan in his address straightaway launched a stinging assault on outgoing Congress Government claiming that the Congress government completely destroyed the State in 15 months of rule.

The state government also exhibited ways how they can destroy the state further while shunning power, claimed Chouhan adding it was not a time for discussing these things. With collective efforts, we would put the state back on track on development and public welfare but I wish to urge partymen that it wasn’t a time for celebration and Corona scare was the topmost priority.

“I would start sitting in my office in Mantralaya since Monday night,” said Chouhan.

Lauding the will shown by PM Narendra Modi against Corona scare, Chouhan who will be sworn in as the Chief Minister for fourth time in MP, claimed the MLAs would shortly visit their constituencies to raise awareness on Novel Corona virus. It is an emotional moment for me as my party has yet again shown that a common worker like me could achieve heights despite having no political or family background, Chouhan said.

Meanwhile, Congress party leaders were heard voicing for appointment of Kamal Nath as the Leader of Opposition.

After senior leader PC Sharma, Sajjan Singh Verma, the former PWD minister also tweeted that Nath should lead the party as LOp and state president into by-polls.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/shivraj-sworn-in-as-mp-cm-away-from-media-glare.html

The number of persons attending the marriage reception and the kind of swanky cars in which the guests arrive are an indication of the social stand of the hosts.

Though the Dravidian movements in the State claim that they have revolutionised Tamil society with self-respect marriages, touted as simple events sans Vedic scholars for solemnising the most important event in the lives of youths, it is all for public consumption. You may not see Brahmin pundits officiating as “God’s Representative” during the ceremony. But there are new avatars of EV Ramasamy Naicker (founder of Dravidian movement who propounded the idea of self-respect marriages) playing the role of the pundit. The marriages continued to be glittering events where music concerts and western dance events by the stars of Kollywood played major role.

Not any more. The coronavirus, which struck Tamil Nadu early this month, has taken the glamour and crowd off the marriages. The last four days saw people hailing from upper middle class families doing away with all opulence, high-end celebrations and the unique spreads during lunch and dinner. Gone are the glitterati and chauffer driven limousines. And above all, the venues have been shifted to the sanctum sanctorum of temples! The priest of the temple blesses the couple, who exchange the garlands (made out of minimum number of flowers) which are sanitised. The minimum number of guests who grace the occasion are welcomed not with the traditional sandal waters and pastes but with sanitisers with which they could clean their hands!

The amount of loss suffered by the catering agents because of the corona virus attack is beyond comprehension. “Usually there would be a minimum of 6,000 guests for a marriage. The coronavirus has brought it down. We serve 14 to 20 course meals during lunch which include vegetable biriyani, fried rice, parothas, puris, vegetable curries and sweet delicacies,” said Manikandan , a lead caterer from Ambur near Velore.

Monday saw a youth belonging to the political outfit led by film star Vijayakanth tying nuptial note in Chennai. He was forced to do away with all celebrations because of the Section 144 but he shifted the venue to the actor’s residence so that his “God” could grace the occasion. A wheel chair bound Vijayakanth, who is keeping indifferent health for the last two years attended the marriage covering his face with mask and blessed the couple.

Elsewhere in the State, the bride, groom and their immediate relations constitute the list of guests. The same is the case in Kerala with parents of soon to be married youngsters deciding to do away with the air-conditioned wedding halls, lavish feasts, and related rituals which would help them save a few lakhs.

117,24-3-20,"No info, circulars, advisories issued to people with disabilities","Amidst the coronavirus scare, the Centre seems to have forgotten the people with disabilities (PwDs) as it is yet to make all its information and circulars/advisories related to Covid-19 in a format that is easily accessible to them.

Waking up to this need of the sector, the Union Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry has now written to the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) to make the awareness material in braille for blind people and in sign language video/tapes for deaf and dumb people.

The Ministry has also asked the Union Health Ministry to ensure medical treatment on priority basis to the sector, in case they are inflicted with the virus, as envisaged under the Rule 25 of the Rights of People with Disabilities Act 2016.

In a letter to all the State Chief Secretaries recently, Shakuntala Doley Gamlin, Union secretary (Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry) drew their attention stating that the information in regard to the Coronavirus that has infected over 3,0000 and killed over 14,000 is very often not accessible by the PwDs.

As such they remain unaware of the safety measures to be taken by them to deal with the situation even though it has been proven that they face increased risk of getting infected and developing more severe cases of COVID-19.

The virus can be kept at bay by following simple hygiene measures like washing hands with soaps and usage of hand sanitisers.

Taking stringent view of the gaps, Gamlin reminded the States about the RPwDs Act 2016 that envisages dissemination of all information in accessible format both print and electronically.

Rule 15 of the Rights of the PWD rules clearly mandate that all the websites must be made accessible in accordance with guidelines for governments websites as adopted by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances and all public domain documents to be uploaded in the website either in the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) or ePUB (ebook file format) format, she said.

Gamlin asserted that immediate steps need to be taken to make all the publicity material related to COVID 19 accessible in print material in braille and audio tapes, videographic material with sub titles and sign language interpretation for the sector.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/no-info--circulars--advisories-issued-to-people-with-disabilities.html

The move has come days after the televised address by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the outbreak on Thursday when he urged the business community not to cut staff salaries.

The Ministry in its advisory said the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) requests all employers not to cut salaries of employees who are unable to work.

The advisory asks employers not to terminate their employees, particularly casual or contractual employees, from their jobs or reduce their wages. The letter states that the catastrophic situation due to the outbreak of coronavirus is a challenge to the society and these challenges can only be neutralised by the coordinated efforts of all.

The advisory further states that in view of the coronavirus pandemic and the consistent efforts of the government requesting the citizen to remain at home and not venture out, will constraint the worker or the employee to report for work.

There may be instances that on this pretext, the employer may dispense with the services of the employees or may force them to go on leave without wages or salaries.

As per the advisory, if any worker takes leave, he or she should be deemed to be on duty without any consequential deduction in wages for this period. Further, if the place of employment is to be made non-operational due to coronavirus pandemic, the employees of such unit will be deemed to be on duty.

The advisory also realises that the termination of the employee from the job or reduction in wages in this scenario will further deepen the crises and will not only weaken the financial condition of the employee but also hamper their morale to combat their fight with this epidemic.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/don---t-cut-salaries-or-lay-off-employees--public-pvt-establishments-directed.html

He also said that no private companies would be allowed to go for retrenchment or salary cut in the wake of Cornoanvirus pandemic situation.

Yechury suggested that there should be moratorium of bank loan repayments to SME, retail traders and EMI payments to employees. “Many countries in the world have announced that the government will guarantee the payment of at least 80 per cent of the salaries being drawn by workers who are now unable to attend work. Government of India should do likewise. Alongside there should be a moratorium on bank loans for a year for SMEs and retail traders as well as on EMIs. Now that the

Finance Bill has been approved by the Parliament, the Central government must set aside separate funds for a substantial package to save the lives and livelihood of crores of people. This is the time to use our resources for saving lives and not be preoccupied by concerns to maintain fiscal discipline,” said Yechury.

CPI’s trade union AITUC urged Government to strengthen the grass root level health administration and economic relief packages to the workers and employees. “ The government should have come out with financial assistance to working people and businesses in case of shut down due to govt. decision to ensure job security and to safe guard the poor, vulnerable needy sections of the society specially those who are daily /casual/contract/migrant workers.

Despite an unprecedented national lockdown which was put in place on March 14, the number of deaths and infections have spiralled in Spain, with the figures growing as the country steps up its capacity for testing. And the lockdown, which was initially put in place for two weeks, will be extended until April 11 to try to curb the spread, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said — in a measure which will be put to parliament on Tuesday.

The rise in infections in this country of 46 million people has brought Spain’s healthcare system to the brink of collapse, particularly in Madrid, the worst-hit area, which has registered 10,575 cases, and where 1,263 people have died — accounting for 58 per cent of the national death toll.

Some 3,910 healthcare workers have tested positive for the virus, or around 12 per cent of those infected, the health ministry’s emergencies coordinator Fernando Simon said.

Officials have repeatedly warned that the number of deaths and infections would continue to rise this week and that the worst was yet to come.

“We have yet to see the impact of the strongest, most damaging wave, which will test our material and moral capacities to the limit, as well as our spirit as a society,” Sanchez said on Sunday.

Once this crisis is over, the airline will have to redouble its efforts to rebuild these cash reserves, Dutta added.

155,24-3-20,Govt raises insolvency threshold to Rs 1 cr to help small cos,"To help small companies facing the threat of defaults due to coronavirus-related lockdown, the government on Tuesday raised the threshold that would trigger insolvency proceedings to Rs 1 crore from current Rs 1 lakh.

This raising of the threshold will help small and medium enterprises, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

Also, the government will consider suspending Sections 7, 9, 10 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for six months if the current economic situation continues beyond April, she said, adding this would help companies being forced into insolvency on default of loans.

156,24-3-20,Sensex recovers 693 pts amid govt measures to aid coronavirus-hit economy,"A day after the historic rout, equity benchmark Sensex bounced back to close 693 points higher on Tuesday as investors noted governments across the world taking prompt economic measures to offset the financial damage from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Indian equities followed an improved investor sentiment in Asia after the Federal Reserve announced limitless bond-buying programme to support the US economy.

Meanwhile, Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said an economic package to help through the coronavirus lockdown was in works even as fresh cases of virus spread reported from various parts of the country.

After gyrating 1,823.97 points, the BSE barometer gave up some gains to end 692.79 points or 2.67 per cent higher at 26,674.03. It hit an intra-day high of 27,462.87 and a low of 25,638.90.

Similarly, the NSE Nifty settled 190.80 points, or 2.51 per cent, down at 7,801.05.

Top gainers in the Sensex pack included Infosys, Bajaj Finance, Maruti, HUL, HCL Tech and Reliance Industries, while M&M, IndusInd Bank, ITC, PowerGrid and L&T were among the losers.

According to experts, a major package from the government of India and the Reserve Bank is expected shortly, and the market is likely to remain hugely volatile with rising possibility of V shaped recovery occasionally.

The US Fed is now leading from the front with its historic package which includes open-ended purchase of securities, direct loans to companies, purchase of corporate bonds, lending against student loans and credit card loans, they said.

The Federal Reserve on Monday announced it will buy unlimited amounts of US Treasury debt -- essentially printing money for the economy -- as well as new steps to lend directly to small- and medium-sized companies that have been among the hardest-hit as economic activity dries up.

Other central banks are also expected to follow suit with bold measures to ease the severely strained credit and financial markets, experts noted.

Traders said extreme lockdown measures taken by the government of India and authorities across the world still weigh on global investor sentiment.

Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul rallied up to 8 per cent. Exchanges in Europe too rallied up to 6 per cent.

Meanwhile, the rupee appreciated marginally against the US dollar to 76.17 (intra-day).

Global crude benchmark, Brent crude futures rose 5.22 per cent to USD 28.44 per barrel.

Coronavirus cases in India crossed 500 and one more death from the infection reported taking the toll to ten, as the Centre on Tuesday asked the states and union territories to clamp curfew wherever necessary in the wake of people defying lockdown orders in several parts of the country.

The number of global Covid-19 infections has shot past 3,80,000.

157,24-3-20,China ready to share its experience to control virus spread with India,"China on Monday “applauded” the aid sent by India during the height of Beijing’s battle against the deadly coronavirus and said it would like to share its experience in handling the COVID-19 with New Delhi and provide necessary assistance in preventing its spread.

India sent about 15 tonnes of medical assistance comprising masks, gloves and other emergency medical equipment to the coronavirus-hit Wuhan city on February 26 by a military plane, which also evacuated 112 Indians and several foreign nationals.

In his media briefing here, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China is extending assistance and aid to local Governments in 19 countries which have extended assistance to it when the coronavirus outbreak struck the country.

Asked about the conspicuous absence of India in the 19 countries listed by him,

Geng said India and China have an “unimpeded channel of exchanges and the exchange

is close.” “After the outbreak of COVID-19, China and India have been in communication and there is cooperation between the two. Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent a letter of sympathies with the Chinese side and the Indian Foreign Minister also spoke with the Chinese side over phone,” he said.

“We have received assistance from the Indian side and we applaud that. We have a mechanism of exchanges and China has been notifying the information to India in a timely manner,” he said.

“We have also been providing assistance and necessary convenience to the Indians in China. We have been protecting their health and safety,” he said. “As the pandemic spreads, we have also noted the situation in India. China and India are the only two countries with a population of over one billion. The virus is a challenge to all and we would like to share our experience with the Indian side and further provide necessary assistance to the Indian side,” he said.

Geng also pointed out India was part of a video conference conducted by the Chinese officials to share their COVID-19 experience with Eurasia and South Asian countries recently.

South Asian countries including India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan, Maldives, Bangladesh participated in it, he said. Officials included those from health authorities, diplomatic services, national defence, customs civil aviation etc. The World Health Organisation delegates in the relevant countries also participated in the video conference, he said.

The conference was a platform to share China’s experience in epidemic prevention, diagnosis and control, treatment, supply guarantee, Geng said, adding that Chinese officials answered around 80 questions. Geng said the conference lasted for four hours and around 2,000 representatives participated in it. The participants think it is timely and necessary to learn from China’s experience, he said.

China, which is battling the coronavirus since January 23, has reported no new domestic cases of the COVID-19 on Sunday but reported nine deaths taking the death toll to 3,270 as it ramped up measures to strictly quarantine people coming from abroad.

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached 81,093 by the end of Sunday. It included 3,270 people who died of the disease, 5,120 patients still undergoing treatment, 72,703 patients discharged after recovery, according to China’s National Health Commission.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/china-ready-to-share-its-experience-to-control-virus-spread-with-india.html
158,24-3-20,MH17 trial briefly resumes in near empty courtroom,"The trial of three Russians and a Ukrainian charged with multiple murder for their alleged roles in shooting down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in 2014 resumed briefly Monday as the presiding judge read out a number of preliminary decisions.

Courtroom was almost empty due to restrictions aimed at slowing spread of coronavirus. Decisions on several requests by prosecutors for further investigations were delayed to give defense lawyers for one of defendants more time to prepare.

Among decisions taken by the court since the trial opened on March 9, Presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis authorised prosecutors to give lawyers for family members of the 298 victims access to limited parts of the investigation dossier.

After a hearing of just under 45 minutes, the case was adjourned until June 8, when defense lawyers for one of the suspects will be allowed to make preliminary objections such as challenging the Dutch court’s jurisdiction to stage the trial.

None of the suspects is attending the trial and only one — Russian Oleg Pulatov — has appointed defense lawyers to represent him. When the trial opened earlier this month, the courtroom was packed with lawyers, judges, family members of victims and media.

But on Monday judges sat separated from one another by an empty seat, the number of prosecutors, lawyers and other staff was reduced and family and media were not allowed to attend. The flight, known as MH17, was shot down July 17, 2014, by a Buk missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russian separatist rebels as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/mh17-trial-briefly-resumes-in-near-empty-courtroom.html
159,24-3-20,Pompeo in Kabul in effort to revive flagging peace process,"US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in Kabul on an urgent visit Monday to try to move forward a US peace deal signed last month with the Taliban, a trip that comes despite the coronavirus pandemic, at a time when world leaders and statesmen are curtailing official travel. Since the signing of the deal, the peace process has stalled amid political turmoil in Afghanistan, with the country’s leaders squabbling over who was elected president.

President Ashraf Ghani and his main rival in last September’s presidential polls, Abdullah Abdullah, have both declared themselves the country’s president in dueling inauguration ceremonies earlier this month.

Pompeo met separately with Ghani and was meeting with Abdullah before going to meet together with both Afghan leaders. His schedule also has Ghani and Abdullah coming together for a one-on-one meeting, presumably to discuss a possible compromise.

The United States pays billions every year toward the Afghan budget, including the country’s defence forces. Afghanistan barely raises a quarter of the revenue it needs to run the country, giving Pompeo considerable financial leverage to force the two squabbling leaders to overcome the impasse.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/pompeo-in-kabul-in-effort-to-revive-flagging-peace-process.html

161,24-3-20,UN chief calls for immediate global ceasefire as coronavirus fire rages on,"United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called for an “immediate global ceasefire” in all corners of the world, emphasising that it is time to put armed conflict in lockdown and focus on the fight against the rapidly-spreading coronavirus pandemic. His appeal came as the total number of deaths due to coronavirus crossed 15,000 globally. Over 341,300 cases have been registered in 174 countries and territories since the epidemic first emerged in China in December.

Addressing UN correspondents in a virtual briefing, Guterres said: “Our world faces a common enemy: COVID-19. The virus does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all, relentlessly”. He voiced concern that as coronavirus spreads across the world, armed conflict rages on around the world and the most vulnerable — women and children, people with disabilities, the marginalised and the displaced — pay the highest price.

Noting that these people are also at the highest risk of suffering devastating losses from COVID-19, he said that health systems have collapsed in war-ravaged countries.

“The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war. That is why today, I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives,” the UN chief said.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/un-chief-calls-for-immediate-global-ceasefire-as-coronavirus-fire-rages-on.html
162,24-3-20,Unpacking chocolate at home risky,"Daily tasks such as cutting, tearing or twisting open plastic bottles, chocolate packaging and containers at home also generate small amounts of microplastics — pieces of plastic that pollute the environment and may risk humans, warn researchers.

Microplastics are generally believed to originate directly from industry. For example, as cosmetic exfoliates, or indirectly from the breakdown of larger plastic items over time.

Researchers at the University of Newcastle in Australia monitored the generation of microplastics during the tearing open of chocolate packaging, cutting of sealing tapes and opening of plastic bottle caps.

The generation of microplastics during these processes was confirmed using chemical tests and microscopy, said the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The researchers found that different shapes and sizes of microplastics were generated during tearing or cutting. These included fibres, fragments or triangles, ranging from nanometres to millimetres in size. Fragments and fibres were generated most often.

They estimated that 10 to 30 nanograms (0.00001-0.00003 milligrams) of microplastics may be generated per 300 centimetres of plastic during cutting or twisting, depending on the opening approach and conditions of the plastic, such as stiffness, thickness or density. “Everyday activities such as opening plastic bags and bottles could be additional sources of small quantities of microplastics,” the researchers noted.

However, their risk, possible toxicity and how they may be ingested are not yet resolved and further research into human exposure is needed, the study said.

The finding sends an important warning that we must be careful when opening plastic packaging, if we are concerned about microplastics and care about reducing microplastics contamination.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/unpacking-chocolate-at-home-risky-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/unpacking-chocolate-at-home-risky.html
163,24-3-20,Olympic postponement may be ‘inevitable’: Japan’s PM,"Postponing the Olympics over the coronavirus pandemic may become “inevitable”, Japan’s prime minister conceded on Monday, after the International Olympic Committee said a delay was being considered as pressure grows from athletes and sports bodies.

The comments from Shinzo Abe were his first acknowledgement that the 2020 Games may not open as scheduled on July 24.

For weeks, Japan and Olympic officials have held the line that preparations are moving ahead to hold the Games as scheduled, but there has been increasing pressure from sports federations and athletes whose training has been thrown into turmoil.

On Monday, Abe told parliament that Japan was still committed to hosting a “complete” Games, but added: “If that becomes difficult, in light of considering athletes first, it may become inevitable that we make a decision to postpone.”

“Cancellation is not an option,” Abe said, echoing comments from IOC chief Thomas Bach, who ruled out scrapping the Games, saying it “would not solve any problem and would help nobody”.

The IOC has also shifted its position on the Games, issuing a statement on Sunday saying it was stepping up planning for different scenarios, including postponement.

It said it would hold “detailed discussions” on the “worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement”. A decision should come “within the next four weeks”, the body added.

“Human lives take precedence over everything, including the staging of the Games,” Bach wrote in an open letter to athletes.

But the IOC warned that the logistics of postponing the Games were extremely complicated, with venues potentially unavailable, millions of hotel nights already booked and a packed international sports calendar.

“These are just a few of many, many more challenges.”

The IOC is responsible for making any final decision on the Games, and has come under increasing pressure as the coronavirus crisis grows.

The idea of holding the Games on schedule has drawn a swelling chorus of objections.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/olympic-postponement-may-be----inevitable-----japan---s-pm.html
164,24-3-20,Will wait & watch for a month before any decision: IOA,"The Indian Olympic Association on Monday said it will “wait and watch” for at least a month before taking any call on Tokyo Olympics participation.

“Being the head of IOA, the health and well being of our athletes and officials are of prime concern to me,” IOA President Narinder Batra said.

“Whatever decisions the IOA takes will be for the welfare of our athletes. But right now we are just waiting and monitoring the situation on a daily basis.

“I assure the people that we won’t let anyone down and our decisions will be in the best interest of our athletes,” he added.

IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta put a timeline to this wait and watch approach, saying it would be at least a month before anything is decided.

“We will wait and watch for 4 to 5 weeks and then come to any decision after consultation with the International Olympic Committee and the sports ministry,” Mehta said.

“The situation is not that bad in our country as compared to other nations,” he added.

When contacted and asked if India is also contemplating acting on the lines of Canada, Sports Secretary Radhey Shyam Julaniya said the ministry is not in consultation with anyone at the moment.

“Your question is hypothetical and the govt cannot react to hypothetical questions,” he said.

“We are not in consultation with anyone right now. The ministry can’t keep giving advisories,” Julaniya added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/will-wait---watch-for-a-month-before-any-decision--ioa.html

The International Olympic Committee (IOC), has asked National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to detail the impact of the coronavirus crisis on athletes’ preparation.

“I am personally in touch on regular and continuous basis with Sports Ministry, Sports Authority of India, IOC, NSFs, with athletes through the NSFs and all stake holders regarding the 2020 Olympics and preparations for Olympics,” Batra said.

166,24-3-20,"Canada urges Tokyo Games delay, won’t send team in July","Canadian Olympic officials on Sunday urged postponement of the Tokyo Games, saying that in view of the coronavirus pandemic they won’t send a team in the summer of 2020.

“The Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) and Canadian Paralympic Committee (CPC), backed by their Athletes’ Commissions, National Sports Organizations and the Government of Canada, have made the difficult decision to not send Canadian teams to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2020,” the COC said in a statement that ratchets up the pressure on the International Olympic Committee to postpone the Games scheduled to start on July 24.

IOC president Thomas Bach said a decision on when the Games would take place would be made “within the next four weeks.”

Canadian Olympic and Paralympic authorities, however, said they wouldn’t wait that long, urging the IOC to postpone the Games for one year while offering “our full support in helping navigate all the complexities that rescheduling the Games will bring.

“While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community,” the COC and CPC said.

“This is not solely about athlete health — it is about public health,” their statement added. “With COVID-19 and the associated risks, it is not safe for our athletes, and the health and safety of their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training towards these Games.

“In fact, it runs counter to the public health advice which we urge all Canadians to follow.”

Bach said the IOC was considering “different scenarios,” adding that complete cancellation of the games was not among them.

“We are thankful to the IOC for its assurance that it will not be cancelling the Tokyo 2020 Games and appreciative that it understands the importance of accelerating its decision-making regarding a possible postponement,” the Canadian statement said.

“We also applaud the IOC for acknowledging that safeguarding the health and wellness of nations.

“We remain hopeful that the IOC and IPC will agree with the decision to postpone the Games as a part of our collective responsibility to protect our communities and work to contain the spread of the virus.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/canada-urges-tokyo-games-delay--won---t-send-team-in-july.html

168,24-3-20,Skinner attacks IOC chief,"British track cyclist Callum Skinner has labelled International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach “arrogant” and “stubborn” over the organisation’s approach to the coronavirus pandemic.

Skinner, who won Gold and Silver medals at the 2016 Olympics and is a member of the British Olympic Association’s (BOA) athletes’ commission, was scathing about Bach in a social media post on Monday.

“IOC president Thomas Bach’s stubbornness and arrogance has spectacularly failed in this instance and he has weakened the Olympic movement,” Skinner wrote on Twitter.

“This isn’t the first time he has put his own motives above the athletes and the movement.”

British sprint star Dina Asher-Smith, who won the 200 metres world title last year, said the IOC’s delay created further uncertainty for competitors.

“So wait... Does this mean that athletes face up to another FOUR weeks of finding ways to fit in training — whilst potentially putting ourselves, coaches, support staff and loved ones at risk just to find out they were going to be postponed anyway!!!""

Meanwhile a spokesman for Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, urged the IOC to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.

“Athletes are facing significant uncertainty in the current environment... We want the International Olympic Committee to make a definitive decision soon, to bring clarity to all of those involved,” the spokesman said.

173,24-3-20,Social stars in time of Corona,"With people being advised to stay indoors and shooting having come to a halt, Bollywood is reaching out to fans in different, innovative ways. By Team Viva

Maximum City”, “The City That Never Sleeps” are some of the descriptions that Mumbai attracts. In popular imagination, the metro is synonymous with the film industry which, by default, also gets imbued with the qualities of the city. But with both being intertwined, it is not surprising that with the shutdown in place due to the Coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, Bollywood sits at home — quarantined and ongoing productions have come to an untimely and infinite halt.

However, the people who populate the industry are as tensile as some of the characters that they portray on screen. So when the stars can’t step out of their homes to shoot another blockbuster, what do they do? They’ve fallen back on technology to catch up. And thanks to social media we also get a glimpse into how they are going about keeping social distance at their respective homes.

Priyanka-Nick’s social media mush

Actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas, along with her husband Nick, posted a mushy picture on social media while emphasising on the fact that self-isolation is the need of the hour. The actress can be seen sleeping with her head on Nick’s lap. Their pet dog is sitting and relaxing next to the couple. She captioned the photo, “Stay at home.” On the other hand, Nick shared a video in which the two urged people to stay at home and maintain social distancing.

Deepika’s productivity episodes

Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone is utilising her time at home productively in a time of COVID-19 pandemic. She took to social media and shared a photograph of her wardrobe and said that she is busy cleaning it. “Productivity in the time of COVID-19!? #cleaning #wardrobe,” she captioned it.

She later posted her third productivity episode where she can be seen drinking fruit juice in her nightwear.

Alia’s “me time”

Actor Alia Bhatt took to Instagram to share various pictures of how staying at home at this time is important and can be utilised for completing important chores. One of them was reading a book, which she captioned, “stay home and finish a book.” Alia was reading a book on musician Nitin Sawhney. With the post, she urged her fans to finish the book they have been wanting to for a long time.

She later posted an image of herself looking at the sunset. Utilising the quarantine time to the maximum, she also posted an image of herself which was captioned, “Stay home and take selfies (be)cause a little vanity never hurt anybody.”

Kareena enjoying her newly-joined Instagram

Actor Kareena Kapoor Khan, who recently made her debut on Instagram, said that there could have been no better timing than this as she is able utilise her time to the maximum on social media.

She had earlier shared a glimpse of what the couple’s week ahead would look like. Kareena revealed what the couple would do during their self-isolation period: “Looks like he is ‘booked’ for the week... While I Instagram.” She also shared two photos — one of Saif reading a book peacefully in a candle-lit study room and the other one of the opposite end of the room, where she can be seen using her phone while sitting on a sofa chair.

Her next post was a cheeky selfie with a bookshelf. She can be seen with a French dictionary by Collins Robert among others and wrote dreaming of everybody’s favourite junk, “I just love French fries.”

Kareena and Saif Ali Khan know how to keep Taimur entertained while abiding by Janata Curfew on Sunday, and staying indoors in the wake of coronavirus outbreak. In Kareena’s latest post, she shared a few photographs in which we can see Saif and Taimur planting saplings in their balcony.

Ranveer’s “out of quarantine” look

Bollywood’s livewire star Ranveer Singh shared his “out of quarantine” look. In a photograph that he posted of himself on Instagram, the actor carried dreadlocks and had an intense look. He captioned it, “Me coming out of quarantine.”

An important message by Suriya

Tamil actor Suriya also took to social media to explain to fans the importance and necessity of social distancing. In a brief video, the actor talked about how the Coronavirus is spreading faster than we thought and we can spread awareness about it. Referencing to the Jallikattu and Marina protests, he asked people to stay indoors and take part in this war against Corona. He also said that the death toll in Italy is higher than in China because of the ignorance of people living outside. The actor insisted that we should follow the precautions such as keeping safe distance from one another and washing hands, so that India doesn’t become another Italy.

He also explained that when a person, who carries the virus, travels by train or goes to a public event instead of isolating himself, he passes the virus to everyone around, and they suffer. He added that doctors, government officials have been risking their lives, so we have to be at home to stay healthy. Suriya then quoted a few words from Valluvar’s classic Tamil Language text, The Thirukkural, which says, “Anjuvathu anjamai pethamai (It is foolish to say no to fear).”

Actor Anushka Sharma’s fantasy drama, Phillauri, completed three years on Monday.

Talking about the film, Anushka said, “It was modern and youthful and yet had an underlying cultural and historical reference that connected with people. For a young production house like ours, Phillauri was an attempt to disrupt the content landscape.”

She added, “The film was a daring project for Clean Slate Films. We were giving India its friendly, lovable neighbourhood spirit that the audience had never seen before. From a concept level itself, it was unique. I was pleased to see the reactions to the film.”

‘I've always believed that for an actor, it's very important and integral to try and learn as many art forms as they can in order to make their performance an overall success. I consider myself very lucky that the people and this industry have given me so much appreciation for my dance work.’

Turner slams Evangeline Lilly

Game Of Thrones star Sophie Turner has slammed The Ant-Man And The Wasp star Evangeline Lilly and other people who are not taking the idea of social distancing seriously in the time of Coronavirus outbreak.

“Stay inside, don't be stupid, even if you count your freedom over — I don't know, what is it — your health,” Turner said during an Instagram Live video.

It seemed that Turner was referring to a controversial Instagram post that Lilly made a few days earlier, in which Lilly had said she values her freedom more than the safety measures and isolation that have been suggested to fight the virus.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blazer-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blazer-trend-blazer-2020-03-24.html
175,24-3-20,The pulse of Bengal,"Photographer Sanjay Das documents the State and its myriad representations in culture, art, landscapes and more. By Ayushi Sharma

Photography is perhaps the only art form that captures the present and seals it forever in history. Travel photographer Sanjay Das has chosen to lay particular emphasis on the visual storytelling of different parts of India since more than two decades. It has always been an effort to discover the known and unknown facets about this country, he says. However, to do this, one needs to walk off the beaten track which the photographer has done. His objective is to create an imagery that tells a story in texture, and in light and shadow to form a unique blend, which is spiritually as well as mentally rewarding.

Bengal has deeply inspired him time and again. For almost nine years now, since his first visit, he keeps going back to the region. Taking local boats and animal carts to reach the nooks and crevices of the fascinating land that holds many surprises, he says that he always prefers to travel by road. Be it landscapes, water, people, dialects, architecture, interiors, crafts, folk paintings, cuisine, textiles or festivals — Bengal is one place where culture is a way of life.

His photographic journey of the State is an endeavour to bring forth the ‘spirit of Bengal’ found in the blend of its land, people, culture and heritage. “It is mesmerising with its long history, cultural legacy and ancient architectural sites and above all, its amiable people and natural beauty. Every place I have visited is a witness to how the locals organically weave their spiritual practices within their everyday activities. The people, their life, occupation, skills, art and craft, tribes, festivals, fairs and rituals, depict the lyrical quality of life, spirit and the pulse of Bengal,” he says.

The state was the richest part of Medieval India and has a long tradition of popular literature, music and drama largely based on Bengali folklore and Hindu epics and Puranas. He tells us, “Rural Bengal takes the lead in keeping the old customs and the associated song and dance forms alive in the modern era. The folk songs and dances deal with a variety of themes. While some are associated with religion, prayers, festivals and rituals, others talk about society at large, and yet others bring religious epics to life.”

His focus as a photographer is to search and document unique images that present the State as a pulsating tapestry of life, interwoven together with different ethnicity, culture, religion, languages and a diverse landscape — flanked by the Himalayas in the North, the lush Gangetic plains in the central part and the deltas and beaches in the South before the myriad tributaries and distributaries of Ganga finally drain into the Bay of Bengal forming a unique biosphere, the Sunderbans.

“Many of my images have depicted how devotion and spirituality exist as a way of life in Bengal, in its lanes and by-lanes, through its sublime culture, inherently religious people and rituals that are in harmony with nature. Be it the different religions all-assimilating into one or the lovely cultural events that seem to make up the glorious state that it is. The images of Bengal’s Architectural influences from different eras are seen in its various temples, mosques, churches, rajbaris (home of the aristocratic people in the olden times) meticulously documented by me,” he says.

“The water line forms an integral part of Bengal with its many rivers, Ganga delta and Bay of Bengal. The Hooghly, the lifeline of millions of people who live along its bank, dramatically changes the landscape, with wonderful lush green fertile flood plains of the golden Bengal. I have captured many moments of this fascinating river that flows into the Bay of Bengal from the Himalayas where it is alive with people bathing on its banks, pounding their clothes on flat rocks to launder them, fishing from boats, towing passengers across or swimming,” adds Das.

He feels that Kolkata is, indeed, a unique blend of past and the throbbing vitality of a metropolis of teeming millions. “The city, with its centuries-old heritage buildings, is brimming with life and looks like a medley of colours and sounds. Roads are thickly populated with yellow taxis, the rickshaw-pullers, trams, buses, cars, cycles and people. Here, life never comes to a standstill, except for the noisy impasse created by the traffic jams,” Das tells us.

The photographs have been taken in monochrome as he feels that it gives them a nostalgic feel of the yesteryears. However, in a span of nine years, “during the time I was doing my survey and research on Bengal, I have witnessed the changes the State has undergone,” he says and adds, “In a few years, many of these facets will be reduced to dust, and with that we lose an essential part of our pristine glory. Therefore, as a photographer, who wants to keep alive the stories and unique elements for posterity, it is my effort to preserve through visual archiving the remains of a glorious past and components of our plush ethnicity. As much as we hope not, this may cease to exist in the years to come. And that is when these archives may help ameliorate the memories of those generations, who may never get to see these images and memories again.

180,24-3-20,Coronavirus: Sonia urges PM to take measures for wage support to construction workers,"Expressing concern over the plight of construction workers after the country-wide lockdown over coronavirus, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce emergency measures, including wage support to those in distress.

In a letter to the prime minister, Gandhi said over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a ""precarious"" future as many of them are stranded in cities and are deprived of livelihood due to the lockdown.

She said the country is in the midst of the worst global pandemic and this has necessitated stringent measures for containment and management of the COVID-19 transmission.

""These measures have led to widespread economic disruptions that had a debilitating impact on the informal sector,"" she noted.

Nearly 500 coronavirus cases have been reported in India so far, according to Health Ministry data on Tuesday.

As cases of the viral infection surged, authorities have put almost the entire country under lockdown, banning gathering of people and suspending road, rail and air traffic till March 31, to check the spread of the deadly coronavirus.

The Congress president said that over the last year, lakhs of migrant workers in major cities across India have left for their home towns and villages fearing a prolonged economic downturn.

""As the second largest employer in India, over 44 million construction workers are now faced with a precarious future. Many are stranded in cities and are deprived of their livelihoods due to the stringent lock down measures,"" Gandhi said.

The Congress chief said several countries around the world, most notably Canada, have announced wage subsidy measures as part of COVID-19 Economic Response Plan.

""Considering the extraordinary circumstance, I request you to consider advising the State Building and other Construction Worker's Welfare Boards to roll out emergency measures, particularly wage support to the construction workers who are in distress,"" Gandhi urged the prime minister.

She said the Building and other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996 provides for various welfare measures for workers.

The Act also provides for constitution of state welfare boards and the constitution of welfare fund, she said, noting that it is reported that the welfare boards collected cess amounting to Rs 49,688.07 crores till March 31, 2019.

She said only an amount of Rs 19,379,922 crore had been spent.

182,24-3-20,MP CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan passes floor test;Cong MLAs absent,"A day after assuming office, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan passed the floor test in the state Assembly on Tuesday by voice vote.

No member of the opposition Congress was present in the House.

As the special session of the state Assembly began, Chouhan moved a one-line proposal to seek trust of the House, which was endorsed by members through the voice vote.

Senior BJP MLA Jagdish Devda, one of the members of the speaker's panel, was on the chair of Speaker.

Two Bahujan Samaj Party MLAs, a legislator of the Samajwadi Party and two independent MLAs - Surendra Singh Shera (Burhanpur) and Vikram Singh Rana (Susner) - also supported the BJP government during the floor test.

There are four independent MLAs in the state, but two of them were absent during the floor test.

The House unanimously passed the trust vote of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government.

Later, Devda adjourned the House till 11 am on March 27.

In the morning, the BJP issued whip to its MLAs to support the trust vote.

Earlier, Kamal Nath resigned as chief minister of the state last week after his government lost majority following the resignation of 22 Congress MLAs.

Chouhan, 61, is now back as Madhya Pradesh chief minister for a record fourth term.

After winning the trust vote, Chouhan took a dim view of the absence of Congress MLAs in the Assembly.

""It is undemocratic on part of the Congress that its members remained absent from the House,"" he told reporters.

However, Congress MLA P C Sharma said Tuesday's trust vote had no meaning.

The BJP government should have sought the trust vote after byelections in 24 Assembly seats lying vacant, the former state minister said.

Chouhan was sworn in as chief minister by Governor Lalji Tandon in a simple ceremony at Raj Bhawan on Monday night.

In the 230-member Assembly, the BJP has 107 legislators. The Congress' strength has reduced to 92 following the resignations of 22 of its MLAs.

At present, 24 seats are lying vacant, reducing the strength of the House to 206. Hence, the majority mark is also reduced to 104.

184,24-3-20,KL ‘right fit’ for No 5 in ODIs,"Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar says young batsman K L Rahul is most suitable for the number five position in the batting order in the ODIs but suggested that the team management must look for batsmen like Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh.

KL Rahul had batted in the middle-order in the home ODIs against Australia in January earlier this year with success. He later continued his fine form in the limited-overs series in New Zealand. Of late, the Karnataka player has also been keeping wickets in the 50-over games.

Manjrekar, who played 37 tests and 74 ODIs, was responding to questions from fans after he asked them “talk cricket” with him on his Twitter page.

He was asked whether India should stick with Rahul at number five in ODIs and does he find other batsmen other than Rahul to be in that position.

To which, Manjrekar, also a known commentator, tweeted, “For the moment he is the right fit. But we must keep looking for a Raina and Yuvi kind of batsman when Rahul eventually moves to the top.”

Yuvraj, who played 304 ODIs for India, scored 8,701 runs while Raina amassed 5,615 runs from 226 ODIs.

The former Mumbai batsman was also asked who he thinks was the right choice for number four and all-rounder’s spot in the T20 World Cup to be held in Australia.

185,24-3-20,No F1 race until mid-June,"The Azerbaijan Grand Prix was postponed on Monday because of the coronavirus outbreak, delaying the start of the Formula One season until the middle of June at the earliest.

The first eight races of the 2020 season have now been either postponed or canceled.

The race at the Baku City Circuit was scheduled for June 7 but has been called off after discussions between governing body FIA and the local government.

“This comes as a direct result of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic and has been based entirely on the expert guidance provided to us by the relevant authorities,” organizers said in a statement.

They said a new race date would be announced for later in the season.

F1 races have been staged in Azerbaijan since 2017.

The next race scheduled after Azerbaijan is in Canada on June 14.

186,24-3-20,Infantino eyes reboot for football to avoid crisis,"The future of football could be fewer games and fewer top competitions to help avoid a financial crisis, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a newspaper interview published on Monday.

With football around the world in near-total shutdown and no end in sight because of the coronavirus pandemic, Infantino said the sport risked going into recession.

“Maybe we can reform world football by taking a step back,” Infantino said in the interview with Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport published on his 50th birthday.

“There needs to be an evaluation of the global impact,” the FIFA president said. “Let’s all together save football from a crisis that risks becoming irreversible.”

Infantino said different formats could be an answer, with “fewer, but more interesting tournaments. Maybe fewer squads, but more balance. Fewer, but more competitive, matches to safeguard the health of the players.”

Before the pandemic, Infantino added to the congested football calendar by expanding the World Cup from 32 to 48 teams for the 2026 edition, and by trying to launch a 24-team Club World Cup next year.

The inaugural edition of the latter tournament in China was delayed last week after UEFA and South American football body CONMEBOL postponed their championships by one year to 2021. That was to give domestic leagues time to try to finish their seasons.

The shutdown means there are already too few dates in the FIFA-managed calendar to complete the scheduled qualification paths for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The pressure now on football stakeholders — many with conflicting interests — is likely to force a debate on the squeezed schedule that the pandemic has exposed.

Some influential clubs in Europe are pushing to get more guaranteed games in a bigger Champions League, and 20-team top leagues could be under pressure to make cuts. Those include leagues in England, Spain and Italy.

“It’s not science fiction. Let’s discuss it,” Infantino said about the possibility of changing football calendars.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/infantino-eyes-reboot-for-football-to-avoid-crisis.html

The postponement of the championships, as well as the cancellation of season-opening Indian Grand Prix series, was reported on Thursday and AFI made the official announcement on Monday.

“The competition committee of AFI on Monday decided to postpone the 24th Federation Cup National Senior Athletics Championships 2020 due to the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,” the AFI said in a release.

“As of now, we have not discussed what will be the new dates for Indian Grand Prix competitions and Federation Cup.”

Earlier, AFI had to postpone its season-opener Indian Grand Prix series which was scheduled to be held at three different venues — Patiala (March 20), Sangrur (March 25) and New Delhi (March 29).",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/afi-confirms-postponement-of-fed-cup-c-ships.html
188,24-3-20,Aus tells athletes to prepare for 2021,"Australian Olympic officials said on Monday “it was clear” the Tokyo Games could not go ahead as scheduled this year and told its athletes to instead prepare for the event in 2021.

The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) convened a board meeting on Monday and unanimously decided a Games starting in July was not possible given the uncertainty around the pandemic.

“It’s clear the Games can’t be held in July,” Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman said.

“Our athletes have been magnificent in their positive attitude to training and preparing, but the stress and uncertainty has been extremely challenging for them.”

AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said athletes needed certainty, and they must also prioritise their health and that of their families.

The board meeting decided an Australian team “could not be assembled in the changing circumstances at home and abroad” and they should now plan for an Olympics in the northern hemisphere summer next year.

“We have athletes based overseas, training at central locations around Australia as teams and managing their own programmes. With travel and other restrictions this becomes an untenable situation,” he said.

“The IOC had adopted the key principles of putting athlete health first and ensuring it acted in their best interests and the interests of sport. This decision reflects those principles.

“We are now in a position where we can plan with greater certainty.”

Chesterman said postponing the Games until next year “will allow athletes from around the world to properly prepare with the hope the coronavirus crisis will be under control”.

“We are aware that for many such a postponement will present a range of new issues. But when the world does come together at the Tokyo Olympic Games they can be a true celebration of sport and humanity,” he said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/aus-tells-athletes-to-prepare-for-2021-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/aus-tells-athletes-to-prepare-for-2021.html

Deputy Commissioner of Police R. P. Meena said, ""Police requested them to vacate the place but they refused. So, police cleared the area and detained a few protesters.""

The Delhi Police also said, ""All protest sites have been cleared -- Jaffrabad, Jamia and Turkman Gate. Some persons detained in all these places as well.""

The agitation at Shaheen Bagh was going on since December 15 after the police action in Jamia Millia where police used force against the anti-CAA protesters in which many students were injured allegedly.

Shaheen Bagh had become a symbol of anti-CAA protest and was replicated in some other parts. However, amid the fear of spread of the COVID-19 spread, protests in other places were called off.

Journalists from 14 locations, comprising both national and regional media representing 11 languages, interacted with the Prime Minister.

192,24-3-20,Delhi Budget sets aside Rs 50 cr to combat virus,"The Delhi Assembly passed Rs 65,000-crore Budget for the 2020-21 financial year on Monday, with the Government setting aside Rs 50 crore to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

Presenting the Budget for the sixth consecutive time in the Assembly, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the Delhi Government will implement the Ayushman Bharat Yojana of the Centre in Delhi.

The Budget focussed on the education, health and transport sectors, which Sisodia said were important areas in the Kejriwal model of governance.

“The Government is providing health care services to Delhiites through 451 Aam Aadmi Mohalla Clinics, 24 polyclinics and 36 multi-specialty/super-specialty hospitals. Ninety-four polyclinics are being established by way of up-gradation of existing dispensaries,” said Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio.

The number of Mohalla Clinics will also be increased to 1,000, he said, adding that an outlay of ? 365 crore for Mohalla Clinic and Polyclinic was made in 2020-21.

Explaining about the health projects under the AAP in Delhi, he said the Government has started the work of upgrading and expanding existing hospitals and construction of new hospitals to increase the bed capacity from 10,000 beds to 26,000 beds.

“An outlay of Rs 724 crore is proposed in 2020-21 to build new hospitals and upgradation of 16 existing Government hospitals.

The SC said overcrowding of prisons is a matter of serious concern, particularly in the present context of coronavirus.

In regard to the provisions of Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it has become imperative to ensure that the spread of coronavirus within the prisons is controlled, the court said.

A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices LN Rao and Surya Kant said the State or UT could consider the release of prisoners who have been convicted or are undertrial for offences for which prescribed punishment is up to 7 years or less, with or without fine and the prisoner has been convicted for a lesser number of years than the maximum.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/sc--release-prisoners-on-parole-bail-to-unclog-jails.html
194,24-3-20,ICMR OK’s anti-malarial drug for high-risk cases,"The National Task force for COVID-19 led by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday gave its nod for the use of anti-malarial medicine hydroxylchloroquine as prophylaxis (preventive drug) for the coronavirus infection for high risk cases albeit with precautions. The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) has approved it for “restricted use in emergency situations”.

The drug cannot be given for general use and one must not self-administer, said ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava when it was brought to his notice that people are rushing to hoard it.

Meanwhile, in the wake of rising cases of coronavirus in the country, the ICMR has also put on fast-track the process of giving approval to kit manufacturers for testing suspected coronavirus (COVID-19) cases.

In a press briefing here on Monday, Dr Bhargava said the hydroxyl-chloroquine compound is recommended only for a healthcare worker who is treating a Covid-19 patient. “Secondly, it’s recommended only for persons staying and caring for a household positive patient. They can take that only for prophylaxis, only for prevention,” he added.

ICMR has, however, cautioned the States that placing of healthcare workers under chemoprophylaxis with hydroxy-chloroquine should not instill a sense of false security and that they should simultaneously follow all prescribed public health measures such as frequent washing of hands, respiratory etiquette, keeping a distance of minimum one metre and use of personal protective equipment (wherever applicable).

In an advisory issued to the States, the ICMR said that the high risk contacts of a positive case placed under chemo prophylaxis should remain in home quarantine while on prophylactic therapy. As recommended by the task force, the drug should only be given on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner, it added.

Apart from the symptoms of Covid-19 (fever, cough, breathing difficulty), if the person on chemoprophylaxis develops any other symptoms, he should immediately seek medical treatment from the medical practitioner who has prescribed the chemoprophylaxis, said the advisory.

The health authorities are pinning hopes on hydroxyl-chloroquine amidst studies reporting its positive results. For instance, researchers in France have published a study in which they treated 20 Covid-19 patients with hydroxyl-chloroquine. They concluded that the drug significantly reduced viral load in nasal swabs. But it was not a randomised controlled trial and it didn’t report clinical outcomes such as deaths, according to the journal Science of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/icmr-ok---s-anti-malarial-drug-for-high-risk-cases-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/icmr-ok---s-anti-malarial-drug-for-high-risk-cases.html
195,24-3-20,Curfew passes must for essential travel in Delhi,"In the wake of coronavirus outbreak, the Delhi Police on Monday evening sealed its border as the execution of the prohibitory orders in the national Capital was not up to the mark during the day. Police said people associated with essential services will be issued curfew passes.

On Sunday, the police imposed prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC in Delhi till March 31 in view of the coronavirus outbreak, banning protests, and other gatherings.

According to the order, persons private sector staff who are engaged in essential services in Delhi, their respective organisations shall seek curfew passes from the office of Deputy Commissioner of Police in which the organisation is located.

Those private organisations which are located outside the national capital in the neibhouring districts may similarly seek curfew passes for those employees who commute from Delhi to the neibhouring districts from the office of DCP of districts: Southwest, Southeast, Shahdara, East, Outer-North or Outer districts of the Delhi Police.

The Government officials who are engaged in essential services will be permitted on the basis of identify cards. For employees of private complaines to whom the essential service is outsourced by Government, the movement shall be permitted on the basis of identify card and authorisation issues by the concerned Government organisation, the order stated.

“Strict checking shall be done at the border pickets and internal pickets within the city in every police station area to ensure that no gathering or movement takes place in contravention of the prohibitory orders,” the order further stated.

196,24-3-20,Markets suffer ‘end of world’ syndrome,"An “end of the world” syndrome gripped the stock market on Monday, and currency shared the panic. The key indices saw the biggest single day fall in the history even as the Rupee touched a new low, breaching 76 levels for the first time on intra-day basis.

The BSE benchmark Sensex sunk 3,935 points or 13. 15 per cent to close at 25,981.24; while the NSE Nifty cracked 1,135.20 points or 12.98% to settle at 7,610.25.

By all yardsticks, this was an unprecedented fall even considering the continuing sell-off in the global indices after the outbreak of the deadly coronavirus. While the Indian market crashed by nearly 13 per cent — Sensex shedding more than 4000 points one time — the Asian indices were lower by 3 to 7 per cent and Europe traded in the same range. It was obvious that the foreign investors were dumping Indian stocks without considering the relatively cheaper valuations.

The absence of any fiscal stimulus by the Government has accented the freefall in the India market, which has come down by nearly 40 per cent from its peak. The banking sector has seen the biggest sell-off amid fear of rising NPA in the coming quarters due to the “lockdown”. Take the case of a company like Axis Bank. The share plummeted by as much 29 per cent in a single day, before registering a symbolic recovery. The stock closed at Rs 308, compared to Rs 760 it reached six weeks ago.

SBI, ICICI bank, Indusind Bank and HDFC Bank suffered the same carnage. Reliance Industry, Bajaj Finance, Maruti and L&T tanked by more than 10 per cent.

In the very first hour of trade on Monday, trading on the BSE and the NSE had to be halted after the benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty hit the 10 per cent lower circuit breaker. As trading resumed after a 45-minute freeze, losses widened on bourses due to unabated sell-offs across sectors.

Global stocks too roiled after nations across the world announced lockdowns in an effort to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 pandemic, spiking fears of a mammoth global recession.

All sectoral indices ended significantly lower, with BSE Bankex, finance, capital goods, basic materials, industrials and auto indices plunging up to 16.82 per cent.

Broader midcap and smallcap indices tanked over 12 per cent each. Further measures and lockdowns are expected after manufacturing companies indicated that they would shut down their facilities, which would have an overall impact on business activity and market confidence, he added.

Meanwhile, S&P Global Ratings on Monday cut its estimate for India’s GDP growth for the next fiscal to 5.2 per cent from its earlier estimate of 6.5 per cent, which further worsened the market sentiment that has been already reeling under the coronavirus spread.

In the global market, bourses in China, Hong Kong and South Korea plunged up to 5 per cent, while those in Japan ended on a positive note. Bourses in Europe sank up to 4 per cent. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil futures dropped 5.30 per cent to USD 25.55 per barrel.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/markets-suffer----end-of-world----syndrome-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/markets-suffer----end-of-world----syndrome.html
197,24-3-20,Lockdown violators to face legal action,"The country-wide lockdown announced by the Government to prevent “community spread” of coronavirus was flouted by a section of people in different cities, including Delhi, prompting the Centre to direct State Governments to strictly enforce the orders and take immediate legal action against violators.

While Punjab, Maharashtra and Puducherry have imposed curfew to enforce the lockdown, some other States have promulgated section 144 to prevent gathering and to ensure “social distancing”.

The flagrant violation of the “lockdown” was observed in various cities around vegetable markets, grocery stores and kiosks. The self-quarantine sought by the Government lost its meaning as hordes of people, including motorists, who were not part of the essential services, kept asking policemen to allow them to move to their respective destinations.

The lack of clarity to implement orders to the police further allowed people to break self-restraint and go out with impunity.

In Delhi, West Bengal, Haryana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh people were seen standing in long queues purchasing vegetables and other items of daily use in complete violation of the “corona-curfew”.

Meanwhile, the Gurugram district administration on Monday made it mandatory for foreigners and travellers coming from abroad to stay in quarantine for a period prescribed by the district health department. “Whether it is a home quarantine or a quarantine facility built elsewhere, they must keep themselves in quarantine,” said a health official.

According to the spokesperson of the district administration, it is necessary for the people of the district who are coming from abroad to keep themselves in quarantine and if they see symptoms of Covid-19 then they will be kept in isolation.

“Action can be taken against those who are not living in quarantine as per rules. There is a provision of punishment of 2 to 6 months in such rules for such people,” said the spokesperson of the district administration.

He said till March 31, the Gurugram district has been locked down. During this time, if a person violates the rules laid down under the lockdown situation, then action will be taken against him under Section 269 of the IPC

“The district administration has appealed to the people to follow the rules during the lockdown and not to leave the house unnecessarily. People do not come on the streets unless it is very important and try to work from home. Also, to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection, it is necessary that people stay in homes for a few days and do not come in contact with more people,” said a senior administration official.

FIR was filed against 40 people in Ahmedabad for violating Janata Curfew on Sunday. A video of people chanting slogans, dancing and clanging utensils during Janata curfew, which was called as a social distancing measure, had gone viral after which a police case was registered, an official said .Similar scenes were observed in many other States, including the national Capital where police was not scene dispersing the gatherings.

The districts where lockdown was announced included 10 each in Maharashtra and Kerala, six each in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat, five each in Karnataka and Haryana, three each in Tamil Nadu and Punjab.

As people are defying the Government order of lockdown, Punjab and Puducherry Governments have announced curfew so that no one can come out of their houses.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to State Governments to ensure that rules and regulations of the coronavirus lockdown are enforced as he noted that many people are not taking the measure seriously.

“Many people are still not taking the lockdown seriously. Please save yourself, save your family, follow the instructions seriously. I request state Governments to ensure rules and laws are followed,” Modi said in a tweet in Hindi.

As coronavirus cases raced to around 500 mark on Monday, several States announced a complete lockdown till the end of the month.

Commissioner of Police Delhi SN Srivastava said in wake of coronavirus outbreak, section 144 of CrPC has been imposed in Delhi. “We expect that everyone will stay at home other than people related to essential services. Strict action will be taken against those who will not follow the restrictions,” he said.

The lockdown will come into effect from tonight and will continue till March 31st. Other than pharmacies, all other shops timing will be restricted from 7 am to 5 pm, said Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan.

Maharashtra which has turned a hot spot of the virus in the county has announced almost a state-wide curfew. “Compelled to announce a statewide curfew as people were not listening,” said Chief Minister Udhav Thackrey.

In addition to sanitisation of the entire premises, daily motivational lectures are conducted by the Army medical authorities to make people understand the importance of the mandatory quarantine to combat the spread of COVID-19, the spokesperson said.He said the people are enjoying their time by playing games, watching television, praying and utilising the available resources in the wellness facilities.Interestingly, the Kerala Government has decided to allow outlets of the State-run beverages corporation to sell liqour, while shutting down bars across the State in the wake of the spread of COVID-19. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan announced the decision after a COVID-19 review meeting here.”Beverage outlets will remain open, we have had some bad experiences when the Government stopped the sale of liquor. It will create many social issues,” Vijayan told reporters.Coming down against the decision, Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said this shows the Government’s adamant attitude against shutting down all liqour outlets which would push the State further into a dangerous situation.It was only after the realising that the situation was worsening, the Government decided to indefinitely shut down the bars in the State, Chennithala said.In many districts, people were seen queuing up before beverages outlets in large numbers, this would only help in spreading the coronavirus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cases-rise-to-468--toll-mounts-to-9-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cases-rise-to-468--toll-mounts-to-9.html

207,24-3-20,US reduces assistance to Afghanistan over political impasse,"The US has decided to reduce assistance to Afghanistan by $1 billion this year due to the Afghan leadership's failure to form an inclusive government, the Stat Department announced.

In a statement on Monday, the Department said that the US ""deeply regrets"" that Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah had informed US Secretary of State Pompeo, who made a surprise visit to Kabul, that they could not agree on an inclusive government, reports Xinhua news agency.

""We are today announcing a responsible adjustment to our spending in Afghanistan and immediately reducing assistance by $1 billion this year.

""We are prepared to reduce by another $1 billion in 2021,"" said the statement, calling the Afghan leadership's failure as ""a direct threat to US national interest"".

""Should Afghan leaders choose to form an inclusive government that can provide security and participate in the peace process, the US is prepared to support these efforts and revisit the reviews initiated today,"" the statement added.

Following his meeting with Afghan leaders in Kabul on Monday, Pompeo had a brief stay in Doha, Qatar, where he met the Taliban's political chief Mullah Baradar.

Pompeo later told reporters that he had made clear to the Taliban about Washington's expectations over reducing violence in Afghanistan.

Pompeo's surprise trip to Kabul and Doha took place amid a stalemate in peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, as well as an ongoing political turmoil in the conflict-battered country.

On February 18, Afghanistan's Election Commission declared Ghani winner of the presidential election nearly five months after the voting, but his rival Abdullah disputed the result.

Ghani and Abdullah both took oath as President of Afghanistan on March 9.

The US and the Taliban inked a peace deal on February 29 after rounds of marathon talks to end America's longest war in its history, paving the way for the withdrawal of thousands of US troops and facilitating intra-Afghan dialogues to find a negotiated settlement to Afghanistan's lingering crisis.

Under the agreement, the US was to secure the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners within 10 days after signing the peace deal to facilitate direct talks between the militant group and the Afghan government.

In return for the prisoners' release, the Taliban agreed to set free 1,000 Afghan security personnel.

However, the Afghan government refused to release the Taliban detainees, demanding the Taliban group observe the ceasefire and initiate talks with the government ahead of the detainees' release, but the Taliban rejected the condition.

""We're investing in a long-term solution to COVID-19,"" Xinhua news agency quoted Trudeau as saying on Monday at a press conference outside Rideau Cottage where he has been in self-isolation since his wife tested positive for the disease.

""Once there are promising options, Canada needs the capacity to mass produce treatments as quickly as possible.""

The money is being made available to Canadian research and life-science companies and educational bodies across the country, including some who focus on antibody discovery and plant-based vaccines.

Trudeau also announced measures to help Canadian farmers and agri-food businesses amid impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

""We are opening up C$5 billion in additional lending capacity. Starting today, farmers and producers can apply to Farm Credit Canada for the support they need to keep food growing and get it on to our tables,"" said Trudeau.

He reiterated that physical distancing was vital.

""If you choose to ignore that advice, you're not just putting yourself at risk, you're putting others at risk,"" Trudeau said.

""Enough is enough. Go home and stay home. This is what we all need to be doing and we're going to make sure this happens.""

Trudeau said his government has not ruled out any enforcement options and he will have a conference call with the premiers and territorial leaders to discuss continued coordination on quarantine and self-isolation, including providing health equipment.

""The premiers and I will also talk about continuing to move forward with measures to support families and small businesses to ensure our economy rebounds,"" he said.

On Sunday, the Prime Minister had announced that the House of Commons will resume to pass legislation for the financial aid of C$82 billion and other plans.

""She's fine,"" the President said on Monday when asked at a news briefing at the White House about the First Lady's condition. ""Negative, yes,"" he added.

This is the first time the President has confirmed that his wife was not infected with the disease, reports Xinhua news agency.

He himself also tested negative for the virus.

""The First Lady was tested on the same night as President Trump was tested, out of an abundance of caution. The test was negative,"" CNN quoted White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham as saying also on Monday.

Trump underwent the test on March 13.

Some of the others who tested negative for the novel coronavirus in Trump's inner circle were his daughter and senior White House advisor Ivanka Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and his wife Karen Pence.

The Trumps and Pences took the tests following their exposure to foreign officials who have tested positive.

The COVID-19 caseload in the US is over 41,000, the death toll has topped 540 and New York has become the new epicentre with 99 deaths.

210,24-3-20,Trump says unproven coronavirus drugs could be ''gift from God'',"US President Donald Trump on Monday said antimalarial drugs that are under investigation to treat the new coronavirus could be a ""gift from God"" despite scientists warning against the dangers of overhyping unproven medicines.

Trump announced last week his administration was working to dramatically expand access to hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, a related compound, following promising early studies in France and China that found the drugs helped patients suffering from the COVID-19 illness.

Many scientists including Anthony Fauci, the United States' leading infectious disease expert, have urged the public to remain cautious until larger clinical trials validate the smaller studies.

But Trump demonstrated no such restraint at a White House press briefing on Monday.

""The hydroxychloroquine and the Z-Pak, I think as a combination probably is looking very, very good,"" he said.

""There's a real chance that it could have a tremendous impact, it would be a gift from God, if that worked it would be a big game changer,"" he added, quoting the example of a patient who was ill but recovered after taking the drug.

NBC reported that a woman in Arizona, who heard Trump talk about chloroquine, ended up in hospital and her husband died after they took a form of chloroquine she had used to treat her koi fish.

""I saw it sitting on the back shelf and thought, 'Hey, isn't that the stuff they're talking about on TV?'"" NBC quoted the unnamed woman as saying.

Banner Health, a non-profit health care provider based in Phoenix, said on its website that ""a man has died and his wife is under critical care after the couple, both in their 60s, ingested chloroquine phosphate, an additive commonly used at aquariums to clean fish tanks.""

Banner Health warned against self-medicating to treat or prevent the COVID-19 illness.

Trump has been criticised by some in the scientific community for overhyping the drugs -- which could create shortages for Americans who need them to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, diseases for which they are approved.

New York is set to begin a clinical trial on Tuesday that would treat patients with hydroxychloroquine taken together with azithromycin, an antibiotic used to clear secondary bacterial infections.

Separately, Vice President Mike Pence announced that self-administered nasal swab tests for the illness would be made available this week, thus reducing part of the burden on the overstretched health care system.

At present, the test is administered by health care workers wearing personal protective gear which is in short supply.

212,24-3-20,Broadway star Aaron Tveit tests positive for coronavirus,"Broadway actor Aaron Tveit has tested positive for COVID-19.

The 36-year-old actor, who took to social media to share his diagnosis, said he is feeling much better now.

""I'm feeling much better. I consider myself extremely lucky that my symptoms have been very mild -- cold like with no fever -- as so many are experiencing much more serious symptoms, because this is a very dangerous virus, Tveit wrote on Instagram.

The actor said he had been quarantined since Broadway shows shut down on March 12 amid the pandemic.

One thing I have been experiencing is the loss of taste and smell, which I think is a big sign for people who are otherwise asymptotic, he added.

Tveit said he was tested earlier last week and found out the results this Monday, but had quarantined himself even before he went through the medical procedure.

This can affect anyone and even if you aren't feeling sick or showing drastic symptoms please take heed, stay safe, stay healthy and I hope to see everyone at the theater again soon, he said.

Tveit joins a growing list of celebrities that have tested positive for coronavirus, including Idris Elba, Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, Kevin Durant, former Bond girl Olga Kurylenko, ""Frozen 2"" actor Rachel Matthews, Daniel Dae Kim, ""Game of Thrones"" star Kristofer Hivju, veteran Opera singer Placido Domingo and celebrated TV host Andy Cohen.

213,24-3-20,"Coronavirus cases rise to 78 in China, spike in imported infections","China reported 78 new confirmed cases, including 74 imported infections, while the death toll from the novel coronavirus increased to 3,277 after seven more fatalities were confirmed from the COVID-19, health officials said on Tuesday.

The overall confirmed cases on the Chinese mainland have reached 81,171 by the end of Monday. This included 3,277 people who died of the disease, 4,735 patients who were still being treated and 73,159 patients discharged after recovery, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Tuesday.

The NHC said, 78 new confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported on the Chinese mainland on Monday, of which 74 were imported from abroad taking the number of overseas cases to 427.

Also on Monday, seven deaths and 35 new suspected cases were reported on the mainland with all the deaths in Hubei Province.

The total COVID-19 cases in Beijing climbed to 522 with eight deaths prompting local governments of Beijing as well as Shanghai to announce that all overseas arrivals will be subjected to nucleic acid tests to ensure proper detection.

Of the 74 newly imported cases, 31 were reported in Beijing, 14 in Guangdong, nine in Shanghai, five in Fujian, four in Tianjin, three in Jiangsu, two in Zhejiang and Sichuan respectively, and one in Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong and Chongqing respectively, the NHC said.

Beijing is already diverting all international flights to different cities where the passengers will be quarantined for 14 days before arriving in the city.

The NHC said 132 people were still suspected of being infected with the virus.

Coronavirus epicentre Wuhan has reported one confirmed case after a gap of five days prompting officials to begin to ease restrictions.

Wuhan also reported seven new deaths, bringing the total number of deaths in the city and Hubei province for which Wuhan is the capital to 3,160.

The province also saw 444 patients discharged from hospital after recovery on Monday. Among the 4,200 patients being treated in hospital, 1,203 were still in severe condition and another 336 in critical condition, the local health commission said.

By the end of Monday, 356 confirmed cases, including four deaths have been reported in Hong Kong, which has restricted the entry of foreigners into the city. Also a total of 25 confirmed cases were reported in Macao and 195 in Taiwan including two deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reporrted.

After days of decline in coronavirus cases, China on Monday said that COVID-19 has effectively been ""stemmed"" in the country and it started easing severe restrictions imposed on Wuhan's 11 million people who were under lockdown since January 23.

The authorities began relaxing restrictions in Wuhan as it reported no new case for the fifth consecutive day on Monday.

Significantly, the Central Leading Group (CLP), headed by Premier Li Keqiang which is coordinating efforts to contain the virus since January 23, said the virus has been curtailed in the country as well as in Wuhan.

""The meeting noted that the spread of the virus nationwide, particularly in the epicentre of Wuhan, has been effectively stemmed,"" an official statement said on Monday.

The meeting, however, warned that the risks for sporadic infections and localised outbreaks have not gone away. With the pandemic rampaging across the world, the situation remains complex and challenging.

""Wuhan city and Hubei province should stay focused on medical treatment and community-level containment as the two key priorities. They should continue to treat the severe cases, promptly admit new cases, and advance epidemiological investigations,"" the meeting said.

In Wuhan, officials said people are allowed to go back to work while restrictions on the public transport are gradually being eased.

The Hubei province and its capital Wuhan with over 56 million people were under lockdown since January 23. The vicious virus broke out in city, reportedly at a live animal market in December last year and became virulent inflicting thousands of people in the city and province catching the government off guard.

As the country saw a surge in imported infections, the Chinese government announced that all international flights scheduled to arrive in Beijing will be redirected to airports in 12 other Chinese cities from Monday.

International passengers flying to Beijing will instead land at airports in 12 cities including Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing and Shenyang as their first points of entry, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a statement.

On Monday, China said international travellers should ""think twice"" about choosing Beijing for flight transfer in view of the restrictions.

Starting from Monday, all international flights scheduled to arrive in Beijing will be redirected to airports in 12 other Chinese cities, Liu Haitao, an official with China's National Immigration Administration said.

Passengers would go through entry procedures and quarantine measures at the designated cities' airports before they continue their flights to Beijing, Liu said, urging travellers to reserve enough time for their next flights to make sure that they do not miss their outbound flights.",trending-news,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-78-in-china--spike-in-imported-infections-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/trending-news/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-78-in-china--spike-in-imported-infections.html
214,24-3-20,Living in the times of Corona,"The World Health Organisation has come out with an advisory that busts myths related to COVID-19. PIONEER HEALTH tells you more

Amidst the recent coronavirus outbreak, there are a lot of myths doing rounds among people. It is important to clear all the misconceptions and go by the facts to fight the pandemic.

Here are a few myths and facts.

All infected patients need to be admitted.

Home management is appropriate for patients with mild infection who can be adequately isolated in the outpatient setting.

Management of such patients should focus on prevention of transmission to others and monitoring for clinical deterioration, which should prompt hospitalisation.

Outpatients with COVID-19 should stay at home and try to separate themselves from other people and animals in the household. They should wear a facemask when in the same room (or vehicle) as other people and when presenting to health care settings. Disinfection of frequently touched surfaces is also important.

There is no definition of “how close is too close”.

The US CDC recommends keeping a distance of six feet from other people to minimize the possibility of infection. (A useful way to think about six feet is that it’s roughly twice the length of the average person’s extended arm.)

Three feet is the distance the W.H.O. emphasises as particularly risky when standing near a person who is coughing or sneezing.

Still, other public health experts say that at this crucial moment, when the world still has an opportunity to slow the transmission of the coronavirus, any number of feet is too close. By cutting out all but essential in-person interactions, we can help flatten the curve, they say, keeping the number of sick people to levels that medical providers can manage.

Prolonged contact is required with an infected person

It’s not yet clear, but most experts agree that more time equals more risk.

The virus cannot last on a bus pole, a touch screen

After numerous people who attended a Buddhist temple in Hong Kong fell ill, the city’s Center for Health Protection collected samples from the site. Restroom faucets and the cloth covers over Buddhist texts tested positive for the coronavirus.

A recent study found that it could live for three days on plastic and steel. If you are ordering lots of supplies online, you may be relieved to know that the virus did poorly on cardboard — it disintegrated over the course of a day. It survived for about four hours on copper

Dirty surfaces are more likely to keep the virus.

No, whether a surface looks dirty or clean is irrelevant. If an infected person sneezed and a droplet landed on a surface, a person who then touched that surface could pick it up. How much is required to infect a person is unclear.

But as long as you wash your hands before touching your face, you should be ok, because viral droplets don’t pass through skin.

Buy a good brand soap.

No, the brand or type of soap does not matter.

My coughing neighbour cannot cause infection in me.

No. An infected neighbor might sneeze on a railing and if you touched it, you would get it.

Virus particles can cross the glasses.

No. There is no evidence that viral particles can go through walls or glass as suggested by a doctor.

AC is dangerous.

We are more concerned about the dangers posed by common spaces than those posed by vents, provided there is good air circulation in a room.

Dog or cat cannot join me in quarantine.

Professor Whittaker, who has studied the spread of coronaviruses in animals and humans, said that he had seen no evidence that people who have the virus could be a danger to their pets

Sex is safe.

Kissing could spread it. Though coronaviruses are not typically sexually transmitted, it’s too soon to know.

Virus can move freely.

A naked virus can’t go anywhere unless it’s hitching a ride with a droplet of mucus or saliva, said Kin-on Kwok, a professor at the Jockey Club School of Public Health and Primary Care at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

These mucus and saliva droplets are ejected from the mouth or the nose as we cough, sneeze, laugh, sing, breathe and talk. If they don’t hit something along the way, they typically land on the floor or the ground. When the virus becomes suspended in droplets smaller than five micrometres — known as aerosols — it can stay suspended for about a half-hour.

Face to face eating is safe.

No, to gain access to your cells, the viral droplets must enter through the eyes, the nose or the mouth. Sneezing and coughing are most likely the primary forms of transmission. Talking loudly face-to-face or sharing a meal with someone could pose a risk.

If you can smell what someone had for lunch — you are inhaling what they are breathing out, including any virus in their breath.

The virus is smart, it makes the nose loose the small, so to experience the smell you inhale deeply.

There are no predictors of transmission

There are four factors that likely play a role: how close you get; how long you are near the person; whether that person projects viral droplets on you; and how much you touch your face.

216,24-3-20,Special care for elderly,"At a time like this, with the threat of coronavirus disrupting our lives, it is very important that the elderly keep themselves safe, as they are easily targeted as their immunity is impaired.

The following precautions need to be taken:

They should wash their hands frequently: Old people tend to hold things a lot more than young people like grabbing railings for support, holding people’s hands to help them climb up and down stairs, or to walk, to sit down and sometimes even go to the bathroom. It is very important that they wash their hands with soap for 20 second.If they are unable to wash their hands themselves, they must be washed by someone at all times, especially if they have returned from the doctor or a hospital.

Sometimes old people tend to forget to wash their hands, in that case, they need to be reminded to do so by either the nurses or the maids looking after them as they do not have children/relatives around.

The staff must also be trained to wash their own hands frequently as they are looking after someone who is vulnerable and prone to the Coronavirus.

They must be dissuaded from going out of the house: Some geriatrics want to go meet their friends in the garden or go out to houses of friends. This has to be discouraged by the staff looking after him/her. The only place they should be allowed to go to, are doctors and only if it's an emergency.

In case they do need to go out, they must be made to wash their hands with soap as soon as they return. Unfortunately, many of the elderly suffer from diabetes or hypertension and this attracts the virus to these diseases.

Medication given on time : All medication to the elderly must be given on time, especially the medications for diabetes and hypertension as these diseases make the old people far more vulnerable to the virus as the coronavirus tends to attack people with these diseases even more than others.

: All medication to the elderly must be given on time, especially the medications for diabetes and hypertension as these diseases make the old people far more vulnerable to the virus as the coronavirus tends to attack people with these diseases even more than others. Hydration and nutrition: Geriatrics must be given anything form of hot water, like soup, tea or coffee from time to time as their respiratory system needs to be unclogged and free so that the Corona Virus does not affect them.

217,24-3-20,Docyard : Build your immunity,"Turmeric has powerful anti–inflammatory effects and is a strong antioxidant. It is a natural way to help boost the immune system by increasing the immune modulating capacity of the body

Since New Year eve, China has reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia from Wuhan associated with seafood, which was later diagnosed to be associated with novel coronavirus. Around 10,000 persons were reported to be infectious which includes 17 healthcare professionals and the casualties have been reported to be over 200 within a month.

While the virus is common in different species of animals, it has now spread to humans through close contacts via respiratory droplets generated through sneezing or coughing. While there is a misconception that the virus only spreads through symptomatic infectants, many such cases have been recorded where the virus has been transmitted through asymptomatic infectants also. It is thus the foremost priority to seek primary prevention through keeping self-hygiene. Always wash your hands with soap or alcohol-based rub and seek immediate medical advice in case of flu-like symptoms for ruling out the condition. Though Indians usually do not prefer to consume under cooked or raw meat/ animal products, still avoid any type of animal product.

Vitamin C as a immunity booster: Vitamin C is an immunity booster. Along with the supplements, it also advisable to do warm saline gargles regularly, because the coronavirus tries to remain in the throat for around two-three days, so if you are cleaning your throat regularly , your things are going to be on a better side.

220,24-3-20,Keep anxiety at bay,"There is a fear pychosis due to COVID-19. ARCHANA JYOTI speaks with doctors who say there is no need for panic

Fortythree-year-old Sunandita Dasgupta, a Government servant in Delhi, has been freaking out about the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) since last few days. “I have Early Onset Parkinson’s Disease which makes me prone to anxiety, but it is manageable. However, in the last few days it was going out of control, affecting my daily activities and worsening my physical condition. Moreover, I was feeling nervous with the flood of information on all media platforms,” she says.

It started with panic and before deeper anxiety set in, she decided to take professional help.

“I sought help of a counsellor who suggested a few methods to control my thoughts. Now, I am taking recourse to yoga, progressive muscle relaxation and other such techniques to reduce anxiety,” she says adding that she’s much settled now.

Sunandita’s is not the lone case of fear psychosis amidst the coronavirus scare in India. With cities after cities under unprecedented lockdown, and a major part of the earth’s population being in self-isolation, whether with families or individually, health professionals feel that a large number of people can go through mental health issues, mainly caused by fear and uncertainty. So far COVID-19 has infected over 3,82,000 people and claimed more than 18,000 lives.

Experts say that generally, the cause of a medical condition isn’t relevant, what matters is the condition itself. It’s likely that most people won’t require doctor’s help under these circumstances; but those who are mentally finding tough to deal with the situation because of stress, then they must seek professional help like Sunandita did.

Dr RC Jiloha, Professor of Psychiatry, Hamdard Institute of Medical sciences & Research, Delhi opines that pandemics are not just a medical phenomenon. They affect individuals and society on many levels, causing disruptions such as panic and stress. As concerns over the perceived threat grow, people may start to collect (and hoard) masks and other medical supplies. This is often followed by anxiety-related behaviours, sleep disturbances, and overall lower perceived state of health. Individuals with mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of widespread panic and threat.

He says, social distancing and self-quarantine, especially for the children and elderly may bring a feeling of ostracism, abandonment and being neglected. This can make an already challenging situation far more difficult for the elderly people, particularly for those who have co-morbidity conditions, are victims of depression or other mental health problems.

However, there are ways to tackle the rise in panic accompanying COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. For instance, says Dr Smita Deshpande, Professor of Psychiatry at Dr RML hospital, Delhi, one should take break from watching TV, reading or listening to news items, including social media. “Go for the facts. But don’t overdo it. Eat healthy food, maintain regular routine and try to do what you like or planning to do for a long time but were not getting time. Talk to people you trust about your concerns and feelings.”

She asserts that meditation and yoga can help people come out of such negative thoughts in this crucial time. She cautions people not to take any anti-depressant medicines without doctors’ recommendations.

“Those already on medication, should continue taking medicine as situations will certainly improve with the passage of time,” she tells you. “Also, tele-consultation facilities for the patients reeling under anxiety or facing mental health problems should be made available. More so, when OPDs in most of the hospitals are being shut down,” suggests Dr Deshpande, saying that she has already written to the Union Health Ministry in this regard. .

Daniel Freeman, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oxford sums up: “We have to accept that no action is 100% risk-free and that we can’t totally control events, no matter how much we try. No matter how much we worry, we can’t know what’s in store for us. And we can’t prevent problems happening just by worrying about them. In the end, it is best to concentrate on what is meaningful in our lives.

“Notice the worry, acknowledge it, but don’t allow it to distract you. Stay as calm as you can, focus on what you’re doing and not what you’re thinking, and watch the worry recede into the distance.”",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/keep-anxiety-at-bay.html

237,24-3-20,"Global death toll from coronavirus nears 17,000","The number of deaths around the world from the novel coronavirus cases stood at 16,961, according to a tally compiled by AFP on Tuesday from official sources.

239,24-3-20,US could overtake Europe as coronavirus epicentre: WHO,"The COVID-19 outbreak in the United States has the potential to exceed that in Europe, the World Health Organization (WHO) said Tuesday as the number of reported US cases surges.

The pandemic began in China in December but the epicentre has since shifted from Asia to Europe. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters during a virtual press conference that 85 percent of the new cases reported to the global body overnight had come from Europe and the United States, now the two ""main drivers of the outbreak"".

The latest WHO coronavirus daily situation report -- published late Monday, before the overnight figures -- showed that Europe reported 20,131 new cases in the preceding 24 hours, while the United States reported 16,354, more than doubling its total caseload.

Asked whether the United States could overtake Europe as the epicentre of COVID-19, Harris said: ""We are now seeing a very large acceleration in the number of cases from the US, so it does have that potential.

""We cannot say that that is the case yet but it does have that potential.

""They have a very large outbreak and an outbreak increasing in intensity."" The WHO's Monday daily update showed European countries with 171,424 total infections and 8,743 deaths (up 1,318), while the United States reported a total of 31,573 infections and 402 fatalities (up 201).

Harris said that due to the incubation period, the rise in case numbers reflected a surge in transmissions taking place up to five days prior.

""Each individual infecting two to three other people takes about three to five days, so we're seeing what happened three or four days ago, or five days ago in many countries,"" Harris explained.

The numbers show that in the United States, ""a week ago there was a lot of transmission"". Despite the surging case numbers, Harris said there were also some ""very big positives"" emerging from America. ""Testing is being ramped up; there are more efforts to isolate, care for every confirmed case and trace and quarantine people,"" she said.

""And also a very, very strong community mobilisation. There are some extremely heartwarming and fantastic stories coming out of the US about what people are doing for each other."" According to an AFP tally compiled at 1100 GMT Tuesday from official sources, COVID-19 has now infected more than 386,000 people worldwide, and killed nearly 17,000 of them since the outbreak began.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/us-could-overtake-europe-as-coronavirus-epicentre--who-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/us-could-overtake-europe-as-coronavirus-epicentre--who.html
240,24-3-20,Global airline industry to lose $252 billion in 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic: IATA,"Amid coronavirus pandemic, global airlines body IATA said on Tuesday that the airlines would face USD 252 billion-loss of passenger revenue in 2020, which would be 44 per cent lower than 2019 figures.

""On March 5, we thought that the pessimistic scenario was a revenue loss of USD 113 billion. That was based on wide spreading of COVID-19, but not as severe as the current blanket of travel restrictions,"" said Alexandre De Juniac, Director General, International Air Transport Association (IATA).

He told reporters in a conference call that ""if this lasts for a three-month period, we see a 38 per cent fall in global demand and a USD 252 billion loss of passenger revenue—44 per cent down on 2019"".

International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents around 290 airlines comprising 82 per cent of the global air traffic.

India has banned international flights for a period of one week from Sunday. Moreover, there would be no domestic flights in India from Tuesday midnight to March 31.

""IATA has been asking governments to provide a lifeline of financial support. A liquidity crisis is coming at full speed. Revenues have fallen off a cliff,"" Juniac told reporters.

""And no amount of cost cutting can save the day if no cash is coming in the door. Without financial relief airlines will go bust. And that could happen en masse,"" he added.

In India, GoAir has laid off its expat pilots, introduced leave without pay for its employees and announced paycut of up to 50 per cent for its top leadership.

IndiGo has announced a pay cut of up to 25 per cent for its senior employees. Air India has stated that due to ""insurmountable dip"" in revenues, it will cut allowances of all employees -- except cabin crew members -- by 10 per cent for next three months.

IATA's Chief Economist Brian Pearce told reporters in the conference call, ""We have never had a situation when a global epidemic has coincided with a recession. This means that recovery would be gradual whenever the travel restrictions are removed, which we expect to happen in the next few months. The recovery would not be quick.""

Apart of top 30 airlines in the world, the rest of the airline industry has high debt levels, Pearce noted.",special,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/global-airline-industry-to-lose--252-billion-in-2020-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic--iata-2020-03-24.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/special/global-airline-industry-to-lose--252-billion-in-2020-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic--iata.html

246,24-3-20,Pune-based firm develops testing kit for faster confirmation of COVID-19 cases,"In what may go down as an important solution in India's fight against coronavirus, Pune-based Mylabs Discovery Solutions has created an indigenous solution to test patients for COVID-19 that can halve the time taken for results.

The molecular diagnostic company, which received statutory approvals late on Monday from authorities, can manufacture over 15,000 testing kits per day from its facility at Lonavala in Pune district and the same will be ramped up to 25,000 kits per day, its co-founder Shrikant Patole told PTI.

Citing the experience in South Korea, the World Health Organisation has been stressing on the importance of tests to fight the pandemic, which has so far claimed nine lives in India.

Though around 500 people have been tested positive for the virus in India so far, experts are bracing for a sharp increase fearing it may have spread across and also point out to a low level of testing in the country.

Patole explained that the company is able to shorten the test time to 2.5 hours with the 'Mylab PathoDetect COVID-19 Qualitative PCR kit' as against the prevalent 6-8 hours because its team has created a solution that does both the screening and confirmation jobs simultaneously.

Its team of 25 scientists started working on the solution six weeks ago, fearing that the crisis may eventually hit India, he said, adding that the company had started as a trading firm in 2012 and diversified into research in 2016.

The test for COVID-19 will also pick up positive cases among asymptomatic patients, Patole said, adding that the approvals from the National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research and Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) were received after a test sampling on patients at Mumbai's Kasturba Hospital which is the nodal location for treating Coronavirus cases.

He did, however, specify the sample size where the kit was used to confirm results.

The Mylab kit was selected along with a solution offered by a German company for the tests.

Patole explained that till now, India has been using kits prepared by the state-run National Institute of Virology (NIV), also based in Pune, but it was the fears over the increase in numbers which made private sector interventions in manufacturing necessary.

The testing kits done by NIV are costing up to Rs 4,500 per sample if we include both screening and confirmation, Patole said, claiming that Mylabs is confident of selling the kits at a fourth of that cost.

He said allowing private labs to conduct tests is essential given the potential threats.

Patole also said that its kit can work within the infrastructure for testing available with Indian diagnostic labs, and does not require any new machinery, which the most imported.

The company is in the process of creating similar test kits for HIV, hepatitis-B and also tuberculosis.

A team of four founders and investors have invested over Rs 25 crore in the company till now and there are no external investors, Patole said.

The company is looking to rope in investors, he added.
