0,10-3-20,Challenge the old order,"It would be presumptuous to think that the Aurat march will cause a major change in the lives of Pakistani women. But it is a step in the right direction

Imaan mujhe roke hai, jo khenche hai mujhe kufr. Kaaba merey peeche hai, kaleesa merey age,” goes a couplet by the renowned poet Mirza Ghalib. We in the Indian subcontinent are living in a transitional era. The passage from a feudal agricultural society to a modern industrial one. At present, we are neither totally feudal nor modern but somewhere in between. A transitional era is a very painful period in society, full of turbulence and strife. If we read the history of Europe when it was passing through its transition from feudal to modern society, that is roughly from the 16th to the 18th centuries, we find that this period was full of turmoil, wars, revolutions, chaotic conditions, intellectual ferment and so on. It was only after going through this fire that modern society emerged in Europe. The Indian subcontinent is presently going through this fire. We are going through a very painful period in our history, which I guess will last another 15-20 years ( it won’t last 300 years, as it did in Europe, because the pace of history has speeded up in view of technical advances). For what is a historic transition? It is a period when the old society is being totally uprooted and torn apart. Can this happen peacefully? One wishes it could but historical experience shows otherwise. The vested interests in the old order always put up a fierce resistance to any fundamental change in the existing social and political order as they feel their interests may be endangered thereby.

One feature of a transitional era is a clash of values. Every social order has its moral and social code, which is destroyed in a great upheaval and replaced by another code. But in the intervening period, that is, in the transitional era, while old values are being challenged and eroded (for instance the caste system, religious fundamentalism, arranged marriages and so on) new values have not yet been put in their place. The whole of society becomes topsy-turvey. As Shakespeare said in Macbeth, “Fair is foul and foul is fair.” In other words, what was regarded good earlier (like the caste system and arranged marriages) is being regarded outdated by the enlightened sections of society (who are against the caste system and in favour of love marriages).

The same is happening in the Indian subcontinent. Modern minded people are challenging casteism, communalism, superstitions, and feudal beliefs and practices. The Aurat (woman) march and its opposition, the Haya (modesty) march, must be seen in this historical context. While the former represents a progressive force in history which seeks to emancipate women and take society forward, the latter represents a reactionary force, which wants to preserve the status quo in society, that is, the feudal values of patriarchy and subordination of women to men.

Mirza Ghalib’s couplet, quoted at the beginning of this article, depicts this situation. In that sher, as in much of Urdu poetry, words are not to be interpreted literally but metaphorically or figuratively. The word “kaaba” in it represents feudal society, while the word “kaleesa” represents modern society. Ghalib wants us to reject feudalism and move forward to a modern society. The transitional era in history is also depicted in a marvel of condensation in the following sher of Firaq Gorakhpuri. “Har zarre par ek kaifiyat-e-neemshabi hai. Ai saaqi-e-dauraan yeh gunaahon ki ghadi hai.” Here the expression “kaifiyat-e-neemshabi” indicates that we are living in an era which is neither night nor day but somewhere in between. In other words, the old social order is partially gone but the new order is not yet in place. Also, the expression “gunaahon ki ghadi” means it is an age of sins. Sins against what? Sins against the old (feudal) code. For instance, the old code required one to marry within one’s own caste and religion and to someone arranged by one’s parents. But the enlightened sections in society are challenging this. The old code required a woman to accept her status as inferior to that of men and always obey the husband but now many women, such as those who participated in the Aurat march, are challenging this and demand equality with men.

It would be presumptuous to think that the Aurat march by itself will cause a fundamental change in the lives of Pakistani women. That will only happen after a revolution, which is many years ahead and will only be attained after a long, arduous struggle against the reactionary elements, in which tremendous sacrifices have to be made. But Aurat march marks an awakening of women, without which no revolution is possible (like the march to Versailles of the Paris women in October 1789, or the demonstrations of the women of St Petersburg on International Women’s Day in Russia which culminated in the February Revolution of 1917). Hence it is of historical significance. No doubt some serious mistakes were made in it, like giving the slogan “mera jism, meri marzi (my body, my wish)” which is liable to be misconstrued and gave ammunition to reactionary elements opposed to women’s emancipation like Maulana Rehman to create public opinion against the march. But mistakes are made in every progressive movement. The important thing is to learn from them and correct them. I am sure my brave sisters of Pakistan will do it. Long live the progressive Aurat march. Down with the reactionary Haya march.

1,10-3-20,Hindi play ‘Bheetari Deewarien’ staged at Shaheed Bhavan,"Why women have to make adjustments in every relationship? She can be treated equal, such thought-provoking messages were given through a Hindi play “Bheetari Deewarien”.

The play was staged at Shaheed Bhavan, marking the closure of Rang Triveni theatre festival. The play was directed by Rajeev Verma and was performed by the artists of Bhopal Theatre Group.

The play itself speaks of social values. Through the play, the message was given that a woman is the most important member of the family. She keeps the family together even after suffering every pain.

The story of the play is woven around Nana and Parvati. Nana does proof-reading work. The elder son Sadashiv works in an insurance company. Middle son Prabha is a drop out, but gets a job. However, he also has the grief to be a drop out. The mother is a victim of family persecution.

Parvati meets Shalini in the temple. Parvati wants to get her married to Sadashiva. He gets ready for marriage, but after a few days he falls in love with Manda. He marries her. Nana expels him from the house. After Nana's death, the responsibility of the family falls on Sadashiva. Shalini helps the family. Parvati is resentful to Manda, she always rebukes him.

To reunite the family, Shalini writes a love letter to Sadashiva and creates conditions that the letter falls into the hands of Manda. Misunderstanding happens between husband and wife. Sadashiv hits his wife.

When Parvati comes to know about this, she remembers the events that happened to her and she stands with Manda.

The mother says that it is not right for a man to torture a wife. As mother-sister-girlfriend and wife, the woman always maintains the family through love, sacrifice, love and sacrifice.

The play was beautifully performed leaving the audience mesmerised.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/hindi-play----bheetari-deewarien----staged-at-shaheed-bhavan.html

5,10-3-20,Independent MLA ‘Shera’ seeks Home Ministry,"Independent MLA Surendra Singh ‘Shera’ who had returned to Madhya Pradesh after four days of stay in Bengaluru, here on Monday demanded Home Ministry for himself.

Shera had earlier claimed he could be a Minister before Holi.

After meeting Finance Minister Tarun Bhanot in Bhopal, the MLA from Burhanpur reposed faith in Congress Government and CM Kamal Nath. He denied any coercive means used against him by anyone.

When asked as why he was meeting Ministers frequently, the MLA claimed he meets Ministers to discuss issues of his region including — potable water, unemployment, weavers’ problems and so on.

When asked if he is offered a Ministerial choice, what would he choose, the former Congressman claimed if offered a choice, he would like to become Home Minister to make police a public-friendly force.

Specifically asked whether Home Minister Bala Bachchan was not performing his duties properly, Shera claimed, “Bala bhai is my old friend and like a brother, but due to lack of capability, he isn’t doing what he is expected to do,” said the MLA triggering a fresh row on Cabinet expansion. Home Minister Bala Bachchan is the one of the most trusted lieutenants of CM Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh.

On Sunday, missing Congress MLA BIsahulal Singh returned to Bhopal with Ministers Bala Bachchan and Surendra Singh Baghel and claimed he was out on a pilgrimage. He candidly accepted that he was saddened after not being offered a Cabinet berth despite being a senior MLA.

On being asked about rumours of him joining BJP, he grinned saying he hasn’t joined BJP all his life so why would he do so in his old age.

Remaining two MLAs Hardeep Singh Dang and Raghuraj Kansana, are yet untraceable.

However, with the return of majority of MLAs barring these two, the imminent threat to Kamal Nath Government has been averted but still both the BJP and Congress are scratching heads for pocketing two of the three vacant Rajya Sabha seats.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/independent-mla----shera----seeks-home-ministry.html

7,10-3-20,Juvenile shelter home attack: 2 girls’ condition deteriorates further,"Condition of two minor girl inmates of juvenile shelter home who were attacked and injured by three minor girl inmates two days ago deteriorated further on Sunday. The case was not registered as the attacking inmates were minor said police.

Incharge of Kamla Nagar police SI Vijay Sisodia said that the two victims were attacked by the three accused minor girls after which the injured girls were taken to hospital. The condition of the one of the minor is reportedly critical.

The matter surfaced after condition of one of the victims went critical as she was strangulated by the attackers but she survived the strangulation.

Kamla Nagar police said that the injured were hospitalized due to severe condition police were informed.

The reason behind the attack was to maintain dominance at the shelter home.

The attackers were old inmates while the injured were latest entrants and possibly due to opposing to accept the dominance a fight broke out. The attackers tried to strangulate the victim in the attack.

Out of the victims and attackers none is a serious offender and have been booked for minor offences like drug addiction and other crimes.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/juvenile-shelter-home-attack--2-girls----condition-deteriorates-further.html
8,10-3-20,Trees give life to life-giving Ganga,"Forests are the most significant players in the life of a river and their health, density and composition are vital for maintaining its food web. Hence, in any Ganga restoration plan, the role of trees has to be appreciated and should be an integral component

If the Ganga dies, India dies,” says Vandana Shiva, a prominent scientist, campaigner and an environmental activist. The Ganga basin covers more than a million square kilometers and deposits sediments which are more than a kilometer deep in some places. These are a boon for crops in North India and Bangladesh. Based on historical evidence, until the early 19th century, the bank of the river Ganga teemed with wildlife, including dolphins. The Arthashastra of Kautilya mentions that the banks of the Ganga were covered by forests full of wildlife, including herds of wild elephants. Ganga is the lifeline of India in view of its economic, ecological, historical, cultural and spiritual imperatives, yet, despite the national restoration programmes, the Ganga Action Plan and the Ganga River Basin Management Plan, it is a dying river.

So what has made the Ganga a toxic, extremely polluted, threatened river? Broadly, anyone can count the factors on their fingertips: Inadequate ecological flow; impact of human activities that add to its toxicity; over-extraction of biological and other material; degradation or death of linked water-bodies; disappearance of riparian vegetation; poor health of basin catchment or draining streams; dying springs and the multiplicity of institutions dealing with different dimensions of the river and the riverscape.

The Ganga has three distinct zones, the upper catchment, the middle part and the deep lower reaches. All these zones have their own autecology. But in all these parts the surrounding landscapes are key players that influence the river’s ecosystem and its integrity. To make the ecological cleansing mechanism effective, the tree cover has to be restored in the catchment and riparian regions.

They are the most significant players in the life of a river and their health, density and composition are most important for maintaining the food web of the river. It is the food web of the river that makes it vibrant and living. Hence, in any river restoration plan, the role of trees has to be appreciated and should be an integral component. Out of the 8,51,475 sq km of the Ganga basin, only 5.6 per cent constitutes dense forest, the rest of the landscape comprises open forests, mangroves or shrubs. The function of forests ceases to be effective if density falls below 40 per cent. There is of course some mention of trees in the detailed project report but so far it has remained a non-starter.

For augmenting the ecological flow of the Ganga, catchment reforestation/enrichment of at least 7.40 million sq km should be a high priority. The Ganga basin is diverse in its geology, climate and in its aquatic ecology but in every zone, trees have a key role to play. Various experiments and studies have shown that any water sub-basin which has a forest cover of more than 30 per cent retained 25 per cent more water than basins with lower coverage. In sub-basins where the forest cover is over 70 per cent, water-retention is 50 per cent more than the sub-basin where forest cover is only 10 per cent. The study has also found that different forest types also have an impact on the degree of water retention. For instance, coniferous forests retain more than 10 per cent more than mixed forests.

Though extensive research has been carried out on various aspect of the river, most of these studies have limitations because the Ganga has never been observed for a long period of time. Hence, data are skewed, sparse or point at spatial coverage. This is particularly true regarding its ecology. The Ganga is a living identity and it has its own cleansing mechanism and ecology.

The 1995 records of the Forest Survey of India show that 85 per cent of river basins are devoid of any forest cover. While the headwater tributaries of the Ganga, like the Bhagirathi and Alaknanda still support a few stretches of good riparian forest cover, these forests almost disappear downstream. This can be attributed mainly to agriculture, which has been the dominant land use in the Gangetic plains for centuries and has affected the green cover and polluted the river. The relationship between trees and water is quite intricate and requires sound skill, knowledge and field experience to address forest management under varied conditions of terrain, climate, geology and hydrology.

People have observed that whenever there has been a loss of tree cover, perennial streams have oscillation between dry river beds and floods. Why does this happen? The leaves of trees intercept a proportion of the rain. That which falls on the ground, loses its momentum and its erosive power is considerably reduced. The interstices within the soil created by roots provide ample room for water absorption and storage. Thus, the trees, through their roots allow the rest to enter the soil slowly to increase the groundwater table. It also reduces the run-off to retard its power of soil erosion. The relationship between water and forests is complex and in the absence of research on river ecology and lack of scientific data, the management of Ganga on its ecological principles has not seen the light of day.

Further, regulation of rivers by construction of dams and reservoirs, logging, grazing, mining, water extraction and tourism have all deteriorated riparian forests. According to a study by Pandit and Grumbine, around 300 dams proposed to be constructed and under construction in the high biodiversity regions of the Indian Himalayas will result in the submergence of 54,117 hectares of forests. This will not only submerge many biodiversity hotspots it will seriously alter the habitat by changing the depth and duration of water in the remaining areas along the dams.

The assessment of the impact of urbanisation that results in increased flow variability, extreme channelisation of nutrients, toxic chemical invasion of biota and decreasing stream vegetation cover are also not available for various locations.

But the real challenge facing the country is the managerial knowledge and expertise of field foresters, land managers and those managing the water resources. Also absent on the ground is the integrated symbiotic approach reflecting the absence of effective institution. Water managers and foresters need to maximise the multifaceted forest benefits without adversely impacting the quality and quantity of flow and the function of the ecosystem of the river. Therefore, to address this challenge there is a dire need for deeper understanding and integration of policies for management of water, land and forest resources and also sensitising decision-makers and building community awareness so that a location-specific sound policy can be formulated along with effective application of regulations. .

So far, the rejuvenation of the Ganga is dominated by engineers and bureaucrats. River ecology was relatively a non-focussed, unapplied instrument kept aside. Serious gaps in ecological research, the management of the river to revive its ecology and to restore its ecological integrity, are great stumbling blocks, preventing management of the Ganga on ecological principles. It is seldom appreciated that the Ganga is an ecosystem that has its own cleansing mechanism that allows it to function efficiently. However, for that to happen, its ecological integrity must be maintained, which includes ecological processes such as production, decomposition, nutrient dynamics and movement of biota. Thus, the good health of the river refers to fully-functional unstressed river ecosystems and a healthy river has high resilience to recover from stress induced by disturbances.

9,10-3-20,A re-run of past follies,"Not learning from past mistakes, when it had to return to Afghanistan in 2001 to take on its own Frankenstein monster, the Taliban, the US has again signed a peace pact with it

Reporting from the Afghan frontlines, 22-year-old cavalry officer and war correspondent Winston Churchill had talked about the bravery of the Pathan warriors: “Their swordsmanship — neglecting guards — concerns itself only with cuts and careless of what injury they may receive, they devote themselves to the destruction of their opponents.” However, the warrior-scholar was far less charitable with the “mullah” among the Pathans: “Their holy men — the mullahs — prize as chief privilege, a sort of droit de seigneur (right of the lord). It is impossible to imagine a lower type of being or a more dreadful state of barbarism.”

The Afghan wastelands, which were immortalised for hosting the fictionalised “great game” by novelist Rudyard Kipling, actually live up to their literary billing. The barren swathes of the unforgiving heights of the Hindu Kush mountain ranges to the Wakhan panhandle have witnessed the unquenched ambitions of various empires — from the Persians to the Greeks, Mongol, Turkic, Mughals, Qajars, Tsarist, British to the erstwhile Soviets in the 1980s. The bloody graveyard of empires was exemplified by the retreating British forces from Kabul, when only one out of 18,500 soldiers made it out of the ferocious Afghan tribesmen, who slaughtered the contingent of the then most powerful military in the world.

Yet again, arguably the most powerful empire in the world today, the US, has succumbed to the irascible, uncontrollable and fierce warriors of the region, albeit under the cover of a pact, “Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan.” After suffering over 2,400 American combat fatalities (additional 1,100 NATO soldiers) and with over 20,660 men injured, the longest war in the US’ modern history (over 18 years since 2001), and burning over a two trillion dollar in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, US President Donald Trump signed an ostensible “peace deal” with the Afghan Taliban.

The deal was inked from the Taliban side by its co-founder, Mullah Ghani Baradar, who is described as a typical “old-fashioned Pashtun tribal head.” The Taliban, which has been the principal terror organisation in Afghanistan, responsible for over 157,000 deaths (as per research from the Cost of War Project at Brown University), has incredulously been promised that it would work along with other members of the United Nations Security Council to “remove members of the Taliban from the sanctions list with the aim of achieving this objective by May 29, 2020.”

The weakly worded and vacuous Afghan “peace deal” that is inherently lop-sided in favour of the Talibanis — with measurable deliverables from the US and vague generalities in the form of Talibani deliverables — is telling in terms of who had the upper hand in the negotiations. The entire edifice of the so-called peace hope is predicated on the complete disownment and U-turn of Talibani behaviour, conduct and ideology — from their historically violent, sworn intransigence and without any hard commitment to reform itself.

The Ashraf Ghani Government in Kabul has been a mute, unengaged and sidelined spectator in the entire process and is hopelessly left to fend for itself as the American soldiers extricate themselves. This withdrawal from the conflict zone follows an unmistakable pattern with the US unilaterally bolting out from a precarious situation — it had done so earlier from this very region in the late 1980s; in Iraq after removing Saddam Hussein; in Libya after eliminating Muammar al-Gaddafi; in Lebanon after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings; in Somalia and in Vietnam among others. It follows the usual pretence of leaving the situation to the locals to “handle their destiny.” Subsequent events have always been even more chaotic, filled with violence, bloodshed, capitulation and take-over by extremist forces.

In an eerily similar situation from the past history, when the US had tired from the unending and inconclusive fighting in Vietnam, it signed a “peace agreement” entailing a ceasefire, release of prisoners, talks between warring factions, withdrawal of its troops (exactly the same terms as in the latest Afghan peace treaty), effectively leaving the depleted US-supported faction to fend for survival. Expectedly and within a few months, the US-supported South Vietnamese forces were slaughtered.

While accepting the surrender, North Vietnamese Colonel Bui Tin rubbished the so-called “peace deal” provisions and asserted, “Between Vietnamese, there are no victors and no vanquished. Only the Americans have been beaten.” Today, Kabul stares at a similar deal with an irreconcilable terror organisation that is not even monolithic or unified in control and has a dubious track record of shifting loyalties among its warlords — the portents are ominous.

Almost immediately, the obviousness of the “face saving” instrument that afforded the Americans to cut-and-run is proving true. Within days of the so-called “peace deal”, brazen violations by the Taliban included a wave of ferocious attacks, forcing the US to make “defensive” air strikes against the Taliban in the Helmand province — hardly reassuring of the road ahead. While Trump spoke about his “good talks” with the Taliban leader Baradar, expected fissures erupted with the Afghan President Ashraf Ghani rejecting the demand to release Talibani prisoners.

Ghani’s comments that, “the Government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners” and further clarification that the US could not take unilateral decisions on its behalf by stating that, “it is not in the authority of the US to decide, it is only a facilitator”, augurs a bleak future.

In 1989, the US had stalled all overtures, invitations and concessions by the then Mohammad Najibullah regime and persisted with the jihadi mujahideen, the forbears of the present-day Taliban. Washington, DC, had wrongly punted on the Inter-Services Intelligence-supported extremist forces and paid a bloody price by supporting a puritanical ideology that would haunt it in the near future.

By 2001, the US had returned to Afghanistan to take on its own Frankenstein monster, now called the Taliban. The then President, George Bush, had famously said, “As a result of the US military, the Taliban is no longer in existence.” He was clearly wrong and the present President has again signed another deal with the historically untrustworthy Taliban. History is deemed to repeat itself.

10,10-3-20,Stop the virus,"We need to activate our existing flu surveillance programmes to check its spread at the community level

Without setting off a panic, India has undoubtedly mounted a preventive protocol and self-imposed curfews to halt the Coronavirus. Since the Wuhan outbreak in neighbouring China, the containment has meant that large numbers of infected returnees have been tracked and their circle of contacts tapped into. Even then, what is worrisome is the rapid spread of the infection by each host with overnight occurrences going up from six to 30 and now 40. It is just not Kerala, suspected cases are popping up from every corner, be it Ladakh or Tamil Nadu and in multiple cities like New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Patna. That shows the possibility of the host, who may have cleared the routine test but maybe incubating the virus for a fortnight while being asymptomatic, unknowingly infecting many people in a domino effect. India, being the second most populated country in the world, faces surveillance challenges because of this “bleed into the crowd” inevitability. The other risk factor is behavioural; Indians rarely voluntarily subject themselves to checks, scans and quarantine and there have been cases of suspected patients fleeing isolation wards. That’s why the penalty for failure to report on arrival is a welcome move. Right now, the threat has percolated from the outside. Once it spreads in the community internally, one wouldn’t know where to set up the barriers amid a wildfire. Even zonal shutdowns won’t work in dense and interactive clusters, be it markets or places of religious gathering such as temples, mosques and churches. All of these are porous to transmission because religious tourism is high and faith-based practices are difficult to negotiate. ISKCON, though, given its largely international footprint, has advised foreigners from the Coronavirus-affected countries not to visit for two months as a precautionary measure. We may have to limit influx at our tourist hotspots, which usually register high footfalls and revenue this time of the year. Both the religious and tourism economies around the world, including Mecca, Vatican and even Tibet, have taken a hit but are restricting events to avoid mass congregations.

In such a scenario, we have to work on an original template that’s practical and manageable. Our public healthcare system doesn’t have the efficiency of China but we do have a record in defeating polio, taming the swine flu in 2009 and confining the deadly Nipah virus. The National Polio Surveillance Project, a collaboration between the Government and the WHO, already has a grid for community surveillance and contact testing, both of which can be activated aggressively to contain the virus. Authorities say health workers contacted nearly 450 people, who had been in touch with five Indians who tested positive in three States. We also have an influenza surveillance programme, which covers four types of flu viruses. This is usually conducted and executed through medical colleges that screen flu patients. This programme, experts say, can be used to do random community checks. Since COVID-19 infections begin mild, the quick diagnostics approach could work in identification. Of course, the disease is a good wake-up call for animal food safety, preservation and processes, be it in dairy, fisheries or poultry. Population pressures mean that we are increasingly getting closer to the possibility of an intra-species jump of viruses. According to estimates by the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, 72 billion animals (chicken, poultry, cattle and goats) are killed each year but they all have the potential to transmit new viruses to us. An epidemic can swamp us in days. A preventive drill needs to be put in place rather than waiting for positive or negative test results, some of which have to be conducted over several rounds. For example, some experts suggest that diagnosis could begin with chest scans that reveal a pattern of pneumonia similar to the Coronavirus. This could speed up identification and treatment protocols and arrest criticality of the disease in advanced stages. This assumes significance in view of a warning by a leading epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong that COVID-19 could infect 60 per cent of the globe if left unchecked. Also given the better resistance of Indians to the flu virus in general, milder infections can be taken care of with a home quarantine, freeing up hospitals for critical patients. We need massive information dissemination down to the anganwadi and panchayat networks and have to be confident rather than be overwhelmed. An inter-State mitigation plan should be set into motion so that undeserved areas do not become potential time bombs. We must have a targetted yet decentralised approach before the virus mutates monstrously.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/stop-the-virus-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/stop-the-virus.html
11,10-3-20,When yes became no!,"The Government may have saved Yes Bank and prevented a run on banks but public confidence is at an all-time low

The Government-inspired rescue plan for Yes Bank, which calls upon the State Bank of India (SBI) to buy up to 49 per cent of its stake besides making an initial investment of upto Rs 2,450 crore, appears to have saved the investors and even equity holders to a certain degree but has ruined bond holders. While the crisis has led to serious questions being asked about how the bonds were sold by bankers, the depositors have been breathing a sigh of relief. Still, there are several unanswered questions surrounding the collapse of Yes Bank. At least the authorities were able to lure co-founder and former boss Rana Kapoor back to Indian shores before he could run away to the den of criminals and conmen, London. It is possible that Kapoor’s questioning will reveal why and what he did and who he worked in cahoots with to perpetuate the fraud allegedly conducted by him. But the image of Indian banks, both public and private, has taken a huge hit in the light of Yes Bank’s collapse. This came close on the heels of the failure of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank (PMC Bank) a few months ago. While the Yes Bank story played out in slow motion, it appears that elements both within the bank and outside tried to scupper any rescue deal being structured without Kapoor retaining a modicum of control. This was likely done to provide a protective shield to the kickbacks that were paid to firms linked with Kapoor and his family in lieu of loans being issued to companies whose profile would have scared away even the most bullish of bankers. Yes Bank continued to provide credit to some deeply distressed firms.

That said, it is important for private depositors and large corporate account holders to maintain a level of confidence in Indian banking. The Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have to make the right noises. A probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is underway. But this isn’t sufficient to reassure the depositors that they are trying their best. Criminal charges have to be framed against those bankers found guilty of corruption and fraud. At the same time, cash deposits in automated teller machines and bank branches must be made available so that everyone knows that their money is safe.",columnists,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/when-yes-became-no--2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/columnists/when-yes-became-no-.html

19,10-3-20,Retirement age in UT to be 58 like Punjab,"The Chandigarh Administration has decided to continue following the Punjab civil service rules. After taking legal opinion on the issue, the Administration has recommended to the Punjab Governor and UT Administrator VP Singh Bandore that it would be legally apt to continue following the Punjab service rules.

The development comes at a time when the Punjab Government has recently decided to reduce the retirement age of its state employees from 60 years to 58 years.

The Administration follows Punjab service rules and pay scale for its employees. While presenting Punjab Government’s Budget recently, Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal had announced the reduction of retirement age of state employees to 58 years from 60. Employees who have turned 59 would retire on March 31 and those who have completed 58 but are still not 59 would retire on September 30.

If the Administration continues to follow Punjab service rules, the decision will affect only 400 out of total around 24000 of its employees.

Earlier after the requests of employees’ unions, the Administration considered following Central civil services rules but due to legal trouble, the proposal has been scrapped.

At present, the retirement age for central employees in most of the services is 60 years, though it is 65 for professors in all Central universities as also for Central Government doctors. In Administration, the employees who turn 58, which is the retirement age, can be given two extensions of one year each.

UT Adviser Manoj Parida told the mediapersons that as per the legal recommendations, the process to discontinue with the Punjab services rules is tedious and legally complicated. The Punjab rules were adopted in 1992 at the level of the Union Cabinet.

Of the total around 24000 employees of Administration, only around 400 are being impacted because reduction in retirement age by Punjab Government, he said.

While about 200 employees will retire on March 31, another 200 on September 20 as per Punjab’s service rules, Parida added.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/retirement-age-in-ut-to-be-58-like-punjab.html
20,10-3-20,UT begins work on STP Kishangarh to fill up Sukhna,"After the Punjab and Haryana High Court order declaring Sukhna Lake legal entity and directing its preservation, the Chandigarh Administration has swung into action for implementation of its long-pending proposal of installation of a sewage treatment plant (STP) for ensuring an additional water resources to fill the man-made water body.

The proposed 2 MLD capacity sewage treatment plant to be built using MBR technology (membrane bioreactor) will fill Sukhna Lake near village Kishangarh in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The STP will also solve the problem of sewage water entering the Sukhna forest area.

“The project is likely to be completed by next eight months. A tender has been floated for construction of the STP,” said a senior officer of UT Administration. The effluent from the STP at Kishangarh will be used for filling up Sukhna Lake and the latest membrance bioreactor (MBR) technology will be used for producing effluent of high quality, he said.

While the proposal to set up STP at Kishangarh was mooted in 2017, the project could not take off. In a series of directions related to preservation of Sukhna Lake, the High Court had last week directed the Administration to ensure that the average capacity of the lake is increased by atleast about 100-150 hectares by one-time large scale desilting (dredging) of the lake. It was also directed that the capacity once created should be maintained through regular dredging. Apart from this, the authorities in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh were directed to lower the storage capacity of the check dams to ensure regular flow of water into Sukhna Lake. The States of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are also directed that no waste water or sewage flows into the river from the villages i.e Kansal, Kaimbwala and Saketri.

The rainfed Sukhna Lake was created in 1958 by damning the Sukhna Choe, a seasonal stream coming down from the Sukhna Hills and was created as a gift to the citizens of Chandigarh for enjoyment of peace and tranquility.

As per statistics with administration, capacity of lake was 1074.4 hectare metres in 1958 which reduced to 513.28 hectare metres. The water spread area was 228.64 hectares in 1958, which declined to 148.28 hectare in 2005. And,the average depth of the man-made water body was 4.694 meter at embankment level in 1958 which declined to 3.484 meter in 2005.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/ut-begins-work-on-stp-kishangarh-to-fill-up-sukhna.html

22,10-3-20,MCD to invite tenders for vending zones,"The tender process will be held this month for 10 vending zones in the city by Municipal Corporation of Dehradun (MCD).The construction of vending zones is most likely to begin after about two months.

The number of fruit and vegetable vendors with their carts on almost every road is increasing in Dehradun on a regular basis. There are more than 7,000 such carts on the main roads of the city out of which only about 3,000 carts are registered with the MCD.

The major problem with the carts is that they are placed on the sides of the roads which results in traffic congestion and accidents too at times.

Considering that carts provide a livelihood to many people, the MCD is planning to make vending zones in selected locations where the vendors can carry out their trade. According to the officials of MCD, tenders will be invited by the corporation and subsequently, further proceedings will be carried out.

While talking to The Pioneer, Dehradun municipal commissioner Vinay Shankar Pandey said, “The tender process will be held for 10 vending zones in the city. The process will probably commence this month and afterwards, the work of planning vending zones will proceed.” Pandey also informed that the tender process generally goes on for about two months so the construction of vending zones will begin only after the said procedure is complete.

The municipal corporation has reportedly proposed the construction of vending zones in twelve selected areas of the city that include the locations near Lansdown Chowk, Panditwadi, near Forest Research Institute (FRI), and Karnpur.

It is pertinent to mention here that last year the MCD had established a smart vending zone at Chhe Number Puliya near the Raipur Ring Road as a pilot project.

This vending zone has elicited positive response from the public and also resolved problems like traffic congestion and littering which were faced at the same location in the past.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/mcd-to-invite-tenders-for-vending-zones.html

27,10-3-20,Stop making fool of yourselves with ‘brazen lies’: Capt to Akalis,"Asking the Akalis to check their facts before shooting foolishly their mouth on issues of critical interest of Punjab, the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday said that the very premise of their criticism of State Government’s employment generation programme was based on “flawed data”.

“The Akalis are only making a fool of themselves with their repetitive attempts to mislead the people with half-baked lies that have absolutely no basis and are completely removed from facts,” said Capt Amarinder.

Presenting facts and figures to counter SAD’s “brazen lies” on jobs created by the Congress Government in the past three years, the Chief Minister said that they had clearly not bothered to understand or analyze the information in the Economic Survey, which they were using as the basis for attacking his Government.

“The said Economic Survey released by the Union Government clearly stated that the source of data provided on unemployment was the PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) 2017-18 conducted by Labour Bureau, Government of India. The reference period therein was July 2017 to June 2018, which was barely a year since his Government had inherited the mess created by the erstwhile SAD-BJP Government in the State,” he pointed out.

Further, the Chief Minister observed that the survey had a very small sample size of 6497 and 6877 persons from rural and urban areas respectively, which translated into a total sample size of just 13,374 persons in a population of 2.27 crores. Further, for youth in the age group of 15-29 years, the sample size was a shocking low of 1,870 and 1,961 persons for rural and urban areas respectively, which meant a total sample size of mere 3831, as against the state’s total youth population of 80.58 lakhs in this age group.

Given the “ridiculously” small sample size used, the data about unemployment in Punjab was just indicated, apart from being dated, noted the Chief Minister, adding that it was evident that the Akalis were either too dumb to understand the implications of this data or were deliberately trying to mislead the people of Punjab by giving out selective information.

Capt Amarinder pointed out that it had been mentioned in the survey itself by the Government of India that no comparison could be made with previous data on unemployment on the basis of this survey “as the data sources are not strictly comparable”. Clearly, then, there could be no comparison of the data of 2015-16 with the data of 2017-18, he added.

“These clear and categorical facts notwithstanding, the Akalis continue to rave and rant about the dismal employment scenario in Punjab, under the incumbent Congress Government, like wayward children who are hell-bent on creating trouble for others, mindless of the consequences,” said the Chief Minister.

Instead of apologizing for pushing the State into such a terrible mess, with employment at an all-time low under their pathetic anti-people policies during their decade-long rule, the Akalis are trying to spread misinformation to further their petty political interests, Capt Amarinder lashed out.

Apparently the Akalis needed to be told everything many times to make them understand even basic facts, the Chief Minister said, reiterating that under this Government’s flagship programme of ‘Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission’, a total of 12.15 lakh jobs had already been provided to the State’s youth.

Of these, 57,905 youth had been assisted in Government placements, 3.97 lakh in private sector, and 7.61 lakh had been facilitated for taking up various self-employment ventures during last three years.

Apart from this, 20.21 lakh households had been given employment in different MNREGA schemes and 648.26 lakh man days of employment thus generated, from April 17 to December 31, 2019, he added.

“Since these numbers were not difficult to understand, the only feasible explanation for SAD’s desperation to undermine his Government’s success on this count could be their deep sense of frustration at being completely rejected by the people of Punjab,” the Chief Minister quipped.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/stop-making-fool-of-yourselves-with----brazen-lies-----capt-to-akalis.html
28,10-3-20,"SAD: Instead of taking shelter behind technicalities, CM must face the reality","Describing the Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s statement on Economic Survey as his “frustration” after his Government was exposed by results of the Survey, the Akali Dal on Monday said that instead of taking shelter behind technicalities, the Chief Minister must face the reality and explain why Punjab lagged behind from rest of India in giving jobs to youth.

SAD spokesperson and former Education Minister Daljit Singh Cheema asked the Chief Minister if he will also deny the fact that 2.69 lakh applicants have registered themselves with the state’s Unemployment Bureau out of which 91 percent are categorised as Skilled and 85 percent are 10th pass or above.

“Punjab Chief Minister is terming sample size of the survey as ‘very small’…It seems that either CM is not aware of standard procedure adopted in Economic Survey throughout the country or he is trying to mislead the people again…However, if he is still not satisfied with the sample size of Economic Survey of India, he should count the number of heads who were demanding employment and were mercilessly assaulted on his orders in front of his palace in Patiala yesterday,” quipped Cheema.

Cheema said that it is good to note that in his statement worthy CM has also accepted that only 57905 youth have been given employment and his claims made in Delhi on 12 lakh youth given employment are totally false and baseless.

“Along with this fact, the CM should have also informed the State that almost same number of teachers who were getting Rs 45,000 per month as their salary have been forced to accept Rs 15,000 per month only,” he said.

Cheema also asked the Chief Minister to explain that when 14,136 youth have cleared ETT-TET examinations and more than 12,000 posts are lying vacant, why his Government has advertised only 1,664 posts.

He urged the Chief Minister to still accept that his performance during three years is a complete failure and State direly needs to work on providing jobs to the youth and process for the same should be started at the earliest.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sad--instead-of-taking-shelter-behind-technicalities--cm-must-face-the-reality.html

33,10-3-20,"Holi colours can be dangerous,says experts","Ahead of the festival of colours ‘ Holi’, the medical experts have warned that the chemicals in the commonly used colours could severely damage the eye and skin. These colours have compounds of lead and mercury which are potent carcinogenic (cancer causing agents) substances.

Senior skin specialist, Dr Anil Arya said that the lead and mercury compounds in the Holi colours can cause allergy due to which rashes and severe itching can occur and in acute cases minor wounds on skin can take place. He informed that a disease called contact dermatitis can also occur from these chemicals. The dermatologist suggested that people should refrain from using such colours and even if they do they should immediately wash them off. He advised that the die hard Holi revellers should put some body lotion or oil before venturing out of their homes on the day.

The colours can also damage the eye. The head of department (HoD) of ophthalmology at Government Doon Medical College (GDMC) Hospital, Dr Sushil Ojha said that many cases of eye injury are reported on the festival of colours. He said that balloons filled with coloured water can be dangerous when they strike the eyes. The cornea of the eye is damaged in such cases due to which vision could be affected. Dr Ojha suggested that people should sport sunglasses to prevent damage to the eye from colours.

He added that one should immediately wash the eyes with clean water when the colours enter the eye and if the problem of irritation persists should visit the Ophthalmologist.

The use of intoxicants like alcohol and cannabis on Holi are responsible for maximum number of accidents on the day. The medical experts are of the view that people should abstain from taking any intoxicating agents in order to enjoy a joyous festival.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/holi-colours-can-be-dangerous-says-experts.html
34,10-3-20,Sacrifice of Baba Uttarakhandi for Gairsain forgotten,"Amid credit seeking exercise by both the incumbent BJP and opposition Congress after chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat made the surprise announcement of granting summer capital status to Gairsain, not many in the state remember that Baba Mohan Singh Uttarakhandi had sacrificed his life for the cause of Gairsain, way back in the year 2004.

After a marathon 38 day long hunger strike on the demand of making Gairsain as permanent capital of Uttarakhand, Baba died on August 9, 2004 at Benital, a place near Gairsain in Chamoli district. Interestingly Baba Uttarakhandi had undertaken as many as 13 hunger strikes for a separate state of Uttarakhand and when it was created, for making Gairsain in Chamoli as its capital. It is said that that the Baba decided Benital as place of his hunger strike as according to him this place was situated above Gairsain and truly represented ethos of a hill State.Baba started his strike on July 2, 2004 on demands like making Gairsain as permanent capital of Uttarakhand, punishment to the perpetrators of the infamous Rampur Tiraha incident, employment opportunities for youth of Uttarakhand and formulation of a policy to stop migration from mountainous areas.

As the hunger strike of Baba went on, a pro Uttarakhand and pro Gairsain sentiment swept the state. On August 08, which was 38th day of the hunger strike, Baba was forcefully lifted and taken to the community health centre (CHC), Karnprayag by the district administration, where he died under mysterious circumstances.

His death created a huge furore as the people of the state became very agitated on his death. A state-wide bandh was observed and a high level inquiry was ordered by the government. Baba was cremated with full state honours at the confluence of West and East Nayar near Satpuli in Pauri district. Born on December 3, 1948, Mohan Singh Negi (Baba Uttarakhandi) was second son of Manwar Singh Negi of Bantholi village located in Ekeshwar block of Pauri district. After completing high school and ITI, he joined Indian Army in the year 1970. He later left the job of Army and jumped into the statehood movement for a separate state of Uttarakhand. He was so engrossed in this movement that he left his family, became an ascetic and pledged to eat only once in day. He was accorded the title of Baba Uttarakhandi by people for his unflinching commitment for the cause of Uttarakhand. When the separate state was created Baba realized that nothing has changed for the poor and simple people living in the mountainous areas of the State.

He then decided to undertake a marathon fast during which he died. After declaring Gairsain as the summer capital of Uttarakhand the incumbent BJP is taking credit for fulfilling the long pending aspirations of the people of the Himalayan State.

The opposition Congress on the other hand is claiming that it was instrumental in initiating the process of capital formation by holding first cabinet meeting and assembly session at Gairsain and would make Gairsain as permanent capital of State.

However, the pivotal role played by Baba Uttarakhandi in making Gairsain as central point of political discourse of the Himalayan state is almost forgotten. RCS Rawat, a retired bureaucrat, said that the state government should name the new assembly building after the name of Baba Uttarakhandi as homage for his sacrifice.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/sacrifice-of-baba-uttarakhandi-for-gairsain-forgotten.html

There is a considerable waste of water every year during Holi that adversely affects the groundwater table in most of the area. The water supply generally drops down on the next day of Holi due to the extensive consumption of water in a single day that also causes water shortage in many areas of the city.

In his appeal, the chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has asked the people to remain vigilant on the festival of Holi in view of threat of Coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the people including local Holi event organisers, parents of school going children, and police are insisting on keeping the Holi celebrations simple rather than indulging in revelling whole day with crowd.

According to a Holi event organiser, Rajeev Prajapati, “Every year I organise Holi gatherings at many areas of Rajpur, Adhoiwala, and Raipur in Dehradun. This time people are quite sceptical about the gatherings due to Coronavirus outbreak. Last year, I had organised eight Holi events but this year, I am organising only three events. These events too would end within three hours.” He further added that the business this year during Holi is also subdued but it is good that people are aware and taking precautionary measure against coronavirus disease. “Many cases of coronavirus have been reported in the neighbouring states of Uttarakhand and the disease can surface here also if the precautions are not be taken by everyone.

Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also decided not to celebrate Holi and attend public gatherings this year. So if he can do it, common people can keep their Holi celebrations simple too,” said Ranjana Kohli, a police constable.

Worried about the health of their wards the parents too are paying special attention to the Holi celebrations of their children. Deepa Kamthan, a resident of Canal Road said, “My children love Holi but this year we have clearly told them that they are not allowed to go outside the house on Holi. Though the Coronavirus has not surfaced yet in Dehradun but we meet hundreds of people during Holi so we cannot risk our children’s health, especially during their board exams.” Interestingly, the children understand the gravity of the issue and prefer to take their parents’ advice in right sprits. “I play Holi every year with my friends, cousins and relatives.

We attend numerous gatherings of our friends and relatives but this year my parents have restricted us to go to any public gatherings,” said Shivam Gandhi, a class X student.

He further added that he does not like the restrictions but he is aware that interaction with so many people in a single day can be dangerous due to the spread of Coronavirus. Therefore he is fine keeping his Holi spirits down this year.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/holi-to-be-subdued-affair-this-year-in-u---khand.html

48,10-3-20,"Roadside garbage, animal excreta on North Delhi roads","Heaps of garbage and animal excreta, scattered on roads at pivotal points in north Delhi, have made lives of resident miserable. The unattended garbage at Municipal Corporation's dhalaos is also providing a safe haven for mosquitoes to breed as even after a brief shower, water accumulates around it making it difficult for residents to even walk through the stretch.

Stray animals, particularly cow and dogs, further spread the mud causing health hazard. The Mukherjee Nagar and Nirankari Colony were the worst-hit, with Azadpur, Burari, Indra Vikas Colony, Wazirabad and Dhaka village being the most affected areas.

Naresh Bhatnagar, a resident of Mukherjee Nagar, said that the north Corporation has failed to maintain the cleanliness of the area. ""I have been seeing the garbage spread on roads like this,"" he said, pointing the garbage on roads around dhalao.

""The corporation officials have been apathetic in handling the menace of stray animals and handling waste despite several complaints. We are forced to live in such unhygienic condition with no option available. We explored all the option including approaching RWA, municipal officials and even police for its redressal but still nothing happened,"" he added.

The dhalao at Nirankari colony, Azadpur and Indira Vikas Colony is always overflowing that is further spread by cows, dogs and scavengers.

Sher Singh Malik, an advocate and resident of Nirankari Colony said that he is addicted of it. ""We have tired complaining to the authorities but no one paid heeds. You cannot think making the capital as per the developed cities across the world until the garbage problem is not resolved,"" he said.

49,10-3-20,Delhi court acquits 30 people in 35-year-old transistor bomb blasts case,"Over three decades after 69 people were killed and 127 injured in a series of transistor bomb blasts across north India, a Delhi court has acquitted 30 of the 49 accused, owing to ""defective, lopsided, unfair"" and ""faulty investigation"".

Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Yadav said the investigation suffered from various lacunae and the accused cannot be convicted in the 35-year-old case on the basis of evidence collected during such faulty investigation.

On the evening of May 10, 1985, bombs fitted in transistors went off in buses and other public places in Delhi and adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana, killing 49 people and injuring 127 in Delhi alone.

A Special Investigation Team, under the supervision of then DCP (Central) of Delhi Police, had chargesheeted 59 accused. While five of the 59 are proclaimed offenders and never appeared to face proceedings, the trial court in July 2006 discharged five due to ""insufficient evidence"".

Of the remaining 49 accused, 19 died during pendency of the trial, leaving 30 accused who have been on bail since 1986.

The court, in its 120-page verdict, said: ""In some cases, public witnesses were associated with the investigation but they were not examined in the court. The indisputable conclusion is that investigation conducted in these cases was defective, lopsided, unfair and suffered from various lacuna. Accused persons cannot be convicted on the basis of evidence collected during such faulty investigation.""

The judge said it was amply clear from the evidence that during the probe, police officials had picked up various persons and made them approvers after pressurising and torturing them. ""Those persons were warned that if they did not depose as per demands of police, they would be made an accused in the case even their family members were also pressurised and tortured by police. Number of witnesses have deposed about the manner in which police pressurised persons to depose on the dotted lines so a to create a false edifice of the alleged conspiracy,"" the court said.

The court said the prosecution has miserably failed to prove charges against the accused and acquitted Surjit Kaur, Manmohan Singh, Gurdev Singh, Buta Singh, Kulbir Singh alias Bhola, Inderjit Singh alias Happy, Hardeep Singh, Tirath Singh, Mukhtiar Singh, Bhupinder Singh alias Bhinda, Arvinder Singh alias Nitu, Anoop Singh and Manjeet Singh.

It also freed Joginderpal Singh Bhatia, Tarjit Singh, Saravjit Singh, Surinderpal Singh, Daljit Singh, Rajinder Singh, Sewa Singh, Surinderpal Singh alias Dolly, Shahbaz Singh, Sukhdev Singh, Jaspal Singh, Dalvinder Singh alias Pappa, Narender Singh, Gurmeet Singh, Harcharan Singh, Gurdeep Singh Sehgal and Gurmeet Singh alias Happy.

It said the police has not collected evidence to clarify whether bomb placed in the bus by accused exploded or remained unexploded and if bomb remained unexploded whether same were diffused or not.

""No details/particulars of bus including its number, etc were collected by Investigating Officer. In fact, nobody has come before the court to depose that he diffused the bombs.

""Even the original disclosure statements of these accused persons are not on record. There is no material on record to suggest that bomb placed by accused Mukhtiyar Singh, Anoop Singh, Bhupinder Singh, Arvinder Singh, Manjeet Singh and Tirath Singh and Daljeet Singh ever exploded,"" the court held.

It said that the prosecution's case is based on circumstantial evidence and in such a case, motive to commit the crime is an important factor to be proved by agency.

""It is prosecution's version that accused persons had hatched a conspiracy to create disharmony amongst various communities to take revenge of Blue Star Operation and riots that happened in November 1984. However, prosecution miserably failed to prove that any relatives, friends, near and dears of accused persons died in 1984 riots or in Blue Star Operation,"" the court said. Noting that vital documents like disclosure statements, seizure memos, statements under Section 164 CrPC and pamphlets/ letters are not on record, the court held it cannot even be said that these documents went missing as it was not established by prosecution that they existed or were filed with the charge sheet.The recent court order, which comes at the end of an investigation and trial that saw eight FIRs, 14 charge sheets, 1,399 prosecution witnesses and around 2 dozen judges, the 30 accused have been acquitted of various charges of the Indian Penal Code, including murder, attempt to murder, criminal conspiracy and waging war against the Government of India, under the Explosive Substances Act and the Arms Act.

The cases from Uttar Pradesh and Haryana were later transferred to Delhi on the Supreme Court's direction.Charges were framed in 2006, by which time many witnesses died or were not traceable and the original charge sheet filed by Delhi Police was misplaced, leading to an FIR and initiation of a departmental inquiry against the ""court officials responsible"".

The police case rested on the secret information they had received that transistor bombs were allegedly being manufactured at the home of one Kartar Singh Narang in West Delhi.

On May 12, 1985, police raided Narang's house and arrested him along with his alleged accomplices, Mohinder Singh Oberoi and Manmohan Singh Khalsa. The police alleged to have recovered bombs, gunpowder, electronic devices, pistols and iron rods from the possession of the three men, of whom Khalsa later died in police custody.",state-editions,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/state-editions/delhi-court-acquits-30-people-in-35-year-old-transistor-bomb-blasts-case.html

The BJP raised Rs 1,612.04 crore as funds from unknown sources which is 64 per cent of the total income of national parties from unknown sources (Rs 2512.98 crore) while the Congess received Rs 728.88 crore from unknown sources which is 29 per cent of the total income of all national political parties. This income BJP forms more than 1.5 times more the aggregate of income from unknown sources.

According to ADR report, the seven national parties have collected Rs 11,234.12 crore funds (from unknown sources) between 2004-05 and 2018-19. The income of national parties--BJP, Congress, Trinamool Congress, CPI(M), NCP, CPI and BSP, was Rs 3,749.37 crore in 2018-19.

82,10-3-20,EC working group asks for ceiling on expenditure,"The Election Commission's working group has recommended that there should be a ceiling on expenditure made by political parties during polls, similar to the provision for individual candidates. Last year, the poll panel had set up various working groups to study different aspects of electoral management.

In the past, the commission had recommended amendments to the Representation of the People Act and Rule 90 of The Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961, for the same. This means if the Government accepts the EC recommendations, a political party may not be able to spend more than Rs 25-35 lakh per candidate in case of Lok Sabha elections and not more than Rs 10-14 lakh per candidate in case of Assembly elections.

""At present, there is no cap on the expenditure to be incurred for an election by the political parties. There is felt need for having such cap for level playing field,"" read the recommendation.

In 2015, the EC had recommended to the Law Ministry to cap maximum expenditure of political parties to ""a multiple of half of maximum prescribed limit for individual candidates with the number of candidates fielded"". The government is yet to take a call on the proposal.

An all-party meeting in August 2015 had recommended that there should be a ceiling on party expenditure. The election watchdog has been pushing for greater transparency in election-related expenditure by parties and candidates.

At present, there is a ceiling on campaigning funds for individual candidates in the electoral fray but no cap on the money political parties can spend for electioneering.

83,10-3-20,Tourists visiting tiger reserves to be under scanner,"Tourists visiting the tiger reserves in the country will now be under the scanner for the coronavirus (Covid-19) with the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) issuing an advisory in this regard to the States. Travellers from China, Italy, Iran, Japan and South Korea which are worst hit by the deadly virus will be specially screened, as a precautionary measure.

""As the tiger reserves are visited by eco-tourists from across the world, it is recommended to establish essential screening and preventive measures in consultaion with district and State health authorities at reception or interpretation centres where there is likelihood of convergence of people,"" said Dr Vaibhav C Mathur, Assistant Inspector General (AIG) of the NTCA.

Obviously, the authorities are taking no chance with the deadly virus which has spread over 100 countries. Worldover, 1,10379 Coronavirus cases have been reported which include 3,831 deaths across 109 countries.

The number of coronavirus cases in India rose to 45 on Monday after six fresh cases were reported from Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Karnataka, New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.

The officials of the tiger reserves have also been asked to prominently display the posters and advisory of the Union Health Ministry on safe habits in the wake of the Covid-19.

Coronavirus commonly spreads from infected persons mainly through air, cough and sneeze and close contact. It can also spread by touching an object or surface with virus presence and later touch your mouth, nose or eyes without washing hands.

In fact, the coronavirus scare has already casted shadow over the wildlife tourism in the country as few tourists are now taking the risk of travelling to the tiger sanctuaries.

The number of tourists coming to Ranthambore tiger reserve in Rajasthan, for instance, has declined sharply. Last year, 9853 foreign tourists had visited Ranthambore by February last year but so far this year in February the number has reached just 4235, according to reports. There are around 50 tiger sanctuaries across the country.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/tourists-visiting-tiger-reserves-to-be-under-scanner.html
84,10-3-20,"SP, BSP, Congress welcome verdict","The Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Congress on Monday welcomed the Allahabad High Court's order directing the Lucknow administration to remove posters of those accused of vandalism during anti-CAA protests in December.

“The Government neither has the knowledge of right to privacy of citizens nor any respect for the constitution. The people of the state are fed up with this government. We welcome the high court's decision,” SP supremo Akhilesh Yadav said here.

BSP supremo Mayawati too welcomed the decision.

“The BSP welcomes the honourable high court's order directing the administration to remove hoardings of those accused of violence during the anti-CAA protests after taking suo motu cognisance of the matter,” Mayawati said in a tweet.

Meanwhile, Congress state president Ajay Kumar Lallu said the court's decision has “exposed” the undemocratic and anti-constitution stand of the Adityanath government.

“The right to privacy is a fundamental right but the government ignored it and put up posters of the accused which was unconstitutional and undemocratic,” Lallu said.

Stressing that it is for the court to decide whether the accused were involved in violence or not, Lallu said: “No charges have been proved against anyone yet.”

Earlier in the day, Allahabad bench Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha had directed the district magistrate and the Lucknow Police commissioner to submit a report on the matter by March 16.

The court, which had on March 7 taken suo motu cognisance of the issue, on Sunday termed the move as “highly unjust” and said it was an “absolute encroachment on personal liberty of individuals”.

The posters bearing photographs, names and addresses of those accused of vandalism during the anti-CAA protests had come up at major road crossings in Lucknow late on Thursday night on the directions of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, an official had said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/sp--bsp--congress-welcome-verdict.html
85,10-3-20,Modi wants to personally streamline BJP's poll campaign in Didi land,"With West Bengal being seen as the foremost test case for the “success” of controversial citizenship legislation as the BJP is consistently highlighting illegal infiltration of Bangladeshi migrants, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought to personally streamline BJP’s poll campaign in the State, next year, by having one-on-one consultations with 18 party MPs from the State over the last few weeks.

After winning Lok Sabha polls with a thumping majority in 2019, BJP has not been able to match its performance in Assembly polls- just managing to form the Government in Haryana, and losing elections in Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Delhi - something which has made the party high command concerned, leading to a full-scale review of its campaign strategy of about last one year. Although BJP won only three of the 294 Assembly seats in West Bengal in 2016, in the 2019 general elections it surprised many political observers by winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats.

Modi has personally sought to receive an in-depth feed-back from party MPs , three MLAs and all key State party leaders as to how to strike a right chord with the Bengal voters. The developmental issues , including key flag-ship welfare schemes of the centre and CAA , were part of the discussion, according to sources.

Rs Hard-HindutvaRs and CAA would be high on the poll agenda but development issues with a focus on ""new Bengal"" need to be given an equal focus to woo voters, they said. Along with Bihar, Bengal is slated for polls in about one year's time. Modi has held one-on-one meeting with most of the BJP MPs from the TMC-ruled State.

During the ongoing Budget Session in which he also sought feedback on popular views about his Government's schemes, an unambiguous signal about the massive importance he attaches to the Assembly polls due in the State in April-May in 2021.

State President Dilip Ghosh and BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said Modi's personal interest was very encouraging and a morale booster as he enquired about the mood of the voters and their view about different central welfare schemes.

In the 2016 West Bengal Assembly polls, the TMC had won 211 seats, followed by 26 of the Left-Congress alliance and merely three of the BJP. The assembly also has one Anglo-Indian member.

The BJP's vote share was barely above 10 per cent against over 45 per cent of the TMC which dramatically changed in the Lok Sabha poll.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won a little more than 40 per cent of votes compared to over 44 per cent of votes of the TMC.

This has given BJP leadership high-hopes in next year's Assembly poll where it expects majority community's ""unhappiness"" with the ""appeasement"" policy of TMC may sway numbers to its side .

In this regard, BJP expects CAA could strike a right chord with Bengali Hindus.

Even though J P Nadda is currently heading the BJP, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, who has been strategizing on the state even before 2016 and since remained key to the muscular campaign of the BJP in the state, would still be at the center-stage of the electioneering and visit state regularly in the run-up to the polls, party leaders said.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/modi-wants-to-personally-streamline-bjp-s-poll-campaign-in-didi-land.html
86,10-3-20,"RS polls: ADMK, DMK nominate candidates","The AIADMK on Monday nominated former deputy speaker of Lok Sabha

R Thambi Durai, former Minister and party strongman KP Munusamy and Tamil Manila Congress leader GK Vasan as its candidates for the biennial Rajya Sabha election from the State.Six Rajya Sabha members representing Tamil Nadu are retiring in April after their six year tenure necessitating the election. Based on the current party position in the Legislative Assembly, the electoral college, the AIADMK and the DMK can send three members each to the Upper House of the Indian Parliament.The DMK has named Tiruchi Shiva, Anthiyur Selvaraj and N R Elago as candidates for the election to be held on March 26.

Though there were reports that the Congress had requested the DMK for a seat, the former was in for disappointment as the Dravidian major ignored its junior partner this time too.

Thambi Dorai was defeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Karur by the Congress candidate who was supported by the DMK and other alliance parties. Munusamy, who facilitated the easing out of the Sasikala gang from the AIADMK too was defeated in the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Krishnagiri.The AIADMK had made an understanding with the Tamil Manila Congress in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election that it would accommodate Vasan, a former union minister and son of TMC founder late G K Moopanar , as a candidate during the Rajya Sabha election.

The AIADMK list has resulted in a lot of heart burning as there were senior leaders like Dr Mythreyan and the glamorous Gokul Indira who were the front runners for the nomination.

The disappointment of the Congress could be seen from KR Ramasami, leader of the Congress legislature party, who sar grim faced while Tiruchi Shiva filed his nomination on Monday for the March 26 poll.

“This is the second successive snubbing we are getting from the DMK. Last time they nominated MDMK leader Vaiko, who has no locus standi in Tamil Nadu as a Rajya Sabha candidate.

The Congress has been supporting the DMK without any pre-condition all these years. They even rejected our request to nominate former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to the Rajya Sabha from Tamil Nadu,” said a senior Congress leader who did not want his name to be

disclosed.

87,10-3-20,Opp demands immediate release of all political detainees in J&K,"A section of Opposition on Monday demanded the immediate release of all political detainees in Jammu & Kashmir, especially former Chief Ministers Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti saying there is nothing against the three to say that they pose a threat to public safety in J&K or endanger national interest.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, former Mrime Minister HD Deve Gowda, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury, Communist Party of India general secretary D Raja, RJD leader Manoj Kumar Jha, and former Ministers in Atal Bihari Vajpayee Govt Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie issued a joint statement alleging democratic dissent is being ""muzzled"" by ""coercive"" administrative action which has threatened the basic ideals of justice, liberty, equality and fraternity as enshrined in our Constitution. Nothing exemplifies this more starkly than the continuing detention on ""flimsiest of grounds"" of the 3 former J&K Chief Ministers for over 7 months, they said.

Omar and Mehbooba were detained following the Centre's August 5, 2019 decision to abrogate special status of the erstwhile State, besides its bifurcation into 2 UTs. They were booked in February this year under the stringent Public Safety Act. NC president Farooq Abdullah, who was under house arrest, was detained in Sept under PSA.

""There is nothing in the past records of these three leaders to lend credence to the Modi Govt's false and self-serving claim that they pose a threat to 'public safety' in J&K or that they have endangered national interests with their activities,"" the opposition leaders said.

""We demand the immediate release of all political detainees in Kashmir, especially the three former Chief Ministers of J&K,"" they said adding India and its Constitution have always stood for unity in diversity with everybody's views respected, honoured and heard.

""There are growing assaults on democratic norms, fundamental rights and civic liberties of citizens of the Indian Republic. As a result, dissent is not only being stifled, but the avenues of raising critical voices are also being systematically muted,"" the statement alleged.

The leaders said the indefinite detention of three former CMs of J&K and other political activists is a blatant violation of their fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/opp-demands-immediate-release-of-all-political-detainees-in-j-k.html

90,10-3-20,Bhattacharya LF man for RS poll with Cong support,"The CPI(M) is likely to field senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya for the upcoming Rajya Sabha elections, party sources have said. Bhattacharya a former Tripura Advocate General will contest as the Left Front candidate backed by the Congress Party.

While the Left has 28 MLAs in the 294-member State Assembly the Congress has 42 candidates.

The Trinamool Congress had earlier nominated four former Lok Sabha MPs: Dinesh Trivedi, Arpita Ghosh, Mausam Benazir Noor and Subrata Bakshi for the March 26 Upper House elections.

According to sources in the CPI(M) the Bengal unit of the party had earlier proposed the name of former Rajya Sabha MP and party general secretary Sitaram Yechury for contesting the election only to be opposed by the politburo of the Marxist outfit.

Subsequently Bhattacharya’s name was proposed and accepted. Sources in the Congress said that the party is not opposed to the idea of Bhattacharya nominating the senior counsel. Bhattacharya’s chemistry with the Pradesh Congress goes back to 2013 when he took the brief for Senior Congress leader and Bengal Opposition Leader Abdul Mannan the main petitioner in the Sharada chit fund case in the Supreme Court which ordered CBI investigation in both Sharada and Narada sting cases.

A former Mayor of Kolkata Bhattacharya fought on CPI(M) ticket in the 2019 general elections and was the only Left candidate in Bengal who did not forfeit his deposit finishing third behind the Trinamool Congress and the BJP.

Meanwhile, in an unrelated development the BJP has slammed the Mamata Banerjee Government for delaying the announcement of municipal elections. State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said that the State Election Commission was intentionally delaying the announcement of the elections in order to help the ruling Trinamool Congress. The tenure of the most of the civic boards in the State would come to an end in May this year.

“Everyone knows why the announcement of the elections is being delayed. It is being done to help the TMC declare its projects and sanction all the funds,” Ghosh said adding however that the people of the State had made up their mind to remove the TMC from power.

Reacting to his statement Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim said that Ghosh was preparing apology for his party’s defeat in the coming elections. “Everyone knows who will win and who will lose.

91,10-3-20,Oil crashes after Saudi launches price war,"Oil plunged over 20 per cent Monday after top exporter Saudi Arabia launched a price war in response to a failure by leading producers to strike a deal to support energy markets.

The two main contracts both lost about a fifth of their value in morning Asian trade, with West Texas Intermediate sliding to about USD 32 a barrel and Brent crude to about $36 a barrel.

Saudi Arabia launched an all-out oil war Sunday with the biggest cut in its prices in the last 20 years, Bloomberg News reported, after a failure by cartel OPEC and its allies to clinch a deal to cut production.

A meeting of main producers was expected to agree to deeper cuts to counter the impact of the new coronavirus — but Moscow refused to tighten supply.

In response, the Gulf powerhouse cut its price for April delivery by $4-6 a barrel to Asia and $7 to the United States, with Aramco selling its Arabian Light at an unprecedented USD 10.25 a barrel less than Brent to Europe, Bloomberg said.

Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA, said that ""Saudi Arabia seems intent on punishing Russia.

""Oil prices... Will likely be capped over the next few months as coronavirus stalls economic growth, and Saudi Arabia opens the pumps and offers huge discounts on its crude grades.""

Global markets had already fallen heavily in recent weeks due to fears about the coronavirus, which has killed thousands and has spread around the world since emerging in China late last year.

Tokyo stocks were hit heavily hit at the open Monday on fears over the virus and the plunge in oil prices, with the dollar down against the yen.

Just after markets opened, crude prices briefly dropped as much as 30 per cent before gaining back some ground — the biggest fall since the Gulf War in 1991, Bloomberg said.

The new developments are reminiscent of the oil price war that erupted in 2014 and sent oil prices crashing to less than $30 a barrel.

The price fall then battered revenues in the Gulf countries, forcing them to resort to austerity measures and borrowing to plug budget deficits.

On Sunday, shares in the energy-dependent Gulf plunged to multi-year lows after the failure to clinch a deal on production cuts, with all seven bourses in the region in the red.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/oil-crashes-after-saudi-launches-price-war-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/oil-crashes-after-saudi-launches-price-war.html
92,10-3-20,"Ghani, Abdullah Abdullah swear in as Af President","Afghanistan lurched deeper into political crisis on Monday as the rivals for the country’s leadership had themselves sworn in at simultaneous ceremonies that were interrupted by at least two blasts.

The bitter feud between President Ashraf Ghani and his former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah has raised fears for Afghanistan’s fragile democracy as the US prepares to leave the country following an agreement last month with a strong and largely unified Taliban.

Polls were held in September, but repeated delays and accusations of voter fraud meant that Ghani, the incumbent president, was only declared as winner of a second term in February — sparking a furious response from Abdullah, who vowed to form his own parallel government.

On Monday Ghani, dressed in traditional Afghan clothing and white turban, arrived at the presidential palace to be sworn in, surrounded by supporters, senior political figures, diplomats and foreign dignitaries including US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad.

Minutes earlier, in another corner of the sprawling presidential palace compound, a suit-clad Abdullah inaugurated himself as president, vowing to “safeguard the independence, national sovereignty, territorial integrity” of Afghanistan. As hundreds of people watched Ghani’s ceremony, two loud explosions were heard prompting some people to flee. “I have no bulletproof vest on, only my shirt,” Ghani told those who stayed behind as sirens wailed.

“I will stay even if I have to sacrifice my head.” An AFP reporter saw many of those who fled return to their seats after Ghani’s refusal to leave the podium prompted cheers and applause.

The game of thrones has strained the patience of the international community and Afghans alike, with Washington warning earlier that the bickering posed a risk to the US withdrawal deal, which requires the Taliban to hold talks with Kabul.

Widening divisions among Afghan politicians would leave the insurgents with the upper hand in those negotiations.

The row has left many Afghans despairing for their country’s future. “It is impossible to have two presidents in one country,” said Ahmad Jawed, 22, who urged the men “to put their personal interests aside and only think of their country instead of fighting for power”.

He told AFP that “instead of holding oath-taking ceremonies they should talk to each other to find a solution”.

Afghans have shown little enthusiasm for Abdullah, Ghani or the election process in general. Most of them abstained in last year’s lacklustre poll that saw candidates pitch few ideas or policies.",world,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/world/ghani--abdullah-abdullah-swear-in-as-af-president.html

Abdalla Hamdok, a longtime economist, tweeted he was “safe and in good shape” following the explosion. Sudanese state TV said Hamdok had been heading to his office when the attack took place.

Hamdok also tweeted a photo of himself smiling and seated at a large desk, while a TV behind him showed news coverage reporting he’d survived.

The attack highlighted the fragility of Sudan’s transition to civilian rule, almost a year after pro-democracy protesters forced the military to remove autocratic President Omar al-Bashir from power and replace him with a joint military-civilian Government, which has promised to hold elections in three years. However, Sudan’s generals remain the de facto rulers of the country and have shown little willingness to hand over power to civilians.

Hamdok, in his brief statement on Twitter, said, “Rest assured that what happened today will not stand in the way of our transition, instead it is an additional push to the wheel of change in Sudan.”

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. A statement from the prime minister’s office said the attackers used explosives and firearms, and that a security officer was lightly wounded. The statement was read by Faisal Saleh, Sudan’s information minister and interim Government spokesman. He said the convoy was hit near the Kober Bridge.

Footage posted online showed two white, Japanese-made SUVs vehicles typically used by Sudan’s top officials parked on a street, damaged with its widows broken.

Another vehicle was badly damaged in the blast. Several dozen people were seen at the site of the attack, chanting: “With our blood and soul, we redeem you, Hamdok.” The protest movement that led the uprising against al-Bashir called the blast a “terrorist attack.” The statement by the Forces for the Declaration of Freedom and Change called on people to take to the streets to “show our unity and cohesion ...

The complainant alleged that the children were subjected to mental torture by the investigators.

Turlapati also alleged that the children, including girls, were shown morphed pornographic videos and photos by the investigating teams.

The 57-year-old Lt Gen Dhillon, who is from the 1983 batch of the Indian Military Academy, recently handed over the charge of XV Corps to Lt Gen B S Raju. Officials in the Defence Ministry said that the order for Lt Gen Dhillon, who has been credited with several successful people friendly operations in the crucial last year, has been issued and he will assume the charge soon.

He will take charge as DG DIA and DCIDS, an organisation which is responsible for collating technical as well as human intelligence for the three armed forces, they said.

The DIA was created in 2002 on recommendations of a Group of Ministers which looked into lapses leading to the Kargil intrusion in 1999.

The DIA is a nodal agency for all defence related intelligence which collects information technically as well as through satellites to safeguard the interest of the country.

The DIA also forms part of the Multi Agency Centre (MAC), an umbrella of organisations which looks into infiltration of terrorists from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Lt Gen Dhillon's tenure at XV corps began on a challenging note as within a week of his taking over in February last year, the nation witnessed a terror attack on its security forces in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber targeted their convoy in Pulwama on February 14.

Coming to grips with his new role, Lt Gen Dhillon of the Rajputana Rifles, began coordinating operations against the perpetrators of the ghastly attack who were neutralised within 100 hours of the incident and also monitored developments along the Line of Control (LoC) where situation was getting more tense by the day.",india,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/india/lt-gen-kjs-dhillon-to-take-charge-as-dg-dia--dcids.html

In its update on Global Macro Outlook for March, Moody's said the virus outbreak has spread rapidly outside China to a number of major economies. ""It now seems certain that even if the virus is steadily contained, the outbreak will dampen global economic activity well into Q2 of this year,"" it said. Moody's baseline forecasts assume that the number of cases would keep increasing globally and there would be travel restrictions through the April-June period.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 73.99. During the day, it moved northward, though briefly, to touch a high of 73.85.

Succumbing to weakening sentiment, the Indian currency finally settled lower by 30 paise at 74.17 to the American unit.

Meanwhile, crude oil prices were in a free fall, plunging nearly 30 per cent to USD 32.11 per barrel after top exporter Saudi Arabia launched a price war in response to a failure by leading producers to strike a deal to support energy markets.

Brent crude futures, the global oil benchmark, was last trading 21.23 per cent down at USD 35.66 per barrel.

The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's strength against a basket of six currencies, too slipped 0.80 per cent to 95.18. Forex traders said the rupee depreciated versus major trading currencies as a collapse in oil prices added to risk-off sentiment caused by relentless spread of coronavirus across the globe.

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in India has reached 43, according to Health Ministry officials.

On the NSE, it jumped 41.17 per cent to Rs 22.80 during the trading hours.

It settled 32.20 per cent up at Rs 21.35.

In terms of volume, over 72 crore shares were traded on the NSE while BSE saw an exchange of more than 6.9 crore units.

The spurt in volume was more than 3.22 times during the day on the BSE.

SBI on Saturday announced it will pick up 49 per cent stake in Yes Bank for Rs 2,450 crore and clarified that all the deposits and liabilities of the reconstructed bank will continue in the ""same manner"".

""Yes Bank has 255-crore shares of Rs 2 per share. SBI will be issued 245 crore shares at a price of Rs 10 per share for Rs 2,450 crore. This will be 49 per cent of the share capital of the reconstructed bank,"" SBI said in a statement.

104,10-3-20,Petrol price falls below Rs 71,"Petrol prices slipped below Rs 71-mark for the first time in eight months on Monday as India looks set to reap windfall from a price war among oil producers leading to international crude prices crashing by their biggest margin since the 1991 Gulf war.

International oil prices crashed by close to 31 per cent, the second-largest margin on record, after the disintegration of the OPEC+ alliance triggered an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

Brent futures plummeted to about $31 a barrel on Monday as Goldman Sachs warned prices could drop to near $20.

For India, which imports over 84 per cent of its oil needs, the slump would lead to lower import bill and a cut in retail prices but will harm already stressed upstream firms such as ONGC. Lower oil prices will also help economy from its 11-year low growth rate by way of reducing input cost for a lot of sectors.

In Delhi, petrol prices dropped to Rs 70.59 a litre, the lowest since early July 2019, and diesel rate were cut to Rs 63.26, according to a price notification of state-owned firms.

Fuel prices have been on the decline since February 27 on international trends. Petrol prices have in all fallen by Rs 1.42 a litre since then and diesel rates have dropped by Rs 1.44 per litre.

But the only dampener in the entire scheme of things is rupee which settled 23 paise down at 74.10 against the US dollar. A weaker rupee means India pays more for buying the same amount of commodity from overseas. It will also help lower inflation rate.

According to the oil ministry's petroleum planning and analysis cell, India is likely to pay $105.58 billion or Rs 7.43 lakh crore on import of 225 million tonnes of crude oil in the fiscal year 2019-20, which ends this month. This compares to $111.9 billion (Rs 7.83 lakh crore) paid for import of 226.5 million tonnes of oil in 2018-19.

The 2019-20 projection is based on average price of $66 per barrel for the basket of crude oil India imports and average exchange rate of 71 to a US dollar.

Every $ 1 change in crude prices impact India's oil import bill by Rs 2,936 crore. Similarly, every Rs 1/$ change in exchange rate impact crude oil import bill by Rs 2,729 crore.

Oil company officials said the import bill will fall in the next fiscal beginning April but an estimation cannot be made given the extreme volatility in the oil and currency market.

It certainly will translate into lower retail prices of petrol and diesel in the coming days as the current rates do not reflect the slump in international prices, they said.

Retail prices of the day are based on average price of benchmark international fuel of the preceding fortnight. And the drop in prices to $31 will get reflected in retail prices over the next 7-10 days.

The moving average helps narrow the extreme volatility in the prices, they said.

On the negative side, lower oil prices mean they become more competitive versus renewable energy and delay switchover to cleaner fuels in fight against climate change.",business,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/business/petrol-price-falls-below-rs-71.html

106,10-3-20,From lessons of history,"Artist Raghu Vyas’ canvas brings to life a variety of gods and goddesses from Indian epics and mythology

From the majestic portrayal of Lord Krishna’s return to the city of Dwarka after the victory in Mahabharata to the meditative contours of Buddha and Shiva, Delhi-based artist Raghu Vyas’ canvas brings to life a variety of gods and goddesses from our epics and mythology. Known for his unique style popular in the art circles as contemporary imaginary realism but firmly rooted in the Basholi school of miniature art, Vyas is now showing 15 such resplendent oils on canvas in a solo exhibition titled Melange: The Art of Raghu Vyas at the Shridharani Art Gallery.

Says the 64-year-old self-taught artist, “There are many lights, some that light the room and others the inner self. My paintings result from the light of my imagination. It is an emotional light that can convey a feeling, a mood or an idea. It is the light of nostalgia, of a distant memory.”

Vyas’ artworks reflect the formalism of Italian Renaissance designs but are also firmly rooted in the tradition of his hometown Basholi, famous for pahari miniature art. The detailed nuances of colours and form seen in his work reflect this influence. There is eclecticism in the choice of his subjects as well. He works around the human, physical and social landscape. He has progressed through a number of themes over the years — with multiple solo shows including his series on the lotus, Nanak, Buddha, Shiva and multiple portrayals of his beloved Krishna.

In the current show, for instance, the largest work (6 feet x 9 feet) titled Celebration, is about Krishna’s return to Dwarka after the victory of Mahabharata. The painting is significant not only for its scale but also the craftsmanship with which Vyas is able to get every human form and emotion down to its tiniest detail, much in the spirit of miniature art. Then there is Shiva, in a meditative pose, who rises high against a landscape of modern buildings and ruined palaces. The kingdom of Ravana lies floating at the bottom of the work, giving the viewers a feeling that Shiva, the destroyer and the creator, continues to exist even now within us. “Nature is Shiva, everything around comes from him and goes back into him. He is the eternal god and that is how I imagine him. No one knows what he looks like but he is peaceful even amid destruction,” says Vyas.

One of the most poignant works in the show is that of Guru Nanak on a visit to a carpenter’s house. This large work is a descriptive ode to how Nanak taught equality of all castes and religions. “Every painting has both history and teaching. And whether it is the unconditional love of Krishna, the teaching of Nanak or the spiritualism of Buddha, it is all relevant to each one of us even today,” the artist says as he signs off.

(The exhibition is on view from March 12 till March 20 at Shridharani Art Gallery, Triveni Kala Sangam.)

107,10-3-20,Mary confirms Tokyo ticket,"London Olympic Bronze medallist Mary Kom (51kg) secured her second appearance at the mega quadrennial Games with a flawless 5-0 win over Irish Magno of Philippines as she entered the semi-finals of the Asian/Oceanian Olympic Qualifiers in Amman, Jordan today. With Mary’s win, India now has seven quotas for the Tokyo 2020 Games.

Riding on her barrage of left cross and clear punches, the six-time world champion established her supremacy early on in the bout and refused to relent as the match progressed. She will now take on reigning Asian Games Gold medallist Yuan Chang of China in her quest for a spot in the final of this event.

Earlier in the day, World Championships silver medallist Amit Panghal (52kg) defeated Carlo Paalam of Philippines 4-1 to secure the sixth quota for India at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics by entering the semi-finals.

World Championships Bronze medallist Manish Kaushik (63kg), meanwhile, went down 2-3 to third seed and Asian Games Silver medallist Chinzorig Baatarsukh of Mongolia in a hard-fought quarter-final. Kaushik can still fulfil his Olympic dream as with 6 boxers qualifying from 63kg, he will get once more chance with a box-off opportunity, where the losing quarterfinalist players will have yet another shot.

In his quest, Manish will face Harrison Garside of Australia in the box-off bout on 11th and a win there will secure his Olympic quota.

It was however, the end of the road in the Asian Qualifiers for former world youth champion Sakshi Chaudhary (57kg) who was blanked 0-5 by Korea's Im Aeji in the quarter-finals.

Panghal, who was the lone bright spot for the Indian contingent in the first session today, had earlier beaten his opponent in the semi-finals of the 2018 Asian Games and the quarter-finals of the 2019 World Championships as well. The familiarity helped him stave off a late resistance from the Southeast Asian Games gold medallist and book his Olympic berth for the very first time.

“I had played my opponent twice and had beaten him as well. I came with a lot of confidence to get the win this time too. I executed whatever strategy my coaches had chalked out. I am glad that gave me the win as well as the Olympic quota. In the next round, I play a Chinese boxer whom I have beaten before at the Asian Championships. The aim is to repeat it and move into the final,” said the Asian Games champion after his win.

He will next take on China’s Hu Jianguan, a Bronze medallist at the Rio Olympics as well as the 2019 Asian Championships.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/mary-confirms-tokyo-ticket.html
108,10-3-20,Don’t have words to express my joy: Satish,"The first super heavyweight (+91kg) Indian boxer to qualify for the Olympic Games, veteran Satish Kumar on Monday said a “secret strategy” and loads of luck has made the last couple of years the best of his decade-long career.

Kumar is an Asian Games Bronze-medallist (2014), a Commonwealth Games Silver-winner (2018) and a two-time Bronze-winner at the Asian Championships (2015 and 2019). He qualified for his maiden Olympics — in Tokyo later this year — by making the semifinals of the ongoing Asia/Oceania Qualifiers in Amman, Jordan ate Sunday night.

“This would be my first Olympic Games, I don’t have words to express how happy I am. Add to this, I am the first Indian super heavyweight to qualify for an Olympics. Wow! That’s quite something,” Kumar told PTI in a telephonic interview from Amman.

“I count myself so lucky. Luck has been on my side for the last couple of years. It has played a huge role in where I am today,” he added without divulging the specifics of how fortune has favoured him.

The 30-year-old has been India’s go-to man in the category, representing the country at major events almost exclusively for a decade now.

“I have toiled so much for so many years, won medals here and there but nothing compares to this. I am over the moon,” said the man from Bulandhshahr in Uttar Pradesh.

The imposing boxer started his career back in 2010 and has five national titles under belt.

“But the last two years have by far been the best of my career. There hasn’t been a better phase,” he said referring to the CWG and the Asian Championship medals.

“I have been so much more faster, my stance is way better than what it used to be and all this has got me better results. Lot of work has gone into making me better and I am thankful to the coaches for their analysis and support ,” he added.

Asked what exactly he has done to turn it around, Kumar responded with a hearty laughter at first.

“There are some strategies which can never be revealed to anyone. They are a secret. All I can say is that I have worked very, very hard to get here.”

It is this hard work, which Kumar hopes would fetch him the rewards in Tokyo and he isn't even thinking about the novel Coronavirus threat which has thrown international sports calendars haywire.

“I don’t think Olympic would be affected. In any case, there are doctors to ensure that there is no problem,” he said trying to evade any elaborate response to a question on the health crisis, which has led to more than 3,000 deaths and left more than one lakh infected globally.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/don---t-have-words-to-express-my-joy--satish.html
109,10-3-20,Advantage Barcelona,"Real Madrid gave up a late goal to fall 1-2 to Real Betis and slip to second place in La Liga just a week after taking the lead by beating Barcelona in the Clasico.

The Blancos came into Sunday’s match at Seville’s Benito Villamarin stadium trailing Barca by 2 points after the Blaugrana’s hard-fought victory on Saturday over Real Sociedad, reports Efe news.

But Zinedine Zidane’s men came up against a 14th-place Betis side determined to put more distance between themselves and the drop zone ahead of next weekend's derby against Sevilla.

Betis started ambitiously and the visitors responded by trying to control midfield. Luka Modric, Toni Kroos and Casemiro gradually took charge and began to get balls forward.

Vinicius Jr. threatened the Betis goal, yet Real Madrid seemed in no hurry to press the attack, preferring to wait for openings on the counter.

That approach carried risks and only Marc Bartra’s lack of finishing prevented Betis from drawing first blood on a set piece. Minutes later, Nabil Fekir forced a great stop from Blancos keeper Thibaut Courtois.

In the 40th minute, Madrid’s Sergio Ramos clattered into Fekir and the ball rolled to Betis defender Sidnei, who hammered home to put the hosts ahead 1-0.

But it didn’t take long for Sidnei to go from hero to villain, fouling Marcelo in first-half stoppage time to hand Real Madrid an opportunity from the penalty spot.

Karim Benzema converted — his first goal in eight matches — to bring the Blancos level.

Despite conceding just before the break, Betis started the second half with drive and enthusiasm. Modric had to make a goal-line stand to thwart Joaquin Sanchez with Courtois caught out of position.

Blancos defender Ferland Mendy, who replaced Marcelo at the hour mark, hit the cross-bar going for the potential match-winner and the final phase of the match was wide open.

It was another sub, former Barcelona man Cristian Tello, who decided the contest for Betis, beating Courtois in the 82nd minute to make it 2-1.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/advantage-barcelona.html

111,10-3-20,Juve reign supreme,"Cristiano Ronaldo attempted to add levity to a troubling situation in virus-struck Italy before helping Juventus to a 2-0 win over Inter Milan in Serie A on Sunday.

The Derby d'Italia, one of the season’s biggest matches, had to be played without fans and with only a limited number of people because of the virus outbreak in Italy.

When Ronaldo got off the team bus inside the stadium, he pretended to high-five imaginary mascots - something he normally does with the actual mascots - before smiling at the cameras.

Aaron Ramsey scored and set up the other goal for Paulo Dybala as the match finally went ahead, a week late due to the spread of the new coronavirus in Italy.

Juventus moved back to the top of the table, a point above Lazio. Inter is third, nine points behind the Bianconeri following a miserable return to Juventus for coach Antonio Conte.

“An important victory, even if there are still many matches to play, in theory,” Juventus coach Maurizio Sarri said.

Sarri's use of the phrase “in theory” could prove significant after calls for the Serie A season to be suspended.

“The know-it-alls scare me, I can’t say what’s right to do,” Sarri added. “But I ask myself if it’s right to take away a two-hour diversion in front of the television for those who have to stay at home.

“We don’t feel scared, but I can’t say how high the risk is.”

The match was played in an empty stadium - including no mascots - following last week’s decree from the Italian government that all sporting events in Italy must take place without spectators until April 3.

That led to Thursday’s decision that the Italian soccer league would resume in full this weekend, starting with the matches that were postponed last round because of the outbreak.

No fans meant there was no fiery welcome for Conte, who was returning to Juventus for the first time as opposition coach. Conte, who left in 2014, led Juventus to the first three of its eight straight league titles and also spent most of his playing career with the Bianconeri.

The voices of players and coaches could clearly be heard and, despite the lack of fans, there was plenty of intensity and passion shown on the field.

Inter goalkeeper Samir Handanovi? made a number of crucial saves before Juventus broke the deadlock 10 minutes into the second half.

Ronaldo failed to control Blaise Matuidi's pullback and it turned into an assist for Ramsey, who fired Juventus in front.

Ramsey also had a part in Juve's second goal, playing a one-two with Dybala following a delightful team move. Dybala then feinted past Inter defender Ashley Young before shooting into the bottom left corner.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/juve-reign-supreme.html
112,10-3-20,"Spurs need to ‘write new stories’, says Lloris","Hugo Lloris has challenged Tottenham to “write new stories” in the Champions League, even though they will take the positives from last season’s sensational comeback against Ajax in the semi-final.

Spurs looked to be sunk when trailing 3-0 on aggregate in the second leg of the tie last May but Lucas Moura’s second-half hat-trick in Amsterdam saw them knock out the Dutch giants in dramatic circumstances.

Spurs, then under the leadership of Mauricio Pochettino, lost 2-0 in the final to Liverpool in Madrid.

Tottenham need another memorable away day if they are to progress further than the last-16 in this campaign, with Timo Werner’s penalty handing Bundesliga high-flyers RB Leipzig a 1-0 win in north London last month.

“We have to take everything positive but I think it belongs to the past, we need to write new stories,” said goalkeeper and captain Lloris, referring to the Ajax match.

“We have to go there and be ready to make the perfect game, we have to go there to win the game. It is as simple as that.

“But the opponent is a very, very good team. I'm not surprised that they are fighting for the title in the Bundesliga.”

While Leipzig have their sights trained on domestic glory, Tottenham will be merely content to book their spot in Europe’s elite club competition next term.

A 1-1 draw at Burnley on Saturday left them eighth in the Premier League table and facing an uphill battle to finish in the top four.

“I don’t know what's going to happen for the rest of the season but we need to keep faith and keep working,” said Lloris.

“We can see players are fighting and giving their best. The confidence is not up there but we are working for that and we are working to finish the season as high as we can.”",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/spurs-need-to----write-new-stories-----says-lloris.html

114,10-3-20,The portraits of ladies,"Artist Bharti Prajapati’s exhibition of paintings, Earth Story — The Elements, is yet another approach to portray the rural woman in all their glory while equating them to the eternal female force. By Team Viva

The art practice of Bharti Prajapati bears a distinct edge. While the core form of her works reflects her art background, the overall effect moves beyond her artistic boundaries, venturing into the space of design. This is because the artist is also a craftsperson who uses both the sensibilities in her creations. Thus the canvas portrays artistic creativity engineered with a charming repetitiveness.

In her latest exhibition titled, Earth Story — The Elements, the artist resurrects a repertoire of rural sensibilities even as she propagates the idea that the universe is made of the five elemental things in nature. She concretises this philosophy in her art by showing their presence in our bodily forms, the earth our mother and the cosmos overhead. Thereafter, she infuses her feminine forms in a harmonic rhythm within the canvas space.

She said, “Nature along with its moods and patterns are imbibed in our physical and physiological evolution. We are a part of this complex puzzle, which I attempt to portray through my collection of oil paintings. This collection is a collage of colours and forms constantly visible around us and how we recreate them in our everyday lifestyle and space.”

In her works, she said, each colour is given a definite space. The potential of colour usage is taken to a new level through their vibrant play, not as a blending of hues but as distinct segments of shading.

Talking about her inspiration and work Bharti said, “My figures have evolved over the years and what started as a rural canvas with the depiction of women with a village backdrop slowly turned into a portrait of the women in their elements. I explored the possibility of eliminating the pictures and colours which I thought were cluttering up space. However, instead, the blank space was interesting to play around with. My attempt was to achieve a fine balance between realism and abstract work of art.”

The natural elements, she believes, are “forever giving and nourishing its beings just like the mother earth. Our rivers flow through the lengths and breadths of the country with vital life-giving water. The fire element plays an important role in creation of new life. The air, on the other hand, is yet another invisible element we are surrounded with and is as crucial for our existence. Last, space represents the vast universe above us. These are the elements we experience and interact to every moment in our lives.”

The subject of her paintings reflect her fascination with the many roles that women play. Bharti chisels their forms into statuesque proportions, using the brush as her crafting tool. The repetitive use of a monotone overall, gives the entire image a rhythmic patterning, making for a unique end product.

Rural women often dominate Bharti’s paintings. Asked why, she says, “Roles of the women and their bonding with the surrounding has been my constant source of inspiration and vocabulary. Rustic backdrops and earthy tones in my paintings get combined with ethnic emotions bringing about a subtle rootedness in the expression. My extensive travels to the villages of India create bonds beyond my practice. The endeavour was to resurrect a repertoire of rural sensibilities, some of what is fast-moving in oblivion.”

She adds that such a connection keeps her abreast with transformations taking place in the Indian rural milieu. She peruses compositions myriad in colours, textures and figures, evoking distinct emotions. Mother earth, goddesses, shakti, one tribe have been the themes of some of her solo shows.

Bharti’s paintings also intrinsically incorporate elaborate patterns and designs in textiles, jewellery and the walls paintings. The sensibility of crafts tradition and texture enlivens spans of her canvas.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-portraits-of-ladies-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-portraits-of-ladies.html
115,10-3-20,The Home Affair,"With the shadow of coronavirus looming large, here are a few ways to have a safe Holi. By Team Viva

Usually, at this time bright colours fill the air and people miss no opportunity to be playful. But this time around, the must-haves to celebrate Holi are not gulaal and pichkaari, and rather masks and sanitisers. Be it metros, local markets or malls, there are indications that the awareness about coronavirus is spiking as more and more people are staying at home and avoiding huge gatherings. The government has taken several steps to ensure that the spread of the disease can be arrested. This will naturally play the spoiler for the big Holi bash that is the norm.

Here are a few ways to celebrate the festival under the threat of coronavirus.

More of a family affair

Asymptomatic people can also spread the infection, which is why social distancing and personal hygiene is important. So, if you have a large Holi gathering and go from house to house, the risk of getting the infection increases. This is the reason many societies and offices are cancelling Holi celebrations and keeping it to their closed groups. Rakesh Sheth, founder of

& Stirred, said, “The best way to play safe Holi is to avoid concerts and public gatherings and stick to small catch-up with closed ones.”

Not only Delhiites, it’s the same even for Bollywood celebrities. For actor Urvashi Rautela, the celebrations this time will be an intimate affair with family and friends. “I am celebrating with my friends and family this year at home because of the coronavirus scare. It is going to be an intimate affair with lots of food and fun,” said Urvashi.

Even the shoot of actor C Joseph Vijay’s forthcoming release, Master, has been wrapped. It was announced yesterday that a grand audio launch would take place on March 15. However, unlike the time when a huge stadium would be booked to accommodate fans for such an event, the makers have decided to avoid making it a big-crowd event owing to the fear of coronavirus.

Garden and terrace parties with dry and herbal colours

This time, Holi on terrace with a close circle is a great idea for many as they are avoiding social gatherings and society parties. Recently, a coronavirus case was suspected in Raj Nagar Extension of Ghaziabad. Not surprisingly, it had a ripple effect. Deepa Garg, resident, Anandam Villas, which is in the same area, said that the society called off the Holi party this time and people are organising garden and terrace parties. “There are a bunch of parties on terrace that have already started. One can match steps with loud Bollywood numbers and throw dry, herbal colours at each other,” she added.

More focus on music and food

Food and music form the essence of this festival with its own signature delights and Bollywood hits like Balam Pichkari, Badri Ki Dulhania, Rang Barse, Let’s Play Holi and more. Though traditional dishes are made and consumed every time but this time it can take the centre stage of the celebration. A student from Dehradun who is in town to celebrate the festival, Harsh Shahi, said, “Along with parties, I wait for Holi to get treated with Gujiyas, Dahi vada, Aloo chaat, Malpua, Thandai and more. But this time the virus has left me only with this option. No public parties or pichkari (water guns) waali Holi.”

Flower petals replacing colours

In the recent years, there have been awareness drives on water conservation and impact of harmful colours on our skin. As a result, people have mostly been using herbal and dry colours. But this time in the wake of the virus, the emphasis is more on flower petals. Recently, a case of coronavirus was suspected in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad. A resident of Vardaan Apartments in the area, Abhay Sharma, said that most of the people in his society will play with flower petals this time and avoid the use of colours. He said, “We play with eco-friendly colours every year but this time due to the virus outbreak, we are planning to avoid colours and only play with rose, lotus, and marigold petals.”

Is alcohol high on agenda?

Holi is synonymous with rang aur bhang. Bhang lassi is the most popular form of bhang consumed in the country, especially on this festival. Served in the form of thandai, pakoda and gujiya, it is an integral part of the colourful celebrations. But this time, people seem to ditch this tradition and load their homes with fancy bottles as they want to relax and enjoy it indoors.

Keep sanitiser at doorstep

If you decide to play Holi this time, ensure that everyone you play with is not displaying any symptoms for the virus. Also, make sure that you follow some precautionary measures and ask your guests too to do the same. Keep a sanitiser at the doorstep so that guests can use it before entering the home. “If you are currently showing any sign of respiratory tract infection (cough, frequent sneezing, runny nose etc) even mild, it’s better to avoid playing and attending any parties. Don’t forget the mask. It will help you recover faster and also protect others from getting exposed,” said Dr Chhavi Kiran Gupta, assistant professor at department of preventive and social medicine, Subharti Medical College.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/the-home-affair-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/the-home-affair.html
116,10-3-20,Trend Blaer,"‘Happy to see Shubh Mangal... response’

Actor Ayushmann Khurrana is happy with the response to Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.

“When you do a film on a taboo topic, you have to first plan on how are you going to spread the message of the film. So, for us, when we decided to take up a subject like legitimacy of same-sex relationships, we decided to do it through humour. It is because of that decision Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan is a success today,” he said.

He says it was a very tricky subject to make a film on. Ayushmann hopes many more films like Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan are made from here on and producers are ready to put their money on such important cinema.

‘There’s so much to do and explore in life. I am glad that Indian industry accepted me and welcomed with open arms. I agree it was not easy for me to become an online sensation. There was a lot of hardwork involved but still there is a long way to go. I have so much to learn and experience. My real journey has just started.’

—Shirley Setia

Actor Karisma Kapoor, who is also a mother of two children, feels it is important to have conversations with the kids.

She is now all set to make her comeback into acting projects with the web show Mentalhood, which will take the audience on the crazy ride of motherhood.

She also spoke about how to make homemade food cool for children. “It is something you have to engrain in your children at a young age. When they are younger, you have to make the food look interesting,” Karisma added.

Kylie, Travis are a couple again

Reality TV star Kylie Jenner and rapper Travis Scott are reportedly back together following their split in October 2019.

“The couple has always had love and respect for one another but took a break last year because they both had so much going on. They couldn’t fully focus on what it took to make the relationship work,” a source said.

“Kylie exploded in the make-up world and was busy making a billion dollar business and Travis was on tour and working on music. Although things haven’t slowed down much for the duo, they’re better able to handle it. Finally, they are happy to be back together,” added the source.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/trend-blaer-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/trend-blaer.html
117,10-3-20,Nurture your dreams,"While the International Women’s Day is done and dusted, there are those who would not stop to celebrate a day but carry on with their set of duties in a manner of everyday ordinariness. Taniya Sanyal, the first female aviation firefighter, feels that just like a home is incomplete without a woman so is every organisation. By Ayushi Sharma

Becoming the first woman firefighter is a feat in itself. Did you always want to be one?

Since my childhood, I have always dreamt of taking up challenging tasks and wanted to choose the path less travelled. I still remember the day when I saw the recruitment advertisement in the newspaper. I was well-aware of the risks involved in the job but this was something I really wanted to pursue, so I applied for the position. I am really grateful to the Airport Authority of India (AAI) for giving me with this opportunity.

What made you choose this profession?

I was always inspired and felt motivated when I saw women occupying top positions, especially in the Indian Armed forces. I believe, a fortunate few get the opportunity to be able to live a life that can make a difference to others as well. Considering that it would be an opportunity to serve people and my country, I took up the task to become a firefighter and trained myself in every aspect to clear both physical as well as written tests.

More and more women are proving their mettle by stepping into unconventional professions, from firefighting service to the Armed Forces... What does the future look like for women?

In my opinion, women can achieve anything they desire and there are many live examples of the same. Pick any beat and you would find woman playing either vital roles or they are the decision-makers. The future is bright, considering, women are now ready to explore more options, to do what their heart desires. As a home is incomplete without a woman, similarly, every organisation is incompetent without a woman playing an active role in it.

Being the only woman, how challenging was it to make a name for yourself in this field?

The challenges were many, but then, I was supported by my instructors and trainers at every level. Hard work cannot be ignored or dismissed in any field but everyone needs the right guidance and support. I had to pass different written tests and then there were medical, driving and physical tests that were required to be cleared by the firefighter aspirants. Among other tasks, I had to prove my physical strength by runing long distances, sprinting, climbing ladders and carrying a 40 kg sandbag for a distance of 60 metres. I knew, if others can do it, so can I.

Recently, in an interview, you said, “Apart from physical barriers, women need to cross their mental barriers as well.” Why do you think so?

I feel, overcoming the mental barrier is half the work done. I want every woman on the planet to believe one thing — everything is possible. We all should be confident about our own capabilities and when I applied for this role, I had the same belief. I knew I will do something different and challenging in my life but my dedication and self-belief made me the first woman firefighter of the Airport Authority of India. The only thing necessary is to nurture our dreams with undivided focus. The confidence and self-trust are all that are required in any field. I would again say, if others can do it, so can I/we.

With the rising debate around gender equality, do you think today’s women do not need to be empowered, they just need to be motivated?

Women’s rights and gender equality have come a long way but this totally depends from region to region. There are some areas that still need to overcome the stereotype of not sending a girl child to school and then there are some women who only need a little push and they would achieve the heights they themselves had not imagined. The greatest source of inspiration in my life is my grandmother. She has always encouraged me to choose a career that I can enjoy from the core of my heart. I would say, she played a vital role in making me the woman I am today. There’s a saying that women are leaders everywhere you look — from the CEO who runs an MNC to the housewife who raises her children and heads her household. Our country was built by strong women and we will continue to break down walls and defy stereotypes.",vivacity,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/nurture-your-dreams-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/vivacity/nurture-your-dreams.html
118,10-3-20,Krasinski has the most incredible partner,"Actor-director John Krasinski says wife Emily Blunt is the “most tremendous actress of our time.”

The actor-turned-filmmaker has worked with his wife on A Quiet Place and then its sequel. He shared his admiration for his wife of nearly 10 years at the red carpet of the premiere of their film A Quiet Place Part II here.

“She is without a doubt the most tremendous actress of our time in my opinion,” said Krasinski in a daily.

Krasinski, who wrote and directed the sequel, said that Blunt isn’t just a wonderful actress, but an amazing collaborator too.

“She is the most incredible partner in writing and directing and set designs. She just has such good ideas,” said Krasinski, 40, adding, “So I actually felt like I had my partner in all things on set, not just the best actress in the world. Anything I can think of, she makes 10 times better so that’s a pretty good weapon to have on set.”

A Quiet Place was about a post-apocalyptic world where humans are the prey of fast-moving creatures who track victims by sound. The 2018 film revolved around a family struggling to survive in a world where making the slightest sound draws the attention of a predatory alien species that has taken over the planet.

The official synopsis for A Quiet Place Part II read, “Following the deadly events at home, the Abbott family (Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds, Noah Jupe) must now face the terrors of the outside world as they continue their fight for survival in silence. Forced to venture into the unknown, they quickly realise that the creatures that hunt by sound are not the only threats that lurk beyond the sand path.”

Talking about second part, Krasinski said, “I did not even want to do a sequel unless it was as organic and personal as the first one. This one feels as much, if not more so.”

119,10-3-20,The gut painters,"With themes of love, womanhood, unity and divinity, the Christie’s auction features a selection of works by artists from the South Asian subcontinent. By Uma Nair

A hundred years of creative endeavours and a thousand artistic expressions — the Christies’ auction at New York features a selection of works representing legends from the South Asian subcontinent.

The sale is led by a seminal Untitled (1983) painting by Vasudeo S Gaitonde, alongside exceptional paintings by members of the Progressive Artists’ Group and their associates such as FN Souza, MF Husain, Akbar Padamsee, SH Raza and Tyeb Mehta. More highlights include important works by other pioneers of modern South Asian art such as Jagdish Swaminathan, Jehangir Sabavala, MV Dhurandhar, Sadequain, George Keyt and Zainul Abedin.

Gaitonde’s Painted prayer

The leading coveting cover of VS Gaitonde is an evocative work that looks like a painted prayer. Dyaneshwar Nadkarni in 1983 said, “The central characteristic of Gaitonde’s artistic personality, it must be understood, is that he likes to stand alone. This independent-mindedness was accompanied by a firm belief in his identity as a painter.”

As recent as 2015, Hemant Sareen noted, “What makes Gaitonde at once represent and stand apart from the Indian modern tradition goes beyond his immersion into its shared language or even his restrained aesthetics with its universal vocabulary. For many of his contemporaries, the language was just a tool to express something. For Gaitonde, the language became not just the subject — it was the expression. He did not attempt to use line and colour to create forms. His forte was the exploration of the relationship between line and colour. If he captured the essence of Indian modernism, it was by disengaging from its effusion, its gaiety and its materialism.”

Husain’s Mithun III

Mesmeric in many ways is MF Husain’s Mithun III (1963). Husain’s romanticism revels in this tender depiction of a man sitting with his reclining lover, bathed in moonlight, enshrouded by a blue night sky. To the side of the outstretched woman, Husain places a deliberately ambiguous animal that hovers between the mortal and the divine. The title, Mithun, literally meaning couple or lovers, is derived from the Sanskrit term mithuna, which was used to describe the loving couples found in classical Indian paintings and temple sculpture. This enigmatic representation has been used to symbolise fertility, union, divinity and worldly pleasure. Husain, in the first half of the 1960s, turned to this theme of mithuna several times, most notably in his iconic painting of the same name from 1964.

Tyeb Mehta’s Reclining Nude

Of rare resonance is Tyeb Mehta’s Reclining Nude (1959). Mehta’s own words in the catalogue talks about his predicament and perspective.

He said, “Expression was all-important. Expressionism appeals to the viewer directly... Munch, Kokoschka, Emil Nolde weren’t painters in the tradition of painting. They were ‘gut’ painters. And I too was painting from the gut.”

This painting is also reminiscent of the Western tradition of the romantic trope of the odalisque, most notably adopted by artists Henri Matisse and Paul Gauguin. Mehta adopts this odalisque style not just as an arena for expression but as a monument to femininity. This painting depicts a woman outstretched on an abstracted background. This abstracted female appears in several of Mehta’s paintings over this brief period treated with an almost deferential, loving respect.

As the 1950s drew to a close, this is one of the last examples of the artist’s subtle and vulnerable early works, which preceded his gestural abstracted style of the 1960s. This tender portrait was exhibited in 1959 in Mehta’s first solo show at the Jehangir Art Gallery in Mumbai, organised by Gallery 59, owned by his friend and gallerist Bal Chhabda. The painting was acquired by Emanuel Schlesinger, an emigre businessman who advised and encouraged several young artists in India at the time, frequently acquiring their work to support them financially as well.

Souza’s Spanish Landscape

Spanish Landscape, an inchoate work painted in 1958, reflects Souza’s interpretation of the complex Romanesque architecture encountered on a trip to Spain that year. Similar to the architecture of churches in the Portuguese colonies of Goa, the roofs and steeples of the buildings in this painting recall the fortified chapels, monasteries and castles of various Spanish hill towns. Souza draws our eyes to these structures by placing them at the cynosure of the painting, where the rolling hills and the sky appear to meet. Rather than cataclysmic, the manmade structures of this citadel appear quiet and brooding, corresponding to the dark hills and bare trees that surround them. Souza admired both Spanish hymns and music.

In the 1959 showcase, in which the landscape was first exhibited, Neville Wallis noted, “One can detect in his style an amalgamation of Indian, Byzantine and Picasso esque strains. It is created with an implacable force that is usually considered as the peculiar problem of Eastern artists in Europe. But the pertinent question is just how expressive a vehicle Souza has made of his painting.” Rather than “hardening into a strait-jacket formula, there has been a loosening, a greater freedom in the linear organisation of his townscapes which glow like stained glass. But in all his work, one is conscious of the inexorable daemon that drives this artist, the first Indian contemporary to gain a high distinction in the West.” (N. Wallis, F.N. Souza, exhibition catalogue, London, 1959, unpaginated).

120,10-3-20,Liverpool’s stellar season not normal: Milner,"James Milner believes there is a risk that Liverpool’s achievements are being taken for granted, saying their spectacular season “isn’t normal” as they close in on the Premier League title.

Jurgen Klopp’s side are two wins away from lifting the league crown for the first time in 30 years after amassing 82 points from 29 matches.

Liverpool returned to winning ways on Saturday, beating Bournemouth 2-1 after three defeats in four matches in all competitions to set a new top-flight record of 22 consecutive home league wins.

Despite their remarkable record, midfielder Milner said winning was not as easy as Liverpool had made it look, shown by their recent wobble.

“It is so hard to win the league. The amount of games we have won in a row — that isn't normal,” said the 34-year-old.

“You can win the league and you can drop points in a few games but to win this many games is not normal and people then start thinking it is easy.”

Milner spoke about his experience of relegation with Leeds in 2004, saying: “You think it is just an impossible task to win a game of football.”

Asked whether Liverpool's form had been taken for granted this season, Milner added: “It can be. Winning is tough and when you have won that many games everybody thinks, ‘Oh they are going to win again, the title is done’.

“It’s not, because you have to go out there and win the games. No one gives you it.”

“What the team has done this season has been unbelievable,” he added.

The return to winning ways has given Liverpool a confidence boost ahead of Wednesday’s pivotal Champions League last-16 second leg tie against Atletico Madrid at Anfield, where Klopp’s side must overturn a 1-0 deficit.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/liverpool---s-stellar-season-not-normal--milner.html
121,10-3-20,Bengal strike late to edge ahead,"Heavyweight Cheteshwar Pujara turned up with fever as Bengal nosed ahead against a scratchy Saurashtra in what was was an attritional opening day’s play in the Ranji Trophy final here.

Avi Barot (54 off 142) and Vishvaraj Jadeja (54 off 92) struck gritty half-centuries before Bengal pacer Akash Deep struck late in the final session to leave Saurashtra at 206 for five at stumps on Monday.

Pacer Akash Deep, who was Bengal;s standout bowler with three wickets, had Chetan Sakariya caught behind, bringing the end of day's play. With the pacers doing the bulk of the job, only 80.5 overs could be bowled.

An unwell Pujara walking off the field after scoring five off 24 balls put the home team in a spot of bother after Barot (54 off 142) and Jadeja (54 off 92) had played themselves in.

The India player, who returned from New Zealand only a couple of days ago, had fever due to throat infection but will bat on the second day, said skipper Jaydev Unadkat.

Bengal may have the edge after day one but Saurashtra batsman Vishvaraj said another 100 runs on the slow and low surface will be of immense value.

“The surface used for the semi-final had a lot more bounce but this one is low and slow. Another 100-150 runs will be really good for us. It is not a typical Rajkot wicket. Having said that, we lost one wicket too many,” he said.

Saurashtra, playing their first final at home, opted to bat in friendly conditions.

The Bengal pace attack has delivered all season and the team relied on them to get the early breakthroughs.

Ishan Porel and Mukesh Kumar tested Harvik Desai (38) and Barot in their opening spell but the openers did well to take Saurashtra to 77 for no loss in 35 overs at lunch. Luck also smiled on the home team with Bengal grassing three difficult catches in the session. Desai was dropped twice while Barot got one life.

Bengal got their first wicket in the third over after lunch when Desai, surprised by the extra bounce generated by left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed, pushed it straight into the hands of the silly-point fielder to leave his team at 82 for one in the 38th over.

Though there was assistance on offer for spinners, Ahmed was content to bowl the containing line and bowled as many as 20 overs in his first spell, majority of them from over the wicket, with pacers operating from the other end.

Vishvaraj then got together with Barot and opted for an aggressive approach against Ahmed, hitting the spinner for three consecutive boundaries.

Medium pacer Akash Deep provided the second wicket to Bengal when he removed a well-set Barot with a ball that pitched around off stump and straightened, taking a faint edge to Wriddhiman Saha.

Vishvaraj and centurion of the semi-final against Gujarat, Arpit Vasavada (29 not out), took Saurashtra to 155 for two in 61 overs. It was a surprise that Pujara did not come out to bat at number four, his usual position for the state team. He bats at number three for India in Test cricket.

Bengal pacers lifted their game in the final session with Akash Deep castling Jadeja with a sharp incoming ball soon after the batsman completed his second half century of the season.

Two overs later, Porel trapped Saurashtra's leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson who had got going with two cover drives off Kumar’s tempting half-volleys. Hero of the semi-final against Karnataka, Kumar was guilty of offering too many freebies to the opposition.

Jackson’s fall finally brought Pujara in the middle but he walked off the field looking unwell.

The ball often kept low in the final session, signs that the batsmen's job is only going to get tougher.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/bengal-strike-late-to-edge-ahead-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/bengal-strike-late-to-edge-ahead.html
122,10-3-20,"Upheaval in MP, all Nath Ministers quit","RS poll a trigger: 17 Scindia loyalist legislators parked in Karnataka

On the eve of Holi, Madhya Pradesh stared at a new political crisis with the continuing power tussle between Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia taking a serious turn that put the very existence of the 14-month-old Congress Government at risk in the State.

On Monday night (around 10 pm) the crisis deepened as all Ministers in the Nath Cabinet submitted their resignations during an emergency meeting called by the CM who had earlier cut short his Delhi visit where he met party high command Sonia Gandhi and rushed to Bhopal after intense speculation about a possible revolt by a faction led by Scindia who, along with at least 17 Congress MLAs, went incommunicado.

“We have expressed our solidarity with the Chief Minister and submitted resignations to him in the Cabinet meeting,” the senior Minister told PTI.

Later, these MLAs — half-a-dozen of whom are Ministers in the Nath Government — loyal to disgruntled senior leader Scindia resurfaced in BJP-ruled Karnataka leading to doubts being raised over their actual motive.

The candidature for Rajya Sabha elections slated for March 26 is being said to be the main trigger for matters reaching a flashpoint as Nath and his loyalists have pitched for sending Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi to the Upper House from MP. In the meantime, speculation doing the rounds even suggested a meeting between Scindia and the BJP central leadership in Delhi.

Meanwhile, late on Monday night, former Chief Minister and BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan met Home Minister Amit Shah for two hours over MP developments. State BJP legislature party is likely to meet in Bhopal on Tuesday.

Nath, who was here to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi to apprise her about the situation in the State, had to rush back to do the fire-fighting.

Congress sources said, “It has less to do with the BJP as was doubted earlier but more to do with the infighting within the party. It could very well be an arm-twisting tactic by Scindia to secure his Rajya Sabha berth.” This, after last week’s drama wherein the Congress blamed the BJP for “abducting” its MLAs as part of its poaching attempts to topple the Nath dispensation.

Of the three Rajya Sabha seats from the State, the Congress and BJP look set to retain a seat each. The tussle is for the third seat. Scindia had wanted the safer seat for himself. But Nath has instead pitched for Priyanka.

The seats will fall vacant as the Rajya Sabha terms of Congress veteran Digvijay Singh and BJP leaders Prabhat Jha and Satyanarayan Jatiya will end on April 9.

In the 230-member Assembly, the Congress has 114 MLAs and has the support of seven other MLAs, including those from the BSP, SP and Independents. The BJP has 107 MLA and is 9 short of the majority mark. Sources said the Karnataka BJP has made arrangements for the stay of Congress MLAs in a resort.

Nath remained non-committal on Scindia’s RS candidature as he spoke to the media after meeting Sonia.

He said he apprised the party chief of the current political situation in the Stateand sought her guidance

“I will follow what she told me,” the CM said.

Nath had left for New Delhi from Bhopal on Sunday night after meeting MLA Bisahulal Sahu who came back to Bhopal after going missing for six days. Although, earlier he was expected to be back in the State only on March 12, he left for Bhopal on Monday after his meeting with the party chief.

Eight of the 10 MLAs, who the Congress alleged were lodged in a Haryana resort on March 3 by the BJP in a bid to topple the Government, are also back in Government fold.

Nath said he has instructed the State Ministers to be in constant touch with the party and supporting MLAs and each Minister has reportedly been given responsibility of 10 MLAs each.

Independent MLA Surendra Singh alias Shera has expressed his desire to become the Home Minister.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/upheaval-in-mp--all-nath-ministers-quit-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/upheaval-in-mp--all-nath-ministers-quit.html
123,10-3-20,Virus erodes investors’ Rs 7L cr,"Sensex, Nifty log worst one-day fall on global recession fears

Investors’ wealth plummeted by nearly Rs 7 lakh crore on Monday as equity markets crashed tracking global equity sell-off amid mounting fears of a global economic slowdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.

Market capitalisation (m-cap) of the BSE-listed companies saw a massive decline after the Sensex plunged over 2,467 points during the day, the 30-share index settled 1,941.67 points or 5.17 per cent lower at 35,634.95. Likewise, the NSE Nifty slumped 538 points or 4.90 per cent to close at 10,451.45.

The carnage in the equity market wiped out investor wealth worth Rs 6,84,277.65 crore, taking the total m-cap to Rs 1,37,46,946.76 crore on the BSE at the end of Monday’s trading session. The m-cap of BSE-listed companies stood at Rs 1,44,31,224.41 crore at the end of trading on Friday.

Traders believe mounting fear of recession in major economies due to the coronavirus outbreak has sent equities into a downward spiral.

The overall confirmed cases on the mainland reached 80,735 by the end of Sunday which included 3,119 people who have died so far, 19,016 patients undergoing treatment and 58,600 patients discharged after recovery, China’s National Health Commission said.

Globally, markets remained in sell-off mode amid concerns over the adverse impact of rapid spread of coronavirus on the world economy. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo sank up to 5 per cent. European benchmarks also plunged up to 6 per cent in their early deals.

On the currency front, rupee slumped by another 30 paise to touch a 17-month low of 74.17 against the US dollar.

Meanwhile, oil prices were in a free fall, plunging nearly 30 per cent to $32.11 per barrel after top exporter Saudi Arabia launched a price war in response to a failure by leading producers to strike a deal to support energy markets. It marked the biggest price crash since the first Gulf War.

On the Sensex chart, ONGC was the top loser, cracking over 16 per cent, followed by Reliance Industries, IndusInd Bank, Tata Steel, TCS, SBI, ICICI Bank and

Bajaj Auto. Heavyweight Reliance Industries shed over 12 per cent.

Shares of SBI plunged over 6 per cent after it said it will pick up a 49 per cent stake in Yes Bank for Rs 2,450 crore.

Crisis-hit Yes Bank, on the other hand, rallied over 31 per cent.

All sectoral indices ended in the red succumbing to growing fears about global recession among investors.

Traders said investor sentiments also remained fragile amid incessant foreign fund outflows. On a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth Rs 3,594.84 crore on Friday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

“With oil prices collapsing in the wake of weak global growth and with the COVID-19 spreading to over thirty countries, global markets were rattled today (Monday) and India also bore the brunt of relentless selling,” said S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities.

On the BSE, 2,199 scrips declined, while 357 advanced and 169 remained unchanged. However, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry President DK Aggarwal said the volatility in the rupee and stock markets is short-lived and primarily driven by the spread of coronavirus.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/virus-erodes-investors----rs-7l-cr-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/virus-erodes-investors----rs-7l-cr.html
124,10-3-20,IAF to fly back 2K Indians from coronavirus-hit Iran,"The Government on Monday initiated an evacuation exercise for Indians stranded in coronavirus-hit Iran by dispatching a C-17 globemaster aircraft even as the number of people infected with the deadly virus in India rose to 45 on Monday after six fresh cases, including a three-year-old child, were reported from Jammu & Kashmir, Punjab, Karnataka, New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.

The C-17 Globemaster military aircraft is expected to depart from the Hindon airbase around 8 pm, said the officials. About 2,000 Indians are living in Iran where 237 people have died of the coronavirus infection while the number of positive cases stands at around 7,000.

The virus scare, in the meantime, continued to play spoilsport with the national and international diplomatic programmes.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bangladesh next week to attend the birth centenary celebrations of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman has been put off after the commemorative programmes were deferred due to detection of Coronavirus cases in that country, the Union Ministry of External Affairs said on Monday.

The Prime Minister has already postponed his visit to Brusells where Indo-EU Summit was to be held later this month.

For its part, virus-hit Qatar included India in the list of 13 countries whose citizens have been temporarily banned from entering its territory.

So far, up to 110,066 Covid-19 cases have been diagnosed across the world. The number of people who have died of the disease globally stands at 3,830 currently.

And as if the global coronavirus scare was not enough, Swine Flu is raising its ugly head in India with reports emerging about cases of swineflu in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Meerut.

As many as 81 patients testing positive for swine flu in Meerut including 20 Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) personnel, as per various reports.

Eight people have died in the district after falling prey to swine flu while three cases of the communicable respiratory disease caused by a subtype of influenza A virus called H1N1 were reported from Ghaziabad. Delhi too has reported over 150 swineflu cases in the last two months.

126,10-3-20,CBI’s lookout notice against Rana Kapoor & family,"Carrying forwards its probe into the Yes Bank scam, the CBI on Monday issued Look Out Circulars (LOC) against seven accused persons, including the beleaguered bank’s founder Rana Kapoor and his family members, even as the agency conducted searches at several premises of the Kapoor family. A LOC alerts immigration staff at all the ports of entry and exit to prevent the accused from moving out of the country.

Meanwhile, in what may calm harried depositors of Yes Bank, its administrator Prashant Kumar on Monday said he is hopeful of the moratorium on the private sector lender being lifted by Saturday.

The LOC against the Kapoor family will help in preventing them from leaving the country, officials said.

The agency has booked Kapoor, his wife Bindu and daughters Roshini, Raakhe and Radha, besides DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan and Dheeraj Wadhawan, promoter of RKW Developers.

In the FIR registered on Saturday, the agency has also named five entities — Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL), DoIT Urban Ventures Pvt Ltd, Morgan Credits Pvt Ltd, RKW Developers Pvt Ltd and RAB Enterprises.

The Enforcement Directorate, which is probing the Kapoors and other accused individuals and entities in a separate case relating to money laundering, has already issued an LOC on the basis of which Kapoor’s daughter Roshini was stopped at the CSM International Airport, Mumbai, from leaving for London on Sunday, officials said.

On Monday, the CBI carried out searches at seven locations in connection with the Yes Bank scam case relating to the Rs 600 crore alleged bribe to the family of its co-founder Rana Kapoor by DHFL as an alleged quid pro quo for Rs 3,700 crore loan by the in-red bank, officials said.",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/cbi---s-lookout-notice-against-rana-kapoor---family-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/cbi---s-lookout-notice-against-rana-kapoor---family.html
127,10-3-20,HC asks UP to remove name & shame posters of anti-CAA vandals,"The Allahabad High Court on Monday ordered the immediate removal of the roadside posters in Lucknow with names and photos of those accused of vandalism during the anti-CAA protests, observing the police action was an “unwarranted interference” in privacy of people.

The bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur and Justice Ramesh Sinha also directed the district magistrate and the Lucknow police commissioner to submit a compliance report on or before March 16 and asked the Uttar Pradesh Government not to install such posters “without having the authority of law”.

The posters were displayed to “name and shame” the accused who had caused damage to public property during the protests against the CAA in Bhopal on December 19.

Reacting to the order, Mrityunjay Kumar, the media adviser to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, said, “Only their posters will be removed, and not the sections (of law) imposed on them. We will take forward the fight to expose the identity of the rioters. Leniency with the rioters in ‘Yogi raj’ is impossible.”

There is a buzz that the Government might challenge the HC order in the SC.

Opposition leaders Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, who head the Samajwadi Party(SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party(BSP) respectively, also welcomed the order.

In its order, the court observed that the action of the authorities was a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution under which no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.

“Accordingly, the district magistrate and the commissioner of police, Lucknow, are directed to remove the banners from the roadside forthwith. The State of Uttar Pradesh is directed not to place such banners on roadside containing personal data of individuals without having authority of law,” the court said.

The bench further said, “A report of satisfactory compliance is required to be submitted by the district magistrate, Lucknow, to the registrar general of this court on or before 16th March, 2020. On receiving such compliance report, the proceedings of this petition shall stand closed.”",page1,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/hc-asks-up-to-remove-name---shame-posters-of-anti-caa-vandals-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/page1/hc-asks-up-to-remove-name---shame-posters-of-anti-caa-vandals.html
128,10-3-20,Could have been better in all departments: Shikha,"Senior pacer Shikha Pandey admitted that India were outclassed not just the fielding but in all three departments which led to the side’s humbling defeat against Australia in the Women’s T20 World Cup final.

“Nerves weren’t really a factor. Once you get onto the field, you just zone out. I don't think I felt nerves,” Pandey told the ICC website.

Pandey rued the dropped chances of Beth Mooney (78 not out), whose caught and bowled opportunity was missed by Rajeshwari Gayakwad, and Alyssa Healy (75), who was dropped off the fifth ball of the innings by Shafali Verma. The opening duo then nicely set it up Australia’s record-breaking win.

“Initially, if you gift chances to batters in form they're going to use them. It could have gone either way but those chances costed us. We could have been better in all three departments, it wasn’t just the fielding,” she said.

Healy and Mooney’s efforts shattered the confidence of the Indian bowlers from the first over itself and Pandey, who was at the receiving end, said even she had to appreciate the former's brutal hitting.

“You do have plans against a batter like her, but the kind of shots she played were amazing. Sometimes you can just stand and acknowledge, and appreciate the shots she was playing. It was one of those days when I was on the receiving end.”

The 30-year-old Pandey was hit for three boundaries from her first 12 overs delivered in the tournament and the only one that got away in the first two games was struck by Healy in the early overs of the opening game.

Pandey held her nerve to help India secure a crucial win over New Zealand and seal top spot, playing a crucial role as one of the oldest in a squad featuring three teenagers.

Despite struggling in the final as Australia reached 184 for four from their 20 overs, Pandey revelled in the occasion with the India team getting the chance to meet tennis star and sporting icon Billie Jean King after the trophy presentation.

“It’s huge to meet people like Billie Jean King in person. I was privileged to be part of the event although it's disappointing to be on the wrong end of the result.

“It’s an honour to meet someone who has done so much for women’s sport in general and is working for equal opportunities. Just to meet her in person is a good thing.

“She said we were unlucky to have lost and to keep working hard,” Pandey said.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/could-have-been-better-in-all-departments--shikha.html
129,10-3-20,"Shafali loses top spot, slips to third","Teenage Indian batting sensation Shafali Verma on Monday lost the top spot in the ICC women’s T20 International rankings as she slipped to third after managing only two runs in the World Cup final against Australia in Melbourne.

The 16-year-old Shafali (744 points) had grabbed the top spot at the end of the league stage of the just-concluded women's T20 World Cup in Australia which the hosts won for an unprecedented fifth time.

Australia opener Beth Mooney, who hit 78 not out in the final on Sunday, jumped two spots to number one with 762 points to her kitty.

Mooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. She has topped the rankings for the first time in her career.

New Zealand’s Suzie Bates (750 points) remained in second position in the list that also features the Indian duo of Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues in the top ten.

While the India vice-captain Mandhana, who had a forgetful tournament, moved down a spot to be ranked seventh, Rodrigues remained static on ninth.

Mooney’s opening partner Alyssa Healy has risen two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semifinal against Australia.

India’s Deepti Sharma advanced 10 slots to reach 43rd position among batters and is among the top five all-rounders for the first time.

Deepti, Radha Yadav and Poonam Yadav occupied the sixth, seventh and eighth sports respectively in the bowlers ranking led by England’s Sophie Ecclestone.

Australia's Megan Schutt and South African Shabnim Ismail occupy the second and third place respectively among bowlers.

While Australia left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen reached a career-best 728 points and fifth place, her best position since a career-best fourth ranking in November 2017.

Her team-mates Sophie Molineux and Delissa Kimmince have advanced 10 places each to reach joint-16th and 31st places respectively.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/shafali-loses-top-spot--slips-to-third.html
130,10-3-20,No change of stance on Dhoni's future,"The addition of two new members, including the chairman, in the national selection committee has not changed the panel’s stance on M S Dhoni, who will “have to perform” in the upcoming IPL to be considered for T20 World Cup selection, a top BCCI official told PTI.

The Sunil Joshi-led selection panel met for the first time in Ahmedabad on Sunday to pick a rather “straightforward” squad for the three ODIs against South Africa beginning in Dharamsala on March 12.

Joshi’s predecessor MSK Prasad had made it clear that the team has moved on from Dhoni and he has to first play to be considered for selection.

“It was a pretty straightforward selection meeting and since Dhoni was obviously not in the reckoning this time (for South Africa series), there was no formal talk about his future,” a BCCI source told PTI.

“He will be back in the reckoning only if he has a good IPL. And why only him, there are so many senior and young players who will play in the IPL. If they do well, they are ought to be considered too. So, you could see some surprise inclusions,” he said.

The T20 World Cup will be played in Australia in October-November and the games India play after the IPL leading up to the mega event will also be a factor in the final squad selection.

“But the performance in the IPL could be the clincher,” the source added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/no-change-of-stance-on-dhoni-s-future.html
131,10-3-20,"WC loss not end for Ind, they’ll be back: Lee","Former Australia speedster Brett Lee feels India’s downfall in the Women’s T20 World Cup final is “not the end for them” and they will be coming back stronger in the times to come.

A record-breaking attendance for a women's cricket match of 86,174 watched on as Australia downed first-time finalists India by 85 runs at the MCG on Sunday. “As for India, it was a disappointing night for them but they'll certainly be back — this is not the end for them, this is just the start,” Lee wrote in his column for the ICC.

“They’d never played in a final before and we saw in Melbourne how vital that experience is, it takes a long time to get settled and by the time they did, unfortunately the game was gone.""

Playing in front of a crowd like that takes plenty of getting used to so they'll be better for it, and should take a lot of heart from the way they played in Australia,"" he added.

India had defeated Australia in the opening game of the tournament. However, they failed to replicate that performance as they were outplayed by the defending champions in all the three disciplines of the game in the final.

Lee further said it was tough for him seeing teenage sensation Shafali Verma in tears after the match. Shafali scored 163 runs coming at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 158.25 in the tournament.

However, she didn’t have the best of days in the final as she dropped a catch in the very first over of the game and then could manage just two runs with the bat.

“I really felt for Shafali Verma at the end, it was tough seeing her in tears but she should be very proud of the way she’s performed in Australia,” said Lee.

“To come out here and face your first tournament head-on is testament to her talent and mental strength, and she’s only going to get better from here.

“When you drop a chance, the one thing you want is another one and unfortunately she didn’t get it, but she’ll learn from this experience and come back stronger.

“Moments like this can define you in a positive way — it’s never about what happens, it’s about how you respond to it and Shafali has proven she can cope with anything. Don't be surprised to see her put a big score on the Aussies the next time they play,” he added.",sports,https://www.dailypioneer.com/images/logo.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/sports/wc-loss-not-end-for-ind--they---ll-be-back--lee.html

133,10-3-20,‘Faf's experience in Indian conditions will help team',"Former skipper Faf du Plessis' long experience of playing in IPL and international cricket in India will come in handy during the upcoming three-match ODI series, feels South Africa head coach Mark Boucher.

The series starts in Dharamsala on February 12.

Du Plessis, who last played an ODI during the 2019 World Cup, had an indifferent T20 series against Australia, with scores of 24, 15 and 5.

“If you go to a place like India, you need to find a balance between youth and experience. I think Faf is really doing well in ODI cricket for South Africa. The last time he played, he got a hundred. He knows the Indian conditions very well,” Boucher said during the team’s pre-departure press conference on Sunday.

The South African team reached India on Monday morning and will take a chartered flight to Dharamsala on Tuesday.

Boucher feels that having Du Plessis also means he will have some selection headaches, which is a good thing to have.

“It’s a good headache to have. Just him being around the squad will add a lot of value and experience as well. We will look at conditions and then put together combinations. Why you would want to have Faf is because he has done really well in those (Indian) conditions.”

While South Africa lost the T20 series 1-2 to Australia, they blanked the visitors 3-0 in the ODIs, which gives them confidence going into the series against India.

“T20s are important this year given we have the T20 World Cup. But in general, Proteas and Cricket South Africa (CSA), we need to find ourselves growing.

135,10-3-20,"Tahir’s brother, PFI State secy among 3 held for Delhi riots","The Special Cell and Crime Branch of the Delhi Police in separate operations on Monday arrested three men for their alleged involvement in the communal riots that broke out in North-east Delhi last month in which 53 people were killed and many injured.

The Crime Branch detained Shah Alam, the brother of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain, in connection with the murder of Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer Ankit Sharma.

Of those arrested included a 33-year-old man, suspected to be a member of the Popular Front of India (PFI), for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to incite the riots in North-east Delhi. Police said the suspected PFI member is also linked to former JNU scholar Umar Khalid, who is facing sedition charges.

According to a senior police official, the suspected PFI member has been identified as Danish, a resident of Trilokpuri. “During initial interrogation, Danish told police that he is PFI secretary of Delhi. He also told police that he has links with Khalid, the former JNU scholar. Further, he has given some clues regarding receiving funding from several sources during the violence,” said a source in the police.

A Delhi court on Monday sent Danish to four days police custody. Police told the court that the accused was confronted with incriminating materials and other people in the case.

“Teams are questioning him to ascertain his role during the clashes in North-east Delhi,” said.

The Crime Branch on Monday also arrested Lokesh Kumar Solanki on the charges of murder and violence that broke out in Northeast Delhi’s Gokulpuri area.

“On March 3, four cases of riots were transferred to the Crime Branch which had taken place in North-east from February 24, 2020 onwards. The FIRs were registered under sections 147/148/149/302/201/120B of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Gokulpuri police station,” said a police official.

“During investigation, through manual and technical, it emerged that a group of persons are involved in these incidents.

136,10-3-20,Rare & risky,"Over 70 million people in India suffer from rare disorders. Dr Deepika Kalo talks about the social stigma related to them, challenges and advancements in treating the diseases

The Indian constitution mentions health as a fundamental right. This means that apart from equal access to healthcare, there is also a need for every citizen to have adequate awareness around diseases. However, in case of rare diseases, this may not be the case. Rare diseases are conditions that affect a small percentage of the Indian population but are a major cause of concern given the lack of treatment options and most importantly, awareness. There are over 70 million people in the country with these disorders which clearly make it a public health challenge.

The lack of awareness around rare diseases has three dimensions. They are life threatening but mostly diagnosed late since some of the symptoms can mimic other conditions. In most cases, the patient’s quality of life is compromised drastically to the point that they cannot even carry out basic tasks. The second is that certain rare diseases including Gaucher, MPS, Pompe, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy and others are treatable. However, this treatment is unaffordable for majority of the population and can go as high as Rs 70 lakh. The third dimension is around screening for such conditions in expectant mothers and newborns. It is possible to understand the risk factors in both these groups through options such as genetic testing.

About 80 per cent of rare diseases are of genetic origin. There are families that have more than one child with a rare disease. This is because there is no education provided on the fact that if one child is born affected, the next diagnosis should take place at the prenatal stage itself. The result is a greater health burden on the family and the healthcare system at large. Raising awareness on some of these crucial aspects will reduce infant mortality as well since about 35 per cent of infants with rare diseases die before they turn one. However, in a country where genetic testing has a lot of associated social stigma and taboo, encouraging people to get tested is a challenge too. This is more so in the Tier-II and Tier-III cities.

The recently concluded genome sequencing project has also emerged as a ray of hope wherein it might become possible to pinpoint the exact gene that undergoes mutation and treat this through precision medicine. There has also been increased focus on rare diseases — thanks to the Government’s National Policy for Rare Diseases and efforts by patient organisations and the healthcare fraternity at large. These efforts have brought to light the suffering of patients with rare diseases and the urgency with which rare diseases need to be addressed in the country. However, while the policy mentions treatment allocation for a certain category of these conditions, capped at Rs 15 lakh, it is imperative to address the other rare diseases as well. To ensure that more people understand whether they are at risk, the policy must be implemented in the most efficient manner and address awareness at the outset. This will ensure that patients do not delay diagnosis and get treatment on time.

Estimates suggest that the prenatal screening and diagnosis market will grow significantly as early as 2024. Some major techniques available today across Tier-I and Tier-II Indian cities include: ultrasonography and maternal serum screens; blood tests for select trisomy or non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). NIPT is already emerging as a highly preferred technique given that it is safer and faster, and more reliable. Other non-invasive prenatal testing methods such as pre-implant genetic diagnosis (PGD) have been accepted in major IVF centers in the country. They help in sampling of cells from human embryos before implantation. Another test that has gained popularity is called the Nuchal scan, or ultrasound detection. Done in the first and second trimester, this method helps in identifying higher risks of Down’s syndrome.

Patients with rare diseases, more often than not, struggle to find adequate information about their condition. When they are diagnosed, they naturally feel isolated, overwhelmed and unsupported. More than the condition itself, the resultant emotional, psychological and financial impact can be considerable. A multi-stakeholder partnership is therefore needed to ensure that patients with rare diseases have the same right to treatment and information as those with other conditions.

137,10-3-20,Cleanse the body & skin,"Internal cleansing is just as important during and after Holi. LALITA ARYA gives you tips that can help eliminate toxicity

All of us are set to have fun with our friends and family today. Chilled containers of flavoured milk, unembarrassed dance moves to Bollywood songs on loop and air packed with lots of colours, there are hundreds of reasons to love the festival. But on the other hand almost every one of us are very well aware with the fact that everything comes with a cost therefore apart from the happiness and joy the festival of colours also brings a lot of skin related issues which we are obviously scared about. Toxic colours used during the festival can cause some serious skin related problems like allergies and rashes. So, it’s very important to make ourselves Holi ready.

When it comes to protect our skin and hair externally almost every one of us does it like oiling and applying sunscreen. But what about the internal cleansing of our skin and hair. It’s crucial to cleanse your full body before and after Holi. Hydration plays an important role in keeping our skin in good condition hence hydrating the body is the demand of the festival. Keep drinking throughout the day. Dehydrated skin can get sunburnt easily.

One can also go for a specialised organic head to toe facial (customised package for pre and post Holi). Dry skin allows the chemicals present in the colours to infiltrate easily, so the key is to always oil the whole body.The facial is enriched with Vitamin E oils protects the skin from getting dry and dull and maintain the natural glow of the skin.

The facial involves the usage of organic elements to enrich your skin with required vitamins and minerals.

There are people who have acne prone skin so it’s very necessary for such people to specially take care of their skin during the festival.

It is advisable to people to use organic colors instead of chemical colours, stay away from the sun for long durations, or do not exfoliate for at least up to two days before.

Always keep your skin moisturise to protect it from hazardous effect of synthetic colors. As your skin is exposed to chemicals you can also use natural ingredient face mask to soothe your skin.

Since skin is exposed to colours all day, don’t use too much make-up as chemicals of cosmetics can react to them.

Do not ignore any part of your body. Colours can settle around ears and eyes very easily and difficult to come off.

Apart from this, the festival of colours needs a lot of energy, so that we can enjoy the festival to the fullest. Hence, it’s mandatory to follow a specific customised diet to keep yourself energetic and enthusiastic before and after the festival.

This Holi enjoy the festival without worrying about the damage the colours will have on the skin or the hair. When we were children, my mother always made us prepare a day in advance for this festival so that we could enjoy it without bothering too much about what the colours would actually do.

There are several ingredients in our kitchen that can come to our rescue.

To begin with, and most of us know this, apply coconut oil on the hair. But before you do this, wash your hair a day before and then apply the oil. This will prevent any damage.

After you are done playing, make a mask of eggs, lemon, yogurt and amla. This will add back the lost moisture.

If you have a dye colour on the face, gently dab the coloured area with a cotton ball and alcohol. Once the colour is removed wash face with soap and water.

Before playing with colours apply a mixture of honey and lemon juice in equal parts on the face and exposed body parts.",pioneer-health,https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2020/story/images/big/dadikakehna-2020-03-10.jpg,https://www.dailypioneer.com/2020/pioneer-health/dadikakehna-dadikakehna-2020-03-10.html
140,10-3-20,Go for organic colours’,"Ayurveda has solutions to several diseases. DR PARTAP CHAUHAN tells you how an alternative route can ensure one has a happy Holi

According to Ayurveda, illnesses are a result of disturbances of the five elements of earth, water, fire, air, and water in the body. The imbalances result in three doshas of vata, pitta and kapha. Among the major factors that cause these imbalances are changes in the seasons. Hence, Ayurveda prescribes certain seasonal regimen (ritucharya) to prevent health problems.

Holi is a part of the regimen for the season of vasant (spring), the beginning of warmer days. The sudden rise in the temperature, along with the increasing humidity, in spring melts the kapha (phlegm) in the body and can lead to many kapha-related diseases. The festival was originally conceived to get the body rid of liquefied kapha and to restore the three doshas to their natural states.

The highlight of the festival is playing with colours. Colour powders were traditionally prepared from Ayurvedic herbs like neem and henna for green, kumkum and raktachandan for red, haldi for yellow, jacaranda flowers for blue and herbs like bilva, amaltas, marigold and yellow chrysanthemums for different other hues. These colour powders have kapha-reducing properties.

Spraying the herbal and water colours, help the medicinal components to enter and detox the skin.

Most colours available in the market today are chemical-based and unsafe. They can leave rashes on the skin. It is important to apply mustard oil all over the body a day before Holi. This will keep the skin protected and also allow you to remove the colours with ease. One can also apply plenty of coconut oil.

This acts as a protecting agent and prevents colours from penetrating deep into the roots.

If there are rashes, we can apply multani mitti on affected areas. Another good home remedy is to make a paste by mixing gram flour, sweet oil and milk cream in rose water. Applying this paste on the affected areas cures rashes.

Since people indulge in a lot of fried snacks and sweets on the day, it can lead to constipation or gastric discomfort. Hence, in addition to caring for the skin, it is important to ensure digestive health. Fruit and vegetable-based meals are better suited for the transitional weather conditions.

Staying hydrated is also very important. The pre-spring sun and dryness in air absorbs moisture faster than people realise. Keep a small sipper of water with you and take a sip or two once every while.
