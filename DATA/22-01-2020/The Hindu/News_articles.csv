Among the men, Ankit Khatana (75kg), Deepak Kumar (52kg), Narender (+91kg), and Naveen Kumar (91kg) made early exits.

2,2020/01/22,Khelo India | Proud shuttler pair from Manipur in limelight,"The names Khwairakpam Manjit Singh and Konthoujam Dingku Singh provide a different flavour to badminton in the Khelo India Youth Games here.

It was a proud moment for the Manipuri shuttlers — who began by playing gully badminton and carried on their association to play for the school, State and the country — as they took the under-21 boys’ doubles silver medal in KIYG.

Rarity

It is a rarity considering that the State — which has produced top-class weightlifters, boxer, judokas and footballers — is not known for its badminton players.

“We used to play for fun. Our homes are very close to each other and we studied in the same class. All the while, we have played together. Since 2014, we have been winning medals in National championships and have represented the country in the Asian junior championships,” Dingku, named after Asian Games gold medallist boxer Dingko Singh, told The Hindu.

“When we did well in doubles in under-17 and under-19 events, (international referee from our State) H. Gyanewar Singh spoke to Gopi Chand sir. We practised in Hyderabad for a month or so and beat senior players in a tournament. That’s how we got selected for the Gopi Chand Academy. We have improved a lot after joining the academy.”

Most important phase

According to Manjit, the two friends needed to be more focused than ever. “This is the most important phase for us as we graduate to the senior level. We have to work hard to keep up our performance.”

Following in the footsteps of Dingku and Manjit, two other talented shuttlers – Meiraba Luawang and Bidyasagar Salam – from Manipur have made their mark. Even then, the sport has not been able to garner much popularity.

“Only one or two individuals back badminton in Manipur. Otherwise, there is not much support. In 2014, we had requested one of our ministers to build a wooden floor indoor hall in Bishnupur but nothing has been done yet,” said Manjit.

Nevertheless, nothing has dampened the spirit of the talented Manipuri pair which is out to prove its worth in the big league.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/n2b7x5/article30627774.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23BADMINTON,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/khelo-india-proud-shuttler-pair-from-manipur-in-limelight/article30627775.ece

4,2020/01/22,Anand draws quickly with Dubov,"Viswanathan Anand played out a quick 19-move draw with Russia’s Daniil Dubov in the ninth round of Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Tuesday.

When the action resumed after a day of rest, top seed Magnus Carlsen gave a master-class to overnight leader Alireza Firouzja, spread over 39 moves, in the only decisive game of the round.

Carlsen moved to the joint second spot, with three others, just half-a-point behind leader Fabiano Caruana. Five more rounds remain.

5,2020/01/22,Lakshay springs a surprise,"Asian Games silver medallist Lakshay Sheoran sprang a surprise on Olympian Kynan Chenai and qualification topper Vivaan Kapoor by winning the men’s trap final in the second National shotgun selection trials at the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, Tughlakabad, on Wednesday.

After just about making the final with 118, one point better than Fahd Sultan and Ankur Mittal, Lakshay shot 47 to beat Kynan by three points. Bhowneesh Mendiratta, Anant Shivan Pratap Singh and Aakash Kushwaha were the others to make the title clash.

Vivaan Kapoor recovered to top the junior section as he beat Shapath Bharadwaj 3-2 in the shoot-off after the two were tied on 42 in the final.

It was a commendable fare from the young Shapath, a double trap specialist, to climb to the top in the title clash after having just about qualified with 114.

In women’s trap, Olympian Shagun Chowdhary beat qualification topper Rajeshwari Kumari (118) 5-4 in the shoot-off after the two were tied on 42 in the final.

World Cup silver medallist Seema Tomar came third, ahead of Manisha Keer, Pragati Dubey and Kirti Gupta. Kirti topped the junior event ahead of Sabeera Haris and Aadya Tripathi, after topping qualification with 113.

6,2020/01/22,Ivanov gives PBL the thumbs up,"Russia’s Vladimir Ivanov knows a thing or two about India and its players. Having played in all five Premier Badminton League seasons and a year in the then Indian Badminton League, the 32-year-old has seen from close the growth of the league.

According to Ivanov playing in PBL has definitely helped in preparing for the Badminton World Federation tournaments. “Here, in three weeks, we have good practice with top players every day. In Russia it is not possible. A best I can only play with players ranked in the top-80 in the world, whereas the cream of badminton is here [PBL],” he said. “I’ve had practice sessions with Sindhu, Sourabh [Verma], Lee [Dong Yae], Mathias Boe, Chirag Shetty,” said Ivanov, who is playing for Hyderabad Hunters in PBL-5.

Ivanov hasn’t been part of a winning team so far in the league. “One time we finished second as part of Mumbai Rockets. I am yet to win a PBL title. Maybe this year, as we have many talented players in Hyderabad Hunters,” he said.

Surprising

Ivanov shot into prominence after winning the 2016 All England Open men’s title along with Ivan Suzonov, but that has surprisingly not had a great impact on his career, he said. “It was really a good result for us. But my life has not changed because badminton is not popular in Russia, only winter sports is. But the Russian Government is supporting us by taking care of travel and stay during BWF tournaments.”

The pairing with Suzonov — with whom he has won 22 BWF (Grand Prix & International Challenge/Series) titles in the last 10-odd years — the 32-year-old said was by accident.

“It was situational,” he remarked. “While we were practising in Moscow, he asked me whether I can partner him. I said, ‘yes, why not’. We started with the Bulgarian Open Challenger in 2008-09 and lost in the semifinals. From there on, it has been quite a good progress,” said Ivanov, who has represented Russia in men’s singles and doubles in the 2012 London Olympics and was ranked as high as world No. 7 in 2017.

On the pair’s chances of qualifying for the Tokyo Games, Ivanov said it would not be easy. Currently ranked 13th in the Road to Tokyo BWF Olympic rankings, Ivanov — a 2018 European championship bronze medallist — said, “we are in a dangerous situation, but are eager to qualify.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/4mlqrf/article30626519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH23IVANOV,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ivanov-gives-pbl-the-thumbs-up/article30626520.ece
7,2020/01/22,"Saina, Srikanth, Verma bow out of Thailand Open","The trio of Kidambi Srikanth, Sameer Verma and H.S. Prannoy, too, faltered in the first round in the men's singles in the Thailand Masters badminton tournament here on Wednesday.

Saina Nehwal

Top Indian shuttler Saina Nehwal suffered a second consecutive opening round defeat as she went to Line Hojmark Kjaersfeldt of Denmark to bring curtains on the country’s campaign in the Thailand Masters badminton tournament here on Wednesday.

The fifth seeded Saina lost to unseeded Kjaersfeldt 13-21 21-17 15-21 in a hard fought 47-minute contest.

World number 18 Saina had a 4-0 head-to-head record against the number 29 Dane before Wednesday’s match.

With Saina’s defeat, India’s campaign came to an end in the BWF World Tour Super 300 event.

Saina had also lost in the opening round in the Indonesia Masters last week after entering the quarterfinals in the Malaysia Masters (January 7-12).

Indian shuttlers thus continued their poor run after making early exits in the Malaysia and Indonesia Masters earlier this month.

Verma lost to Malaysia’s Lee Zii Jia 16-21 15-21 in a 39-minute men’s singles match. The story went on similar lines for the fifth seeded Srikanth, who went down to Shesar Hiren Rhustavito of Indonesia 21-12 14-21 12-21, in a match that lasted 48 minutes.

This was Srikanth’s third consecutive first-round exit this season.

It was curtains for Prannoy too.

15,2020/01/22,Samsung says its new refrigerator line makes ‘perfect curd’,"Introducing its 2020 refrigerator line-up, Samsung on Wednesday unveiled its Curd Maestro refrigerator, which is the world’s first that prepares curd.

Curd Maestro models will be priced between ₹30,990 and ₹45,990.

“We are confident that the new range of refrigerators will further strengthen our market leadership in the refrigerator category,” said Raju Pullan, Senior Vice President, Consumer Electronics Business, Samsung India.

Samsung says Curd Maestro is its ‘Make for India’ innovation and addresses the pain points of daily curd-making.

How it works

Samsung says Curd Maestro enables curd preparation in five to six hours — five hours for soft curd, six hours for thick curd.

One needs to boil and cool the milk and mix the curd culture manually while Curd Maestro does the most crucial part of the job — fermentation.

It will not only ferment the curd but will store it too.

According to the company, National Dairy Research Institute (NDRI) has tested and recommended the process of curd making in Samsung’s Curd Maestro.

Samsung says Curd Maestro makes curd with the same consistency each time and eliminates all the hassle of curd-making in different weather conditions.

Curd Maestro refrigerators come with Samsung’s 5 in 1 ‘Twin Cooling’ technology and will be available in 244-litre, 265-litre, 314-litre and 336-litre capacities.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/73jn5n/article30624294.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22NETSAMSUNGCURD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/samsung-says-its-new-refrigerator-line-makes-perfect-curd/article30624295.ece
16,2020/01/22,Low-cost iPhone to get into production in February: Report,"The low-cost successor to iPhone SE is getting into mass production next month and Apple could release it in March.

Apple is reportedly ready to return to the low-cost phone market after an absence of four years, CNET reported on Tuesday.

The handset — believed to be comparable in size to the 4.7-inch iPhone 8 from 2017 — would be Apple’s first low-cost smartphone since 2016’s $399 iPhone SE.

It is pertinent to note that the iPhone SE was one of company’s most successful mobile devices in the past half-decade because of a combination of reasons.

Price was a factor but it also offered long-time iPhone fans a reprieve from all the design changes that Apple was doing.

Planning for the new handset was reported in September by Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asian Review.

17,2020/01/22,Global smartphone market to grow by 64 mn units in 2020-24,"Riding on the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled features, the global smartphone market is expected to grow by 64.05 million units during 2020-2024, a new report said on Wednesday.

According to London-based market research firm Technavio, the consumer’s shift to online purchases will have a positive impact on the market and contribute to its growth significantly over the forecast period.

“Online smartphone sales contributed to around 50% of the total sales in India as of April 2019 because many major e-commerce vendors such as Amazon and Flipkart are promoting multiple brands of smartphones,” said the report.

In addition, online distribution channel requires limited investments and eliminates additional costs for the seller as well when compared to the offline channel.

The online sales volume of smartphones is increasing due to factors such as wide assortment of products, convenience, and the availability of products at special prices and discounts.

“This is expected to further increase the variety and number of products available over the online channel. All these factors are expected to showcase a positive outlook for the market over the forecast period,” the report added.

AI is gaining traction in the smartphone industry as it has transformed the way consumers interact with technology.

“AI facilitates the introduction of features such as augmented reality (AR), facial recognition, device management, emotion recognition, user authentication, and more,” said the report.

Vendors such as Apple, Huawei, and Samsung are increasingly investing in R&D to provide best user experience using AI.

“AI-enabled smartphones consume less power to perform multiple operations per second. Thus, technological advances in AI and its integration in smartphones, will drive sales leading to the growth of the smartphone market during the forecast period,” the report added.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/bpozwl/article30581981.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KochiCITYInsiG13700Q5K3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/global-smartphone-market-to-grow-by-64-mn-units-in-2020-24/article30622264.ece
18,2020/01/22,Apple dropped plan for encrypting back-ups after FBI complained: sources,"Apple Inc dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt back-ups of their devices in the company’s iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The tech giant’s reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers’ information.

The long-running tug of war between investigators’ concerns about security and tech companies’ desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at Pensacola, a Florida naval base last month.

U.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by “killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements.” Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children.

Apple, in fact, did turn over the shooter’s iCloud back-ups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterisation that it “has not provided substantive assistance.”

Behind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe.

An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company’s handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple.

More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee.

Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order.

In private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI’s cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing that it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said.

When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan.

“Legal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,” another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision.

That person told Reuters that the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption.

“They decided they weren’t going to poke the bear any more,” the person said, referring to Apple’s court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.

Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations.

Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI’s arguments that the back-ups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed.

“It’s because Apple was convinced,” said one. “Outside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government.”

However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often.

Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project — variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop — were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Apple shifts focus

Apple’s decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBIs job easier.

The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation.

Apples iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apples most recent semi-annual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts.

The company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period.

Had it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption.

Instead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data.

But backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities.

Apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers’ information.

In October 2018, Alphabet Inc’s Google announced a similar system to Apple’s dropped plan for secure back-ups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world’s mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key.

Two people familiar with the project said Google gave no advance notice to governments, and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news.

The company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on Google’s service or the agency’s approach to it.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/k6hq56/article30621950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22NETAPPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/apple-dropped-plan-for-encrypting-back-ups-after-fbi-complained-sources/article30621951.ece
19,2020/01/22,Donald Trump warns of trade war with EU countries,"U.S. President Donald Trump relaunched a major trade offensive against Europe on Wednesday, threatening to hit the EU with damaging auto tariffs if Europeans failed to agree a long-delayed trade deal.

With observers warning that global harmony on trade was crucial to the health of the world economy, Mr. Trump warned Europe that the U.S. would protect its interests, on the second day of his stay at the Davos economic forum.

His interventions took the focus off climate change, which had dominated the first day of event, where Mr. Trump lashed out at the “prophets of doom”, who say that the world is in crisis over global warming.

“The EU is tougher to deal with than anybody. They’ve taken advantage of our country for many years,” Mr. Trump said. “Ultimately, it will be very easy because if we can't make a deal, we'll have to put 25% tariffs on their cars,” he added.

Mr. Trump said that his attention would now to turn to Europe, after he sealed a trade truce with China after a bitter trade war that destabilised the world economy.

“... I wanted to wait till I finished China. I didn't want to go with China and Europe at the same time.”

Mr. Trump’s comments followed a warning by the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that Washington would proceed with long threatened auto tariffs if Europeans go through with a digital tax that mainly affects US firms.

EU-U.S. trade ties deteriorated after Mr. Trump came to power three years ago, who imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, notably from the EU, which responded by taxing iconic U.S. products.

20,2020/01/22,"Trump impeachment trial: GOP, Democrats fight over witness procedures","Day 1 of U.S. President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial at the Senate stretched across some thirteen acrimonious hours and extended into the early hours of Wednesday, as Democrats pushed for a change to GOP-proposed trial rules and Republicans mostly stood together to resist changes.

None of the 11 amendments proposed by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were approved by the Republican controlled Senate, although Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had to yield some ground on the timetable for opening arguments.

Mr. McConnell had initially allocated 24 hours over two days each for the prosecution and defence — a scheduling that would mean most Americans would miss parts of the broadcast which would extend well into the night.

But with the risk of defections from moderate Republicans and a combative Democratic side, Mr. McConnell made last minute modifications to his “organizing resolution”.

First, each of the two sides would have 24 hours over three (not two) days to present their opening arguments. Second, evidence from the House inquiry into the President would also no longer need to be voted on again before admitted in the Senate.

Last minute change

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, considered a moderate Republican and facing re-election later this year, was reportedly one of the those who pushed for the last minute modification. Ms. Collins also voted with Democrats on one of the 11 resolutions (which failed, as four Republicans would need to vote with all 47 Democrats for a resolution to pass).

Republicans did not move on the question of subpoenaing new witnesses and documents (Democrats had sought an early agreement on these), pushing that question down the road for after opening arguments.

Democrat requests for documents and witnesses, including Acting White House Chief of Staff and former National Security Adviser John Bolton did not go through.

Call for civility

As a long day was drawing to a close, Chief Justice John Roberts, who is the trial’s presiding officer, intervened minutes before 1 am to admonish both sides, suggesting that they had used “language not conducive to civil discourse.”

His intervention came after an acrimonious round of remarks from Jerrold Nadler, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the House Managers, and White House Counsel and Trump defence team attorney Pat Cipollone.

“I think it is appropriate at this point for me to admonish both the House Managers and the President’s counsel in equal terms to remember that they are addressing the world’s greatest deliberative body,” Justice Roberts said, recalling a case when objections were raised over the use of ‘pettifogging’ [worrying about minor details] in the 1905 Senate trial of a district judge.

“I don’t think we need to aspire to that higher standard but I do think those addressing the Senate should remember where they are,” he said.

Given Day 1 minimally altered Mr. McConnell’s intended trial timetable, it is possible the entire trial (and, as things stand, the likely acquittal) of Mr. Trump will be concluded before February 4 when he is scheduled to deliver the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/mrqz6j/article30627651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Mitch-McConnell-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-impeachment-trial-gop-democrats-fight-over-witness-procedures/article30627652.ece
21,2020/01/22,Intelligence agents raid Juan Guaido’s offices,"Agents from Venezuela’s Sebin intelligence service have raided the offices of Opposition leader Juan Guaido while he is travelling in Europe, an opposition lawmaker said.

“We have just confirmed that Sebin officers are inside the office,” lawmaker Delsa Solorzano told reporters on Tuesday after speaking with security guards at Caracas’s Zurich Tower.

National Assembly leader Mr. Guaido has been recognised as President by the U.S. and more than 50 other countries in his year-long power struggle with socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who earlier this year tried to block Mr. Guaido’s re-election as Assembly president.

The Opposition said one of their lawmakers, Ismael Leon, was arrested on Tuesday on his way to the National Assembly. “Cowardly dictatorship! While I am away, consolidating support to overcome the tragedy that we Venezuelans are enduring, they shamelessly show what they are all about,” Mr. Guaido said.

However, in a series of tweets, the Minister of Communication and Information denied Sebin officials had targetted the private office of the opposition leader, claiming it was an operation against two businessmen for money laundering.

The tower where the offices are located had been surrounded in the afternoon by hooded and armed Sebin officers dressed in black.

The offices were empty when the search began, the opposition said, adding that several lawmakers had been unable to gain access.

“Whatever procedure is under way, they are carrying it out without authorisation... without witnesses, and they have no search warrant,” Delsa Solorzano said outside the building.

Lawmaker Angel Torres said the agents “abruptly entered” the offices, amid opposition fears they could plant false evidence.

Venezuelan authorities made no comment on the report of the arrest of Leon.

22,2020/01/22,Lebanon’s PM says nation faces ‘catastrophe’,"Lebanon faces a ‘catastrophe’, Prime Minister Hassan Diab said on Wednesday after his newly unveiled Cabinet held its first meeting to tackle the twin challenges of a tenacious protest movement and a nosediving economy.

Hassan Diab, who replaced Saad Hariri as Prime Minister, vowed to meet the demands from the street but demonstrators were unconvinced and scuffled with police overnight.

The 61-year-old academic admitted that the situation he inherited was desperate. “Today we are in a financial, economic and social dead end,” he said in remarks read by a government official after the new Cabinet’s inaugural meeting in Beirut. “We are facing a catastrophe,” he said.

Western sanctions on the Iranian-backed organisation are stacking up and economists have argued the government might struggle to secure foreign aid.

“Government of last resort,” was the headline on the front page of Al-Akhbar, a daily newspaper close to the powerful Hezbollah movement that gave its blessing to Mr. Diab’s designation last month.

Western sanctions on the Iranian-backed organisation are stacking up and economists have argued the new government might struggle to secure the aid it so badly needs.

But French President Emmanuel Macron, one of the first leaders to react to the formation of the new government, said he would “do everything, during this deep crisis that they are going through, to help.”

Hezbollah and its allies dominated the talks that produced the new line-up, from which outgoing premier Saad Hariri and some of his allies were absent.

The millionaire was one of the symbols of the kind of hereditary and sectarian-driven politics that protesters who have been in the streets since mid-October want to end.

He and his government resigned less than two weeks into the non-sectarian protests demanding the complete overhaul of the political system and celebrating the emergence of a new national civic identity.

Protesters from across Lebanon’s geographical and confessional divides had demanded a cabinet of independent technocrats as a first step to root out endemic government corruption and incompetence.

Mr. Diab is a career academic from the prestigious American University of Beirut and he insisted on Tuesday in his first comments that the government just unveiled was a technocratic one.

“This is a government that represents the aspirations of the demonstrators who have been mobilised nationwide for more than three months,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dswuth/article30627510.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Hassan-Diab,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanons-pm-says-nation-faces-catastrophe/article30627511.ece
23,2020/01/22,"Jeff Bezos phone hack: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may be linked, say U.N. experts","Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon’s billionaire boss Jeff Bezos, U.N. experts said on January 22.

The U.N. special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said they had information pointing to the “possible involvement” of the Prince in the alleged 2018 cyberattack.

Saudi officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd.

Cybersecurity experts hired by Mr. Bezos, the world’s richest man, concluded his phone was probably infiltrated by a video file sent from a WhatsApp account purportedly belonging to Prince Mohammed, known as MBS, in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter.

They said the device began leaking massive amounts of data about a month afterwards, the source said.

Ms. Callamard, the special rapporteur for extra-judicial killings, and Mr. Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said the allegation of Saudi involvement “demands immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities”.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the allegations. “I think ‘absurd’ is exactly the right word,” he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. “The idea that the Crown Prince would hack Jeff Bezos phone is absolutely silly.”

The allegations could nonetheless further damage relations between tech tycoon Mr. Bezos and Riyadh, and risk harming the kingdom’s reputation with foreign powers and investors.

Khashoggi killing

The alleged cyberattack is said to have taken place months before the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Bezos-owned Washington Post.

Prince Mohammed said in 2019 that the killing was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it.

In another previous flashpoint, Mr. Bezos’ security chief said in 2019 that the Saudi government had gained access to the Amazon CEO’s phone and leaked messages to U.S. tabloid the National Enquirer between Mr. Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who the newspaper said he was dating.

A month before, Mr. Bezos had accused the newspaper’s owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing “intimate photos” he allegedly sent to Ms. Sanchez. The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirer reporting.

Saudi Arabia’s U.S. embassy also dismissed the allegations. “We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,” it said in a message posted on Twitter.

24,2020/01/22,Sri Lanka President Rajapaksa wants civil war disappearances probed,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa wants a probe into the disappearances of over 20,000 people in the country’s brutal civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels, his office said in a clarification after the Sri Lankan President declared the missing persons “dead” in a first-ever admission to a UN official.

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former wartime defence secretary who played a key role in ending Sri Lanka’s nearly 30-year-long civil war with the Tamil separatist rebels, told UN Resident Coordinator Hanaa Singer last week that after the necessary investigations are completed steps would be taken to issue death certificates to the missing persons.

The President’s office said Mr. Rajapaksa had explained to the UN official that he will have the matter investigated, but added, “however I can’t bring back the dead.”

The President told the UN official that as a result of the census carried out by the government at the end of the conflict in 2009, it had emerged that most of the missing persons had been conscripted by the LTTE, the statement said.

“Their families attest to being witnesses of their loved ones being taken by the LTTE. However, thereafter they do not have any information as to their fate. Therefore, as far as they are concerned these people are missing,” the statement quoted the Sri Lankan president as saying.

“The unfortunate truth is that these people had died during the battles. Even in the security forces there are about 4,000 personnel listed as missing. But in reality these people had died during the fights, but their bodies had not been recovered,” it said.

Mr. Rajapaksa told the UN official that after the conclusion of the necessary investigations, steps would be taken to issue death certificates and after that the families would be given the necessary support to rebuild their lives.

According to the government figures, over 20,000 people are missing due to various conflicts including the three-decade separatist war with Lankan Tamils in the north and east which claimed at least 100,000 lives.

The Tamils alleged that thousands were massacred during the final stages of the war that ended in 2009 when the government forces killed Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.

The Sri Lankan Army denies the charge, claiming it as a humanitarian operation to rid the Tamils of LTTE’s control.

At the end of the civil war, the United Nations accused both sides of atrocities, especially during the conflict’s final stages.

International rights groups claim at least 40,000 ethnic Tamil civilians were killed in the final stages of the war, but the government has disputed the figures.

Several mass graves containing skeletal remains have also been found, but only a handful have ever been identified.

The UN and other rights groups have pressed Colombo to establish a war crimes tribunal to investigate allegations of human rights abuses — both by the military and the LTTE.

Successive Sri Lankan governments have resisted such attempts, saying it is a domestic issue and the allegations should be probed internally.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nly5p7/article30536070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10THRDGOTABAYA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-president-rajapaksa-wants-civil-war-disappearances-probed/article30623363.ece
25,2020/01/22,"Rescuers resume search for four S. Korean climbers, three Nepal guides","Rescuers took advantage of improved weather on Nepal’s Mount Annapurna to press ahead with a search for four South Korean climbers and three Nepali guides and have a possible location for them, officials said on January 22.

Nine soldiers and seven civilian rescuers were digging through ice and snow on the Annapurna trekking trail and had made progress in determining their possible whereabouts, said army spokesman Bigyan Dev Pandey.

Snow and bad weather on January 21 stalled the rescue operation.

Khum Bahadur Subedi of the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal, another agency involved in the operation, said they are hoping to have a better idea of the location by the afternoon on January 22.

The trekkers and their guides are still listed as missing but mountaineering experts have said there is little chance they could have survived the massive avalanche on January 17.

The avalanche hit part of the trekking route after heavy snowfall earlier in the week. All other trekkers who were in the area have been flown by helicopters to safe areas.

The former Portuguese colony is a huge draw for mainland tourists as the only place in China that allows gambling.

With the Lunar New Year approaching this weekend, a huge influx of mainland tourists is expected in the city.

Asian countries have ramped up measures to block the spread of the new virus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan and has so far killed at least nine people.

On January 22, Macau announced its first confirmed case — a 52-year-old businesswoman from Wuhan who arrived in the city by high-speed rail on January 19, via the neighbouring city of Zhuhai.

“A series of tests found that she was positive for the coronavirus and had symptoms of pneumonia,” Lei Chin-lon, the head of Macau’s health bureau, told reporters.

The woman had been staying at the New Orient Landmark Hotel with two friends who were being monitored since her admission to hospital on January 21.

Ao Ieong Iu, Macau’s Secretary for Social Affairs and Culture, said staff in all casinos would be required to wear masks while anyone arriving at entry ports along the city’s border with the mainland would need to fill out health declaration forms.

27,2020/01/22,"Media report claims Saudi crown prince hacked Jeff Bezos’ phone, Saudi dismisses report","Saudi Arabia said on Wednesday that a media report that the Kingdom is behind the hacking of Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos' phone was “absurd.”

The billionaire's phone was hacked in 2018 after receiving a WhatsApp message that had been sent from the personal account of Saudi's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman, The Guardian reported on Tuesday, citing sources.

The encrypted message from the number used by the crown prince is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone Bezos had used and extracted large amounts of data within hours, the report said.

“Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr. Jeff Bezos' phone are absurd. We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,” Saudi's U.S. embassy said in a message posted on Twitter.

Amazon declined to comment.

The relationship between the Amazon chief executive and the Saudi government had soured since early last year after he alluded to Saudi Arabia's displeasure at the Bezos' owned Washington Post's coverage of the murder of its columnist and Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Bezos' security chief said at the time that Saudi had access to his phone and gained private information from it involving text messages between him and a former television anchor, who the National Enquirer tabloid newspaper said Bezos was dating.

The Saudi embassy in Washington on Tuesday dismissed suggestions that the kingdom hacked the phone of Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, as media reports linked the security breach to a WhatsApp message from an account of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

28,2020/01/22,China coronavirus: CDC confirms first U.S. case,"A Washington state man who recently traveled to China has been diagnosed with the coronavirus, becoming the first confirmed U.S. case of the newly identified illness that has killed six people in China and sickened some 300 others across Asia.

The patient, identified only as a man in his 30s, fell ill over the weekend after traveling to his hometown in China and was diagnosed with the coronavirus on Monday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee told reporters at a press conference in Seattle.

“This is not a moment of high anxiety,” Inslee said, reporting that the man was listed in satisfactory condition at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington and not known to have infected anyone else. “This is a low risk. It appears to have a transmission vector that really should not prevent anyone from going anywhere in Snohomish County, except maybe the isolation ward at the hospital.”

The coronavirus, which causes respiratory symptoms similar to a cold or flu, has been linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of about 11 million. That market has since been shut down.

The main Providence Regional Medical Center building is pictured after a spokesman from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a traveler from China has been the first person in the United States to be diagnosed with the Wuhan coronavirus, in Everett, Washington, U.S. January 21, 2020. | Photo Credit: REUTERS

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Washington State say the agency is preparing for more U.S. cases of the coronavirus to emerge, and the CDC raised its travel alert for Wuhan to a level 2, calling for enhanced precautions.

Under that alert level, the CDC recommends travelers to Wuhan should avoid contact with sick people, animals or animal markets.

Airports to screen passengers

At the Seattle press conference, CDC Medical Officer Satish Pillai said that all travelers from Wuhan would be directed to five U.S. airports — in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and San Francisco — for screening.

CDC officials said they have begun tracking down individuals who came in contact with the patient, who lives alone, to check them for symptoms, but so far have not found any additional patients.

Besides the United States, cases outside of China have been reported in South Korea, Thailand and Japan.

“I don't think looking at what we know so far that this it on the scale of SARS and MERS, the two most significant coronavirus outbreaks that we know from history,” Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said in a phone interview with Reuters. “It is early days in this outbreak and we don't have a good handle on the severity of illness.”

The CDC said it has screened more than 1,200 passengers since Jan. 17. None of them have been sent on for additional testing.

The U.S. traveler from Washington state had returned on Jan. 15, arriving at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, which is not on the U.S. list for enhanced screening. The patient sought care at a medical facility in Everett, Washington, and was treated for the illness. Based on his travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected the new coronavirus. Specimens were taken from the patient and sent to the CDC for testing. The agency said it has developed a new test that allowed it to identify the presence of the virus in a traveler.

As is often the case, preliminary information suggests older adults with underlying health conditions may be at increased risk of severe disease, according to the CDC.

The agency is working with health officials in China and globally to better understand the virus and any potential treatments, but U.S. officials have said it could take at least a year of testing before any vaccine could be used on the public.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/enfbc7/article30621878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAKUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-coronavirus-cdc-confirms-first-us-case/article30621879.ece
29,2020/01/22,Greta says planting not enough after Trump backs trillion tree plan,"Greta Thunberg said planting trees was not enough to address climate change on Tuesday, in an apparent rebuke to a planting pledge in Davos by U.S. President Donald Trump.

“Our house is still on fire,” Thunberg said, repeating her remarks at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum a year ago. “Your inaction is fuelling the flames,” the teenage activist added, in the latest to-and-fro with the 73-year-old president.

Their ongoing debate around climate change appears as an attempt by both to frame the argument, with Thunberg calling for an immediate end to fossil fuel investments in front of a packed audience less than a hour after watching Trump make his keynote address in the Swiss ski resort.

Trump announced the U.S. would join an existing initiative to plant one trillion trees, but also spoke at length about the economic importance of oil and gas and called climate change activists “pessimistic” and the “heirs of yesterday's foolish fortune tellers”.

Thunberg responded by referring to “empty words and promises” by world leaders. “You say children shouldn't worry... don't be so pessimistic and then, nothing, silence.”

Earlier, Thunberg called on world leaders to listen to young activists, who have followed her to Davos this year.

“I'm not a person that can complain about not being heard,” she said, prompting laughter from the audience on the first day of the annual WEF meeting. “The science and voice of young people is not the centre of the conversation, but it needs to be.”

Several young activists have travelled to the Swiss ski resort of Davos this year, following in Thunberg's footsteps.

Among the “climate heroes” being celebrated by the WEF are Irish teen scientist Fionn Ferreira, who created a solution for preventing micro plastics from reaching oceans. They also include South African climate activist Ayakha Melithafa, 17, and Canadian Autum Peltier, who has been advocating for water conservation since she was 8.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1pr6sh/article30621775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Greta,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/your-inaction-is-fuelling-flames/article30621776.ece
30,2020/01/22,"China coronavirus death toll hits 17, over 470 infected","Deaths from China’s new flu-like virus rose to 17 on January 22, heightening global fears of contagion from an infection suspected to have come from animals.

The previously unknown and contagious coronavirus strain emerged from the central city of Wuhan, with cases now detected as far away as the United States. Officials believe the origin to be a market where wildlife is traded illegally.

The latest death toll in Hubei Province, of which Wuhan is the capital, had risen to 17 by 1200 GMT (7.30 p.m. IST) on January 22, state television quoted the provincial government as saying.

Hours earlier, officials had put the toll at nine dead, all in Wuhan, and more than 470 cases confirmed in China.

Contrasting with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, China has this time given regular updates to try to head off panic as millions travel at home and abroad for the Lunar New Year.

“The rise in the mobility of the public has objectively increased the risk of the epidemic spreading,” National Health Commission Vice-Minister Li Bin said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) began an emergency meeting to rule if the outbreak was a global health emergency.

After official appeals to stay calm, many Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks, avoiding public places such as cinemas and shopping centres, and even turning to an online plague simulation game or watching disaster movie The Flu as a way to cope. “The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,” said one commentator on China's Twitter-like Weibo.

The virus has spread from Wuhan around China to population centres including Beijing, Shanghai, Macau and Hong Kong. Abroad, Thailand has confirmed four cases, while the United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan have each reported one.

President Donald Trump said the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had a good containment plan. “We think it is going to be handled very well,” he said at Davos in Switzerland.

Respiratory threat

Mr. Li said the virus, which can cause pneumonia, was being spread via breathing. Symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing. About 2,200 people in contact with infected people were in isolation. There is no vaccine for the virus.

“I believe the government for sure, but I still feel fearful. Because there's no cure for the virus,” said Fu Ning, a 36-year-old woman in Beijing. “You have to rely on your immunity if you get an infection. It sounds very scary.”

Fears of a pandemic initially spooked markets, with aviation and luxury goods stocks hit and the yuan falling, but they were regaining their footing on Wednesday in approval of China's containment response.

Across China, companies from Foxconn to Huawei Technologies and HSBC Holdings were warning staff to avoid Wuhan and handing out masks. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of Apple supplier Foxconn, said he was advising employees not to visit China.

With more than 11 million people, Wuhan is central China's main industrial and commercial centre and an important transport hub, home to the country's largest inland port and gateway to its giant Three Gorges hydroelectric dam.

WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said new cases would appear as China stepped up monitoring. But Li said there was no evidence of “super-spreaders” capable of disseminating the virus more widely, as happened during the SARS outbreak. SARS was thought to have crossed to humans from civet cats sold for food.

Global precautions

Airports round the world have stepped up screening of people from China.

Russia's consumer safety watchdog said it had strengthened its sanitary and quarantine control, Britain said it would start enhanced monitoring of passengers arriving from Wuhan and Singapore started screening all passengers arriving from China.

The Chinese-ruled gambling hub of Macau confirmed its first case of pneumonia linked to the coronavirus and tightened body-temperature screening measures.

A first case of the virus emerged in Hong Kong on January 22, media reported. The patient arrived via high-speed railway from the mainland and had been quarantined. “The whole world is watching,” the city's Commerce Secretary, Edward Yau, told Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Mexico said it was investigating a potential case of the virus.

North Korea banned foreign tourists from January 22 due to the virus, several foreign tour operators said, losing one of its main sources of foreign currency.

Sport too was affected, with some qualifying boxing matches for the 2020 Olympics set for Wuhan cancelled and women's football qualifiers shifted to Nanjing.

China's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, the top legal authority in the communist-ruled country, posted on January 21 that anyone failing to report virus cases “will be forever nailed to the pillar of historical shame”.

But despite such openness, some experts were sceptical.

“We have reason to doubt whether surv (surveillance) is adequate as cases mount,” tweeted Lawrence Gostin, a public health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fszu71/article30621613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAOUTBREAK1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-virus-toll-continues-to-rise-number-of-affected-crosses-470/article30621614.ece
31,2020/01/22,Lebanon forms government with backing of Hezbollah and allies,"Lebanon formed a new government on January 21 under Prime Minister Hassan Diab after the Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its allies agreed on a cabinet that must urgently address an economic crisis.

The heavily indebted state has been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri quit as premier in October, prompted by protests against politicians who have collectively led Lebanon into the worst crisis since the 1975-90 war.

New Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni said Lebanon needed foreign aid to save it from an unprecedented situation that had forced people to “beg for dollars” at the banks and fear for their deposits. He also described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as “a fireball”.

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and allies including President Michel Aoun nominated Diab as premier last month after efforts failed to strike a deal with Hariri, Lebanon's main Sunni leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states.

Weeks of wrangling over portfolios among Hezbollah's allies held up an agreement until Tuesday, when the heavily armed group delivered an ultimatum to its allies to make a deal or suffer the consequences, sources familiar with the talks said.

The cabinet is made up of 20 specialist ministers backed by parties. Wazni, an economist who had served as an adviser to parliament's finance and budget committee, was nominated with the backing of Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. Nassif Hitti, a former ambassador to the Arab League, was named foreign minister with the backing of Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement.

Diab described his government as a technocratic “rescue team” that would work to achieve protesters' goals. His first trip abroad would be to the Arab region, particularly the Gulf.

But analysts said Hezbollah's role meant Diab might have trouble winning foreign support.

Protesters took to the streets of Beirut as the government was announced. Police fired water canons at stone-throwing demonstrators near parliament who tried to dismantle newly erected barricades. “This government doesn't reflect us,” said protester Rabih Al-Zein.

The absence of a government had left Lebanon rudderless as ordinary people suffered in the crisis.

A liquidity crunch has led banks to restrict access to cash and the Lebanese pound to slump. Jobs have been lost and inflation has soared. Over the last week, hundreds have been injured in clashes between the security forces and demonstrators.

“Any government better than a vacuum”

Hezbollah is designated as a terrorist group by the United States, and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia and the Gulf Arab states that have provided Lebanon with financial aid in the past have for years been deeply concerned by its rising influence in Beirut.

“It will certainly not be easy for a government of this type to convince the outside world to help Lebanon,” said Nabil Boumonsef, deputy editor-in-chief of the An-Nahar newspaper.

Hariri and his Future Movement have stayed out of the government, along with the staunchly anti-Hezbollah Christian Lebanese Forces party and the Progressive Socialist Party of Druze leader Walid Jumblatt. “Any government is better than a vacuum becaues what is coming is more difficult,” Jumblatt wrote on Twitter.

Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said the new government of “one colour” could further polarise Lebanese politics. Hariri's absence meant that old Sunni-Shi'ite tensions might be reactivated.

One of the government's first tasks will be to decide its approach to looming sovereign bond repayments, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing in March.

Wazni, speaking to al-Jadeed TV, said the government needed “a clear position” on the maturing Eurobonds. Lebanon's union of exchange dealers said on Tuesday it had decided to set the exchange rate at a maximum of 2,000 Lebanese pounds to the U.S. dollar in agreement with the central bank governor. The pound has been officially pegged at 1,507.50 to the dollar for more than two decades. Diab expressed hope that the currency would strengthen.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1jhu34/article30621513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LEBANONPROTESTS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-forms-government-with-backing-of-hezbollah-and-allies/article30621514.ece
32,2020/01/22,Militants kill 36 civilians in Burkina Faso market attack,"Thirty-six civilians were killed in Burkina Faso on Monday in what the government called a terrorist attack on a market in Sanmatenga province.

Armed militants forced their way into the market of the village of Alamou and attacked people there before burning the structure to the ground, the government said in a statement on Tuesday.

The bloodshed is part of a surge in violence in the West African country that has killed hundreds, forced nearly a million from their homes and made much of the north ungovernable over the past two years. “These repeated attacks on innocent civilians call for real cooperation between defence and security forces,” the government said.

President Roch Marc Kabore called for two days of national mourning in response to the attack. It was not immediately clear who was responsible.

Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have carried out increasingly brazen attacks against civilian and military targets in Burkina Faso in recent months, including an attack on a mining convoy in November that killed nearly 40 people.

33,2020/01/22,Pakistan scribe held over FB posts on govt.,"A Pakistani journalist critical of the government and the Army has been detained for five days for having published “anti-state” comments online, his lawyer told AFP Tuesday, in a new illustration of shrinking freedoms in Pakistan.

Azhar-ul Haq Wahid, who worked for a small television channel and a newspaper with a limited readership, made comments about the Pakistani establishment on his Facebook account. He recently wrote that a court decision to lift the death penalty on former military ruler Pervez Musharraf had “mocked” the Constitution. A police report said “anti-state and defamatory material” was noted on his Facebook account against the public functionaries and state departments” was noted on his Facebook account, according to a copy seen by AFP.

Mr. Wahid was arrested last Thursday in the eastern city of Lahore, and has been in custody since. His lawyer Mian Dawood said a court must decide his bail later this week.

The arrest “is only to threaten the freedom of media” which has faced “blatant censorship for last three years in Pakistan”, Mr. Dawood told AFP.

It is “clearly another attempt to intimidate journalists who refuse to be censored,” said the head of the Asia-Pacific office of Reporters Without Borders Daniel Bastard, asking the Pakistani justice “dismiss the charges against Mr. Wahid and free him at once.

Pakistan has long been one of the most dangerous places in the world for journalists, once caught between Islamist militants and the powerful security establishment.

However security has dramatically improved in recent years. Now Pakistani media complain of increasing censorship and pressure by the military establishment.

34,2020/01/22,Key Ministers retained in new Russian government,"President Vladimir Putin appointed a new government on Tuesday, keeping key officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was also retained.

The list of appointments released by the Kremlin showed Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu would be staying on in the government.

The government of Putin's longtime ally Dmitry Medvedev resigned last Wednesday, a few hours after the president announced a series of constitutional reforms.

He was replaced the next day by Mikhail Mishustin, the little-known head of Russia's tax service.

“I sincerely wish you success... it is in the interests of the entire country,” Putin said in televised meeting with the new cabinet members.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Energy Minister Alexander Novak also kept their posts, though several ministers dealing with social policy were replaced.

35,2020/01/22,"In documentary, Hillary Clinton says ‘nobody likes Sanders’","Former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton has launched a scathing attack on presidential hopeful and 2016 Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, telling in a documentary that “nobody likes him.”

Ms. Clinton also refused to say whether she would endorse and campaign for Mr. Sanders if he becomes the Democrats' choice to take on President Donald Trump in November's election. “He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him,” Ms. Clinton, 72, says in a four-part series due to air on streaming site Hulu in March.

“Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician.”

“It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it,” she adds.

Mr. Sanders, a leftist Senator from Vermont, is among the leaders in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination.

He sits second in national polls behind Joe Biden and ahead of Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, two weeks before the first nomination vote in Iowa.

Mr. Sanders, 78, pushed Ms. Clinton to the wire four years ago in an acrimonious, months-long battle for the party's nomination. Ms. Clinton won that race but lost to Mr. Trump in November.

Asked whether she would back Mr. Sanders if he won the nomination this time around, Ms. Clinton said: “I'm not going to go there yet. We're still in a very vigorous primary season.”

Ms. Warren has accused Mr. Sanders of telling her privately in December 2018, as they contemplated White House runs, that he did not believe a woman could win a presidential election.

Mr. Sanders denies the claim but Ms. Clinton said the comment was “part of a pattern.”

“If it were a one-off, you might say, 'OK, fine.' But he said I was unqualified,” she recalled.

“It's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women,” she added.

Mr. Sanders was forced to apologize to Biden on Monday after one of his supporters, Zephyr Teachout, wrote an opinion article in The Guardian accusing the former vice-president of having “a big corruption problem.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/1iym1b/article30618335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-hillary,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/in-documentary-hillary-clinton-says-nobody-likes-sanders/article30618336.ece

38,2020/01/22,"U.S. ready to 'help' India, Pakistan on Kashmir: Trump","U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States was watching developments between India and Pakistan over Kashmir “very closely” and was prepared to help if necessary, but did not say how.

Speaking ahead of talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump said trade and borders were both critical points for discussion, while Mr. Khan said that for him Afghanistan was the top priority.

Explained: Why does India say no to Kashmir mediation

“Trade is going to be of very, very paramount importance ... and we're working together on some borders, and we're talking about Kashmir in relation to what is going on with Pakistan and India. And if we can help we certainly will be helping,” he said.

“We've been watching that and following it very, very closely,” he added.

India maintains that Kashmir is a bilateral issue and no third party has any role in it. Pakistan has been trying to internationalise the Kashmir issue after India withdrew the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, but New Delhi has asserted the abrogation of Article 370 was its “internal matter.”

Mr. Khan, an international cricketer before turning to politics, said that while relations with India were important, the most pressing concern was Afghanistan.

“The main issue, of course, is Afghanistan because it concerns the U.S. and Pakistan,” he said. “Both of us are interested in peace there and an orderly transition in Afghanistan with talks with the Taliban and the government.”

39,2020/01/22,Forgot your password? Not having one is safer: WEF study,"With weak or stolen passwords accounting for an average of four out of five global data breaches, a new study has said it is safer not to have a password.

The new report released by the World Economic Forum here during its 2020 annual meeting said that freeing ourselves of passwords will actually make individuals safer and businesses more efficient.

Cybercrime is set to cost the global economy USD 2.9 million every minute in 2020, and some 80% of these attacks are password-related.

Knowledge-based authentication — whether with PINs, passwords, passphrases, or whatever we need to remember — is not only a major headache for users, it is costly to maintain, the study found.

For larger businesses, it is estimated that nearly 50% of IT help desk costs are allocated to password resets, with average annual spend for companies now at over USD 1 million for staffing alone.

“Password-less authentication does not mean removing all security barriers to our digitalised society. It means harnessing tools such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to save users time and save company money,” the WEF said.

“With the growing availability of biometrics and next-generation technology, consumers are demanding a better digital experience while wanting to be secure online,” said Adrien Ogee, Project Lead, Platform for Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust, World Economic Forum. Better authentication practices are not just possible they are a necessity.

The report, produced in collaboration with the FIDO Alliance, has suggested five top password-less authentication technologies, ready for implementation by global companies. They are biometrics, behavioural analytics, zero-knowledge proofs, QR codes and security keys.

“Relying on passwords as the primary means for authentication no longer provides the security or user experience that consumers demand,” said Andrew Shikiar, Executive Director and Chief Marketing Officer of the FIDO Alliance.

The path forward is with standards-based, cryptographically secure authentication that keeps login info secure and private, while providing a fundamentally better user experience.",internet,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/k0hyf4/article30624200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22NETPASSWORD,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/forgot-your-password-not-having-one-is-safer-wef-study/article30624201.ece

According to the firm, India has shown positive progress in its fight against cybercriminals and 38.8% of the overall Kaspersky users in the country were attacked at least once by a web-based attacks in 2019 as compared to 2018 when it stood at 40.4%.

“In my opinion, cybersecurity is the most troubled area for any large enterprise. With our comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity solutions, we are in a position to help organisations to mitigate or respond to any kind of dynamic threats,” Dipesh Kaura, General Manager for South Asia, Kaspersky, said in a statement.

The threats include file-less malwares, social engineering attacks and other attacks that were targeted through the world wide web.

The total number of unique threats detected by Kaspersky products in the year 2019 were 14,22,50,268.

According to Kaspersky’s KSN reports, from 2018 and 2019, there has been a moderate decrease in the number of attacks targeted at India.

“In India, we did see a decrease in the number of adware and malware attacks, however there has been a huge increase in riskware attacks from 28% in 2018 to 39% in 2019.

The profit was reported on a 5.4% growth in revenue during the quarter to ₹36,717.6 crore.

The company won new orders worth ₹41,579 crore during the quarter in a subdued business environment, registering a 2% growth over a year earlier.

Cumulative order flow

On a cumulative basis, the order inflow for the nine- month period ended December 31, 2019 stood at ₹1,28,571 crore, growing at 11% over the corresponding period of the previous year.

“We will meet the order inflow target, sales and profit margins guidance. On the revenue front, the asking rate is not different from last year as we get most of the orders in the last quarter. We expect to be somewhere in the band of the guidance given,” said S.N. Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO, L&T. The consolidated order book of the group stood at ₹3,06,280 crore as at December 31, 2019, registering a growth of 5% over March, 2019. International orders constitute 24% of the total order book.

“This quarter and the last nine months have been very challenging but we were able to deal with the challenges. Economic growth slowed down substantially and if we are to grow at sub-5%, it’s not good news for companies like us that depend upon investments,” said R. Shankar Raman, Group CFO, L&T.

L&T’s revenue from the infrastructure segment fell 5% to ₹17,249 crore during the quarter.

“Challenges faced in projects in Andhra Pradesh and for a short duration in Maharashtra and Delhi, coupled with lower fund allocation in some States adversely impacted the execution progress,” said Mr. Subrahmanyan. The infrastructure segment constitutes almost half of L&T’s order book and revenue.

44,2020/01/22,Indian corporates yet to work towards employee wellness: Experts,"Employee wellness is one of the biggest needs of corporate India today especially when enterprises are increasingly talking about employee engagement.

Corporates, have been focusing around employee health and fitness by offering a slew of things: health insurances, gyms, dietitian services, sports/games and yoga/meditation centres. However, most of these services currently remain under-utilised or not benefited because the most important faculty — the mind and it’s wellness — was so far never addressed, as per healthcare experts and HR professionals who participated in a discussion on Wellness at Work.

Vishal Bali, executive chairman, Asia Healthcare Holdings, said, “Indian corporates has been concentrating on the physical health of their employees for decades now. But being happy is mostly a function of the mind and very little of it is physical. Some companies are beginning to realise the distinction between health and wellness, but a lot of work has to happen in this front.’’

The panelists, in general, were of the opinion that creating a pool of sound-minded people was critical for the overall productivity, profitability and per employee revenue enhancement for corporates.

Rupa Parashuram, vice-president, rewards, human capital management at Goldman Sachs argued workplaces should offer platforms for employees to talk about their work and life challenges freely and fearlessly.

“The moment you say mental health, the perception is that someone is having a close door consultation with a shrink. It’s not so. On our campus, we are trying pet therapy, art therapy, music therapy and we have also opened multiple avenues for employees to vent out emotions. These efforts are yielding good results in making our people happy and stress free.’’

Every corporate that endorses employee engagement for better performance should concentrate on wellness of their employees, as a precursor. “The power of happy mind is unbelievable and it will have direct impact on personal and corporate success,’’ said Rahul Mansharmani, VP and global head, rewards, Wipro.

Corporates should take wellness care very seriously especially when social support systems are breaking down and stress levels are only increasing.

Sanjeev Prasad senior director, human resources at Samsung R&D Institute India said, “A bad manager, a poor leader, an unfriendly work environment or unsuitable job role, any of these can trigger stress at work. Employers should be mindful of and sensitive to their employees’ mental happiness. We at Samsung understand it and if we realise an employee requires a family holiday, we send him/her for it at company cost.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-corporates-yet-to-work-towards-employee-wellness-experts/article30627634.ece

“On 22nd January 2020, OIL has filed a clarificatory/modificatory petition before the Hon’ble Supreme Court against its order and next course of action will be based on the outcome of the petition,” the company said in a statement.

The PSU clarified that it obtained a National Long Distance Service Licence (NLD Licence) to establish ‘Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System (SCADA)’ for control, management and protection of Oil India’s pipeline network used for transportation of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products.

It added that NLD licence was predominantly used for the SCADA system and only the spare bandwidth capacity was leased out to other telecom operators. “As per the licence terms, licence fee is to be paid on Gross Total Revenue from services provided under the NLD licence. Since the award of the NLD licence, the cumulative revenue of ₹1.47 crore was earned by OIL from leasing of spare bandwidth capacity on which all applicable licence fee and other statutory dues as per licence terms has been paid by OIL regularly,” it added.

Following the SC judgment, DoT had issued demand notices to OIL seeking payment of licence fee on total reported revenue, including revenue from sale of crude oil, natural gas etc., which neither relates to the NLD licence nor can be treated as supplementary/ value added services related to the NLD licence.

48,2020/01/22,"Axis Bank Q3 profit rises 5%, growth muted over bad loans","Private sector lender Axis bank reported a net profit of ₹1,757 crore for the third quarter of the financial year, reflecting a 5% growth over the same period of the previous fiscal.

Net profit growth was muted due to elevated level of slippages to bad loans. The bank’s operating profit for the quarter was ₹5,743 crore, up 4% year-on-year.

“[Third quarter] of FY19 had witnessed one large recovery in an account in the steel sector,” the bank said.

Net interest income (NII) grew 15% year-on-year to ₹6,453 crore, while net interest margin for the third quarter stood at a 10-quarter high of 3.57%.

“The environment remained challenging, with banking sector loans and deposit growth [at] 8% and 10% respectively. In this context, our domestic business growth has been healthy,” Amitabh Chaudhry, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Bank, said in the post earnings media conference.

Non-interest income for the period was ₹3,787 crore compared to ₹4,000 crore a year earlier.

Slippages to non-performing assets remained elevated at ₹6,214 crore for the third quarter, compared with ₹4,983 crore in the second quarter and ₹3,746 crore a year earlier.

Slippages from the loan book stood at ₹5,124 crore. In addition, slippages from the investment book were at ₹1,090 crore, largely from one housing finance company account, the bank said. “On the asset quality front, slippages remained elevated as we anticipated and mentioned previously. The stock of our BB rated book has declined significantly and in line with normalised levels,” Mr. Chaudhry said.

Bad loan provisions for the quarter were ₹2,962 crore, compared with ₹3,352 crore in Q3 last year and ₹2,701 crore in Q2.

“The bank now holds ₹2,558 crore of additional provisions for various contingencies which are not considered in provision coverage ratio,” Mr. Chaudhry said. The bank’s PCR as on end December was 78%.

As on December 31, 2019, the bank’s gross NPA was 5% as compared to 5.03% in the previous quarter and 5.75% a year ago. Net NPA ratio was 2.09% as compared to 1.99% in the previous quarter and 2.36% year ago.

Domestic loans grew 18% while retail loans grew 25% on year to Rs 2,91,554 crore and accounted for 53% of the net advances of the Bank.

The share of unsecured loans like personal loans and credit cards has been stable on year on year basis at 17% of retail book.

The corporate loan book grew by 9%, with domestic corporate loan book up 16%.

The total deposits grew 15% year-on-year. The share of current and savings account deposit and retail term deposits in the total deposits stood at 82% as on December end.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/7trgvj/article30627911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-axis-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/business/axis-bank-q3-profit-rises-5-growth-muted-over-bad-loans/article30627561.ece
49,2020/01/22,Tata Motors unveils premium hatchback Altroz,"Tata Motors has entered into the premium hatchback segment with the launch of Altroz at an introductory price starting from ₹5.29 lakh for the petrol version and ₹6.99 lakh for the diesel version.

This segment constitutes about 12.5% of the passenger vehicles market and Maruti and Hyundai sell about 40,000 units of their premium hatchback models a month.

Altroz, with a BS-VI engine, is the first vehicle from Tata Motors which has been developed on the new ALFA architecture and the second vehicle showing the Impact 2.0 design language after Tiago.

Fitted with safety features and driving assistance systems, the technologically loaded Altroz comes with six different factory-fitted customisable options to be chosen by customers. Along with the introduction of Altroz, Tata Motors on Wednesday launched the fully-refreshed BS-VI versions of Tiago, Tigor and Nexon.

Focus on safety

Stating that these cars were not just fully BS-VI ready, but also offered a lot more to aspiring Indian customers, Mayank Pareek, president, Passenger Vehicles Business Unit, Tata Motors said, “We have gone beyond BS-VI and are focussing on passenger safety with the introduction of Altroz. This car is a premium product for safety-conscious customers.”

He said the company would not get involved in the pricing game, but would rather focus on providing ‘technologically superior’ and safe vehicles which can command a premium in the market.

Speaking at the launch, Guenter Butschek, CEO and MD, Tata Motors said, “We promised to kick-start the year with a product offensive and here we are. The future of efficient, green, sustainable mobility solutions needs to translate into reality and we have made a start by bringing the new generation of BS-VI solutions to the market.”

More in store

“With Altroz, we are expanding our market coverage further. We have lots more in store for 2020 and we have just commenced unveiling our well-defined future product portfolio,” he added.

51,2020/01/22,Businesses face digital ceiling in their transformation progress: Infosys’ study,"Businesses globally face a “digital ceiling” when it comes to digital transformation, according to new research from Infosys Knowledge Institute (IKI), the thought leadership and research arm of the tech major.

The study, Infosys Digital Radar 2020, has assessed the digital transformation efforts of companies on a Digital Maturity Index and found year-over-year progress in basic areas, such as digital initiatives to improve a company’s efficiency.

However, most companies come up against a “digital ceiling” when trying to achieve the most advanced levels of maturity, as per the study.

Companies knew how to achieve moderate transformation success, with an 18% increase in companies progressing this year from the lowest tier of Watchers to the middle Explorer tier. However, Explorers struggled to move into the top Visionary cluster, with the top tier remaining the same, indicating a “digital ceiling” to transformation efforts, found the study.

Salil Parekh, CEO and MD at Infosys said: “We’ve seen enterprises successfully employ emerging technologies to optimise productivity and efficiency, but struggle at the next stage of digital maturity. Faster, better, and cheaper technology alone will not provide the improvements enterprises need. Our research has shown that companies which can keep pace with digital transformation are those that design digital initiatives to improve customer experiences and empower their employees, differentiating themselves and propelling their business to the most advanced levels of progress.”

The report, which surveyed over 1,000 executives globally, ranked the most digitally advanced companies as “Visionaries”, followed by “Explorers” and then “Watchers.”

As per the survey, the Visionary cluster remains unchanged despite companies reporting fewer barriers to digital transformation than last year. Human, rather than technological, barriers are now the most persistent, with the two of the top hurdles being the lack of talent or skills (34%) and a risk-averse corporate culture (35%).

The research demonstrates that top performers break through the digital ceiling because they think differently.

Firstly, successful companies focus strongly on people, using digital transformation to make improvements centred on customers and employees.

Most companies (68%) across the spectrum stated operational efficiency and increased productivity as a main transformation objective. But successful companies in the Visionary cluster are particularly motivated to make improvements for their employees. Nearly half of Visionaries describe “empowering employees” as a major business objective for transformation, compared with less than one third of Explorers and less than one fifth of Watchers.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/businesses-face-digital-ceiling-in-their-transformation-progress-infosys-study/article30627477.ece

53,2020/01/22,India initiates probe into alleged dumping of newsprint from 5 countries,"India has started a probe into alleged dumping of newsprint, used in printing of newspapers, from five countries, including Australia and Canada, following a complaint by an industry association.

Indian Newsprint Manufacturers Association has filed an application before Directorate General of Trade Remedies (DGTR) on behalf of domestic industry for an anti-dumping investigation on imports of ‘Newsprint, in rolls or sheets, excluding glazed newsprint’ originating in or exported from Australia, Canada, European Union, Hong Kong, and Russia.

DGTR is an investigation arm of the commerce ministry, which probes dumping of goods, significant increase in imports and subsidised imports from India’s trade partners.

Global trade rules, framed by Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO), allow these initiatives to guard domestic industry from these anti-trade practices.

In a notification, the directorate has stated that on the basis of the prima facie evidence submitted by the association about dumping of the product from these countries, “the authority, hereby, initiates an investigation.”

In the probe, DGTR will determine the existence, degree and effect of alleged dumping on domestic manufacturers.

If it is established that the dumping has impacted the domestic industry, the directorate would recommend imposition of anti-dumping duty. The finance ministry will take the final decision on imposing these duties.

The period of investigation is April to December 2019. It would also look at 2016-19 data.

Countries carry out anti-dumping probe to determine whether their domestic industries have been hurt because of a surge in cheap imports.

As a counter measure, they impose duties under the multilateral regime of the WTO.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/usdg8d/article30623298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22NEWSPRINT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-initiates-probe-into-alleged-dumping-of-newsprint-from-5-countries/article30623299.ece
54,2020/01/22,Airlines scour the world for scarce 737 MAX simulators,"Airlines are scrambling to book time in 737 MAX training facilities as far afield as Fiji, Iceland and Panama, operators said, after Boeing Co recommended pilots be trained in one of the few simulators replicating the latest model.

That means thousands of pilots from more than 54 airlines need to squeeze into about three dozen 737 MAX simulators around the world before they can fly the plane.

“Boeing is recommending that all 737 MAX pilots undergo training in a 737 MAX simulator prior to flying the aircraft in commercial service,” the company told Reuters on Tuesday evening, the first confirmation of its new policy.

On Jan. 7, the company had recommended using a simulator but did not specify what type.

The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes and cannot return to service until regulators approve software changes and training plans.

The estimated 34 737 MAX simulators in service, produced separately by CAE Inc and Textron Inc's simulator and training division TRU, are less than a quarter of the number of older 737 NG simulators certified by U.S. and European regulators.

“I think that what a shortage of simulators will mean is the fleet of MAXes will start flying more slowly than what the airlines would like,” said Gudmundur Orn Gunnarsson, managing director of TRU Flight Training Iceland, a joint venture between Icelandair and Textron's simulator and training division.

“In the beginning it was said that simulator training would not be needed,” he said. “This changes it totally.”

SIMULATORS SCARCE

Gunnarsson said TRU Flight Training Iceland had more inquiries than usual from potential airline customers about the use of its 737 MAX simulator since Boeing's Jan. 7 announcement.

Boeing said on Tuesday it did not expect to win approval for returning the 737 MAX to service until mid-year, longer than previous estimates, in part because regulators are working on new pilot training requirements.

Many airlines did not order 737 MAX simulators, assuming they could rely on the older 737 NG simulators because the types were so similar.

Simulators can cost C$10 million ($7.64 million) to C$20 million each, with the 737 MAX at the upper end, CAE said. Hourly rates for simulator training can cost $500 to $1,000, it said.

High demand for 737 MAX simulators has led the Montreal-company and its rival TRU to produce simulators for customers they have yet to line up.

“Customers are making increasing inquiries from all over the globe,” a TRU spokeswoman said.

South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet, which does not have a 737 MAX simulator, said it had already contacted Boeing, other airlines and training centers.

“With limited MAX simulators available, we expect carriers will likely face challenges to book slots for MAX simulators,” said an Eastar official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity.

SELLING TIME

Fiji Airways spent more than $10 million to buy a 737 MAX simulator to help save on the costs and lost productivity of sending pilots to Singapore, Australia and the United States for training, said its chief operating officer, Paul Doherty.

The carrier uses its simulator 35% to 42% of the available hours to train its 70 737 pilots and had plans to sell the additional time. Now it is getting calls from airlines thousands of miles away.

“We have got interest ... particularly from Asia,” Doherty said. “We are expecting some from the U.S. Our focus is to really develop our own pilots and to provide the best for Fiji Airways, but we are also very happy to help other airlines that need some time. That could be a real choke point, I think, for a lot of airlines.”

Panamanian carrier Copa Holdings SA, the only Latin American airline with a 737 MAX simulator, said it was seeing a lot of demand, although it was not authorized to disclose the interested carriers. Copa said it its top priority was to train its own 245 pilots.

U.S. airlines have more simulators than many of their counterparts abroad, but they also have more 737 pilots to train, which could be done in stages.

Before Boeing's recommendations for simulator training, Southwest Airlines Co, the world's largest 737 operator, had estimated it would take about 30 days to train all of its roughly 10,000 737 pilots on the MAX.

On Tuesday, the Dallas-based carrier said it would be premature to make cost and timing estimates before regulators approved a training package.

The airline said it has three simulators in various stages of FAA certification and expects to receive an additional three in late 2020.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/f1zrwr/article30326210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BOEING-737MAXSAFRAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/airlines-scour-the-world-for-scarce-737-max-simulators/article30622085.ece
55,2020/01/22,Centre seeks guidelines on execution of convicts,"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on January 22 moved the Supreme Court to frame guidelines to execute death penalty of condemned prisoners within seven days of rejection of their mercy petitions.

The move comes amid various pleas filed by convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case that has delayed their hanging. The four convicts are on death row since 2013 after a trial court ruled against them. Multiple curative petitions and mercy pleas filed before the President of India have been rejected.

The MHA filed an application in the top court on January 22 to seek “appropriate clarification/modification and directions” in the 2014 Shatrughan Singh Chauhan and another vs Union of India judgment that defined the procedure to be adopted in cases of prisoners on death row.

‘Accused-centric rules’

The existing guidelines, the Ministry said, are “accused-centric”.

“These guidelines, however, do not take into account an irreparable mental trauma, agony, upheaval and derangement of the victims and their family members, the collective conscience of the nation and the deterrent effect which the capital punishment intends to make. It is found several years before and after the judgment in the Shatrughan case that convicts of even such heinous crimes under the garb of Article 21 take the judicial process for a ride,” the MHA said.

It sought a direction that “if the convict of death sentence wants to file mercy petition, it would be mandatory for a convict of death sentence to do so only within a period of seven days from the date of receipt of death warrant issued by the competent court”.

The MHA submitted that the court should “mandate all the competent courts, State governments, prison authorities in the country to issue death warrant of a convict within seven days of the rejection of his mercy petition and to execute death sentence within seven days thereafter irrespective of the stage of review petition/curative petition/mercy petition of his co-convicts”.

The MHA also pleaded that “it would be permissible for the death convicts to file curative petition after rejection of review petition only within a time to be stipulated by this Hon’ble Court and not thereafter”.

MHA submitted that while taking care of the rights of the convicts, it is more important and need of the hour to lay down guidelines in the interest of the victims, their families and in larger public interest. “...lest the guilty of such horrible, and dreadful, cruel, abominable, ghastly, gruesome and henious offences would be permitted to play with the majesty of law and prolonged the execution of the sentence awarded to them in accordance with the law,” MHA application said.

On December 18, 2019, the Supreme Court dismissed the review petition filed by Nirbhaya gangrape convict Akshay against its 2017 judgment upholding his death penalty. The top court in July 2018 dismissed the review petition of the other three convicts — Mukesh (30), Pawan Gupta (23) and Vinay Sharma (24) — in the case saying no grounds have been made out by them for review of the 2017 verdict.

56,2020/01/22,BJP backs policy of loot and scoot: Congress,"The Congress on Wednesday slammed the Narendra Modi government in the wake of a criminal case filed by the CBI against two directors of Mumbai-based Frost International for defrauding Bank of India of ₹3,592.48 crore. The party accused the government of encouraging “loot and scoot” culture. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill told a press conference that the BJP government continued to play the role of either “facilitator” or just remained “mute spectator” whenever fraudsters “fleece and fly.”

‘Discrepancies in probe’

In this latest scam, the 10 company directors are untraceable after allegedly defrauding a consortium of 14 banks led by Bank of India. “This once again reaffirms the BJP’s policy of giving pain to common man and gain to con man,” Mr. Shergill said. He pointed out various discrepancies in the investigation of the case.

The Congress claimed that the consortium of banks had noted the default in payments by Frost International way back in January 2018. But it took them two years to file a formal complaint, which was finally lodged on January 10 last year. A formal FIR was only filed a year later on January 19.

This case, he said, followed the same pattern as cases of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi and other economic offenders.

The Congress also raised the issue of rising non-performing assets. “Instead of building a five trillion economy, the BJP has waived off bad loans and emptied public savings to the tune of ₹5 lakh crore,” Mr. Shergill said.

Rahul’s tweet

Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi too on Twitter flagged news stories about doubling of NPAs with Life Insurance Corporation of India. He accused the government of risking people’s future by damaging the financial health of LIC. According to news reports, the NPAs with LIC had doubled and now stand at ₹30,000 crore in five years. “Crores of honest people invest in LIC because they trust it. The Modi government is risking their future by damaging LIC and destroying the trust the public has in it,” Mr. Gandhi said.

57,2020/01/22,‘Presidential Order under Article 370 has no relevance’,"The Centre could not have on August 5, 2019 unilaterally notified a Presidential Order under Article 370 of the Constitution to fundamentally alter the governance and identity of Jammu and Kashmir, senior advocate Sanjay Parekh submitted before the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Appearing before a Constitution Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana, Mr. Parekh, appearing for the PUCL, explained that the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir was adopted on November 17, 1956. The J&K Constituent Assembly dissolved after that on January 26, 1957. The very purpose of a temporary provision of Article 370 ended there. The future governance of J&K was entrusted to the erstwhile State’s Constitution. Hence, a Presidential Order under Article 370 has no relevance.

Mr. Parekh referred to the Supreme Court’s Prem Nath Kaul judgment of 1959, the first verdict after the J&K Constitution was framed.

The court held that it was the Constituent Assembly of the State which decided the constitutional relationship between J&K and the Union of India. The purpose of Article 370 came to an end with the framing of Constitution and dissolution of Constituent Assembly of Jammu & Kashmir.

“The idea clearly was that thereafter the civil, political, cultural and socio-economic rights should be governed by the Constitution of J&K and the aspirations of the people of Jammu & Kashmir,” Mr. Parekh argued.

He submitted that this interpretation was in consonance with the intention of the people even before the Instrument of Accession, the Debates in Constituent Assembly while framing the Indian Constitution, the Delhi Agreement, as well as the Kaul judgment.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t8m3sz/article30627631.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22TH-THGRP-SC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/presidential-order-under-article-370-has-no-relevance/article30627632.ece

DySP Singh was arrested while ferrying three Hizb militants in a private vehicle on the Srinagar-Jammu national highway on January 11. They will be formally produced before the NIA court.

Sources said the police officer and the three others were taken outside the Valley in two separate flights.

DySP Singh is facing charges under Section 7 of the Arms Act, Section 3 of the Explosive Substances Act and Section 18, 19, 39 and 48 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Safe house identified

Meanwhile, a team of the NIA encircled a house in Srinagar’s Gulshan Nagar area, following a tip-off that Hizb ‘commander’ Babu used it as a safe haven during his stay in Srinagar.

Preliminary investigations suggest the house is owned by a doctor, who is currently posted in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district. The NIA called off the raid after it found the house locked from the outside and there was no one inside, officials said. The house has been sealed, they said.

One person has been arrested for questioning related to the case, said officials. They did not reveal his identity.

There was a sudden spurt in operations against militants in south Kashmir following the arrest of the police officer and the militants, in which at least seven militants were killed.

Most individuals and organisations that filed petitions against the CAA refrained from commenting on the Supreme Court’s observation.

62,2020/01/22,"Cabinet clears ₹4,000 crore for 6 NIT campuses","The Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved ₹4,371.90 crore for setting up permanent campuses for six National Institutes of Technology (NITs) that have been functioning from temporary structures after being set up in 2009, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said.

At a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Cabinet approved funds for the NITs in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Puducherry and Delhi, he said.

The then-government in 2009 established these NITs without adequate funds for land and buildings, he said. Each of the NITs had been given ₹250 crore each. The government had now taken a decision to correct this.

“These NITs were established in the year 2009 and started functioning from academic year 2010-2011 in their respective temporary campus with very limited space and infrastructure. The projects at the permanent campus could not be completed in the manner envisaged due to late finalisation of land required for construction and also the cost approved for construction works was far below the actual requirements,” a government statement said.

The revised cost estimates approved by the Cabinet would help NITs with capacity for 6,320 students getting their own permanent campuses by March 31, 2022, the statement said.

The Cabinet also approved the closure of Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited, which Mr. Javadekar said had 88 employees and was functioning “on paper.” It also approved a proposal to designate Daman as the headquarter of the newly-merged Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.

63,2020/01/22,Pathalgarhi supporters kill 7 in Jharkhand,"Supporters of the “Pathalgarhi” movement, armed with lathis and axes, kidnapped seven villagers and later killed them in West Singhbhum district of Jharkhand for allegedly opposing their stir, police said on Wednesday.

Inspector General of Police (Operations) Saket Kumar Singh said the policemen reached Burugulikera village on Tuesday night after getting information about the killing of seven natives. After murdering, the killers dumped bodies of the victims in a forest.

A panchayat representative was among those massacred, he said.

After an overnight search operation, bodies of the seven villagers were recovered from the forest, four km from the village, he said.

The place is over 175 km from the capital Ranchi.

There was a meeting over ‘Pathalgarhi’ movement in the village on Tuesday when a dispute had arisen, West Singhbhum Superintendent of Police Indrajit Mahata said.

Following the development, supporters of the movement kidnapped seven villagers and later killed them with the help of lathis and axes, he said.

Pathalgarhi is a name given to a tribal protest which seeks autonomy for village sabhas (gramsabhas). Those demanding Pathalgarhi want no laws of the land be applicable on the tribal people in the area. The Pathalgarhis reject government rights over their forests and rivers.

Expressing grief over the incident, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren said “law is above all and the guilty will not be spared.

Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said the Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approved a proposal to extend the commission’s term till July 31.

The Cabinet also approved an addition to the commission’s terms of reference.

The commission will now also “study the various entries in the Central list of OBCs and recommend correction of any repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription”, a statement said.

The commission had been appointed to look into the existing list of OBCs and categorise the OBCs that have not benefited from the reservations in government jobs and education.

It is also expected to give its recommendations to ensure that these marginalised communities get the benefits of various schemes.

The commission, headed by retired Delhi High Court Chief Justice G. Rohini, was constituted on October 2, 2017. “The commission has come to the view that it would require some more time to submit its report since the repetitions, ambiguities, inconsistencies and errors of spelling or transcription etc., appearing in the existing Central list of OBCs need to be cleared. Hence the commission has sought extension of its term by six months, that is up to July 31, 2020 and also addition in its existing terms of reference,” a government statement said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/o5zplf/article30627069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23TH-ROHINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/another-extension-for-obc-sub-categorisation-panel/article30627070.ece

BSP president Mayawati, through a tweet, said her party was ready to accept the challenge “on any stage and at any place.” She said the BJP government was “troubled” by the “struggle” and protests organised by the youth and women across the country against the CAA, the proposed nationwide NRC and the NPR.

Mr. Yadav slammed the BJP for the CAA and said the government did not want to debate on the economy, jobs or demonetisation. “As for the question of debate, I say to the BJP people, pick a place and stage, and the BJP can also call its favourite channels [TV news channels]...we are ready to debate on development,” he told journalists here.

The former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister accused the BJP of tampering with the Constitution because it had a majority. “But you can’t suppress people’s voice with majority,” he said.

At a rally here on Tuesday, Mr. Shah accused Opposition parties of spreading misconceptions about the new law, and instigating riots and arson. He dared Mr. Yadav to come on stage and speak on the CAA “for five minutes.” He asked other Opposition leaders like Mayawati, Rahul Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee to pick any platform for an open debate on the CAA.

And the one the Home Minister should be challenging was talking about the problems of other States, Ms. Vadra said in Hindi.

A resolution passed at a special meeting of the party core committee chaired by president Sukhbir Singh Badal said: “We support the Act as far as it grants protection and safeguards to the Sikhs and several other communities including the Hindus. But in its present form, it falls short of being inclusive and secular and to that extent goes against the core ideals bequeathed to us by the great Guru Sahiban, saints and seers down the ages as it discriminates against a significant minority in the country, the Muslims.

“We want the Act to be amended to remove that discrimination. Discrimination on religious grounds runs against the core beliefs of the great Hindu religion too which regards the whole world as one family.

“The SAD has always been in the forefront as the custodian of the great inclusive vision of Babasaheb B.R. Ambedkar as enshrined in the Constitution. Secular democratic values are the cornerstone of the Constitution and the SAD has always made supreme sacrifices to protect those values in letter and spirit.

68,2020/01/22,Army personnel seek clarity on toll exemption,"There is confusion among the military fraternity over a recent circular by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is in contravention to the existing exemption from toll fee for serving military personnel. Several veterans have expressed outrage over this move on the social media after several personnel reported instances of being charged toll since.

The NHAI issued a clarification dated December 16, 2019 on the guidelines on payment of user fee at toll plazas in the backdrop of the issue of FASTags. It clarified on the vehicles used for official purpose by the Ministry of Defence, including those that are eligible for exemption in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Toll (Army and Air Force) Act, 1901.

Referring to an earlier memorandum dated June 17, 2014, it stated that “exemption under Indian Toll (Army and Air Force) Act, 1901 from payment of user fee is available to the persons who are ‘on duty’ and does not pertain to retired personnel.” “No exemption is available on use of personal vehicle if it is not used for discharging any official purpose and duty even if it accompanies the said official,” the circular said, adding that the exemption was available only on production of pass as specified in the Indian Toll Rules, 1942.

The circular also has a list of exempted vehicles that includes the Chief of Staff holding the rank of full General or equivalent and the Vice Chief of the Army Staff and equivalent, gallantry medal awardees and Central and State armed forces in uniform including para-military and police.

Some instances have since been reported where Army personnel were asked to pay toll fee.

Col Mukul Dev, a serving officer from the Army’s Judge Advocate General branch, said on Twitter, “Please read Sec 2(l) of Army Act which clearly stipulates that an Army Personnel is deemed to be on duty, till such time he has not retired. Accordingly, traveling on Casual Leave (CL)/AL or furlough is also considered to be “On duty”. There are many judgements of Hon'ble Supreme Court on this.”

Col. Dev also stated that at para 1 of the letter dated January 03 2020 by the NHAI, a mention of the NHAI letter dated June 17, 2014 had been made. This June 2014 letter had been superseded by their own (NHAIs) letter of December 14, 2019.

In all the circulars that the NHAI issued in 2019, they were making a reference to their June 2014 circular. However, they were yet to cancel their circular of December 06, 2017 and hence this circular is in force, he added.

“There have been contradictory orders from the NHAI on this and this has to be clarified at the highest levels,” a serving officer observed.

Responding to a question from The Hindu on the issue, a senior NHAI official said the advisory was issued in consultation with the Law Ministry. “We are going by their advice,” he added.

Another official said the exemption is applicable only for official vehicles or those on official duty.

71,2020/01/22,"In Bengal, significant hike in the number of holidays for Hindu festivals","It’s going to rain holidays in West Bengal this year. With Assembly elections in the State scheduled for 2021, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, often accused by her adversaries of being partial to Muslims, has doubled the number of holidays given for several Hindu festivals.

As per the State Government’s 2020 calendar, notified last November and being widely circulated now as the year unfolds, the total number of public holidays in a year now stands at 43. If weekends too are excluded, then State government offices and schools and colleges will function only for 230 days this year.

The new list of holidays, greeted by the beneficiaries with delight as well as amusement, is likely to have a far-reaching impact on the work culture of West Bengal, where government departments, as it is, do not enjoy much of a reputation when it comes to promptness.

Half of October

The State will be practically shut for half of October this year, with as many as many as 11 consecutive days — compared to five so far — being declared as holidays for Durga Puja.

Saraswati Puja, another popular Bengali festival, will now see people being given a two-day holiday instead of one day. Likewise, the festivals of Chhat, celebrated by the Bihari population in the State, and Bhatridwitya, the Bengali equivalent of Raksha Bandhan, will now be marked with a holiday of not one but two days. Holi, too, will be celebrated with a two-day closure. An extra holiday will also be given for Id-ul-Fitr.

The festivals of Shivaratri and Janmashtami, more popular across north India, have also been notified as public holidays. In the hills of West Bengal, the birthday of poet Bhanu Bhakt has also been declared as holiday.

As per the State Government order, no substitute holiday(s) shall be allowed for any notified holiday(s) in case they coincide with a non-working day, but that should hardly be a reason for complain considering that the number of public holidays now add up to almost a month and a half.

BJP’s rise

The Bharatiya Janata Party, now openly pro-Hindu, has seen a spectacular rise in West Bengal in recent times, with the party winning 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the State in the 2019 Parliamentary elections — something unimaginable until a few years ago. Ms. Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress was ahead of it by only four seats.

She is now desperate to hold on to her Hindu supporters, who appear to be moving away from her, and has of late been announcing measures to demonstrate that she isn’t partial to Muslims. During last year’s Durga Puja, she had announced an aid of ₹10,000 to every Durga Puja organised in the State. Now comes the holiday bonanza as the countdown begins for the 2021 Assembly elections, which will see a direct contest between the Trinamool Congress and the BJP.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/6dq95m/article30625911.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01MPDHAKI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/in-bengal-significant-hike-in-the-number-of-holidays-for-hindu-festivals/article30625869.ece

But that does not mean school, college teachers and other government officers and employees can take to the streets during duty hours. They should not even meet Ministers,” said Mr. Sarma, who handles Education too.

“The pay cut will apply to all — from the clerk to the doctor if duty hours are used for other activities,” he said.

Mr. Sarma also announced a scheme under which some 20,000 students living in hostels would be given ₹7,000 annually to “easing the fiscal burden” on their parents.

“We estimated that a hostel boarder spends about ₹1,400 per month for 10 months excluding two months of holidays. We want to bear 50% of this expenditure and hope to raise it to foot the entire bill.”

He said the money would be deposited in the bank account of each student and the college principals were called for the meeting primarily to work out disbursement with the Finance Department. “We intend to deposit the amount before February 10.”

The Sarbananda Sonowal-led government has been on a sop spree after the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that left six people dead in Assam since December 12-14 last year.

A Blue Corner Notice is issued by the international police cooperation body to collect additional information from its member countries about a person’s identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.

Earlier, the Gujarat Police had sent a request to the Central Bureau of Investigation, the nodal body for Interpol matters in India, seeking a Blue Corner Notice against Nithyananda, who is facing a rape case in Karnataka and a case pertaining to the illegal confinement of children and minors in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

“Interpol issued the Blue Corner Notice against the controversial godman this month,” Deputy Superintendent of Police-Ahmedabad (Rural) K. T. Kamariya told mediapersons in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.

Working ahead

Police officials involved in the investigation against the self-styled godman said that they are now working to get the Interpol to issue a Red Corner Notice, a global arrest warrant, against Nithyananda, who fled the country after a rape case was lodged against him in Karnataka.

In November 2019, the Gujarat Police had registered a First Information Report (FIR) against Nithyananda after two girls went missing from his ashram in Ahmedabad.

He was charged with kidnapping and wrongful confinement of children in order to make them collect donations from his followers to run his ashram, which was set up in the premises of a Delhi Public School in the city.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/n6yu4l/article30039564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Nithyananda,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/interpol-issues-blue-corner-notice-against-nithyananda/article30624632.ece
79,2020/01/22,India drop 10 ranks to 51st position in Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index,"The latest edition of the Democracy Index spells gloom for India. The world’s biggest democracy slipped 10 places in the 2019 global ranking to 51st place.

The survey published on January 22 attributes the primary cause of “the democratic regression” to “an erosion of civil liberties in the country”.

India’s overall score fell from 7.23 to 6.9, on a scale of 0-10, within a year (2018-2019) — the country’s lowest since 2006. The average global score also recorded its worst value ever, down from 5.48 in 2018 to 5.44, driven by a sharp regression in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, a lesser one in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and by stagnation in the remaining regions that were covered. The report published on Wednesday by The Economist Intelligence Unit — the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, which is the sister company to The Economist newspaper — records how global democracy fared, analysing 165 independent states and two territories.

The report, A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest, was done by The Economist Intelligence Unit — the research and analysis division of The Economist Group, which is the sister company to The Economist newspaper.

India was graded in electoral process and pluralism (8.67), government functioning (6.79), political participation (6.67), political culture (5.63) and civil liberties (6.76).

The average global score also recorded its worst value ever, down from 5.48 in 2018 to 5.44, driven by a sharp regression in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, a lesser one in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and by stagnation in the remaining regions that were covered.

The report records how global democracy fared, analysing 165 independent states and two territories.

In the Asia and Australasia region, India ranks eighth, behind Taiwan and Timor-Leste.

The report talks about the repeal of both Article 370 and Article 35A and how ahead of the move, “the government deployed a large number of troops in J&K, imposed various other security measures and placed local leaders under house arrest, including those with pro-India credentials.”

“The government also restricted Internet access in the State,” it notes. It says the NRC exercise in Assam excluded 1.9 million people from the final list, and that “the vast majority of people excluded from the NRC are Muslims.”

While the ruling BJP says that most of the people excluded from the list are immigrants from Bangladesh, the government of that country “denies this”, the report adds. It also cites the critics’ claim that the exercise “targets the Muslim population and will lead to demographic changes along religious lines”.

On the CAA, the report says, “The new citizenship law has enraged the large Muslim population, stoked communal tensions and generated large protests in major cities.”

The Index also categorises India under “flawed democracies”, countries that hold free and fair elections and where basic civil liberties are respected, but have significant weaknesses in aspects of democracy, such as problems in governance, an underdeveloped political culture and low levels of political participation. According to the report, there are only 22 “full democracies” as compared to 54 “authoritarian regimes” and as many “flawed democracies,” that include the U.S.

“Almost one-half (48.4%) of the world’s population live in a democracy of some sort, although only 5.7% reside in a “full democracy”, down from 8.9% in 2015 as a result of the US being demoted from a “full democracy” to a “flawed democracy” in 2016,” it says.

The total score of some 68 countries declined from 2018, but almost as many (65) recorded an improvement. Thailand registered the biggest improvement in score owing to an election in March 2019, which was the first since the military coup d’état in May 2014, while China registered the greatest decline as discrimination against minorities, especially in Xinjiang, intensified, and digital surveillance of the population continued apace.

The report describes the year in Asia as one filled with “drama and tumult,” with Hong Kong being the epicentre of protest in the continent. Globally, “the sheer number of protests spanning different time zones” caught the attention of commentators everywhere, says the report, topped by Norway (9.87) and followed by Iceland, Sweden and New Zealand.

80,2020/01/22,Congress should be called ‘Muslim League Congress’: BJP,"The BJP on January 22 accused several Opposition leaders of “abusing” Hindus through “appeasement politics” and referred to the Congress as “Muslim League Congress”.

Seeking apology from Congress president Sonia Gandhi and NCP chief Sharad Pawar, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said leaders of these parties have used the ongoing protests against the amended citizenship law to “abuse” Hindus.

Ashok Chavan said in a public meeting that the Congress joined hands with the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra because Muslims wanted Congress to stop the BJP, Mr. Patra stated. “This shows the Opposition party has nothing to do with people belonging to other religions, including Hindus,” he said.

Mr. Patra also referred to a statement from an NCP leader to attack the Opposition.

Asked about Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge’s reported jibe at the RSS for its “non-participation” in the freedom movement, the BJP leader shot back, asking if parents of Sonia Gandhi, who are of Italian origin, had fought in India’s independence struggle.

81,2020/01/22,22 youths to be conferred National Bravery Awards,"Two youths from Jammu & Kashmir, and a Karnataka boy who guided an ambulance during floods in the State, are among those chosen for the ICCW National Bravery Awards this year, officials said on Tuesday.

The names of the awardees — 10 girls and 12 boys — were announced by the Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) on Tuesday at a press conference here.

Sixteen-year-old Muhammed Muhsin from Kozhikode in Kerala, who drowned while saving three of his friends in the rough sea in April last year, has been chosen for the ICCW Abhimanyu Award posthumously, the officials said.

Kupwara native Sartaj Mohidin Mugal, 16, and Mudasir Ashraf, 19, from Budgam are among the awardees for performing acts of valour in Kashmir in 2019.

“I was on the first floor of my home in Tumina village of Kupwara in October last year, when a shell fired by adversaries hit my house on the first floor and as a result my room was filled with smoke. I immediately jumped from the first floor, and then rushed to the ground floor where my parents and two sisters were,” Mugal said.

“I picked my sister Sadia, 8, in my hands and Sania, 13, held my hands, while my parents ran out of the room, before the damaged house collapsed,” he said.

Mugal has been selected for the ICCW Shravan Award.

Ashraf, from Budgam, had rushed to help people after an Mi-17 helicopter had crashed in a village there.

“The helicopter debris had hit a villager, who caught fire. I tried to douse flames by putting soil on him, but in vain. Help arrived later, but the man could not be saved. I tried very hard,” he said.

Venkatesh, 11, from Karnataka, who guided an ambulance carrying a body and relatives of the deceased during the floods last August, will also receive the award, officials said.

ICCW, an NGO, has been organising these awards since 1957, and has awarded 1,004 children — 703 boys and 301 girls — till last year.

However, in January 2019, sources had said that the Centre had undertaken its own selection process for national children’s awards and dissociated itself from the Bravery Awards given by the Council.

The Women and Child Development (WCD) Ministry had then said it had reinvented the national children’s awards and included bravery as one of the categories under the awards, called the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar, 2019.

Assam boy Kamal Krishna Das, 12, from Assam’s Guwahati who saved his mother, aunt and himself after being thrown overboard a boat in Brahmaputra in September 2018, is also among the awardees.

Das, whose mother, Situmoni Das, a housewife, was present at the press conference, said he aspired to become a doctor.

“I recognised my mother by her bangles when she was drowning in the river waters. I swam back from the shores and then rescued my aunt too. There were nearly 30 people on the boat before they were all thrown overboard,” he said.

Another boy who displayed exemplary courage is Everbloom K. Nongrum, 10, from Meghalaya, who saved two of his friends in separate drowning incidents last year.

A resident of Mawryngkneng village in East Khasi district, Everbloom when asked if he felt afraid jumping into the waters, said, “No, not at all. I will not shy away from saving more lives in future, if it is in my capacity“.

The youngest recipient would be Lourembam Yaikhomba Mangang, 8, from Manipur, who saved the life of a boy who was drowning in Imphal River in March 2019.

82,2020/01/22,"Unlike theocratic States like Pakistan and America, India is secular, says Rajnath Singh","Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said Indian values consider all religions equal, and that is why “the country is secular and never became a theocratic state like Pakistan.”

Speaking at the NCC Republic Day Camp in Delhi, Mr. Singh said: “We (India) said we would not discriminate among religions. Why did we do that? Our neighbouring country has declared that their State has a religion. They have declared themselves a theocratic State. We didn’t declare so.”

“Even America is a theocratic country. India is not a theocratic country. Why? Because our saints and seers did not just consider the people living within our borders as part of the family, but called everyone living in the world as one family,” the Minister said.

Mr. Singh underlined that India had never declared its religion would be Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist and people of all religions could live here.

“They gave the slogan of ‘Vasudev Kutumbakam’ — the whole world is one family. This message has gone to the whole world from here only,” he added.

He also said children of Jammu and Kashmir are ""nationalists"" and shouldn’t be seen in any other way. ""Sometimes they are motivated in the wrong direction,"" he added, when asked about his kids in the State who are being motivated to join the National Cadet Corps.

“Youngsters are youngsters. Sometimes, the way they should be motivated, people do not motivate them. In fact, they are motivated in the wrong direction. That is why the kids should not be blamed for this. The ones who are motivating them in wrong direction are the culprits,” the Defence Minister added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u9t0tp/article30568254.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH15RAJNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unlike-theocratic-states-like-pakistan-and-america-india-is-secular-says-rajnath-singh/article30622613.ece
83,2020/01/22,Prashant Kishor poses a question to Amit Shah,"A day after Union Home Minister Amit Shah asserted in Lucknow that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) would stay despite protests, Prashant Kishor, leader of BJP’s partner JD(U), on Wednesday asked Mr. Shah, “Why don’t you go ahead and implement the CAA and NRC [National Register of Citizens] in chronology”?

The national vice-president of the JD(U) tweeted, “Being dismissive of citizens’ dissent couldn’t be the sign of strength of any Govt. @amitshah Ji, if you don’t care for those protesting against #CAA_NRC, why don’t you go ahead and try implementing the CAA & NRC in the chronology that you so audaciously announced to the nation!”.

Of late, Mr. Kishor, who is also a poll strategist, has been urging his party leader and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and other non-BJP State governments to oppose the CAA and the NRC.

At a public rally in Lucknow, Mr. Shah asserted that the CAA would not be withdrawn despite the ongoing protests. “Today I’ve come to Lucknow to say that whoever wants to protest can protest but the CAA won’t be taken back”, he said. “If any clause of the CAA takes away the citizenship of anyone, including Muslims, they can tell me. The agitations and sit-ins against it are wrong.”

Varma seeks “ideological clarity”

On Tuesday, another JD(U) leader Pawan Varma, in a letter to Mr. Kumar, asked for “ideological clarity” on JD(U)’s electoral alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar.

Both Mr. Kishor and Mr. Varma have recently been taking on Mr. Kumar on the the CAA, NRC, NPR and other issues.

State JD(U) leaders refused to make any comment on Mr. Kishor and Mr. Varma’s regular attacks on the party chief, but State president of the party Basistha Narayan Singh told journalists that he would speak to Mr. Kumar on this issue and request him to take action.

State BJP leaders told The Hindu that both the leaders were “headaches” of the JD(U) and not of the BJP.

Senior State Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra said, “both the leaders are now showing a mirror to Nitish Kumar who, otherwise, is known for making turnarounds for his political survival.

84,2020/01/22,Supreme Court refuses to stay Citizenship Amendment Act without hearing government,"The Supreme Court on Wednesday said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, is “uppermost in everybody's minds”, but refused to stay the law without hearing the government first.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde did not pay heed to fervent pleas to even postpone the process of collecting population data to identify illegal migrants or “doubtful citizens” on the basis of their religion.

The CJI indicated that the CAA challenge may eventually be referred to a Constitution Bench for a decision on merits.

The Bench issued notice on at least 80 more fresh petitions filed for and against the CAA. It gave the government four weeks to file its response. The government urged the court to “freeze” the number of petitions filed in the case.

144 petitions

A total of 144 petitions were listed before the Bench that also comprised Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna.

The court said it would list the case in February to pass interim orders. It asked the senior lawyers involved in the case to categorise the petitions and work out a schedule for hearing them.

“I don't think anything [any law like the CAA] is irreversible. There will have to be a date for hearing this interim prayer [for a stay of the CAA)... This case is uppermost in everybody's minds,” the CJI reacted to the concerns.

Lawyers argued that the National Population Register (NPR) exercise is commencing in April. Data collected through it would be used for preparing a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). The NPR-NRC is considered a harbinger of facilitator for the operation of the CAA, which fast-tracks the citizenship-by-naturalisation process for “illegal migrants” from six religious communities, other than Muslims, who have fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Senior advocate K.V. Vishwanathan addressed the court, “The most immediate concern now is the sweeping powers given to executive authorities to brand people as ‘doubtful citizens’. Once this is done, there are no guidelines to help these people. This is sinister. It will lead to gerrymandering of electoral rolls. The concern is spread across both the majority Hindus and the minorities as well. You have to address this fear... Otherwise fear and insecurity will pervade the country.”

U.P. govt ‘move’

Senior advocate A.M. Singhvi submitted that the Uttar Pradesh government had “marked” people as doubtful citizens two weeks ago. “The process of granting citizenship under CAA is already underway,” he said.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal urged the court to postpone the NPR and the citizenship process for at least two months to avoid chaos.

Attorney General K.K. Venugopal reacted that “a postponement of the CAA and its stay were one and the same”.

Senior advocate Shyam Divan contended that the final certificate of citizenship by naturalisation to illegal migrants should be stayed during the pendency of the case in the Court. Indian citizenship once granted cannot be revoked if the challenge to the CAA succeeded in court, he said.

But Mr. Venugopal countered that there were provisions in the law that allowed the revocation of citizenship.

Importance to N-E pleas

The CJI indicated that the court would give due importance to petitions concerning the impact of CAA in border States such as Assam and Tripura. These cases may be segregated and heard. He, however, said all the petitions on the CAA would be subject to a common final decision.

Senior advocate Vikas Singh said the CAA would change the entire demography of Assam. The CAA violated the Assam Accord of 1985, which stipulated that any foreigner who entered the State after the cut-off date of March 24, 1971, irrespective of their religious affiliation, would be deported. The cut-off date in the CAA is December 31, 2014.

The government has maintained that the amendments made to the Citizenship Act of 1955 were meant to protect and welcome religiously persecuted people fleeing the three neighbouring countries where Muslims form the majority.

The petitions argued that a law that welcomed “illegal migrants” into India selectively on the basis of their religion was against the principles of secularism, right to equality and dignity of life enshrined in the Basic Structure of the Constitution.

The petitions said the Act selectively agreed to grant citizenship benefits to illegal migrants from only three countries. Besides it did not impose any requirement on illegal migrants to prove their claim of religious persecution or even a reasonable fear of it. The legislation effectuated discrimination on the basis of the intrinsic and core identity of an individual, that was, his religious identity as a Muslim. While Muslim migrants would have to show their proof of residency in India for at least 11 years, the law allowed illegal migrants from the six communities to be naturalised in five years' time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4298nv/article30537200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-petitions-sc-says-no-stay-without-hearing-centre-may-refer-pleas-to-larger-constitution-bench/article30622277.ece
85,2020/01/22,Defence Ministry shortlists L&T and MDL to build six conventional submarines,"In a significant move, the defence ministry on January 21 shortlisted two Indian shipyards and five foreign defence majors for the ₹50,000 crore project to build six conventional submarines in India for the Navy besides approving military procurement worth ₹5,100 crore.

The shortlisted Indian entities to construct the submarines, being billed as one of biggest ‘Make in India’ projects, are L&T group and state-owned Mazagaon Docks Ltd (MDL), official sources said.

Adani Defence, which was a strong contender for the project, named as P-75 I, failed to make the cut following a detailed evaluation of eligibility criteria by a high-powered committee, they said.

The Congress last week had alleged that the government was “favouring” the Adani group for the submarine project. The Adani group had joined hands with Hindustan Shipyard (HSL) in a bid to bag the project.

The mega project is being implemented under the ambitious strategic partnership model under which select private firms are being roped in to build military platforms like submarines and fighter jets in India in partnership with original equipment maker.

The decisions on the submarine project and procurement of military equipment were taken at a meeting of the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and attended by Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat.

The five global defence majors selected by the committee for the P-75I project are - ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (Germany), Navantia (Spain) and Naval Group (France), Rubin Design Bureau (Russia), and Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering (South Korea).

Initially Reliance Naval & Engineering was among the Indian contenders.

Within the next six weeks, the defence ministry will issue RFP (request for proposal) to MDL and L&T and the two firms will have to submit their detailed bid within 3-4 months after receiving the document.

Both L&T and MDL will have to select a foreign partner out of the five shortlisted entities.

“The DAC approved shortlisting of Indian strategic partners (SP) and the potential original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that would collaborate with SPs to construct six conventional submarines in India,” the defence ministry said in a statement.

It said strategic partner is expected to play a “transformational role” in building an eco-system in the country, comprising development entities, specialised vendors and suppliers.

The Indian Navy plans to acquire 24 new submarines, including six nuclear attack submarines to bolster its underwater fighting capability.

The defence ministry also said the DAC accorded approval for procurement of equipment worth over ₹5,100 crore from indigenous sources.

These include sophisticated electronic warfare systems for the Army designed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and manufactured locally by the Indian industry.

Officials said the systems will be used in deserts and plains and will provide comprehensive electronic support and counter measure capabilities to the field formations.

“The DAC also approved prototype testing of trawl assemblies designed by DRDO for T-72 and T-90 tanks providing an important indigenous de-mining capability to the Army,” said the ministry.

It said the DAC also accorded approval for inclusion of innovations for defence excellence (iDEX) in defence procurement procedure which would provide for avenues to startups and innovators wanting to be associated in military supplies.

It was the first meeting of the DAC after appointment of the Chief of the Defence Staff.

“Today’s decisions are also in keeping with the mandate given to the CDS and the newly-constituted Department of Military Affairs to promote use of indigenous hardware by the services,” the defence ministry said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/defence-ministry-shortlists-lt-and-mdl-to-build-six-conventional-submarines/article30621557.ece

She was a member of military ‘platoon number 31’ of the Darva division under the Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) of the outlawed CPI (Maoist) organisation.

She surrendered before Malkangiri SP, Rishikesh Dnyandeo Khilari, at the district police headquarters saying she wished to lead a normal life.

Multiple cases

Ms. Madkami hails from a family of peasants from the Mathili police station limits in Malkangiri district. She joined the Maoist organisation in 2015. According to police records, she was involved in three murders, one incident of arson and two exchange of fire with security forces. The Odisha government had declared a reward of ₹2 lakh for her capture.

She alleged that women cadres were facing physical and mental torture in the Maoist organisation. After observing the developmental activities undertaken by the Odisha government in her underdeveloped region and the lack of any effort by the Maoist leaders to help the downtrodden, she said she had realised the futility of the path of violence.

Increased area dominance activities by security forces in the interior pockets of Malkangiri district such as establishment of camps at Temurupalli and Mahupadar near the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border was another reason cited for her surrender.

According to the SP, the surrendered naxalite will be provided all assistance as per the surrender and rehabilitation policy of the Odisha government.

87,2020/01/22,CBI books Frost International Limited in bank fraud case,"The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked Frost International Limited (FIL) and 14 others for allegedly cheating a Bank of India-led consortium of ₹3,592.48 crore and the unpaid interest. Look-out circulars have been issued against the several accused persons.

Among those named are company directors Uday Jayant Desai and his son Sujay, daughter Sanjana and wife Nilima; Sunil Lal Chand Verma, his wife Rita and sons Nipun and Saral; and Anoop Kumar Baldevraj Wadhera and his wife Poonam.

Three other companies — R.S. Builders, Globiz Exim and NSD Nirman — have also been arraigned.

Incorporated in 1995 and promoted by Mr. Desai and Mr. Verma, FIL trades in agro-commodities, minerals, metals, bullion, polymer, chemical and petroproducts, plastics and textiles. It had suppliers and buyers in Bangladesh, China, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, West Indies, China, Cambodia, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland and Taiwan.

According to the FIR, the company had taken ₹380.65 crore in credit from the Bank of India before the consortium of 14 banks was formed in 2011. In all, it availed itself of ₹4,061.95 crore in credit. The Bank of India has the highest exposure of ₹756.75 crore. FIL had also raised ₹498.51 crore through loan from the Indian Overseas Bank.

A stress in the loan accounts was noticed from January 2018, when the letters of credit started devolving with the member banks, as export proceeds were not realised. The accounts soon turned non-performing assets, and were declared a fraud last year.

A forensic audit report in January 2019 raised suspicion about funds diversion under the pretext of unsecured loans to group concerns, including Mohan Steels, Commet Overseas, Viva Merchants and Fisco Metals India. It found instances of no actual export of goods. There was a mismatch in the ship movement data. with those from the loading and discharge ports.

A mismatch was also observed in 18 merchant trade transactions; a majority of payments towards sales were received from third parties; purchases worth ₹4,374.17 crore and sales worth ₹4,411.48 crore were executed among parties having common key managerial personnel.

Also, purchase and sale transactions amounting to ₹9,822.63 crore and ₹9,889.09 crore were among the parties known to each other.

The report noted that as per the credit report of one Fareast Distribution & Logistics Pte Limited (FDLPL), the Hong Kong-based firm Fausta Limited, involved in providing financial services, held 100% stake in FDLPL.

The address of Fausta Limited was the same as that of Gulf Distribution Limited, indicating that both were linked. FIL was involved in purchases worth ₹31,398.58 crore from FDLPL and sales of ₹23,426.66 crore to Gulf Distribution Limited from 2012-13 to 2017-18.

It is alleged that when the lead bank wrote to 10 parties owing money to FIL, it did not receive any response. The banks allege that the company and its promoters showed trade without having genuine business transactions and defaulted on repayments. The funds were allegedly diverted.

At the Bank of India’s request, the look-out circulars were issued against Mr. Desai and 10 others in January 2019. In October 2018 too, the circulars were issued against him and 13 others, at the instance of the Indian Overseas Bank.

They have also been requested to provide daily details.

The Ministry had on Monday written to the Ministry of Civil Aviation to facilitate thermal screening at the international airports of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) will convene an emergency meeting of the committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) under the International Health Regulations on January 22.

The total number of confirmed cases of coronavirus reported to date (January 21) is 222 (China: 218, Thailand: 2, Japan: 1, Republic of Korea: 1), including four deaths (all in Wuhan). The number of people reported with 2019-nCOV in Wuhan, China, includes 15 health care workers.

Announcing this in a tweet, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said: “The Emergency Committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) will ascertain whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, and what recommendations should be made to manage it.”

“In India, as of today, there are no cases detected on community surveillance or contact tracing but a travel advisory has been issued and put up on the Ministry’s website and also the Twitter handle for wider circulation,” noted a senior health official.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ministry-seeks-details-of-travellers-from-wuhan/article30620040.ece
89,2020/01/22,Number of cities in Centre’s clean air programme inadequate: Greenpeace,"A Greenpeace India report says 80% of Indian cities have pollution levels exceeding particulate matter standards. Jharia in Jharkhand tops the list faring as the most polluted city in terms of PM10 (particulate matter 10 micron). The report also highlights that almost all States including Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Bihar have a bigger number of non-attainment cities compared to the 102 included under National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).

The NCAP is a programme of the Union Environment Ministry to reduce pollution by at least 20% in 102 cities that have failed to meet clean-air standards. Cities and States have submitted plans and roadmaps — and they will then be funded by the Centre — to achieve them.

Delhi showed improvement compared to last two years but still clocked pollution levels 3.5 times more than the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), which is also more than 11 times the WHO prescribed limits for PM10, the report noted.

The ‘Airpocalypse – IV Report’ underlines that the CPCB has identified only 122 non-attainment cities and 102 of them are included under the NCAP till now. These 122 cities are spread across 28 States and nine Union Territories and is ‘incomplete’ leaving 116 more cities which exceed the 60 µg/m3 limit prescribed by NAAQS, according to 2018 annual data.

The report analysed pollution data of 238 cities with at least 52 days of monitoring data.

“It’s worrying to see that more than 80% cities had PM10 levels exceeding the 60 µg/m3 limits for PM10 prescribed under National Ambient Air Quality Standards. If we want to make NCAP truly a ‘national program’, then we have to include all polluted cities in it and implement it with the addition of specific pollution and emission reduction targets in a time bound manner,” Avinash Chanchal, Senior Campaigner, Greenpeace India, said in a statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/homes-and-gardens/article19692589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16BGPSIRAJ3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/number-of-cities-in-centres-clean-air-programme-inadequate-greenpeace/article30619966.ece
90,2020/01/22,It will take decades to complete the sanctioned railway projects: government,"Even with an annual capital expenditure of about ₹1.6 lakh crore for the Railways — which is the highest-ever — it will take decades to complete the sanctioned projects, the Ministry of Railways told a parliamentary panel on Monday, adding that public private partnership (PPP) is the only way out.

The Ministry told the Standing Committee on Railways headed by former Union Minister and BJP leader Radha Mohan Singh that the transporter needs ₹50 lakh crores to complete the sanctioned projects till 2030.

“Given that the capital expenditure outlays are around ₹1.5-1.6 lakh crore per annum, completing even all sanctioned projects would take decades,” it said in its presentation. The Ministry said the only way out is using private investment.

The Centre said it does not plan to privatise the Railways and Union Minister Piyush Goyal had clarified in the past that there was a proposal to outsource the commercial and on-board services of a few trains and to permit private players to induct modern rakes to run trains on select routes to improve services.

As per the Ministry, ongoing projects as on August 1, 2019 include 188 new lines, 55 gauge conversion and 255 doubling of existing lines. The length under the 188 new lines is 21,295 km, of which the Railways has so far only commissioned 2,622 km at ₹85,536 crore as on March 31, 2019.

Gauge conversion

Similarly, in gauge conversion 7,274 km work has been sanctioned out of which only 3,573 km has been commissioned so far costing ₹19,640 crore. In case of doubling of existing lines, 20,500 km work has been sanctioned while only 2,800 km was commissioned till March 31, 2019 at an expenditure of ₹48,342 crore. Apart from this, the government has set a target of 100% electrification of broad gauge lines by 2023.

According to sources, the committee members objected to the absence of Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav at the meeting. They summoned him for the next meeting and asked the Ministry to come up with clarifications. “The basic question is why is the Railways taking over new projects without first completing the unfinished ones. The officials were unable to answer this question,” one member said.

As on April 1, 2018, the Railway network is 68,442-km long. Of this, 63,491 km is broad gauge, 3,200 km meter gauge and 1,751 km narrow gauge.

For 2019-20, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had proposed a capital expenditure of over ₹1.60 lakh crore for the Ministry. This is the highest-ever allocation for the national transporter surpassing the previous year’s ₹1.48 lakh. The outlay comprised ₹65,837 crore from budgetary support, ₹267.64 crore from the Nirbhaya Fund, ₹10,500 crore from internal resources and ₹83,571 crore from extra budgetary resources.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hwp4o2/article30618482.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THLTRAILBUDGETNEWDELHISTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/it-will-take-decades-to-complete-the-sanctioned-railway-projects-government/article30618483.ece
91,2020/01/22,Supreme Court studying code of conduct for Ministers,"A five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Tuesday said the possibility of enforceability ought to be explored if a new code of conduct is framed for Ministers at the Centre and in the States.

The Bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, is examining whether “greater restrictions” should be imposed on Ministers’ right to free speech. “If we ask the government to frame a code of conduct, it is necessary and desirable to make it enforceable,” Justice Mishra told senior lawyer Kaleeswaram Raj, appearing for Joseph Shine, one of the petitioners.

The issue, which was referred to a Constitution Bench in April 2017, was based on a petition filed by the family members of the Bulandshahr rape case victim, who were enraged by then Uttar Pradesh Minister Azam Khan’s statement that the case was part of a conspiracy against the Akhilesh Yadav government.

Mr. Raj said the government and the legislature should be asked by the court to formulate a “voluntary code of conduct with respect to the personal and public lives of Ministers and to publish it after finalising the same based on due deliberations”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/wmgt1e/article30600392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11SUPREMECOURT-19jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-studying-code-of-conduct-for-ministers/article30619550.ece
92,2020/01/22,"India, Brazil to sign Strategic Action Plan","India and Brazil will upgrade their strategic partnership with an “action plan” and sign a Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) when Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visits as the Chief Guest of the Republic Day celebrations from 24-27.

According to officials involved in the planning of the visit, the two countries hope to take their partnership to “the next level” and build on the relationship between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Bolsonaro, who met twice in 2019.

“Our bilateral relations are based on a common global vision, shared democratic values, and a commitment to foster economic growth of both countries. Bilateral relations were elevated to a Strategic Partnership in 2006, heralding a new phase in India-Brazil relations,” said the Ministry of External Affairs statement announcing Mr. Bolsonaro’s visit from January 24-27 in Delhi.

First BIT since 2015

According to the officials, the Strategic Partnership Action Plan will serve as an “umbrella agreement”, for plans between the two countries to increase defence cooperation, technology sharing and a logistics agreement.

The Bilateral Investment treaty will be one of the first that the Modi government will sign since 2015, when it decided to scrap all existing treaties with 83 countries, and brought in a new “Model BIT”. Since then India has been able to sign BITs with Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, has concluded an agreement with Cambodia, and is negotiating treaties with about a dozen other countries.

Brazil and India will also exchange a Social Security Agreement (SSA), first signed in March 2017, to allow investments in each other’s pension funds, to help business processes and encourage the flow of investment. In 2018 Indian investments in Brazil were around U.S.$ 6 billion and Brazilian investments in India are estimated at U.S.$ 1 billion, the MEA said, adding that bilateral trade stands at about $8 billion.

Of particular interest will be any discussion held on climate change cooperation between the leaders, given Mr. Modi’s stated commitment on combating global warming, and the Brazilian President’s stand rejecting scientific studies on climate change. Last year, Mr. Bolsonaro decided not to host the COP-25 UN climate talks, and although Brazil joined the India-led International Solar Alliance (ISA), it was done under his predecessor President Michel Temer.

‘Far-right’ beliefs

While Mr. Bolsonaro is known internationally for other controversial “far-right” beliefs on gender and orientation, and rights for indigenous tribes, he could face protests in India over Brazil’s complaint at the World Trade Organisation against New Delhi’s subsidies to sugarcane farmers.

Brazil is the largest producer and exporter of sugar, and claims Indian subsidies are inconsistent with global trade rules.

According to the programme, Mr. Bolsonaro will be accompanied by 7-8 ministers, including the Mining Minister and Agriculture Minister who have already arrived in Delhi to negotiate agreements to be signed at the end of bilateral talks on January 25. Among about 20 agreements set to be exchanged, are the Strategic Partnership Action Plan, along with the BIT, a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAT) on crime, agreements on double taxation avoidance, bio-energy or ethanol production, cybersecurity, health, mining, oil and gas exploration and investment, and animal husbandry.

Mr. Bolsonaro will attend the Republic Day parade and the At Home hosted by President Ramnath Kovind on January 26. On January 27, he will also address the “India-Brazil Business Forum” and is expected to travel to Agra to see the Taj Mahal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tgzou/article30618040.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KRAJAIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-brazil-to-sign-strategic-action-plan/article30618041.ece
93,2020/01/22,RPF unearths e-ticket racket,"The Railway Protection Force (RPF) unearthed an illegal ticketing scam in the Railways, which it says is linked to a terror financing racket.

RPF Director-General Arun Kumar said on Tuesday that the scam came to light with the arrest of Ghulam Mustafa, 28, a software analyst from Jharkhand. He was arrested in Bhubaneswar, Odisha, around 10 days ago.

“We have seized two encrypted laptops from Mustafa, which indicate an organised crime racket. Hamid Ashraf, the person who developed the software to illegally book tickets by forging Aadhaar and PAN cards, is wanted by the CBI in a July, 2019 case of bomb blast near a school in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh,” Mr. Kumar said.

An Indian software company, which has branches across the country and abroad, has also come under the scanner for having links to the racket, Mr. Kumar said, without naming it. He, however, said the company was involved in a money laundering case in Singapore.

Mr. Kumar said a team of programmers were working for Mustafa, who is one of the members of the multi-layered racket.

He allegedly started out as a tout in Bengaluru and graduated to e-tickets and illegal software, an RPF officer said.

“For the last 10 days, the IB, the Special Bureau, the ED, the NIA, the Karnataka police have interrogated Mustafa. Dimensions of money laundering, terror financing and diversion of funds through crypto-currency are suspected,” Mr. Kumar said.

He said Mustafa allegedly had 563 personal IRCTC user IDs, and a list of 2,400 SBI branches and 600 regional rural banks where he was suspected to have accounts. “Mustafa’s phone has many Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Middle-Eastern, Indonesian and Nepali numbers as well as six virtual numbers. There was also an application to create fake Aadhaar cards.”

Mr. Kumar said an analysis of his laptops revealed that he was a follower of a Pakistan-based religious group. Mustafa’s digital footprints were found on government websites, he said.

Ashraf, the mastermind of the racket, is suspected to have generated ₹10 crore-₹15 crore a month through the illegal procedure, and is suspected to be in Dubai.

“The first aim of these organised rackets is to generate cash. Once that money is amassed, they turn towards terror financing. All the information gathered from them has indicated a link to terror financing and money laundering… Ashraf is suspected to have a technical team to maintain the cloud-hosted servers. He has 18-20 lead sellers or super admins in India, who handle the money and send to Ashraf through various hawala accounts and crypto-currency,” Mr. Kumar said.

Then there are around 200-300 panel sellers who buy the software panel from lead developers and forward it to agents. “One panel is a set of 20 IDs bought with ₹28,000 per month. They forward the IDs and software to agents. Roughly 20,000 agents are there in India who use the illegal software for booking. About ₹10 crore-₹15 crore in black money is generated a month in cash. The illegal software, ANMS, bypasses IRCTC’s log-in captcha, booking captcha and bank OTP to generate tickets. For a genuine user, the booking process usually takes 2.55 minutes, but for the software it takes 1.48 minutes...,” Mr. Kumar said.

The Director-General said the software also facilitated simultaneous log-in through several user IDs with pre-filled data, thus helping to corner most of the confirmed tickets. The agencies are also looking for a suspect code-named “Guru ji.” “Guru ji is higher up in the order and a technical expert. He uses VPN [virtual private network]. He received around ₹13 lakh from Mustafa recently through bank transfers involving 71 transactions,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rpf-unearths-e-ticket-racket/article30619993.ece
94,2020/01/22,Census 2021: Respondents can fill in data online,"In the second phase of the decennial Census exercise that will be conducted in February 2021, respondents will have the option to fill in details on their own, a senior government official said.

The ‘population enumeration’ phase of the Census — which is to be carried out from February 9 to 28, 2021 — will have the facility of online self-enumeration for the public.

An official explained that the respondent could register online and fill in the details and share the reference number with the enumerators when they arrive.

Around 30 lakh enumerators, who are mostly government officials and government school teachers, will each be assigned the responsibility of collecting details of about 650-800 people through both online and offline modes.

The self-enumeration option will, however, not be available in the first phase — the House Listing and Housing Census that is to be carried out from April 1 to September 30, 2020.

The National Population Register (NPR), which has been objected to by several non-BJP ruled States, will also be updated simultaneously in the first phase.

A day ago, the Kerala Cabinet took a decision that the State government would fully cooperate with Census 2021 but it was hard-pressed to cooperate with the work related to the NPR as people were deeply concerned that it was a precursor to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

States to be sensitised

Earlier, the Kerala and West Bengal governments had informed the Registrar General of India (RGI) to halt the NPR exercise, citing the maintenance of “public order”.

Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said on Tuesday that the NPR was a “constitutional obligation”, and the Centre would keep on sensitising the States as disclosing information under the NPR is voluntary.

On January 9, the RGI notified the 31 columns for which the enumerators will seek response for the House Listing and Housing Census. The information asked would be whether the respondent has access to LPG/PNG connection, if the person owns a radio, transistor or television, has access to the Internet, and whether they own a laptop, computer, telephone, mobile phone, among other things.

Around 30 lakh enumerators will each be assigned the task of collecting details of about 650-800 people.

In a series of tweets on Tuesday, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said the 2021 would be the first ever census to be conducted with a mixed mode approach - a mobile app (created in-house by RGI office) and will have facility for online self enumeration for the public during population enumeration phase.

“The Indian census is the largest administrative and statistical exercise in the world, with more than 30 lakh functionaries, and at the cost of about 8700 crore rupees...While confidentiality about your data is guaranteed by Census Act, 1948; the same law specifies penalty for BOTH public AND census officials for non-compliance or violation of any provision of the Act,” MHA tweeted.

95,2020/01/22,Questions on parents in NPR form may be dropped: Ram Vilas Paswan,"The patriarch of key BJP ally Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Union Minister, Ram Vilas Paswan, on January 21 said the government may consider the widespread demand to remove the questions on date and place of birth of a respondent’s parents from the National Population Register.

“Even I don’t know the date of birth of my parents, forget about producing documents proving the dates,” Mr. Paswan told The Hindu.

He said the government would consider acceding to the demand and had repeatedly clarified that the production of documents would not be mandatory.

No MHA notification

So far, there is no official notification from the Ministry of Home Affairs, which is helming the exercise, on changes to the NPR form. The government has not yet notified the NPR form.

Various State governments have insisted that these two questions should be removed from the NPR form because a vast majority of respondents will not be able to produce any proof of date of birth and place of birth of their parents.

The NPR exercise by far, Mr. Paswan said, is similar to the Census, which happens at the turn of every decade.

“As far as the amended citizenship Act is concerned because of which there are widespread protests, I want to once again say that no government can revoke citizenship of a genuine Indian citizen, whether he is a Dalit or from the minority community,” Mr. Paswan added.

Even the amended Citizenship Act, Mr. Paswan said, didn’t stop a person from any religion from applying for Indian citizenship following the laid down procedure in the usual course.

‘No nationwide NRC’

On the National Register of Citizens (NRC), Mr. Paswan said there was no question of extending the exercise in Assam to the entire nation.

“When the Prime Minister of the country has already clarified that there has been no discussion or decision around implementing NRC across the nation, what is the point of having a debate on it,” he added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/q5g4wn/article29417337.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAMVILASPASWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/questions-on-parents-in-npr-form-may-be-dropped-ram-vilas-paswan/article30619261.ece
96,2020/01/22,Six more temples to be brought under TTD?,"Efforts are on to bring six more temples in the district under the purview of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), according to sources.

The board of trustees, at a recent meeting, has reportedly resolved to take over the administrative control of the proposed temples after obtaining a comprehensive report from the heads of concerned TTD departments and necessary orders from the Commissioner of Endowments, as required u/s 145 of the AP Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions & Endowments Act 1987.

The TTD had earlier resolved not to take any additional temples into its fold by way of resolution 1084 dated February 24-26, 1997. However, sources said that it was forced to reconsider its decision and take the responsibility of maintaining several temples time and again.

Though the TTD was not averse to taking over of the temples in the State, several of the temples were financially weak and the income derived from the landed property endowed to the temples was meagre. Several of the temples were also mired in legal disputes or were under the clutches of encroachers, forcing the TTD to spend precious time and money in evicting them.

Further compounding the TTD’s difficulties, the existing staff of these temples who were earlier working on minimum consolidated wages, now sought salaries at par with other TTD employees soon after the takeover. Some of these staff had even gone to court on this issue, according to sources.

This apart, the TTD was also pressurised into carrying out rituals and functions of these temples in a grand manner, leading to a drain of funds.

At present, there are already about 25 temples under the TTD’s fold. This apart, there are several cases pending in various courts regarding the regularisation of services, wages and encroachments.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/six-more-temples-to-be-brought-under-ttd/article30627853.ece

Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and CRDA Repeal Bills to a select committee after a tense standoff between MLCs of the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) and the Opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Wednesday.

Chairman Shariff Mohammed Ahmed conceded to Leader of the Opposition Yanamala Ramakrishnudu’s demand that the Bills be sent to the select committee keeping in view their serious implications, after an acrimonious debate that led to the Council being adjourned for nearly three hours.

Trouble began when Ministers Buggana Rajendranath Reddy (Finance) and Botcha Satyanarayana (Municipal Administration) countered Mr. Ramakrishnudu’s claims that the TDP had fulfilled the precondition of moving the motion for sending the Bills to a select committee on Tuesday itself.

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy alleged that the plea for referring the Bills to a select committee could be conceded only if a motion was moved at the time of taking the Bills into consideration but the rule was not followed. Therefore, the TDP’s request should be rejected, the Finance Minister stated, insisting that the Chairman ascertain the facts of the matter.

However, Mr. Ahmed’s statement that TDP MLC P. Ashok Babu submitted the motion but it was not technically moved infuriated both the ruling and opposition members.

Taking strong objection to it, Leader of the House and Deputy Chief Minister Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose rushed to the podium along with Mr. Satyanarayana and started shouting at the Chairman.

Condemning the actions of the YSRCP members, TDP MLCs Nara Lokesh and T.D. Janardhan said that the Ministers and MLCs of the ruling party cannot exert pressure on the Chairman in such a manner.

Unruly scenes

Pandemonium reigned as members of the TDP and the YSRCP began pushing each other, only to stop short of a scuffle.

Amidst heated discussions, Mr. Ramakrishnudu alleged that the 22 Ministers who came to the Legislative Council should be expelled as they were not members of the Council and had come only to pick up a confrontation with the TDP MLCs.

As tensions flared, TDP president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu accompanied by a few party MLAs entered the VIP gallery and watched the proceedings.

Mr. Naidu’s entry almost led to another scuffle as the marshals asked him and his party members to vacate the gallery. Mr. Naidu refused to leave, stating that as Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, it was within his rights to enter the Council premises and watch the proceedings from the VIP gallery.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/decentralisation-crda-repeal-bills-referred-to-select-committee/article30627831.ece

He explained how CDSCO was planning to take forward the country’s challenges in this space and explained the regulatory guidelines in place for innovation and startup activities.

Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Director K.N. Ganesh, who was the guest of honour, said that research held the key to development, especially in the field of medical sciences. SVIMS Director and Vice-Chancellor B.

At MCT Circle, workers of various parties and social groups led by the former MLA M. Sugunamma and Tirupati Urban Development Authority (TUDA) former Chairman G. Narasimha Yadav took out a candlelight rally, criticising the State for undermining the importance of Amaravati, which was painstakingly developed by the erstwhile TDP regime. Ms. Sugunamma flayed the government for its intemperate remarks against the TDP on the floor of the house and high-handed behaviour on women and farmers agitating in the villages comprising the Amaravati capital region. Tense moments were witnessed when policemen came to the vicinity to swoop down on the agitators. The JAC members however fell on their feet, as if pleading for compassion towards the agitators and also on Amaravati. Taken aback, the cops retreated to avoid creating a scene.

In Kadapa, politicians, students and general public under the aegis of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi Joint Action Council (JAC) took out a candlelight rally and protested at Ambedkar Circle.

105,2020/01/22,Protest continues in support of Amaravati farmers,"Congress leaders and activists observed relay fast under the banner of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti Joint Action Committee here on Wednesday demanding that the YSR Congress Party government withdraw the Capital Region Development Authority Repeal Bill forthwith.

Addressing JAC activists, city Congress president Sripathi Prakasam said he was confident that ryots in Amaravati, who had sacrificed the land for the State capital, would get justice in the High Court as the Bill passed by the State Assembly would not stand legal scrutiny.

The Jagan Mohan Reddy government would not get the Bill, which aimed to create three capitals in Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool, passed in the Legislative Council, said civil society organisation ‘Poura Samajam’ president G. Narasimha Rao. The Centre should immediately intervene and ensure that the State capital remain at the same place where the foundation stone was laid in Amaravati in the august presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said.

After taking stock of the political situation, the JAC would chalk out future course of action in the next couple of days, said JAC convenor Alla Venkateswara Rao.

Meanwhile, people from different walks of life voted overwhelmingly for retaining the State capital in Amaravati during the people’s ballot held in the city, said JAC leader Ch. Seshaiah.

‘Ambivalent stand’

Meanwhile, TDP State Organising Secretary N. Balaji took strong objection to the alleged ambivalent stand of the BJP.

106,2020/01/22,Overwhelming response to Horsley Hills Festival enthuses officials,"The recently concluded two-day Horsley Hills Adventure Festival, which received an overwhelming response from nature lovers and spirited adventure sports enthusiasts from across India, has galvanised the Tourism Department to sustain the efforts and to introduce several vibrant events for the tourists on a permanent basis.

According to the tourism officials, it is for the first time in the history of the 150-year-old hill station to attract over 20,000 participants in just two days (January 18 and 19), as against the regular statistics of just 200-500 tourists during weekends. The dream of turning the Horsley Hills into a hot destination for adventure sports conceived during the 1970s became a reality after 50 years with the success of the festival launched with a budget of ₹1 crore.

District Tourism Officer (Chittoor) D.V. Chandramouli Reddy told The Hindu that the triathlon event — cycling, trekking and running — covering a 10 km distance from foothills to hilltop, saw the participation of over 200 youth, besides health fitness freaks even above 40 years. With a nominal fee, a large number of youth joined the rock-climbing event guided by the expert coaches, during the two days. The zip line, tree climbing, zorbing, the elements, bungee trampoline and cycle gyro were some of the events which witnessed overwhelming participation. “All these events were put into action for the first time in Horsley Hills for the adventure festival,” Mr. Reddy said.

“Our publicity efforts were a hit with southern States. Now, our immediate priority is to continue some of the adventure sports activities on a permanent basis. Initially our focus would be on the triathlon of cycling, trekking and running, and rock climbing. For the festival, we had engaged the services of a private agency to guide the participants. Now, we will send proposals to have a permanent camp for these prime sports,” the tourism official said.

Hot air balloon ride

In view of the heavy winds atop the hill station, the much-publicised event of hot air balloon ride could not be grounded during the festival. The department has plans to further improvise the action plan for this particular activity. Interestingly, there was good response to the ‘tent accommodation’ atop the hills for the visitors, which was provided due to shortage of accommodation blocks.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6txec9/article30625398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23-VJ-HORSLEYHILLS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/overwhelming-response-to-horsley-hills-festival-enthuses-officials/article30625312.ece

The deceased were identified as K. Ramu (18), K. Vijaya Lakshmi (5) and Satyavathi (45). The girl’s mother, K. Durga Bhavani, and her two children were battling for life in the Rajamahendravaram Government Hospital.

The suspect, M. Srinivas, is absconding. The reason for the act was not known immediately, said Rajamahendravaram South Zone Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) M. Venkateswarlu.

Satyavathi and Appa Rao were staying with their son, Ramu (who died in the incident), at the village. Durga Bhavani came to her parent’s house for Sankranti festival.

“Srinivas, who too is a native of Dulla village, is the relative of Satyavathi. As per the CCTV footages, the suspect procured petrol in a nearby bunk around 1.30 a.m. and filled it in a bottle. He might have removed the tiles from the roof, poured petrol and set fire,” the DSP told The Hindu.

Special teams

Rajamahendravaram Urban district Superintendent of Police Semushi Bajpai constituted special teams to nab the suspect in the case.

109,2020/01/22,Another jumbo electrocuted in Chittoor,"In a fresh incident of electrocution, one more wild elephant was killed in the fields near Tekumanda village of Bangarupalem mandal, 30 km from here, in the early hours of Tuesday, bringing the toll of the pachyderms to an agonising figure of seven, six of them due to electrocution, in a span of 10 months, all happening in a radius of about 15 km of the sanctuary zone.

According to information, a big herd from the wildlife sanctuary made its way into the agriculture fields close to Tekumanda village on Monday night. The farmers and local youth were worried seeing the pachyderms trampling the crops.

A team of elephant trackers rushed to the spot, and was on the job of driving them back into the forests, producing heavy noise with drums and weird shrieks. In the melee, one of the elephants crashed against an electric pole in the darkness. The pole got uprooted and the live overhead power line fell on the fleeing jumbo, killing it instantaneously. At dawn, a huge crowd of local people stormed the spot to have a look at the carcass of the giant male jumbo.

Senior forest officials inspected the spot, while a team of veterinary doctors were deployed to perform post-mortem of the electrocuted pachyderm.

It is the first jumbo casualty in the Koundinya wildlife zone in 2020, while the number of elephant casualties remained at six in 2019.

A vast stretch of forest fringe areas is left without any fence or trenches, making human habitations and fields vulnerable to raiding elephants, and moreover exposing the pachyderms to a high risk of getting electrocuted.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jn61xk/article30621599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22VJELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/another-jumbo-electrocuted-in-chittoor/article30621600.ece

The decision came on Tuesday morning, barely five days before the scheduled programme.

Senior officials in the Police Department and the district administration confirmed the shifting of the programme. The actual reason,however, could not be ascertained immediately.

Elaborate arrangements were being made and even marching contingents comprising platoons from the Eastern Naval Command, CRPF, Telangana Special Police, AP Special Police, NCC, SSC and scouts and guides, had been rehearsing for the last one week.

“We even held a rehearsal session in the morning, but later we came to know that it had been shifted,” said a member of Bharat Scouts and Guides. The cadets were eagerly waiting to showcase their marching skills in front of the Governor and the Chief Minister. “We now have to move hurriedly to Vijayawada,” said an NCC cadet. The district administration was getting ready to organise the full dress rehearsal on January 24, and the stage and seating arrangements were nearing completion. “We now have to dismantle everything,” said Rajesh, a worker from Bihar.

It is learnt that some part of the marching contingents will be shifted to Vijayawada for the programme and the remaining will take part in the district programme.

The government also moved about 1,000 men drawn from various districts, armed reserve, AP Special Police and Octopus to the city to provide security to the CM and other VVIPs. Now all of them along with the security apparatus such as DFMDs and bomb detection equipment have to be moved back to Vijayawada, said a senior police officer.

114,2020/01/22,‘Skilling youth imperative to achieve $5 trillion economy’,"Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu underscored the need for development of knowledge and skills of the youth in order to reap the advantage of the country’s demographic dividend and achieve accelerated economic growth.

Delivering the convocation address of Vikrama Simhapuri University here on Tuesday, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu expressed confidence that the trained and educated human capital would play an important role in achieving the Central government’s goal of making the country a USD 5 trillion dollar economy in the coming years.

Mr. Venkaiah Naidu emphasised the need to step up investments in education from the current 4.6% of GDP to 6%, as recommended by NITI Aayog.

“Indian universities should emerge as the hotspots of research, incubation and innovation,” the Vice-President said, calling for a strong research ecosystem through collaborative, inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary research initiatives.

The Vice-President lamented that India’s expenditure on R&D has stagnated. “One reason for this is low investments by the private sector in research and development,. The private sector should spend a reasonable share on R&D and join hands with universities,” he said, calling on the corporate sector to create a separate corpus to promote cutting edge research in higher education institutions and universities.

Maintaining that universities must maintain close interaction with the industry, the Vice-President called for creating the right ecosystem for research to thrive. “It should be remembered that ultimately every scientific outcome must benefit the society,” he said.

He called for reorientation of the education system and improving the quality of teaching and research in institutions of higher education.

In this context, he noted with concern that none of the Indian universities has figured among the top 100 universities of the world in a recent survey.

‘Glorious past’

“India was once known as the centre of learning, and knowledge-seekers from all over the world used to come and study at renowned learning centres like Nalanda and Takshashila. Our students must draw inspiration from our glorious past to create a magnificent future,” he said.

He asked the private universities to consider the education as a mission and as an investment in the future of the country and not merely treat it as a business opportunity. ''Private universities need to focus on ensuring inclusiveness and deploy more resources to educate children belonging to the under-privileged sections of the society”, he added.

The Vice-President also asked students to spare their time for societal obligations. He appreciated Vikrama Simhapuri University’s concept of ‘College to Village’ in this regard.

115,2020/01/22,Bring classical Telugu within commoners’ reach: M. Venkaiah Naidu,"Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu has emphasised the need to make classical Telugu understandable to common people.

Addressing the valedictory session of a workshop organised by the Centre of Excellence for Studies in Classical Telugu (CESCT), Mr. Venkaiah Naidu called for the use of technology to popularise the Telugu language by digitalising old texts.

“CESCT must promote Telugu education in the country and abroad, and popularise the rich cultural heritage of classical Telugu by publishing and translating its works into other languages. It should also digitilise the ancient literature and texts, including palm manuscripts, for the benefit of GenX and conduct research on classical music, various classical dance forms and link them with classical language,” Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said.

Calling for a movement to promote all regional languages, Mr. Venkaiah Naidu said that he wanted State governments to chip in with their contributions to nurture the mother tongue. In this context, he called for providing basic education in one's mother tongue.

“The Centre is fully committed to nurturing classical languages. The decision to shift the CESCT from Mysuru to Nellore was taken as it would be a more appropriate place for the purpose,” Union Human Resources Development Minister Ramesh Pokhrial ‘Nishank’ said.

He also called for a wider debate on the present examination system with a view to undertaking reforms in the education system.

CESCT was set up under the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL), Mysuru after Telugu was recognised as a Classical Language in 2008.

Thanks to the intervention of Mr. Venkaiah Naidu, CESCT, which had hitherto been functioning in Mysuru, was shifted to Nellore after Swarna Bharat Trust Managing Trustee Deepa Venkat offered to house the CESCT in its premises for three to four years free of cost.

Tamil, Sanskrit, Kannada, Malayalam and Odia are the other languages that have been declared as classical languages.

Roadmap

More than 200 scholars and experts of Telugu classical language who participated in the workshop chaired by Prof. D.G.Rao, Director of Central Institute of Indian Languagues, came out with a roadmap on the preservation, propagation and promotion of classical Telugu so that the richness of the language could be taken to greater heights, according to CESCT Director Prof. D. Muniratnam Naidu.

Earlier, interacting with students at Akshara Vidyalaya and Skill Development Centre, the Vice-President highlighted the nutritional values of traditional Indian foods and pointed out that consumption of junk foods led to lifestyle diseases. He also urged the students to respect their elders. “They should love and live in tune with nature,” the Vice-President said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6awe1t/article30619321.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22-VJ-VICEPRESIDENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bring-classical-telugu-within-commoners-reach-m-venkaiah-naidu/article30619322.ece
116,2020/01/22,TDP stalls ‘decentralisation’Bill in Legislative Council,"The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) on Tuesday stalled the AP Administrative Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill 2020 in the Legislative Council.

The Bill, passed by the Assembly late on Monday night, envisages establishing three capitals Visakhapatnam (Executive), Amaravati (legislative) and Kurnool (judicial).

TDP leader and former Speaker Yanamala Ramakrishnudu gave notice under Rule 71 and moved a motion “disapproving the policy of the government.”

Ministers Buggana Rajendranath Reddy Botcha Satyanarayana and others opposed it and demanded that Chairman Mohammed Ahmed Shariff to give priority to the business of the House. The Chairman announced a break and invited leaders of the two sides to his chambers to discuss the issue and break the impasse.

When the House reassembled, the Chairman allowed the motion and said the business of the House would be taken up after a two-hour discussion on the Bill. The YSR Congress Party, which has just nine members in the Council, remained firm and insisted that the Bill be tabled, suggesting that TDP leaders could make their points as part of the discussion on the Bill.

As the Chairman asked Rajendra Prasad (TDP) to speak, the YSRCP members objected to it, demanding that the Bill be taken up first.

Nothing was audible in the din and to restore order, the Chairman adjourned the House. The Council witnessed pandemonium again when YSRCP members tried to thwart the Chairman’s attempt to give a chance to TDP members. Some of them raised slogans in support of their demand.

The TDP leaders said the Chairman should suspend the “unruly” YSRCP members.

Responding to it, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said they would prefer suspension rather than being witness to the “misuse of Rule 71.”

118,2020/01/22,Mangaluru bomb scare: Police to probe Aditya Rao’s possible links,"The city police are investigating as to whether Aditya Rao, who is suspected to have placed an explosive at the Mangaluru International Airport on January 20, had done so as an “act of vengeance” or if there were others who might have set him up for the task. How a habitual hoax caller progressed to making an explosive has to be studied, said the police.

Also read: Aditya Rao’s family had kept him at a distance for two years

A senior police official overseeing the investigation of the case said the person who made the hoax call (suspected to be Aditya) to the airport terminal manager on Monday had said that the “police will repent” for putting him behind bars for eight months.

This made the Mangaluru police to suspect the role of Aditya who had been jailed in the open-air prison at Devanahalli, Bengaluru, following his arrest by the International Airport police in 2018. He had been arrested for three hoax calls he made to Kempegowda International Airport in 2018.

‘Voice matched’

In addition, the official said that the voice of the caller who said that the Mangaluru–Bengaluru Indigo flight had an explosive matched with that of Aditya’s.

“We cannot rule out the chance of him acting under the influence of others. We need to closely investigate his contacts, including those he could have come in touch with during his stay in the prison at Devanahalli,” the official said. The progression from the person known for making hoax calls to the one who actually placed an explosive had to be studied closely, the official said.

Apart from recording eyewitness accounts about Aditya’s movement on January 20, the police will collect evidence about the place where he prepared the explosive and how he procured the material. The police are looking at how he acquired the knowledge and if anyone was associated with him in this task.

Assistant Commissioner of Police (North) K. Belliyappa, who is the investigation officer in the case, proceeded to Bengaluru along with Assistant Commissioner of Police Vinay Gaonker and a few other city police personnel and took custody of Aditya. He was brought by a flight to Mangaluru on Wednesday night.

The management of the bar and restaurant at Balmatta in Mangaluru where Aditya worked for a few days said on Wednesday that they alerted the police about him after television channels showed the video grab of the suspect.

A management representative told reporters here that they called the police as the person in the video grab resembled Aditya.

Colleagues of Aditya at the bar and restaurant said he worked in the billing section on a temporary basis between December 16 and January 12. “He was offered the job on compassionate grounds after he mentioned that his father was not keeping well and his mother had passed away,” said a management representative.

The representative, who did not want to be named, said Aditya lived in a room at Valencia here. He was an introvert and never spoke much with his colleagues. He would report to duty at 10 a.m. and leave for his room at 11 p.m. every day. During the afternoon break, between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., he worked out at a gymnasium nearby. Aditya left the job on January 12 saying he had got a job as a security in charge in an educational institution.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nbc3uk/article30628079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGADITYARAOINSIDE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-to-probe-aditya-raos-possible-links/article30628080.ece
119,2020/01/22,Section of State officers works in fear because of back-seat driving by saffron groups: Kumaraswamy,"Stating that some section of the bureaucracy is “working under fear”, especially in coastal Karnataka, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday claimed that officers were finding it difficult to work efficiently because of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “bad administration and back-seat driving by its allied organisations such as the VHP and the RSS”.

“Karnataka was always known for efficient officers. I do not blame the entire Police Department, but many efficient officials have been sidelined and such officials are unable to work freely. Some section of the bureaucracy is also in fear,” he told reporters here. He said, “Officers are unable to work efficiently owing to the BJP’s bad administration and some influence by other groups such as the VHP and the RSS that do back-seat driving.”

Mr. Kumaraswamy’s comments came in the light of BJP leaders accusing him of demoralising the police force over his recent statements on police officials handling the law and order situation.

Later, the JD(S) leader also put out a series of tweets hitting out at BJP leaders who had made accusations against him.

“It is the responsibility of of the ruling dispensation to get officials work efficiently. My concern is about the 6.5 crore population that lives in fear now,” he added.

‘Trying to appease govt.’

Also blaming a section of officials for trying to “appease” the government, he pointed to a series of developments in the State that started from the death of two persons during an anti-CAA protest in Mangaluru and the arrest of terror suspects in Chamarajanagar to the more recent the Mangaluru airport case.

“Work with caution on sensitive issues,” he advised both officials and the government.

‘Focus on unemployed youth’

Urging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to “change their attitude”, Mr. Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said that in the light of details emerging about the accused in the Mangaluru airport bomb case, the two should be worried about unemployment among the youth in the country.

“Educated youngsters are running around for jobs. First take up such issues,” he said. The former Chief Minister also said that the surrender of the accused “looks like a drama” to him, and the whole incident could be best described as a “pataki prakarana” (cracker incident).

‘What is the message to investors?’

At a time when Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is wooing investors at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mr. Kumaraswamy asked, “What signals are you sending to the investors when there exists an atmosphere of fear? Where is Karnataka headed to?”

He asked if signals about communal tensions and terror were going out, how could the State get investors. He said that the series of church attacks in Karnataka in 2008, when the BJP came to power, was still fresh in memory.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j82z23/article30628030.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23BGKUMARASWAMY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/section-of-state-officers-works-in-fear-because-of-back-seat-driving-by-saffron-groups-kumaraswamy/article30628032.ece
120,2020/01/22,KSE orders probe into working of drinking water units,"Expressing concern over drinking water supply units not functioning in many villages, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa has ordered a probe into the units in Arsikere taluk.

At a meeting to review the department’s works here on Wednesday, he asked the officers of Hassan Zilla Panchayat to submit a report within eight days.

Arsikere MLA K.M. Shivalinge Gowda said among 131 drinking water units set up in fluoride-affected villages, nearly 100 were not functioning. However, the officers said only 29 were not working, while the rest were functioning.

Disputing the officers’ statement, the MLA said many had developed technical problems within days after they were inaugurated. “The machinery procured itself was faulty. I challenge the officers to issue a certificate confirming the efficiency of the machinery. The money spent on the units has gone waste”, he said.

The Minister said he had listened to similar problems in many districts. The issue needed to be probed. “I order the officers to probe why the units are not working in Arsikere. The probe should complete in eight days”, he said.

Solid waste management

Mr. Eshwarappa, reviewing the Swachh Bharat programme, said the Central government provides a grant of ₹20 lakh each to gram panchayats for handling solid waste.

The amount could be utilised properly if the legislators and the district administration helped to get land to set up landfill sites. He appealed to the legislators to identify suitable land in each gram panchayat so that the fund could be utilised.

C.N. Balakrishna, A.T. Ramaswamy, Preetham Gowda, MLAs; Principal Secretary L.K. Atheeq; and other senior officers were present.

‘No pits’

Mr. Shivalinge Gowda said that many people who built toilets under Swachh Bharat scheme were not using them. Many have not dug the pit, but only constructed the toilet to show progress in implementing the scheme, he claimed.

He said many people could not dig a pit as they did not have sufficient land. “I know the reality of the toilet construction programme. Many have built toilets as they were threatened with disconnection of water and power supply and withdrawal of ration card”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kse-orders-probe-into-working-of-drinking-water-units/article30627600.ece

125,2020/01/22,Economy will worsen further under Modi: Yechury,"Terming the emerging economic slowdown as the beginning of a harsh recession, Sitaram Yechury, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), cautioned that the economic condition in the country would further worsen under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The proclaimed GDP growth is at 4.1% at present. As per many national and international economists and agencies, the actual growth is hovering between 2% and 3%. The slowdown is clearly visible in many forms including joblessness. 10 lakh jobs were lost in the auto ancillary industry alone in the last few months. 20 lakh people in the textile industry have joined the army of unemployed. Major Information Technology companies like Infosys are downsizing their workforce,” he said at a press conference in Kalaburagi on Wednesday.

Criticising the Union government for its ‘failure’ to handle the economic slowdown, the communist leader alleged that the measures taken for addressing the issue was expected to further worsen the condition rather than improving it.

“The government announced a package of ₹2.25 lakh crore for helping the corporate giants in the form of tax concessions as a measure to address the economic slowdown. But, it would no way help India come out of the crisis as people’s purchasing power has fallen to a great extent. Instead of offering ₹2.25 lakh crore to big corporate companies, the same amount could have been spent on areas such as infrastructure development that would have resulted in enhancing the people’s purchasing power. But, Mr. Modi cannot do it as it would in no way help increase the wealth of his corporate friends manifold. As per a recently released Oxfam report, India’s richest 1% held more than four times the cumulative wealth held by the bottom 70% of the country’s population,” he said adding that India’s economic condition would worsen in the days to come.

Pointing to Mr. Modi’s remarks at a public rally at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi where he had said that there were no discussions or decisions for the extension of National Register of Citizens (NRC), Mr. Yechury said that he had never seen a Prime Minister who lied as much as Mr. Modi did.

When asked of his party’s future course of action on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and NRC, Mr. Yechury reiterated his call for a civil disobedience movement.

“There is no way but to resort to a peaceful civil disobedience movement. There are millions of Adivasis, nomads, flood victims, Dalits, minorities, displaced people and other poorer sections of people who simply cannot prove their citizenship in the NRC process as they don’t have the required documents. We call upon the people to provide the required information for census and not to provide any information for NPR [National Population Register] and not to furnish any documents for NRC. Home Minister Amit Shah has said that he would not step back from CAA and NRC regardless of any number of protests. Even the British had told Mahatma Gandhi that the country would not get freedom, regardless of the number of agitations. But, they had to bend because of the pressure of people’s movement and free the country,” he said.

128,2020/01/22,Nalini Balakumar case: Siddaramaiah condemns Mysuru Advocates’ Association,"Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday condemned the resolution adopted by Mysuru Advocates’ Association against appearing for Nalini Balakumar, who has been accused of sedition.

Speaking to reporters in Mysuru, Mr. Siddaramaiah described the resolution as “unconstitutional, undemocratic and against professional dharma”. He stood by the advocates who had defied the Association’s “illegal” diktat, and signed the ‘vakalathnama’ to represent Nalini Balakumar. “The advocates who signed have done the right thing.”

Mr. Siddaramaiah said Nalini’s act of holding aloft a ‘Free Kashmir’ placard does not amount to sedition. Finding fault with the police for booking her under sedition, the former Chief Minister referred to the proceedings of a similar case in Delhi High Court, where the judge reportedly questioned the public prosecutor whether he had read the Constitution.

Questioning how the placard can be considered anti-national when Kashmir was gripped by emergency with prohibitory orders remaining in force, Mr. Siddaramaiah justified Nalini’s right to make a statement against the wrongs as perceived by her. “If you write your opinion, can they book you under sedition?”, he asked the journalists.

Terming as “illegal” the threat of disciplinary action against the advocates representing Nalini, Mr. Siddaramaiah said such actions will not pass the test of law and will be struck down by the court.

He termed the resolution adopted by the Association as ‘political’ and criticised the goondaism” displayed by a section of the advocates, who had allegedly tried to manhandle advocate and former Chairperson of State Women’s Commission Manjula Manasa.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nalini-balakumars-case-siddaramaiah-condemns-mysuru-advocates-association/article30623779.ece

The police have taken him into custody for further questioning. Rao has reportedly confessed that he had placed the explosives at the Mangaluru airport on Tuesday as he was “frustrated.”

Habitual hoax caller

The Mangaluru police were on the lookout for this habitual hoax caller. Soon after the incident, they had verified CCTV footages and begun search for Rao, but he had managed to escape to Bengaluru in a truck.

Rao worked as a cashier since December 14 in a popular bar and restaurant in Balmatta in Mangaluru. He had not come to the restaurant for the last few days after getting his salary, a representative of the bar told mediapersons.

The other case was regarding two calls made on August 27, 2018, about explosive substance in six flights. The cases were registered in the BIAL police station. He had served a nine-month sentence and got out on bail.

134,2020/01/22,Police need to be trained to follow SC guidelines on registering FIRs: HC,"The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday observed that police officers, including IPS officers, required proper training in the fundamentals of registering First Information Reports in criminal cases as per the guidelines issued in a 2013 Supreme Court verdict in the case of Lalita Kumari vs. Government of Uttar Pradesh.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar made these oral observations after noting that the Additional Director-General of Police (Crime) had sought a report within a day from Superintendents of Police of five districts on 113 victims of child pornography mentioned in a 2018 report by Union Ministry of Women and Child Development.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed by Bachpan Bachao Andolan, seeking action in the cases of the 113 victims, housed in State-run homes. Director-General and Inspector-General of Police Neelamani N. Raju, in her affidavit, had stated that SPs of five districts had submitted reports indicating that there were no instances of child pornography in the homes for children under their jurisdiction. They had been instructed by the ADGP, through a letter dated December 16, 2019, to submit their report within a day.

Following this, the Bench said this showed the senior police officers did not understand criminal law. The SPs have done what has prohibited by the Supreme Court, the Bench said.

The apex court, in the Lalita Kumari case, had said that registration of FIR was mandatory under Section 154 of the CrPC if the information disclosed the commission of a cognizable offence and no preliminary inquiry was permissible in such a situation. If the information did not disclose a cognizable offence but indicated the necessity for an inquiry, a preliminary inquiry had to be conducted to ascertain whether a cognizable offence had been disclosed.

The HC Bench questioned how the SPs could come to any conclusion without conducting an investigation by registering an FIRs.

Probe by CID

Meanwhile, the DG&IGP, in her affidavit, indicated that the mistake had been rectified with FIRs registered, subsequent to court’s earlier observations, by including the ministry report as source of information.

The DG&IGP also said that all the FIRs registered in the five districts — Kolar, Vijayapura, Ballari, Gadag and Kalaburagi — related to the 113 victims of child pornography had been transferred to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) to ensure that the probe was conducted independently, without any reference to the reports filed by the SPs. The Bench adjourned further hearing on the matter till February 7.

Child-friendly courts

Meanwhile, the Bench asked the Additional Advocate General to get instruction from the government on the High Court administration’s request for providing suitable sites for establishing 31 child-friendly courts across the State.

Pointing out that the existing child-friendly courts were housed within the regular court complex and victims are forced to pass through court complex, the Bench said that the Karnataka government was lagging behind in providing infrastructure for child-friendly courts, though it was in the forefront in providing good infrastructure for the judiciary in the country.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-need-to-be-trained-to-follow-sc-guidelines-on-registering-firs-hc/article30619224.ece
135,2020/01/22,"‘It’s sorting out, not demoting’","The State government has reportedly decided to strip Director General of Police Jacob Thomas of his rank. The State may demote him to the rank of Additional Director General of Police.

However, Mr. Thomas, the senior-most ranking IPS officer in the State, appeared unfazed by the move.

He told The Hindu that he was willing to work as a “sub-inspector”. He felt hounded for speaking out on issues that concerned the public.

“No official intimation”

“I have conducted myself as a citizen. I am prepared to incur the costs involved. I have suffered losses on personal, professional, and financial fronts for listening to my conscience,” he said.

Mr. Thomas said he had not received any official intimation. “I have learnt of the possibility from a newspaper,” he said.

He is currently managing director of Kerala Metal Industries Limited in Palakkad.

Answering questions from presspersons in Palakkad, Mr. Thomas said “it will not be demoting, rather it will be segregating or sorting out.”

He said as ADGP, he still would have the chance of a promotion. “The government can take any decision and implement it; as citizens we have certain limitations,” he said.

Mr. Thomas, who was hand-picked by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to head the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau in 2016, fell out with the government after the agency booked Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan on the charge of nepotism.

Ever since, he has faced a slew of departmental inquiries for breaking service rules, penning a service story without permission, a bid-rigging charge, and an amassment of wealth case.

Mr. Thomas is likely to seek legal recourse against the move to lower his rank. He may also move the Central government and Central Administrative Tribunal.

136,2020/01/22,Citizens will have to suffer for acting responsibly: Thomas,"State’s seniormost IPS officer in service Jacob Thomas, who is currently managing director of Metal Industries Ltd., Shoranur, said here on Wednesday that citizens would have to suffer some loss for acting responsibly in a democratic society.

Delivering the Sanjay Chandrasekhar Memorial Lecture organised by the Press Club, Palakkad, Mr. Thomas said, “A citizen’s role is not to keep mum fearing personal loss. Even if it causes them some loss, good citizens should perform their role,” he said.

Name, a burden

Mr. Thomas said that that even names had become a burden on the people.

“You are being segregated and branded as per your name. Your ideology, your religion, and everything matters,” he said.

During a discussion on the role of citizens, Mr. Thomas said that legislative intent of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) was the vital thing.

“But I do not know the actual legislative intent of the CAA.” He said the State government, as a legal entity, had the right to approach the judiciary against the CAA.

“In fact, the government has approached the Supreme Court to send home a very important message.”

He blamed the government officials for the situation leading to the demolition of the apartments at Maradu, causing heavy destruction and loss. “If the government officials concerned had raised a hue and cry against the illegal actions in time, then this heavy loss could have been saved.”

Press Club secretary C.K. Sivanandan welcomed the gathering. Senior journalist P.P. Narayanan Kutty presented a memento to Mr. Thomas.

142,2020/01/22,ED questions former Minister,"The Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) reported questioning of former Excise Minister K. Babu on January 16 over allegations of illegal amassment of wealth has triggered speculation that the Central agency may register a case against him.

The interview that happened in Kochi was about the case registered against the Congress leader by the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB). Officials said the ED could have received third party information from the VACB and might be probing whether there was any money laundering angle to the case against Mr Babu.

After the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government assumed power in 2016, the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) had registered a “disproportionate assets” case against him.

The agency had accused Mr Babu of amassing illegal wealth, an estimated 49.45% of his known income, during his tenure as Excise Minister in the Oomen Chandy government.

Reprieve under UDF

Earlier, under the United Democratic Front (UDF) regime, the VACB had pedalled back from booking Mr Babu on the charge of nepotism and corruption in the allotment of new bar licences. It had filed a quick verification report stating that the accusations levelled against Mr. Babu by office-bearers of the Kerala Bar Hotel Association in sworn statements in various courts were baseless.

Mr. Babu has moved the Kerala High Court to dismiss the illegitimate wealth case slapped against him by the agency. He told reporters in Thrissur that the VACB had victimised him. The ED directorate questioned him to find out whether there was any integrity in the VACB’s charge that he had earned over ₹100 crore through corrupt means, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ed-questions-former-minister/article30627986.ece
143,2020/01/22,‘Take tour packages from approved operators only’,"The need to purchase tour packages from approved and reputed tour operators and have medical and travel insurance for outbound travel have come into focus with the tragic death of eight tourists from Kerala at a hotel in Nepal.

With reports from Nepal confirming that the tourists died of asphyxiation after using gas heater in their room, the selection of hotel, facilities being offered, safety standards, and location of the property gain importance. It is yet to be confirmed whether the 15-member group had purchased the tour package from an approved tour operator and whether they had travel and medical insurance.

Good hotels

“Had the group purchased the tour package to Nepal from an approved agent, this would not have happened. All approved tour operators offer only good hotels with prescribed safety and security standards and facilities, insist on travel insurance and brief them on the dos and don’ts before departure,” says Benny Thomas of the Outbound Tour Operators Association.

As the kin of the deceased are in the dark about the Nepal trip, it is inferred that it was worked out after the group reached Delhi. Even in Kerala, 60 of 1,200 tour operators have registration with India and Kerala Tourism. “One can save money while going for cheap tour packages. But, tragic incidents such as the one in Nepal highlight the need for depending on approved tour operators and for staying in good hotels and resorts in good locations,” adds Mr. Thomas. “European countries insist on travel insurance and we make it mandatory for all outbound travel. The premium is ₹1,500 for a week up to the age of 60 and will change depending on age. Still, it is inexpensive, compared to the tour cost and the risks involved,” he added.

Abraham George, Member, National Tourism Advisory Council, says they had been demanding at different levels for norms to prevent mushrooming of unlicensed travel agents to prevent holidayers from being taken for a ride. From Kerala, Far Eastern countries followed by European countries are the most sought after.

Insurance must

Retendering procedures for issuing contracts for generating 150 MW are progressing. Other than rooftop, preliminary works for setting up floating panels are progressing.

The target is to generate 400 MW from the panels to be laid on the reservoirs of the Idukki project and 100 MW from Banaruasagar. Tender process for 200-MW ground-mounted solar projects too are progressing.

Archa Unni, managing director of Niel Entertainment, said that the municipal chief had demanded ₹10 lakh.

Files plaint

The firm has since filed complaints with the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) and the District Police Chief.

The firm said that they had not paid any bribe to the municipal officials. According to Niel Entertainment, they approached the municipality for permission last year. As the civic body delayed its nod, the firm moved the High Court. The court then issued an order in favour of the firm. Subsequently, both the municipality and the Ports Department granted permission to conduct the expo in November 2019. While, the Ports Department allowed them to use the land till February 23, 2020, the municipality granted permission for the firm to conduct the expo till January 23, 2020. On Tuesday, the municipal council decided not to extend the permission.

Mr. Varadarajan told The Hindu here on Wednesday that the expenses for bringing the bodies were being done as per the directions of the State government.

Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran spoke to Union Minister of State for External Affairs V. Muraleedharan on the issue and the latter is understood to have responded positively. Still, there was a lack of clarity and hence the State government directed NoRKA to foot the bill. The bodies were expected to be transported on Thursday morning itself, Mr. Varadarajan said.

152,2020/01/22,Using a Shakespearian technique to voice dissent,"Shakespeare’s prowess to voice dissent through soul-stirring plays which lay bare social and personal truths is still a tool to show resistance. At least in politically sensitive Iran, where artists and writers face many challenges. The Mostaghel, the only formal theatre company in Iran, has been using adaptations of the bard’s plays to depict the state-of-affairs in the country, now on the verge of a war.

The company’s last year offer at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) was the adaptation of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which was much lauded. This year, it is back again with Coriolanus, a Persian adaptation of the Shakespearean original that hints at the country’s many turbulent political situations. “We dedicate our play to the people of Iran, who have been oppressed by the rulers for long,” says Mostafa Koushki, the play’s director.

One of Shakespeare’s famous tragedies, Coriolanus is based on the life of Caius Marcious, a legendary Roman leader who was given the name Coriolanus following his success against various uprisings challenging the Roman regime. But his temperament is unsuited for popular leadership and he fails to win the support of his people and loses the position of Consul. He then allies with his enemy Tullus Aufidius and swears to take revenge on his city. The conclusion of this decision was his death.

Mr. Koushiki says a theatre presentation from Iran at this time is not an easy task with tensions mounting in West Asiat after the killing of Iran’s military commander Quassem Soleimani.

“In dictatorial government and totalitarian regimes, sovereignty and the masses join hands in a queer way as the dominant and the dominated. The masses repeat words of the domineer without any thought and the domineer rides on it. This will cause elites, intellectuals and rationalists to be killed, deported or be imprisoned. There is no difference between Third World and Developed countries in this trend,” says Mr. Koushki.

The Mostaghel Theatre Company has more than 10 productions since its formation four years ago. Coriolanus‘s musician Ali Rezania, who effortlessly handled more than half a dozen instruments, was given a huge rounds of applause by the audience.

An Evening with Immigrant from the U.K. and Cheralacharitham, a Malayalam play, were the other two plays staged on Wednesday at the ITFoK.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/9xjrfi/article30627974.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv23irantheaer,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/using-shakeaspeare-for-showing-dissent/article30626761.ece
153,2020/01/22,Govt. seeks legal opinion to prosecute Devassy,"The State government has sought legal opinion on whether or not to prosecute former Maradu grama panchayat president K.A. Devassy.

Mr. Devassy, an influential CPI(M) leader, had found himself in the eye of a storm after the Crime Branch (CB) ‘reported’ in December that he had ‘played a vital role in the commission of the offences’ related to the illegal construction of four flats in the panchayat.

The agency told the government that Mr. Devassy had actively collaborated with the ‘delinquent’ builders to help them fraudulently acquire, reclaim and construct on ecologically fragile wetland. The builders, later, palmed of the illegally built flats to unsuspecting buyers.

However, the delay on the part of the government to accord sanction to prosecute Mr. Devassy had ‘hobbled’ the agency's efforts to investigate the corruption aspect of the case. In contrast, the government had given the CB sanction to prosecute three local body officials Jairam Naik, P.E. Joseph and Muhammad Ashraf.

The alleged move to save Mr. Devassy from prosecution prompted the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) to take to the streets in protest. Congress leaders also swore to raise the issue in the coming budget session of the Assembly. Hundreds of apartment dwellers, who lost their life’s savings when their flats were dynamited, lent their support to the UDF protest.

Finally on January 20, Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Vishwas Mehta wrote to the Director General of Prosecution seeking his ‘remarks’ in the matter. Mr. Mehta has not set any deadline for receiving the legal opinion.

The agency had sought the permission of the government for sanction under Section 17 (a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act to indict him as a former public servant for conspiracy, cheating and graft. It suspected that a large amount of money had changed hands over a protracted period to facilitate the fraud.

Abuse of power

155,2020/01/22,Kerala govt. to issue land deeds for all applicants,"Revenue Minister E. Chandrasekharan has said that title deeds for all applicants in the State would be issued before the end of tenure of the LDF government.

Speaking after inaugurating a district level pattaya mela here on Tuesday, Mr. Chandrasekharan said that the government would ensure land for all landless tribespeople.

A piece of land for living was not the munificence of anybody but the right of a citizen in a democratic set-up. The inordinate delay by the Forest Department in marking the boundary of the land that was allotted to tribespeople was the major reason for the failure to ensure land to all landless tribal families, he said.

The Forest Department should ensure that the land identified for tribal families was habitable, Mr. Chandrasekharan said. Land deeds were provided to 1,40,000 families in the State in 38 months. When the pattaya melas were completed in five more districts, the number of families would cross 1,50,000, he said.

A.K. Balan, Minister for Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Backward Classes, who delivered the presidential address, said that coordinated intervention of the district administration, Forest and Tribal departments was needed to solve land-related issues of the tribal families. As many as 8,051 such families in the district were landless, Mr. Balan said.

He directed the Tribal department officials to adopt steps to provide land to all tribal families in the district in two months.

Mr. Chandrasekharan handed over pattayams (land deeds ) to 500 families belonging to the general category and 496 tribal families.

Possession certificates were issued to 15 tribal families under the Forest Rights Act on the occasion.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wkjfk5/article30618540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22tvwypattayamela,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-govt-to-issue-land-deeds-for-all-applicants/article30618541.ece
156,2020/01/22,8 tourists from Kerala found dead in Nepal hotel,"A holiday in Nepal turned tragic for a group of friends from Kerala and their families, as eight of them, including four children, were found dead, presumably due to asphyxiation caused by a malfunctioning gas heater in their hotel room.

The deceased have been identified as Praveen Krishnan Nair (39), his wife Saranya (34), their children Sreebhadra (9), Aarcha (8) and Abhinav (7), Renjith Kumar (39), his wife Indu (34) and son Vaishnav (2). They were part of a group of 15 belonging to four families who had travelled to Nepal last week.

They were staying at a hotel in Daman, located in the Makwanpur district, on their way back from Pokhara to catch a flight back to India. They checked in at the hotel on Monday night. Two of the families shared one room, while the others stayed in the second room. The gas heaters were switched on due to the cold weather. The room was bolted from inside and there was hardly any ventilation.

On Tuesday morning, all the eight in the first room were found unconscious. They were airlifted to the HAMS hospital in Kathmandu, where they were pronounced dead on arrival. The deaths are presumed to have been due to carbon monoxide poisoning, caused by a gas leak in the heater.

According to Kannan, Praveen’s cousin, the trip was a sort of get-together for four college friends and their families. Praveen, Renjith Kumar, Jayakrishnan and Ramkumar were batch mates at the Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering, Pappanamcode, from where they passed out in 2004.

Praveen, hailing from Chenkottukonam on the outskirts of the city, was working at a private firm in Dubai. Saranya, his wife, had shifted back in Ernakulam a few years back to complete her M.Pharm, which she would have done in March.

Renjith Kumar, hailing from Kunnamangalam in Kozhikode district, was running an IT company, while his wife Indu was working at a co-operative bank. Their son Madhav, who was sleeping in the other room survived.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has expressed deep grief at the deaths. In a statement, he said officials of the Department of Non-Resident Keralites Affairs had got in touch with the Indian embassy in Nepal. After post-mortem, the bodies are expected to be brought here by Wednesday.

External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said the Embassy officials were at the hospital providing the necessary assistance. “Our thoughts are with the bereaved families,” he said.

157,2020/01/22,Power generation resumes partially at Moolamattom,"Power generation at the Moolamattom power house resumed partially on Tuesday after it was stopped following a blast at the exit transformer of the second generator on Monday night.

The blast occurred around 9.30 p.m. and the underground station was filled with smoke. Fire and Rescue Services personnel immediately evacuated all staff from the power station.

Two of them, assistant engineer Sampath and contract staffer Abin Ramachandran, were admitted to a private hospital at Moolamattom after they had difficulty in breathing.

A Kerala State Electricity Board official on Tuesday said the other generators were restored to normal power production mode by afternoon. The second generator needed inspection and only an inquiry could ascertain the reasons for the blast. The official said the State would have a shortage of 500 MW in view of the partial disruption in generation. Electricity Minister M.M.Mani on Tuesday visited the power house to take stock of the situation.

The Moolamattom power house of the Idukki reservoir has an installed capacity of 780 MW with six generators of 130 MW each. It meets nearly 40% of the power requirements of the State and is reserved mainly for the peak summer season demand.

2015 and 2011 blasts

In April 2015, a major blast was reported at the circuit breaker and in January 2011 two engineers on duty at the powerhouse were killed in another blast.

A second power station at Moolamattom to meet the requirements of the peak season is under consideration of the government. It is also aimed at reducing the pressure on the present power station where the equipment are over 40 years old and without much upgrade.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/power-generation-resumes-partially-at-moolamattom/article30619903.ece
158,2020/01/22,Acid attack awareness loses to period biopic,"Three days before the release of Chhapaak — which she starred in and debuted as producer for — Deepika Padukone was spotted at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. The actor stood alongside those who protested the mobbed violence that occurred a few days earlier. Right Wing supporters called for the boycott of her film on social media: going as far as to post the same image, with the same seats in the same theatre, cancelling those same tickets.

Chhapaak, directed by Meghna Gulzar, has reportedly been made on a budget of ₹40 crore and released to 1,700 screens across the country. But when the film hit cinemas on January 10, it opened to a reasonable ₹4.50 crore net. While some would insist the boycott had some effect, trade analysts say otherwise. “[The opening] is not a low number [for a film like Chhapaak],” says Shailesh Kapoor or Ormax Media, a firm specialising in trade insights. “If the film was really boycotted, it would have opened 15 to 20% lower. The ‘boycott’ actually created a lot of buzz for the film.” Kapoor adds that in spite of being released to a significant number of screens, the film has only been targeted at three to four metro cities. “The masses aren’t getting influenced by politics [when it comes to films],” he adds. “Chhapaak’s target audience has their own opinions of politics.”

The film is entirely led by a woman without an A-lister male star while tackling a niche subject like acid attacks, with little no ‘masala’ entertainment. Take in to account Gulazar’s last film Raazi, which became Alia Bhatt’s first solo ₹100-crore earner. The film opened to ₹7.33 crore net, a little more than Chhapaak, but continued steadily for several weeks. Unfortunately, Padukone’s film has not been able to sustain an increase in revenue collecting a total of ₹29.70 crore net in about 11 days. Chhapaak might be a dampner on Padukone’s career graph, but it’s only in terms of box office success. After all, her last film Padmaavat became the second highest grossing film of 2018 collecting ₹282 crore net. This time, she’s not waiting another two years to appear on the big screen with Kabir Khan’s 83 set to release in October. For now, it’s quite certain that the film will crawl towards a slow second week and end its run with a lifetime earning around ₹35 to ₹40 crore net.

Big competition

On the other hand, Chhapaak’s immediate competition was Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, reportedly made with ₹120 crore with a 3,880 screen count. The biographical period film overpowers Chhapaak in mass attraction, budget, scale and even star power with Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan. It’s no wonder then that the film opened at ₹14.50 crore net and continues to pull audiences in its second week earning a total of ₹170 crore net as of this Monday. With disparate subjects and equally different target audiences, it’s not as if the bigger of the two took viewers away from the other. But it’s clear that Tanhaji is the real winner especially considering its performance in Maharashtra which accounts for almost 40% of total revenue. “The film has turned out to be bigger than expected, becoming Devgn’s biggest film to date,” says Kapoor adding that Maharashtra usually contributes to about 20% of a mass film’s collections. Plus, the film has performed well across the board, in single screen and multiplex territories.

With no real competition at the end of Tanhaji’s first theatrical week, it will continue to sustain its collections in week two. This week, Kangana Ranaut’s Panga releases along with Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor-starrer Street Dancer 3D. The two might just cut short Tanhaji’s wining streak which is predicted to snag an impressive ₹200 crore net before bowing out of cinemas.\

159,2020/01/22,‘We dance for a cause’ : Shraddha Kapoor and Varun Dhawan on 'Street Dancer 3D',"While shooting for Baaghi 3, fresh out of her experience on Street Dancer 3D, Shraddha Kapoor would do steps in between takes. Even as Kapoor tells me that her favourite styles now are popping and locking and the robot, she sways while seated to demonstrate what she means. “I have always loved dancing,” she remarks cheerfully, “So to be able to live that out in a film is a dream come true for me.” Growing up, Kapoor attended classes by contemporary dance gurus like Shiamak Davar, Ashley Lobo and Terence Lewis. But it wasn’t until ABCD2 (2015), that she decided to do it professionally. “It was my ABCD2 family,” she says when I ask her about her reasons for doing Street Dancer 3D. But the expectations were higher and the training more gruelling this time around. “It was very difficult on the body,” recalls Kapoor. “There were a lot of injuries, there was a physio on set for all of us.”

Against type

The opportunity of playing a character who is passionate, aggressive and arrogant was both new and appealing to Kapoor. Street Dancer 3D’s overconfident Inayat, she points out, is a far cry from the docile Vinnie of ABCD2. At the same time, being a part of Remo D’Souza’s steadily growing dance universe, which provides a platform for many gifted dancers, was greatly inspiring for Kapoor.

For Varun Dhawan, it was a documentary on the Sikh Welfare and Awareness Team or SWAT, a charitable organisation based in West London, that proved to be the real draw. Director Remo D’Souza and writer Tushar Hiranandani discussed it with Dhawan and he says that its subject not only inspired him to come on board but also ended up playing a big part in Street Dancer 3D.

Vim and vigour

Dhawan like Kapoor attests to the long hours of training for the film and speaks of how embodying a dancer meant bringing about changes to one’s body language too. “The challenge is every day. You are not dancing in a regular dance form. You are playing a dancer. So, your behaviour has to be like that. You can’t do anything ordinary… that was taxing and difficult,” he notes.

Dhawan admits that he has always been a dancer. The actor remembers watching broadcasts of Michael Jackson’s HIStory World Tour as a boy and says that he has always admired and tried to ape performers like Prabhu Deva, Govinda, Usher and Chris Brown. However, he is also quick to add, “But not at this level. Not on the reality show competitive level. I am dancing with reality TV stars here.”

Shared legacy

Street Dancer 3D’s trailer seems to indicate that it draws its competitive energy from the age-old and oft-used narrative of the warring subcontinental rivals.

Dhawan agrees that there is an India-Pakistan angle and an associated rivalry since the protagonists are from the two countries, but points out that it is only an angle. “It is not what the film is actually about. We dance for a cause – the rehabilitation of illegal immigrants which is also there in the trailer,” he emphasises.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8bme06/article30627363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/23bm-pg5-Street-Dancer,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/we-dance-for-a-cause-shraddha-kapoor-and-varun-dhawan-on-street-dancer-3d/article30627364.ece
160,2020/01/22,"After #MeToo, Harvey Weinstein’s trial set to open in New York","Harvey Weinstein spawned the #MeToo movement. Now, the former film titan is starring in the biggest trial of its era: a landmark moment in a global reckoning that has empowered women while shining a light on power dynamics in workplaces from Hollywood Boulevard to Main Street.

Opening statements and the first witness testimony are expected Wednesday in Weinstein’s New York City rape trial, where the possibility of life in prison looms for the once-celebrated Pulp Fiction producer now vilified as a predator by scores of women.

Weinstein’s accusers include some well-known actresses who plan to testify or attend the trial and others who are looking to the New York case for a form of justice because their allegations haven’t resulted in criminal charges.

""This trial is so important because the enormity of Harvey Weinstein’s international power and fame offers an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the rampant abuse of power that permeates our culture on a global level,” actress Jessica Barth said Tuesday.

""Not only the outcome of this trial, but the trial as a whole, is precedent setting,” said Barth, a star of the Ted films who says Weinstein once invited her to his hotel suite and demanded a naked massage.

Weinstein’s trial could take more than a month, Judge James Burke said. Judging from an arduous two-week jury selection that netted a panel of seven men and five women, it could be a hotbed of protests and intense media coverage.

Extra court officers have been lining the front of the Manhattan courthouse where Weinstein, 67, has been ambling in and out with a walker that his lawyers say was necessitated by a summer car crash and subsequent back surgery.

In a failed last-minute push to get the trial moved, Weinstein’s lawyers said a flash mob’s chanting, “The rapist is you!” at street level could be heard in the courtroom, 15 floors above.

Adding to the drama, actor Cuba Gooding Jr. is due at the same courthouse Wednesday for a hearing in a case in which several women have accused him of groping. He’s denied all allegations of wrongdoing.

Though dozens of women have accused Weinstein of sexually harassing or assaulting them over the years, his New York trial involves just a pair of allegations- that he raped a woman in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and sexually assaulted a different woman in 2006.

Backed by expected testimony from four other accusers, prosecutors will attempt to portray Weinstein as a monster who used his power to ingratiate himself with women, sometimes promising a film role or other career advancement, before sexually assaulting or raping them.

One of them, actress Annabella Sciorra will testify that Weinstein forced himself inside her Manhattan apartment and raped her in 1993 or 1994 after she starred in a film for his movie studio.

While Sciorra’s allegations are outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges, the judge has said her testimony can be used to prove predatory sexual assault charges, which carries a maximum life sentence and requires prosecutors to show a pattern of misconduct.

Weinstein’s lawyers say any encounters were consensual. They plan to go on the offensive, pointing to “dozens and dozens and dozens of loving emails to Mr. Weinstein” they say show he and some of his accusers were in consenting relationships. Defense lawyer Damon Cheronis said some of the women “also bragged about being in a sexual relationship with him.”

Once trailed by whispers in Hollywood circles, Weinstein was met with an explosion of allegations from dozens of women after The New York Times and The New Yorker published separate exposes about his behavior in October 2017.

After opening statements, prosecutors are expected to call a former member of the board of directors at Weinstein’s old movie studio to testify about how the company handled allegations against him.

One issue that has remained unresolved in the trial is the defense’s objection to a juror who wrote an upcoming novel about young women that includes, according to the book’s publicity materials, descriptions of their relationships with predatory older men. If she is removed and replaced as a juror, that’ll leave just two remaining alternates for the trial.

Once the New York trial is over, Weinstein faces additional rape and sexual assault charges in Los Angeles. Those charges were filed this month as jury selection in his New York trial was getting underway.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/r5qvt0/article30625310.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SEXUALMISCONDUCTHARVEYWEINSTEIN,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/after-metoo-harvey-weinsteins-trial-set-to-open-in-new-york/article30625311.ece
161,2020/01/22,‘Once Upon a Time in Hollywood’ to re-release in India on February 14,"Quentin Tarantino’s critically-acclaimed feature Once Upon a Time in Hollywood will be re-releasing in India on February 14, the studio Sony Pictures Entertainment India announced on Wednesday.

Written and directed by Tarantino, the film earlier released in the country on Independence Day last year.

The movie, led by Hollywood superstars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, is based on the murder of actor Sharon Tate and three others at the hands of the Manson Family cult.

It features DiCaprio, 45, as Rick Dalton, an ageing, out-of-work actor, with Pitt, 56, playing his longtime stunt double named Cliff Booth. The two characters happen to be the neighbours of Tate, essayed by Margot Robbie in the film.

The film also stars Al Pacino, Kurt Russell, Dakota Fanning, Margaret Qualley, Damian Lewis, Bruce Dern, Emile Hirsch and the late Luke Perry in pivotal roles.

162,2020/01/22,Netflix holds its own in streaming wars against Apple and Disney’s new services,"Netflix is holding its ground in the streaming wars, passing its first big test since Apple and Disney launched rival services.

The company added 8.8 million worldwide subscribers during its fourth quarter, surpassing expectations at a time when it faces heated competition.

Netflix had said it expected to add 7.6 million subscribers, and analysts thought the service would fare even better. The increase pales slightly next to the 8.9 million subscribers the service added in the fourth quarter of 2018.

The stock dropped about 2.5% immediately in after-hours trading, likely due to a cautious forecast for the first quarter. But shares rebounded and later traded up more than 2%.

The company —a pioneer in producing streaming media and binge-worthy shows — now boasts more than 167 million subscribers worldwide, bolstered by a list of well-received movies and shows released late last year. That includes the fantasy show The Witcher and Oscar nominees The Irishman and Marriage Story.

The boost helps reaffirm Netflix’s strong standing in the increasingly crowded world of video streaming. The fourth quarter was an important milestone for Netflix, as it was marked its first head-to-head competition with Apple’s $5-per-month streaming service and Disney’s instantly popular $7-a-month option.

Still, it’s unlikely to be a smooth road for Netflix. NBC, HBO and startup Quibi are all planning to launch new streaming services soon.

Two big questions loom: How much are consumers willing to pay for each video streaming option? And how many will they pay for before reaching subscription fatigue?

Netflix CEO Reed Hastings acknowledged the increased competition in a call following earnings, but said he believes the services are mostly capturing new viewers who are transitioning from traditional TV watching.

“It takes away a little bit from us,” he said of the Disney Plus launch. “But again, most of the growth in the future is coming out of linear TV.”

Netflix has one major advantage over competitors- it has been collecting data on the shows viewers crave for years.

""Netflix’s scale allows it to reach mass audiences, which makes it easier for them to create hits when compared to newcomers to the market,” EMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom said.

Netflix’s most popular plan costs $13 a month, far more than competitors from Disney, Apple and Quibi. But its price is comparable to HBO Now, and it boasts one of the largest libraries of TV shows and movies, not to mention regularly updated original shows.

It’s also less controversial to avoid digital advertising and the scrutiny around companies making customers’ personal information that comes with it, he said.

In its quarterly letter to shareholders, Netflix included a chart of Google search trends that showed people searching more often for The Witcher than for competing shows including The Mandalorian, The Morning Show and Jack Ryan, from Disney, Apple and Amazon, respectively.

In the U.S., Netflix added 420,000 subscribers, below its own estimates. Growth in its home country has been slowing in the last year, partly because most people in the U.S. who want Netflix already subscribe.

The company reported profit of $587 million on revenue of $5.47 billion, exceeding expectations.

Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers during the first three months of this year, well below the 9.6 million subscribers it added in the first quarter last year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6tviac/article30624697.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NETFLIX-RESULTS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-holds-its-own-in-streaming-wars-against-apple-and-disneys-new-services/article30624698.ece
163,2020/01/22,"In China, people are fighting the coronavirus outbreak by watching disaster movie ‘The Flu’","Threatened by a new virus outbreak, many Chinese have been turning to an online plague simulation game and a disaster movie called The Flu as part of coping mechanisms.

The new flu-like coronavirus has killed nine people and infected more than 400 in an outbreak originating from the central city of Wuhan, spreading fear of contagion globally and rattling financial markets.

Plague Inc., a strategy simulation app by UK-based Ndemic creations, was by Wednesday the top-paid game on the iOS operating system on China’s Apple Store. It allows users to create and evolve a pathogen to destroy the world.

“The best way to conquer fear is to confront fear,” said one commentator on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.

“Isn’t this actually joining the evil force if you cannot beat the evil force?” joked another.

South Korean disaster flick The Flu was the most searched-for movie on Chinese media review and social networking site Douban on Wednesday. A documentary on the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak topped TV searches.

Furthermore, 11 out of 14 top-ranked articles on content platform Toutiao were related to pneumonia, as were over half of the 50 most-read topics on China’s Twitter-like Weibo.

The virus outbreak has coincided with China’s Lunar New Year celebrations this weekend when millions travel at home and abroad for holidays and family reunions.

But the usual bonanza for the tourism and consumer industries may be hit as some people were cancelling trips and avoiding public areas like cinemas and shopping centres.

Blockbuster movies set to premiere over the holiday have seen sales momentum waning. In Wuhan, moviegoers who had pre-paid were offered refunds, according to ticket-booking platforms Maoyan and Taopiaopiao.

“It’s understandable the virus could prevent people from coming to cinemas,” lamented one manager at a Beijing cinema, who asked not to be named.

164,2020/01/22,Udhayanidhi Stalin on his ‘feud’ with Rajinikanth and Mysskin’s ‘Psycho’,"If Tamil cinema opts to reflect contemporary politics on the big screen, as it so often does, then Udhayanidhi Stalin is, perhaps, the best candidate to play Rajinikanth’s villain in whatever film the latter chooses to work next.

Such has been the nature of his tweets — and he writes them with a certain slyness and wit characteristic of the lineage he belongs to — that makes it next to impossible for him to not expect questions about his supposed political ‘feud’ with Rajinikanth, when he meets a group of cinema writers ahead of this Friday’s release, Psycho (a film directed by Mysskin that stars Udhayanidhi in the lead).

“How do you know that my tweets are about [Rajini]?” he asks.

To which, he is asked, in return, if he will be contesting in next year’s State assembly elections, and whether he would prefer running against Rajinikanth (the actor has announced his intent to form a political party). For once, he does not deflect.

“First let’s see if he enters politics,” he says.

When another query about the Thuglak-Murasoli controversy is brought up, Udhayanidhi leans back on a swivel chair in the visitors’ conference room at MK Stalin’s Chittaranjan Road house and remarks, “He just gave publicity for Murasoli and Thuglak. That is all there is to it...”, before laughing.

Then, he adds: “Let’s talk about Psycho too.”

Learning by method

Udhayanidhi’s association with Mysskin stretches back more than a decade.

“I’ve watched all his films but he has not watched a single film of mine. He ensures to keep reminding me of that as well,” he laughs.

The actor-producer was to have made his debut in Mysskin’s film Yuddham Sei (2011), which was eventually finished with Cheran in the lead after he dropped out. Udhayanidhi later made his acting debut with M Rajesh’s Oru Kal Oru Kannadi (2012).

“It was my decision. I did not want to do a dark film on debut. Later, when I watched Yuddham Sei, I felt bad. It was such a brilliant film, and I felt that I had missed out on a glorious opportunity,” he says.

In Psycho, Udhayanidhi plays a visually-challenged music conductor named Gautham.

“I loved the character,” he says, adding that he spent a few days with a visually-challenged person to observe their mannerisms and communication style in a bid to help him prepare for the role.

Future projects Udhayanidhi Stalin is already working a film directed by Mu Maran of Iravukku Aayiram Kangal fame. Titled, Kannai Nambathey, the film has an ensemble cast including Prasanna, Aathmika, Sathish, and the Roja Koottam pair of Srikanth and Bhoomika. “The shoot is 60 per cent complete. I think there is about 20 days of filming left,” says Udhayanidhi. The actor has also signed up Magizh Thirumeni of Thadam fame for another project, a film that will be produced under his banner Red Giant Movies.

But nothing would have readied him for what Mysskin had in store for him.

Udhayanidhi, inspired by Ayushmann Khurrana in Andhadhun, says he had bought a pair of special lenses — the kind that would bleach one’s vision.

“You won’t be able to see a thing. I asked my wife to shoot a video of me touching and feeling my way around the house with the lens on, and then I sent the video to Mysskin. He saw it and said, ‘Kannamma, super! But we don’t need to do all this. We just need a [black] sunglass,” he laughs.

Still, Udhayanidhi says, he went against the filmmaker’s wishes, and used the lens while shooting, much to the latter’s annoyance.

“He asked me why I was doing needless things, but I reasoned with him that it would add that bit of realism to my portrayal. I told him that it would feel nice if I brought that aspect to my acting,” Udhayanidhi says.

Perfecting tactics

Disputes can be commonplace when working on a Mysskin project, considering the “perfectionist” he is.

Like when he banished all of his assistant directors from the film set for a day when the crew was shooting in Coimbatore.

“He was angry. The poor assistants were calling us from two streets away to ask if he had calmed down enough to come back,” he laughs.

“From my hair style and costume to determining what type of glass I should wear and what stick I should be holding, everything was decided by him. He is someone who gets what he wants. I was told that the ‘Unna Nenachu’ song was the 27th tune that Ilaiyaraaja had composed,” he adds.

Psycho promises to be a performance-heavy affair for not just Udhayanidhi but also for names like Aditi Rao Hydari, Nithya Menen and Raj Kumar (who plays the ‘psycho’ character in the film).

“Raj will go places after this. He has acted really well. At the end of the film, you will feel confused as to who the real hero is,” says Udhayanidhi.

He waxes lyrical about Nithya, who plays a character named Kamala Das.

“She is a bundle of energy. In fact, Mysskin offered her both the lead female roles in the film, and she chose to play Das. It is a very challenging character, and I don’t think I have seen a similar role in recent times in Tamil cinema. Kamala Das cusses a lot but there is a reason for it. She is always angry in the film,” he says, adding, “Though Aditi is my love interest, I had only two days of shoot with her. After watching the film, I realised that she has struggled a lot physically to play her character.”

It’s just business!

Despite the rawness in its depiction of violence and use of abusive words in dialogues, Udhayanidhi says that the Film Certification Board only demanded four mutes in Psycho.

“I don’t think they wanted any visuals to be cut but, of course, it is an A-certificate film. It is certainly not a film for children,” he says.

The topic is gently steered back towards Rajinikanth by a few diligent members of the questioning group.

The Superstar is acting in a film produced by Sun Pictures directed by Siva. The last Sun Pictures production that featured Rajini was Petta, a film whose Tamil Nadu theatrical distribution rights was snapped up by Red Giant Movies (Udhayanidhi’s film production and distribution firm).

Will the current political situation make it any different for when this next Rajini film is up for release?

“Why should it be any different? If Sun Pictures are producing, obviously, I will distribute it. If he (Rajinikanth) has no problem with it, then why will I have a problem?” Udhayanidhi concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7zyls6/article30624056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Udhay-Stalin-36,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/udhayanidhi-stalin-on-his-feud-with-rajinikanth-and-mysskins-psycho/article30624057.ece
165,2020/01/22,‘Baywatch’ star Pamela Anderson marries for the fifth time,"Actor-model Pamela Anderson and movie mogul Jon Peters have tied the knot in a private ceremony.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the couple, who dated over 30 years ago, exchanged vows in Malibu on January 20.

Anderson, 52, and Peters, 74, reunited in recent months and kept the relationship under wraps.

Peters, a producer on Barbra Streisand’s 1976 version of A Star Is Born and the 2018 remake and other films including Batman (1989) and Superman Returns (2006), said Anderson inspired him.

“Pamela has never seen her full potential as an artist. She has yet to shine in a real way. There is much more to her than meets the eye, or I wouldn’t love her so much. “There are beautiful girls everywhere. I could have my pick, but — for 35 years — I’ve only wanted Pamela. She makes me wild -- in a good way. She inspires me. I protect her and treat her the way she deserves to be treated,” the producer told the outlet.

Baywatch alum Anderson talked about Peters in the form of a poem.

“Jon is the original ‘bad boy’ of Hollywood — no one compares —I love him deeply like family. His life used to scare me. So much for a girl like me. Now I’ve seen more of life and realise..”

“He’s been there all along. Never failed me — I’m ready now and he’s ready too — We understand and respect each other - We love each other without conditions. I’m a lucky woman. Proof God has a plan,” she said in a statement.

This is a fifth marriage for both.

Anderson’s former husbands include rocker Tommy Lee and rapper Kid Rock. Peters’ ex wives include actor Lesley Ann Warren, producer Christine Forsyth-Peters and he was once in 12-year relationship with Streisand.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dla27b/article30624024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PEOPLEPAMELAANDERSONJONPETERS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/baywatch-star-pamela-anderson-marries-for-the-fifth-time/article30624025.ece

Titled Naarappa, the movie stars Venkatesh in the lead role, is directed by Sreekanth Addala (of Kotha Bangaru Lokam fame) and produced by D Suresh Babu and Kalaippuli S Thanu. The shooting is currently underway. Cinematographer Shyam K Naidu has also come on board, while Mani Sharma is the composer.

The female lead for the film, which was played by Manju Warrier in the Tamil original, has not been finalised yet.

168,2020/01/22,Prathama Prasad in 'Amnoru': Goddess of the Kannada small screen,"It was natural for Prathama Prasad to travel around the world as a classical dancer. Trained in Kathak under the tutelage of the legendary Maya Rao, Prathama took to the stage as a fish to water. But, as the daughter of veteran actor Vinay Prakash, Prathama also was interested in films.

And she was not just looking to play lead roles. She took on any role that did not keep her away from her first love — dance.

Prathama has acted in the film MMCH, directed by Mussanje Mahesh, besides being a part of a few serials — mostly mythological. Now Prathama is back in action, again as a goddess for the new series titled Amnoru. She plays the titular role, which is being aired on Udaya TV from January 20.

Prathama had played goddesses in serials Devi and Mahadevi. And, she recently finished shooting for the film Chowkabara, which she says is almost ready for release. “I play the heroine’s sister and am paired with Madhu Hegde, who is a popular actor on the small screen.”

After MMCH, she says, “my biggest project was the serial Brahmagantu. It gave me a huge platform and exposure. In fact, even today, I am known by the name of the character I played in it — Puttatte.

Coming back to Amnoru , Prathama laughs, “I think I am tagged to be the goddess of the small screen. Even in the popular series Bili Hendathi, I played a deity for a couple of special episodes that were telecast during Dasara. I take it as a blessing as I am a very spiritual person in life too. But I am also open to exploring other roles too.”

Prathama credits her mother, who she calls as her “friend and guide”. She says, “She has been very supportive of my career.”

Prathama’s passion for dancing continues. She was ranked second in Vidwath in Kathak, conducted by the Karnataka Secondary Board of Education.

She says she will always find a balance between acting and dancing.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/43jqvm/article30622757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22bgmprathamajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/prathama-prasad-in-amnoru-goddess-of-the-kannada-small-screen/article30622759.ece
169,2020/01/22,Actor-director Ramesh Aravind plays a cop — in three Kannada films this year!,"This year looks exciting for Ramesh Aravind. His crime thriller, Shivaji Suratkal, is slotted for a Shivarathri release.

The actor, who has demonstrated his prowess and versatility as a multi-lingual actor, director and a TV host, will now be seen as a cop in this film. This will be the third film where he plays a cop this year, after 100 and Bhairadevi.

The actor has got a maker over for Shivaji Suratkal, which is set to release on February 21. The actor will be seen on screen after a two-year hiatus. His last film Pushpaka Vimana was released in 2017. Shivaji Suratkal will be the actor’s 101st film in his 34-year career in the film industry. 100 will be the first film where Ramesh is involved in an action sequence. Till now Ramesh has always battled adversaries mentally. “There was no need to compose fights so far,” smiles Ramesh.

In 100, a story of cyber crime, Ramesh’s fight sequences were composed by stunt master, Ravi Varma. “I shed my Tyagaraja image,” says Ramesh. “100 has given me the confidence to meet the expectation of an action director.”

About playing a cop in three films this year Ramesh says, “I don’t mind playing a policeman as long as the role comes with variety. In Bhairadevi I play a regular cop, in Shivaji Suratkal I am a detective and in 100, I am an expert in cyber crimes.”

Ramesh says he spent a lot of time with cyber cops to study their body language and their working style, which he adds he imbibed to build his character. “In this digital age, we read about various instances of people getting cheated on online. What happens when a cybercrime affects a police officer’s home forms the crux of 100. It deals the issue of cyber stalking.”

Ramesh says Shivaji Suratkal is a murder mystery. The film is directed by Akash Srivatsa. Ramesh dons two looks in the film — one clean shaven and the other with a beard as the story travels in two timelines. The Central Board of Film Certification cleared Shivaji Suratkal with a U/A certificate, which sees Ramesh set off to solve the case of Ranagiri Rahasya (mystery of Ranagiri).

170,2020/01/22,"After ‘Darbar’ and ‘Pattas’, Kollywood is looking at festival films","After many weeks, happy times are back for the Tamil film industry. Footfalls across theatres in Tamil Nadu during the Pongal holiday weekend were up and encouraging. Rajinikanth’s Darbar has done well and his son-in-law Dhanush’s Pattas did decent business at the Tamil Nadu box-office. Both films got mixed reviews from critics and fans, but enjoyed a dream run during the five-day Pongal holiday weekend. However, the hard-to-please trade was unhappy that the first week gross of both films combined would not be anywhere near last year’s Pongal winners: Ajith’s Viswasam and Rajinikanth’s Petta.

Is Tamil cinema business largely becoming festival centric? The popular Chennai single-screen Kasi Theatre MD Subramaniam says, “To a large extent, business booms during the festival season, which brings the fans of big stars and family audiences in droves across Tamil Nadu. Last Pongal, Rajini sir’s Petta and Ajith sir’s Viswasam released on the same day and both films went on to become big hits as the content clicked with audiences. This year, however, the content of both Pongal films have not lived up to expectations, but footfalls were very good when you compare with December 2019.” Theatre booking app Book My Show created history all over India, when it sold 2.1 million movie tickets for a single day (January 12) for various new releases in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil.

Summer special

A leading producer feels ‘festival holiday’ releases work best when two strong big-hero films openly clash and release on the same day like the Viswasam versus Petta battle of 2019. This year, there was a gap of six days between Darbar and Pattas release and at no point were they pitched against each other. The overseas and rest of India box-office were taken by two big Telugu releases: Mahesh Babu’s Sarileru Neekevvaru and Allu Arjun’s Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. Fans of both the actors went berserk on social media as the two films turned out to be winners.

Theatre owners across Tamil Nadu are not very kicked about February and March, when 25-plus films are slated for release. There is a feeling that fans and family audiences come out in large numbers only during festival times. Small films, irrespective of good WOM (word-of-mouth), get only very small screens and limited shows, and their share from net revenue gets decreased every week as share of theatre increases.

Now, all eyes are on the Tamil New Year and summer of 2020 releases, especially in the month of April and May. Vijay’s Master has announced its release on April 9, for the Easter-Tamil New Year-Vishu weekend, and all areas have been sold out. The buzz is that Suriya’s Soorarai Pottru may be pitched against Master or release a week later. On May 1, Karthi’s Sultan will clash with Jayam Ravi’s Bhoomi, while for the Eid weekend on May 22, Vikram’s Cobra is the front runner. Sivakarthikeyan’s Doctor and Dhanush’s untitled with Karthik Subbaraj are also summer releases.

Changing times

Bala Subramaniyam, leading exhibitor and distributor of Baba Cinemas, Coimbatore, says, “Big changes are happening in the industry. Today, a film with a popular star, good content and festival dates is the best combination. The ancillary industry of online booking via booking apps, canteen sales, theatre advertisements and parking also depends on footfalls and how well the star-driven content works. My Pongal 2020 canteen sales were only 70% of 2019 Pongal sales! I’m looking forward now to summer releases to revive the box-office.”

The industry blames ‘poor content’ and the favourite whipping boy ‘OTT platforms’ for this situation. Subramaniyam explains, “Even before the opening credits roll, audiences are keenly watching as to which OTT platform has acquired the rights of the film. If the content does not live up to expectation, those who watch early shows tell their friends to wait and watch it on OTT platforms. In the good old days, every big film was shown on satellite television channels only after a year! We should embrace technology and move with the times, but I think Tamil cinema should have a healthy 100 days or a minimum of 60 days between theatrical and OTT release window.”

Kollywood’s best bet now seems to be gearing up for ‘big festival releases’. The 2020 release slate clearly indicates clash of titans during all major festivals this year. Will history repeat itself this year with a possible Ajith (Valimai) versus Rajinikanth (Siva-directed untitled flick) clash for Deepavali 2020? We’ll know soon.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/r7f6qj/article30622502.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/collage1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/all-eyes-on-festival-films/article30622503.ece
171,2020/01/22,"Man must give way to the elephant, says Supreme Court","Noting that “the elephant is a gentleman and man should give way for the elephant”, the Supreme Court on Wednesday indicated that it will uphold the Tamil Nadu Government Order that notified the Nilgiris Elephant Corridor in 2010.

‘Big but fragile’

“Elephants are big, powerful but fragile. We are dealing with a fragile eco-system. Look at the money involved in poaching. See the rampant poaching of rhinos in Assam… Man must give way to the elephant. We are not gong to allow anyone to come in the path of the elephant,” Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde said.

The court is hearing on a report filed by its amicus curiae A. D. N. Rao to seal or demolish over 800 buildings, except tribal houses, within the areas marked as an elephant corridor by the Tamil Nadu government, represented by advocate Yogesh Kanna, situated in the Masinagudi area near the Mudumalai National Park (close to the Serugu plateau) in the Nilgiris. The area falls on the way from Ooty to Mysore.

The court, reserving its orders, said it would not take any decision on individual cases of sealing or demolition. Chief Justice Bobde orally said that the court would appoint a committee led by a retired High Court judge to hear and decide the individual grievances of those affected by the government notification under the Tamil Nadu Preservation of Private Forest (TNPPF) Act, 1949.

Illegal resorts

When some of the resort owners in the area said that elephant and man do co-exist, Chief Justice Bobde wryly replied, “It is because the elephant is a gentleman… Why do you have to go inside the forest?”

Mr. Rao, in his report, had urged the court to uphold the validity of the State Government Order of 2010 and dismiss the Special Leave Petitions filed against a plan of action report prepared by the Nilgiris District Collector on illegal resorts within the protected area.

The court is hearing a 1996 Public Interest Litigation filed by A. Rangarajan, wherein directions were issued that no construction would be allowed in elephant corridors, as mentioned in the Elephant Task Force titled ‘Gajah’. The elephant corridor in the Nilgiris is 22.64 km long and 1.5 km wide.

173,2020/01/22,"Don’t fall prey to sectarian forces, TNCC president advises actor Rajinikanth","Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri slammed actor Rajinikanth for his comments on Periyar during the Thuglak event and questioned why the actor was selectively quoting from the past.

In a statement, Mr. Alagiri condemned the actor’s statement on Periyar and said Periyar had fought for social justice in a society that had oppressed sections of people for thousands of years.

“While Mr. Rajinikanth quoted the 1971 rally in his speech, why did he not speak about the black cover page that Cho printed after the Babri Masjid was demolished and had severely criticised the demolition? Why did he not speak about the Thuglaq issue brought out in 1996 where Cho had detailed the role of Rajinikanth and Cho himself in bringing about the formation of the DMK-Tamil Maanila Congress alliance to dislodge the Jayalalithaa regime?” Mr. Alagiri asked.

Mr. Alagiri asked why Mr. Rajinikanth chose not to speak about these two issues and mentioned only the 1971 rally in his speech at the Thuglak event. “What is the sectarian political agenda behind this? Will Mr. Rajinikanth explain?” the TNCC president questioned.

In his speech, Mr. Rajinikanth had said that Periyar held an anti-superstition rally in Salem in 1971 in which naked pictures of Lord Ram and Sita were paraded in public and garlanded with slippers.

Referring to the actor’s statement on Tuesday refuting allegations that he had spoken about something that had not happened and that the rally must be forgotten but not denied, Mr. Alagiri asked why the actor was referring to just one issue.

Mr. Alagiri said the Congress still had high regard for the actor but ended with the plea: “Kindly do not fall prey to sectarian forces.

The minimum demand during the summer months last year, was around 14,500 MW. That minimum demand is likely to increase during the summer months this year. The peak demand reached last year was in the range of 15,150 MW to 16,150 MW, Tangedco said in its petition. It also said the total availability of power from various source is 13,135 MW for the period from February 2020 to May 2020.

“As public exams for schools / colleges are scheduled during the summer period, availability of power is to be ensured for the benefit of public. It is estimated that deficit will be in the range of 300 MW to 1000 MW during February 2020 to May 2020. Hence, additional power is to be procured to meet minimum demand during summer months,” Tangedco said.

The morning peak and evening peak demand will be met through hydro sources to an extent of 900 MW. Wind generation during the above period is likely to be available around 500 MW. Based on day ahead forecast of demand and wind generation, additional peak requirement will be managed through power procurement from exchanges, it added.

Last year, an all-time high demand 16,151 MW was met on April 12 and an all-time high consumption of 369.940 MU was met on April 3.

The TNERC also gave its nod for deviations from the Ministry of Power guidelines for processing short-term tenders for the power procurement.

Ramaswamy alias Thanthai Periyar.

Claiming that the speech amounted to insulting Dravidian ideologists, the petitioner said, it would squarely attract the penal provisions relating to breach of public peace by promoting hatred and enmity between different groups. He also accused the actor of having made such statements to score political mileage and to appease one section of the society.

However, the police did not choose to register a FIR despite making out of cognisable offence, he alleged.

176,2020/01/22,SC asks T.N. to file report on status of Perarivalan’s plea,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the Tamil Nadu government to file a report on the status of a plea for pardon filed by Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict, A.G. Perarivalan, before the State Governor.

The order from a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao came after the court found that not much progress has been made by the CBI in its probe into whether the assassination was the culmination of a “larger conspiracy”.

Justice Rao remarked to Additional Solicitor General Pinky Anand that the report on the status of the investigation submitted in the court merely makes vague allusions to enquiries abroad in places like London, Hong Kong, etc. It has no specifics.

Turning then to Perarivalan’s lawyers, senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan and advocate Prabu Ramasubramanium, the Bench asked what relief did they really want from the apex court. Mr. Sankaranarayanan pointed out that his client has been in prison for nearly three decades. They drew the court’s attention to a short order passed by the Supreme Court on September 6, 2018.

The two-paragraph order referred to the application filed by Perarivalan under Article 161 (power of the Governor to grant pardons, etc, and to suspend, remit or commute prison sentences in certain cases) of the Constitution before the Governor of Tamil Nadu.

The court had observed in the 2018 order that “the authority concerned will be at liberty to decide the application as deemed fit”. On hearing about this order, the court, on Tuesday, ordered the State government to enquire and report back to the court in two weeks.

Perarivalan, who is in mid-forties, has spent about a quarter of a century inside jail serving his life imprisonment. He was 19 years old at the time of his arrest. Perarivalan had sought an order from the court to stay his life sentence till the MDMA probe into the larger conspiracy is completed.

He contended his role in the alleged crime, stretched to the maximum, would be that of supplying two nine-volt batteries without the knowledge of what it was going to be used for.

DMK president M.K. Stalin on Tuesday said that the actor must watch what he speaks about Tamil leaders. “Rajinikanth is not a politician. He is just an actor. Thanthai Periyar fought for the Tamil people for 95 years. Rajinikanth should be mindful of what he says about him,” said M.K. Stalin.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said that comments against leaders who are not alive should not be allowed in the society. “I condemn his statement. Rajinikanth shouldn’t rake up old issues and create controversies,” he said. Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani said that Rajinikanth has said something that was ‘false’. “In his eagerness to praise Thuglak editor Cho, Rajinikanth has spoken about something that Cho didn’t write about in Thuglak and Thuglak didn’t publish. Who is making him speak like this?” asked K. Veeramani.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi Chief Thirumavalavan on Tuesday urged Rajinikanth to fully know the facts before speaking about Periyar. “What Rajinikanth spoke about Periyar was false. This is why we asked him to apologise. We are not forcing him to do it. We hoped that he would apologise. We hope that once he realises that he was wrong, he would come forward to apologise,” said Mr. Thirumavalavan. He said that Rajinikanth has fallen into the trap of Sangh Parivar forces.

Thuglak’s editor and a close associate of Rajinikanth, S. Gurumurthy, on Tuesday posted on social media that the actor’s comments are a reflection of his ‘Spiritual Politics’. BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said that he was on the side of Rajinikanth on this issue.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajini-must-watch-what-he-says-about-periyar/article30619789.ece
178,2020/01/22,"State to sign MoUs in a month for ₹52,000 cr. investment","The State government, which formally cleared five proposals of industrial projects of over ₹52,000 crore at the Cabinet meeting on Monday, is planning to have the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) signed in a month.

Among the projects are an oil refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Thoothukudi at a cost of ₹49,000 crore; a ₹1,900-crore facility in Sriperumpudur to produce electronic hardware and another unit in Oragadam, near Chennai, to manufacture mobile phone and components, at a cost of around ₹600 crore.

Apart from permitting the increase in the size of investment by ₹100 crore for a bio-diesel producer, the Cabinet has approved a ₹504-crore project by Mitsuba Sical, a Japanese manufacturer of auto components in Gummidipoondi, on the northern outskirts of the city.

The refinery-cum-petrochemical complex project, promoted by Al Kharafi Group of Kuwait, is expected to come up in nine years.

The government hopes that if this project comes up, this will transform the southern region as a whole, because of its enormous potential for employment generation and industrialisation.

Talking of a similar project in Dahej, Gujarat, an official of the government says that it is estimated to have facilitated 1.6 lakh jobs.

As far as the assurance given by the Thoothukudi project promoter, around 5,000 jobs will be generated directly. While the cost of the proposed refinery will be ₹35,000 crore, the petrochemical complex will cost ₹14,000 crore.

The Sriperumpudur facility is going to be implemented by Wintech, regarded as one of the largest manufacturers of mobile phone instruments. This will become the main unit of the company, which has a unit in Tirupati.

As for the Oragadam unit, it will be a project of BYD, which is also a key player in the production of electric vehicles in China.

Asked about the proposed visit of Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to China as part of the State government’s efforts to woo industrial projects, a top official says that this may take place in the middle of the year, even though dates have not yet been finalised.

Speaking to reporters in Tiruchi, he maintained that there was absolutely no strain in the alliance between the parties. TNCC president K.S. Alagiri had recently met DMK president M.K. Stalin and the meeting had reaffirmed the alliance. Both parties would continue to work for the betterment of the people. The alliance would face the next State Assembly polls together to unseat the AIADMK from power.

Terming the AIADMK government a puppet of the BJP government at the Centre, Mr. Dutt said that it was unfortunate that the State government had been acting as per the whims and fancies of the Centre. The AIADMK government had largely become unpopular and the outcome of the recent rural local body polls had clearly established its unpopularity.

180,2020/01/22,Police get 10 days’ custody of SSI murder accused,"The Principal Sessions Court here on Tuesday granted 10 days’ police custody of the two accused arrested in connection with the gunning down of Special Sub-Inspector of Police Wilson at Kaliyakkavilai on Kerala border on January 8.

Principal Sessions Judge Arul Murugan, who adjourned the case on Monday even as the police were seeking 28 days custody, granted 10 days of police custody on Tuesday.

He also asked the police to produce Abdul Shameem of Thiruvithancode and Thoufiq of Ilankadai in Kottar in Nagercoil on January 31 at 4 p.m. before him at the end of the custody period.

Though the police had sought 28 days of custody for interrogation of the two pertaining to the murder of Wilson even as he was on duty at the check-post near Kaliyakkavilai market on January 8 around 10.30 p.m., they were given 10 days.

Murder weapons

Since the police are yet to recover the gun and the knife used to murder the police officer, the information to be extracted from the accused may lead to the seizure of the weapons, sources said.

Moreover, the custodial interrogation may also throw more light on the conspiracy that may transcend the boundaries of various States since the police believe that the accused had attended the meetings organised in various destinations that include Vickramasingapuram in Tirunelveli district to Mumbai.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7j35v4/article30619723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THTHOUFEEQCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/police-get-10-days-custody-of-ssi-murder-accused/article30619724.ece
181,2020/01/22,"HC stays hearing in tax evasion case against Karti, wife","The Madras High Court on Tuesday stayed all further proceedings in an alleged tax evasion case prosecuted by the Income Tax department against Sivaganga Member of Parliament Karti P. Chidambaram and his wife Srinidhi Karti Chidambaram before a special court for hearing cases booked against legislators.

Justice M. Sundar granted the interim stay till January 27 when he would take up for final hearing a couple of petitions filed by the MP and his wife in August last questioning the jurisdiction of the special court to conduct trial and also two other petitions filed recently to quash the entire I-T proceedings.

The case against the petitioners dates back to March 2015 when they had sold their 1.16 acre property at Muttukadu to Agni Estates and Foundations Private Limited. The charge was that the couple disclosed only payments received through cheques as sale consideration and did not disclose the cash receipts.

Initially, the I-T department had initiated prosecution before an Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate court, designated to hear cases related to economic offences, at Egmore here. However, after Mr. Karti Chidambaram became a MP in May 2019, the High Court Registry transferred the case to the special court for legislators.

Challenging such transfer, the petitioners claimed that it was impermissible in law to transfer a case from a Magistrate court to a Court of Sessions. They also contended that since the alleged offence had taken place in 2015 and the first petitioner had become a legislator only in 2019, there was no necessity to transfer the case.

In their quash petitions, the couple pointed out that the statutory time limit for the I-T department to pass a reassessment order for the year 2014-15 had expired on December 31, 2019. “Thus in the absence of the reassessment order, the allegation that the original return filed on July 29, 2014 is a false return is not correct and hence no offence is attracted,” they claimed.

Before fixing a date for final hearing of all the four cases, Justice Sundar told the lawyers representing all parties in the case that he had appeared as a counsel for Agni Estates and Foundations Private Limited in a totally different case during his stint as an advocate. Therefore, he wanted to know whether any one had objection to him hearing the present petitions.

All the lawyers in unison expressed no objection. After recording their submission, the judge proceeded to fix January 27 as the date of final hearing. In the meantime, when he was apprised that the special court was about to frame charges against the petitioners, he said, it would not be appropriate do so pending adjudication of the present petitions. Since the jurisdiction of the special court itself had been questioned by the petitioners, it would be advisable for that court to put on hold all further proceedings until further orders from the High Court, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/4t39hi/article30619702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THKARTI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-stays-hearing-in-tax-evasion-case-against-karti-wife/article30619703.ece

However, recital of mantras in Tamil alone was not possible.

The submission was made during the hearing of a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to use Tamil mantras alone and not Sanskrit ones during the consecration ceremony of the Big Temple scheduled to take place on February 5.

In his petition, advocate G. Thirumurugan of Ramanathapuram said that the temple pujas and rituals must be conducted in Tamil alone.

As the petitioner failed to add the temple management as one of the respondents, a Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T.

183,2020/01/22,"Despite closure, illegal resorts still operating in notified elephant corridor","Despite the closure of 39 resorts “illegally operating” in the notified elephant corridor in the buffer zone of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR), a few of them continue to function surreptitiously. This is notwithstanding efforts of the District Administration to crackdown on the resorts.

Of the 39 resorts against which action was taken in 2018, The Hindu contacted seven establishments, of which three agreed to bookings in their properties. A fourth resort claimed to be running another property outside the elephant corridor, while three others said that they were temporarily closed and would be functional in March and April during “peak tourist season.” A resort in Bokkapuram, said that they were accepting bookings only through “trusted sources.”

“Due to the elephant corridor case, which resulted in resorts around Bokkapuram being closed down, we have only limited rooms on our property which we rent out to guests,” said the resort manager. The only means of booking rooms were through the recommendations of the owners of the resort. “We are working in a legally grey area, and we send guests an account number to which they can directly transfer funds,” he added.

Two other resorts said that their original buildings had been closed down, but they let visitors stay in the buildings that have been allowed to function.

Nilgiris Collector J. Innocent Divya said that regular inspections are conducted in all the sealed resorts, and none of the sealed rooms have been opened nor have the seals been tampered with. However, some of the buildings in the sealed resorts, for which residential permits had been obtained by the owners were still functioning. “They have been strictly instructed that no commercial activities can be conducted and are only to be used by the owners for maintenance purposes,” she added.

Local residents, including owners of legal resorts in the surrounding areas alleged that these were the same buildings that were being rented out to guests surreptitiously. “From the resort owners I have spoken to, they all confess to taking in guests, and it is sort of an open secret that these establishments continue to function in some capacity,” said a long-time resident of Bokkapuram. The District Administration and the Forest Department served notices to three resorts, where guests and “tourism-related activities” were seen during an routine inspection, a few months ago.

“Some of these resorts have been reviewed online by guests during the period they are supposed to have been sealed, pointing to the fact that they are still being leased out to visiting tourists. It is clear that they continue to flout Supreme Court guidelines,” said a conservationist from the Nilgiris who requested anonymity.

The administration should insist that these owners take down online advertisements for their properties, and contact information which will allow customers to get in touch with them, he added. “They specify to guests to check-in to the rooms post a certain time in the evening and leave early in the morning before government officials can get wind of what is happening and launch inspections,” said a tribal resident of Bokkapuram, who routinely fixes rooms for guests to stay in. “Of course, this means that illegal night safaris and treks can still be organised into reserve forests with a ‘package’ being fixed at ₹5,000 for a group of three to four persons,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/45qen9/article30619616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22THRESORTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/despite-closure-illegal-resorts-still-operating-in-notified-elephant-corridor/article30619617.ece
184,2020/01/22,HC orders demolition of bungalow close to Bay of Bengal on ECR,"Citing the recent Supreme Court verdict in the Kerala Maradu flats demolition case, the Madras High Court on Tuesday ordered the demolition of a 16,218 square feet bungalow constructed close to the Bay of Bengal at a stretch known as Olive Island in Muttukadu Taluk situated on the East Coast Road here.

A Bench of Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha directed the Kancheepuram Collector as well as the district coastal management zone authority to demolish the bungalow used as a guest house by Rajsriya Automotive Industries Private Limited, and report the progress to the court within two weeks.

The orders were passed after Special Government Pleader E. Manoharan told the court the entire stretch on which about six bungalows had been constructed illegally by different individuals had been declared as a ‘no development zone’ since it was a inter tidal zone falling under Coastal Regulatory Zone (CRZ)-III.

After advocate A. Yogeshwaran, representing a public interest litigation petitioner informed the court that he had filed the case against all six buildings, the judges ordered disconnection of power supply to the other five bungalows apart from snapping their sewage and drinking water connections too.

The court had, on November 28 itself, ordered disconnection of power insofar as the guesthouse owned by the private automotive industry was concerned. Then, it had also recorded an undertaking given by the company’s counsel that it shall remove all boulders that had been placed illegally behind the guesthouse to prevent intrusion of seawater.

However, when the case was taken up for hearing on Tuesday, the counsel sought two more weeks’ time to remove the boulders. Irked over such a submission, the judges ordered that the bungalow constructed on the seafront solely on the basis of a planning permission obtained from the local panchayat should be demolished.

They also ordered that the boulders should be removed by the private company itself and shifted to some other place without dumping it anywhere near the coastal area.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-orders-demolition-of-bungalow-close-to-bay-of-bengal-on-ecr/article30619577.ece
185,2020/01/22,"RSS, Muslim League propagated two-nation theory: TPDK","Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) vice-president S. Doraisamy has filed an impleading petition in the Madras High Court objecting to a plea by a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office-bearer to delete a sentence from the Class X social science textbook wherein it was stated that the Hindu Mahasabha as well as RSS had taken a “pronounced anti-Muslim stance” during the days that led to a partition of the country on religious lines.

Filing a detailed affidavit in support of his impleading petition, Mr. Doraisamy, 76, also an advocate, said deleting the sentence from the textbook would amount to not allowing schoolchildren to know a historical fact. “I state that the sentence in the above textbook is not false. It is a true historical fact. The younger generation should know the past history of the land,” the affidavit read. P. Chandrasekaran, secretary of Chennai chapter of RSS, had filed a writ petition early this month seeking deletion of the sentence on the ground that RSS had only opposed the partition of the country on religious lines and that it had been “falsely misinterpreted” to mean as if the organisation had taken an anti-Muslim stance.

“If such wrong messages are included in the textbook meant for school students, it will lower the image of the organisation,” he said.

Taking exception to the stand taken by the writ petitioner, the TPDK leader accused the RSS of having played a dubious role throughout the freedom struggle. “I state that the RSS did not participate in the freedom struggle. Their aim was to establish Manusmiriti Raj and no other person other than those who follows Hindu religion should live in India. All evidence points towards disruptive activities and the fact that the organisation was never a part of the freedom struggle.

“The RSS by declaring that Hindus are a separate nation has, in fact, been supplementing the two-nation theory as practised by the Muslim League. Both hold the same views about distinct characters and exclusiveness of Hindus and Muslims ... Savarkar, the great philosopher and guide of RSS not only propagated the two-nation theory but also entered into alliances with the Muslim League in order to break the Quit India Movement,” the impleading petitioner alleged.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rss-muslim-league-propagated-two-nation-theory-tpdk/article30619371.ece
186,2020/01/22,HC calls for report from IIT-M on maintaining its campus free of plastics,"The Madras High Court on Tuesday directed the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M) to explain by February 21 the steps taken by it to keep its campus plastic free so that the deer roaming around the sprawling institution do not end up consuming plastic waste.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha passed the order after Special Government Pleader (Forests) S.V. Vijay Prashanth told the court that consumption of plastic waste by deer in the IIT campus was a cause of concern for forest department officials.

Wondering why the forest department had not acted against the institution if it had not been keeping the campus plastic-free especially when there was large presence of deer population, the judges directed the counsel for IIT-M to file a status report within a month.

The interim order was passed on a public interest litigation petition filed by animal lover S. Muralidharan of Chennai, through his counsel S.P. Chockalingam, to restrain the forest officials from translocating the deer from Central Leather Research Institute (CLRI) campus in the city.

The court had last year disposed of the PIL last year with a direction to the forest department to come up with a standard operating procedure (SOP) for capturing the animals. Accordingly, the department on Tuesday apprised the court of the SOP in place.

After taking note of it, the judges permitted the department to go ahead with translocating the deer from CLRI campus to nearby zoos and forest areas. The SGP informed the court that more than 260 deer had been translocated from Chennai city since August 2018.

He said, the entire process was a huge success with some deer lodged in Guindy National Park and others in Anna Zoological Park at Vandalur. A few deer were also translocated to Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve on pilot basis and that too turned out to be successful.

Out of the 10 female spotted deer shifted to the tiger reserve for increasing the prey population, nine had got accustomed to the forest area whereas just one deer was hunted down by a leopard, he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-calls-for-report-from-iit-m-on-maintaining-its-campus-free-of-plastics/article30619361.ece

Mr. Shanmuga Sundaram presented roses to traffic violators and advised them to wear helmet and seatbelt and not to overload vehicles.

A majority of youngsters riding without helmets were surprised by the Collector’s gesture.

An RTO official said such an approach might make motorists think twice before violating rules.

Non-governmental organisations, women and students were part of the rally.

The rally started from Voorhees Higher Secondary School at Officers Line and reached the Mahatma Gandhi statue near Vellore Fort.

The campaign urged the civil society to play a leading role in tackling the effects of socio-economic problems caused by alcohol trade and its consumption.

Vellore Collector, A. Shanmuga Sundaram while flagging off the rally, said it was important to free society from the problem.

Participants raised slogans such as ‘Give up alcohol,’ ‘We want to create a alcohol-free State’. “Alcohol abuse was undoubtedly the cause of many problems in society and we need a strong partnership with civil society to reduce this,” said S. Partheeban, an octogenarian from Oosur.

A resident of Virupatchipuram, A. Visalakshi, said people’s protest against opening of new outlets often got weakened due to politicisation.

Regrouping protesters was not easy, which made the job easy for the government agency to open new outlets at their will, she added. District Revenue Officer, J.

190,2020/01/22,Can you don an additional pair of gloves?,"“Specialist” sounds like the acme of professional excellence. In contrast, “generalist” sounds like a disappointing compromise — a case of having to check into a lacklustre mid-way house between sparkling excellence and plain utility.

However, the so-called generalist would actually be a “specialist-generalist” — the successful ones certainly are. And the future seems to belong to the “specialist-generalist”, defined as a professional almost indispensable in their main role, but can also effortlessly slip into related roles when exigency demands it.

It is not challenging at all to illustrate this breed of professionals, especially now, when a cricket-crazy India only recently watched a specialist-batsman make room for an additional pair of gloves in his kit-bag, one he would be wearing behind the stumps.

The rise of star batsman K.L. Rahul in the additional role of a wicket-keeper at the international level (he has already been a wicket-keeper in domestic and IPL cricket), during the recent one-day international series against Australia, underlines the value of multifacetedness, of how it increases the options on the table for a team. Besides the commendable performance behind the stumps, Rahul also evinced another aspect of adaptability, showing he can be as effective batting at number five, as he has been while playing in the top order.

Multiple roles

Shifting to the organisational playground, in today’s business climate, one sees a demand for something similar. Due to the advent of new and more complex job roles, as specialisations are becoming more and more nuanced due to highly advanced technologies, professionals are expected to display extreme expertise in niche areas. At the same time, with technologies and even job roles sometimes fading faster than sartorial fads, these professionals are also expected to don “multiple gloves”. Such versatility can come in handy, particularly during times of resource crunch.

“For any professional, hip-pocket skills are indispensable. They signify deep knowledge in a particular area of operation. When they possess these skills in abundant measure, they automatically earn the respect of peers and seniors in their organisation and field. So, in the early part of their career, professionals have to be focussed on developing these hip-pocket skills or vertical expertise. And subsequently, when they have risen in stature in the organisation or field on account of their vertical expertise, they have to concentrate on acquiring horizontal experiences, which are gained by becoming engaged in various other lines of operations. To draw an example from the IT industry, if someone is on the project-management side, they have to give it the number of years and time it takes to develop top-notch expertise in it. And, then to graduate to a higher managerial role in the IT set-up, the project-management professional should aim at having stints in allied sections so that they acquire a generalist-ability to function effectively there, or just to understand how they fit into the larger puzzle,” says Kannan Hariharan, former senior director, human resources, PepsiCo India. Shouldn’t organisations promote a culture that creates “specialist-generalists”?

“Whether the organisation does this or not, the employees should do it in their own interest. It may not always be possible to have short stints in related sections; in such a scenario, they should ask the management to allow them to be part of projects that will give them these horizontal experiences,” says Kannan.

Unfamiliar environment

Horizontal experiences are directly linked to a professional’s long-term career prospects, and in some extreme situations, their very survival.

Drawing an example from the animal world, generalist species — one that follows a wide range of diet and also the ability to adapt to a variety of environmental milieus — perform well in hostile conditions, which may include being thrust into totally unfamiliar habitats.

Birds that have become naturalised in environments where they have been introduced, always have a high capacity for generalist living.

To illustrate this point, V. Shantaram, director, Institute of Bird Studies, Rishi Valley, presents the story of the rose-ringed parakeets in the United Kingdom: “The rose-ringed parakeets may have been introduced accidentally or deliberately in United Kingdom, but they have thrived in their naturalised environment, especially in and around London, because they quickly got used to having fruits and seeds available in the UK, and also adapted to the low temperatures there. It is a different story that they are considered a pest by farm and orchard owners in the UK, but the fact remains that they have survived because they adapted quickly to a new environment.”",careers,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8vo7lq/article30624268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22OPKLRAHUL,https://www.thehindu.com/education/careers/can-you-don-an-additional-pair-of-gloves/article30624269.ece
191,2020/01/22,The emerging face of employment,"The gig economy is sometimes reduced to convenient terms — “project-based work” or “freelance employment”. These terms are however too narrow in focus to do the concept any justice.

Gig economy suggests a paradigm shift in how organisations and their teams work.

Born in the cradle of technology, flexibility is its key defining feature, as it allows employers the option of cobbling together a distributed time-bound team, with the best talent from different parts of the world. For the employee, there is the advantage of moving quickly new pastures.

How developed is the gig economy in India?

Though nascent in India, it is growing at a steady pace. The Global Gig Economy Index report — drawn from a sample of three lakh freelancers, service providers and outsourcing professionals in the Payoneer network — has ranked India among the top 10 countries.

The report says there has been an increase in freelancers in India from 11% in the third quarter of 2018 to 52% in the second quarter of 2019, thanks to various initiatives including Startup India and Skill India.

Freelancing is said to be effective in improving the rate of participation from women in India’s labour-force.

From a talent-acquisition point of view, gig workers supplement skills provided by the existing workforce, reduce hiring costs and can be a viable solution in filling temporary vacancies in teams.

On the disadvantages side, though the gig economy has been growing in India, it is largely unregulated, which means there are no rules on how much a worker should be paid, how many hours they can work every day, on an average; and the social benefits they are entitled to.

Who can regulate the gig economy?

The Ministry of Labour and Employment has been working on a “Social Security Code” to ensure labour benefits for gig-economy workers.

“Currently, these workers are not covered under health, ESI, PF or any other scheme as gig economy is not yet defined as a way of life,” says Neeti Sharma, senior vice-president, TeamLease Services, a staffing company that provides human resource services to various industries.

Regulation will help all stakeholders.

“Regulation will ensure fairness as well as accountability,” says Neeti, adding that when it is formalised, gig economy will draw more professionals.

How does one operate in the gig economy?

Networking is essential to getting good assignments. It is important to get the terms of the agreement right before signing up for a project. Freelancers should read through the agreement carefully, and look for clauses about payment timeliness, the time period and deliverables. A recent research by Flexing It, a platform for ‘on demand’ business consultants, says that some of the best practices followed by companies to develop a strong “Freelancer Value Proposition” include creating a technology-based solution, either internally or in partnership with a leading platform, to gain access to a trusted talent pool; and having a dedicated HR resource team to manage external talent; and having an on-boarding structure. With regard to compensation, the research says, more than 25-30% premium is paid as compensation. Some forward-looking companies also offer some benefits to gig workers.

‘The journey is not free of obstacles’

Working as a freelancer for over two years now, I have enjoyed the freedom that comes with being one’s own boss. However, the journey has not been obstacle-free.

I enrolled with a recruitment company that serves as a bridge between companies and women professionals in tech, sales and marketing. My first assignment there was to develop Apps for a client.

It was a four-month project and the assignment required me to work 12 hours at a stretch every day, as the client had tight deadlines to meet. You cannot back off as you have signed an agreement and it would affect your future gig projects. It was taxing, but I was paid well and on time, every 15 days, so it kept me going.

Despite years of experience, I have to go through rounds of interview to get a project, which means I have to be updated on the latest trends in my field. Sometimes, it takes months to land a project. There are instances when clients backed off even after making an offer.

Joining a new gig-project job platform may mean you have to build your credibility all over again, and till you do so, it is difficult to get projects.

‘Spell out the requirements clearly’

Finding a good gig worker depends on how well you have spelt your requirements on the freelancing portal. We follow a strict check-list which includes drafting the skills required for the job, and identifying those who will be in the panel to hire the gig worker. For certain roles, the potential candidate is given a task before placing them in the short-list. We recruit gig workers for roles relating to technology, copy writing and visual designing almost every month and one of the main challenges we face is getting the worker to understand our expectations. For example, when we connect with the prospective hire we expect them to ask questions to clarify their role and our requirements.

We expect the gig worker to communicate proactively if they miss a deadline. We don’t always go with the rating; as many a time, we have found someone to be efficient though they have just started out. Women on a career comeback, after a break, usually make a good hire, as they are keen on proving themselves again.

192,2020/01/22,Nagoba Jatara off to a ritualistic start,"The sleepy village of Keslapur in Indervelli mandal started reverberating with traditional Adivasi music with the arrival of Mesram clan pen patlal (patels of the god) and their families under the sacred ‘wad marra’ or the old banyan tree late on Tuesday night.

Their ceremonial arrival provided an insight into the centuries-old customs of the Boiguitta branch of the Mesram clan Raj Gond and Pardhan Adivasis as they prepare for their most important religious event, the maha puja of serpent god Nagoba who is the persa pen or bada dev (big god).

The Nagoba Jatara, which is slated to get under way on January 24 night, entails a series of rituals starting with takhid which has the patels, the descendants of Mesram Raj Gond kings, and their families and entourage arriving and ceremonially occupying the gaddi or throne, which is a space earmarked for them. Gaddis are also earmarked for the katodas or priests in the clan and the Pardhans who guide the kings and the priests in all rituals.

The patels and their families belong to Pangdi in Sirpur (U) mandal and Daboli in Jainoor mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, and Wadgaon and Keslapur in Indervelli mandal.

They perform the puja of the earth before entering the sacred land under the banyan tree and are welcomed by the pilgrims from the clan who had earlier arrived at the place carrying the sacred gangajal or water from Godavari in Jannaram mandal of Mancherial district which is to be used later during rituals.

The patels, katodas and Pardhans discussed further proceedings, their meeting continuing well into the early hours of Wednesday. Old Tukdoji, the Pardhan bard, sang the ‘Nagoba bhidi’ or the ballad of Nagoba, the serpent god, also known as Shri Shek.

Paying tributes

On Wednesday, the Adivasis performed the ‘thoom’ rites which involve paying tributes to the Mesram clan elders who died since the last Nagoba Jatara. The sacred earthen pots which are used to fetch water from the local kui (well) were also brought under the tree from Sirikonda during the day.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wetce4/article30628183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY22-ADILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nagoba-jatara-off-to-a-ritualistic-start/article30628168.ece

194,2020/01/22,Nod for closure of Rudraram HFL,"A meeting of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, presided by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved closure of Hindustan Fluorocarbons Limited (HFL), a 500 tonne per annum Central public sector enterprise involved in manufacture of poly tetra flouro ethylene (PTFE) at Rudraram, which is 10 kms from Patancheru, on Hyderabad outskirts.

The announcement of the approval was made by Union Minister Prakash Jawadekar after the meeting in New Delhi.

The company, a subsidiary of Hindustan Organic Chemicals (HOC), was declared sick by the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) after it started making losses since 2013-14 and had negative net worth of ₹ 43.20 crore. It had accumulated losses of ₹ 62.81 crore as on March 31, 2019.

The company manufactured plastics, synthetic resins, synthetic rubber and synthetic fibres of all kinds. It also manufactured PTFE bushes for fans to eliminate greasing and used by Khaitan and Kedia in their fans. The PTFE know how was available to select few companies in the world and HFL sourced it from Atochem, France, a world leader in fluorocarbons and fluoropolymers.

US-based chemical giant DuPont was earlier in talks with HOC to pick up a stake in company which was also approved by government in principle. The merger of the company with HOC, which was planned in order to bring HFL out of the purview of BIFR., was proposed to be dropped in case the joint venture with DuPont came through.

The Cabinet committee decision entailed shutting down operations of the company and offering voluntary retirement and voluntary separation schemes (VRS/VSS) to employees. The government will extend an interest free loan of ₹ 77.20 crore to the company exclusively for implementation of VRS and VSS. The amount will be repaid to government by disposal of land and other assets of the company. The surplus proceeds from sale of land and assets will be used for repayment of outstanding government loans of ₹ 15.80 crore with interest up to March 31, 2019.

The government approved appointment of NBCC (India) Ltd as Land Management Agency for facilitating disposal of HFL’s land assets subject to outcome of the decision of Telangana government and Telangana State Industrial Infrastructure Corporation on purchase of land.

The company, listed with Bombay Stock Exchange, had informed the exchange in March last last year that the ongoing process of strategic disinvestment by the Centre had terminated. The Centre asked it to initiate action to sell 66 acres and 13 guntas of vacant surplus land and use the proceeds to give VRS/VSS to employees.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nod-for-closure-of-rudraram-hfl/article30631176.ece
195,2020/01/22,Isotopes techniques hold key to water resources management: BARC scientist,"Application of isotopes techniques would hold the key to development and management of water resources, particularly in the backdrop of increasing water scarcity being caused by climate change and its contamination, Head of Isotope Hydrology Section in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) Uday Kumar Sinha said here on Wednesday.

In an exclusive interactive session and lecture to senior engineers of Irrigation Department and senior officials of the Groundwater Department, he explained the application of stable and radioisotopes in hydrological investigations for water resources development and management.

The session was held following a specific request from the Irrigation Department, after a few of its engineers had attended a workshop last year under the National Hydrology Project.

Mr. Sinha said the task of management of water resources was highly challenging due to the diverse climatic and hydrological ecosystems in the country. He explained that isotope studies could be applied to a wide spectrum of hydrological problems related to both surface and groundwater resources and environmental studies in hydro-ecological systems.

Stating that the technology had become established scientific discipline often referred to as “Isotope Hydrology”, he said it was an emerging discipline with expanding investigation tools for many environmental problems. The BARC scientist explained that improved measurement of naturally occurring isotopic abundances – relative number of atoms of an element with different numbers of neutrons in the nucleus – in waters had immensely increased the utility of isotope techniques in the hydrological investigations.

Mr. Sinha stated that it was possible to utilise isotopes as conservative tracers of delineating groundwater flow paths, for estimating solute exchange from one phase of a system to another, for determining extents of chemical reactions in the subsurface, for identifying source regions in watersheds, for identifying recharge areas of aquifers and for estimating its subsurface residence times.

The BARC scientist told the irrigation and groundwater officials that isotope techniques could be applied in studies on leakages in dams, reservoirs, canals and tunnels, for investigation on hydrological processes and dynamics of lakes and wetlands, for quantification of various components in the stream flow – hydrograph separation and estimation of dilution and dispersion of wastewater discharges in surface water bodies.

Further, it was also useful for identification of source and origin of groundwater recharge, recharge area of springs, source, mechanism and pathways of groundwater contamination, the origin of geothermal waters and their flow dynamics, surface water-groundwater and aquifer-aquifer interconnections, estimation of residence time of groundwater and determination of groundwater velocity and flow direction.

Under the watchful eyes of a strong police force, including a company of Rapid Action Force (RAF), voters turned up at respective polling stations in good numbers.

Turn up sans fear

It may be recalled that the communally sensitive town had been rocked by violence just 10 days ago as two communities clashed. The incident had spread scare among locals then. However, it appeared that has passed and fear was not seen as voters formed queues even at hyper-sensitive polling stations.

Nirmal Superintendent of Police C. Shashidhar Raju supervised all measures to ensure peace during the polling process. He kept visiting wards which have a history of violence in a bid to reassure voters of safety.

210,2020/01/22,Reflecting on the deeper meaning and philosophy of Nepali Thangka paintings,"It’s all in the details: the Nepali Thangka paintings have vivid colours with red, orange, yellow, blue and green dominating, representing Buddhist symbols and images, capturing the cosmic world of gods and goddesses. They are displayed at an art show Illuminating The Divine, at DakshinaChitra.

The show has been curated by Stephen Eckerd, who has vast experience working at galleries at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. Thangka paintings flourished as murals in Buddhist monasteries many centuries ago, and were later rendered on cloth and handmade paper as well.

“The idea behind this show is contextualising culture through art,” says Stephen, adding: “Thangka artist Rajan Sangachhen will be the artist in residence here till mid-February.”

Stephen’s trademark style is displaying the photo and bio of the artist along with their works, and he has followed the same here as well. “I want art connoisseurs and collectors to establish contact with the artists. I consciously promote such culture,” he adds.

Most of the artists whose works are on display are from Lalitpur in the Kathmandu valley, known for its rich cultural heritage, especially in arts and crafts. “In fact, Lalitpur is known as the city of artists, and the legacy dates back to the 4th Century, as is documented by Chinese Buddhist monks. But unfortunately, those art works have been destroyed. It’s only from 11th Century that Thangka paintings survived,” says Stephen. He further explains how in Nepal, temple festivals such as Samek Mahadan and Nature have always fascinated the Thangka artists. “For them, religion, both Hinduism and Buddhism, has been the central theme, along with which they also weave in the flora and fauna of their landscape.”

Interestingly, Thangka (Tibetan word for painting) art was influenced by Chinese Buddhist monks, who came to Nepal to visit sacred sites. This resulted in a unique style of painting by the Newari artists of the Kathmandu Valley. In Nepal, Thangka is known as Paubha, and the Newari artists specialised in traditional religious paintings used in worship. Paubha (Sanskrit word for painting) art therefore depicts deities, mandalas or monuments.

Yet another unique aspect of this art is that it is drawn on cotton fabric, using mineral colours. The fabric is coated with white clay and animal glue (saresh in Nepali) derived from the skin of cow, buffalo or rabbit. It is further rubbed with a stone to make the fabric smooth, and is then employed to paint images. Typically, Thangka or Paubha paintings were mounted on brocade fabric and some artists specialised in this work. The paintings can be rolled and displayed when needed, which is why they were also called scroll paintings. The earliest Nepali painting on cloth dates back to late 11th Century.

Stephen has mounted the collection, about 40 totally, at a height of two to 2.5 feet, and the reason he gives is an eye-opener. “Children are our most valuable visitors and I hang the artefact low so that they can view it and appreciate it. This also helps visitors on wheelchairs.” Magnifying glasses are also hung close to the artefacts for visitors to use, and if closely examined, reveal a wealth of fascinating details.

“Illuminating the divine” is on till February 10, 10 am to 5.30 pm, at Kadambari Gallery, DakshinaChitra, Muttukadu, ECR. Phone: 2747 2603. Rajan Sangachhen will also be offering workshop on January 25 and 26, 10.30 am to 5.30 pm, fee Rs 2500. For details, call: 9841777779.

Culture calls

The exhibition has on display the works of renowned and award-winning Nepali artists, apart from upcoming ones. It also has posters and film screenings.

Films being screened include: Tashi Samtenling Monastery: Bodhinath, Nepal. This film is on a day in the life of the oldest Buddhist monastery in Nepal.

Samek Mahadan: This documentary is about one of the most beautiful Buddhist festivals in Nepal.

Stephen Eckerd will be conducting classes in exhibition design which deals with how to do the layout, curate events around the exhibition so that more people walk in. He will also teach art management for the students interning at DakshinaChitra

Artist in residence

Rajan Sangachhen will be living and working at DakshinaChitra till the second week of February.

Art connoisseurs, artists and students can interact with him and even commission work.

An architect, the 32-year-old went to a fine arts school while he was working as a 3D modelling designer for almost 10 years.

He sells three to four paintings a year, as the detailed sketches are time-consuming.

“The Department of Environment and Climate Change has decided to replace them with electric-CNG vehicles,” said K.S. Pannu, director “Tandrust Punjab Mission” on Wednesday.

“It has been observed that a large number of three-wheelers which are more than 15 years are operating in Punjab but as per Rule 68C of the Punjab Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989, these cannot operate beyond 15 years,” said Mr. Pannu.

Registration stopped

The Punjab Pollution Control Board has already banned the registration of new diesel/petrol-operated three-wheelers in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Mohali districts since January 2019.

A video of the Etawah incident, where policemen can be seen using batons and chasing away protesters in the area late on Tuesday night, has also gone viral on social media.

Violence broke out when police tried to disperse the protesters who were observing a sit-in since Tuesday morning in Pachraha area, defying prohibitory orders imposed there.

“Police used force against us while we were holding a peaceful protest. Our brothers and cousins were beaten up and we were abused,” one of the women protesters said.

Responding to the allegations, police said the protesters had staged a dharna defying prohibitory order in the area and pelted them with stones. Police said they had to use mild force to chase the protesters away.

Solidarity protest

In the video, policemen can be seen entering houses and shops. The sit-in was organised in solidarity with the women protesting at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

213,2020/01/22,"Dean threatened us to call off stir, allege AMU students","Protesting students of Aligarh Muslim University have alleged that the newly-appointed Dean of Students’ Welfare, Mujahid Baig, has threatened them to call off their sit-in protest.

In a video shared by students, in response to a question that a student lost his hand during the police action, Prof. Baig could be heard saying, “Allah ka shukr ada karo ki kisi ki maut nahin huyi. (You should thank god that nobody lost his life.)”

Meet with students

The incident happened on Wednesday when the Vice-Chancellor, along with his core team, went to meet the medical students who were boycotting classes and exams demanding the resignation of the V-C and the Registrar for calling police inside the campus on December 15.

“In the midst of the interaction, Prof. Baig said that we should be thankful that a student only lost his hand and that nobody lost his life. He said this in the presence of the V-C and heads of different faculties of the medical college,” said Adnan Ziya, a student of medicine, who was present during the meeting.

“Prof. Baig’s tone was threatening. The interaction was with the V-C, who called in the police. But he would often pass on the mic to the DSW to answer questions addressed to the V-C,” said Mr. Adnan.

According to local sources, Prof. Baig, Chairman, Department of Medicine, is known to be a “tough” character and has been the Proctor in the past.

An official spokesperson admitted that Prof. Baig did say certain things that should not have been said to students.

“However, his intention was not to threaten anybody. He was referring to some past instances which were even more tragic,” he said.

‘Aggressive attitude’

Faizul Hasan, former president of AMU Students’ Union, said, “Prof. Baig talks of the presence of anti-social elements on campus but himself talks like one.

214,2020/01/22,"Raising azadi slogans amounts to sedition, says Adityanath","Raising slogans of ‘azadi’ (freedom) “in the name of protests” will amount to sedition and invite harsh action, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Wednesday while speaking in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Addressing a rally in Kanpur, he said “people living on Indian soil will not be allowed to conspire” against the country.

“In the name of dharna and demonstration, if you raise slogans of azadi that were once raised in Kashmir, it will come under sedition and the government will take the harshest action,” said Mr. Adityanath.

The Chief Minister accused the Opposition parties in U.P. of using women and children as proxies to protest against the CAA. “They lack the courage to protest directly because they know we will seize their property if they indulge in arson and vandalism,” he said.

Mr. Adityanath also questioned the women holding sit-ins against the CAA and claimed that they did not know what they were protesting against. He claimed the women were told to gather in the streets by the men in their families while they themselves preferred to “sleep in their quilts” at home.

“Ab inhone ne apne ghar ki mahilaon ko chaurahe chaurahe par bithana prarambh kar diya hai (Now they have started to place their women at all crossroads),” Mr. Adityanath said.

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister’s comments come at a time when protesters, mostly women, are holding sit-ins against the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens in Prayagraj and Lucknow.

‘Property will be seized’

The CM also warned those who “burn and vandalise” public property that their property will also be seized. “We will punish them in such a way that coming generations will remember how things are done,” Mr. Adityanath said.

He, however, also mentioned that holding a peaceful dharna and submitting a memorandum was everyone’s right in a democracy.

Targeting the Opposition, Mr. Adityanath also accused it of “speaking the language” of and encouraging the “enemies”.

Referring to the Congress, he said: “For them the country is not important, Hindus are not important, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis and Jains are not important. And now even Christians are not important for the Congress. And they have said in one voice that till ISI [Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence] agents don’t get an entry into India, they will oppose the CAA.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ixjp6o/article30627850.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE23-PNORTH2020000108A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/raising-azadi-slogans-amounts-to-sedition-says-adityanath/article30627851.ece

Additional sessions judge B.G. Ganatra granted Mr. Patel bail on condition that he will cooperate with court proceedings and will not seek adjournment unless there is a genuine reason.

Mr. Patel was arrested after a non-bailable warrant was issued by the court which had observed that Mr. Patel was flouting his bail conditions by not cooperating with trial proceedings and remaining absent.

The court will hear the sedition case on January 24 during which Mr. Patel has to be present.

Last week, the judge issued an arrest warrant against Mr. Patel after accepting the government’s plea against exemption from appearance.

216,2020/01/22,IPS officer’s harassment charge malicious: Assam Rifles,"The Assam Rifles (AR) has refuted the allegations by an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer that its troops had harassed, assaulted and misbehaved with her during a routine check of vehicles in Manipur’s Tengnoupal district on January 18.

Acting on a complaint by Sub-Divisional Police Officer of Yairipok Anupama, copies of which were submitted to the Governor Najma Heptulla and Director General of Police L. M. Khaute, the Manipur State Commission for Women (MSCW) on Monday summoned an Assam Rifles jawan identified as P. K. Pandey. The panel also sought suggestions from the National Commission for Women and State Chief Minister N. Biren Singh.

In a statement received late Tuesday night, Assam Rifles said the police officer’s allegations that she was “assaulted, harassed and molested” at the Khudengthabi Check Post were baseless and malicious. It said the SUV (sports utility vehicle) the police officer was in had bypassed the designated scanning lane and jumped the vehicle queue at the check post around 2 p.m. on that day. The vehicle had come from Moreh, a town on the Manipur-Myanmar border.

‘Normal action’

“The vehicle was stopped by the AR troops and the passengers were asked for their identification, which is the normal course of action at the check post. On being enquired about the identity of the passengers and reasons for bypassing the scanning and jumping the queue, the officer along with armed male escorts who were in civil dress started arguing in an ignoble and indecorous language which is unbecoming of a uniformed soldier,” the statement said.

This was possibly with the aim of avoiding checking of the unidentified and suspicious stores loaded in the vehicle, the statement said.

Apart from refusing to divulge her identity and behaving rudely, the police officer started clicking photographs of the check post, to which rifleman Pandey objected. However, she persisted and continued clicking photographs, which is against the laid down norms, the statement said.

The AR said the police officer and her escorts were carrying their personal weapons without any escort vehicle, outside her area of jurisdiction. “Had she cooperated with the security forces and provided the identity as asked, such an unwarranted incident as claimed by her could have been avoided,” a spokesperson of the paramilitary force said.

Movement of such vehicles with occupants in civil dress carrying weapons in a vulnerable area and without prior intimation to other security agencies has serious operational ramifications, the AR said, adding that video footage of the incident at the check post would be released at an appropriate time.

‘On official duty’

Though Ms. Anupama maintains that she was on official duty, the AR is in possession of video clippings showing her and her party entering two towns across the international border, Namphalong and Tamu, and bringing some “suspicious items”, which falsify her claim of being “on official duty”.

It has been pointed out that senior officers of the AR tried to bring about a compromise. Instead of extending cooperation to the officers “she [Ms. Anupama] insisted on hitting the rifleman Pandey ten times with a shoe” for accepting his apology.

It further added that since the incident took place in the presence of people and several agencies, it was not possible that the officer and her team were “assaulted”.

‘Law takes course’

The Manipur Chief Minister N. Biren, who holds the State’s Home portfolio, has said that the law will take its own course, “now that a First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged with the police”.

The MSCW and several women’s organisations have condemned the incident and demanded appropriate action against Pandey and four other personnel named in the FIR.

217,2020/01/22,"Will a person be declared foreigner, then allowed to apply for citizenship, asks Mamata in anti-CAA jab","West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who took her fight against the CAA and the proposed NRC to the Darjeeling hills on Wednesday, sought clarifications from Union Home Minister Amit Shah on the clauses of the new law, even as she accused the Centre of spreading lies on the issue.

Addressing a rally after leading a mega 4-km-long protest march through the serpentine roads of this Himalayan town, Ms. Banerjee said the Centre is trying to push CAA only in non-BJP ruled states.

She claimed all states except West Bengal have attended the meeting on the National Population Register (NPR) in New Delhi due to fear of BJP-led Union government.

Explained: What connects the NPR, NRIC and Census?

“Every day the Union home minister is giving new sermons. Yesterday he said that we (opposition parties) are misleading the people. I would like to ask him to clarify whether a person will be declared foreigner and then allowed to apply for citizenship under the CAA,” Ms. Banerjee said, addressing the rally in Hindi.

Reiterating that the CAA, the NPR and the NRC won’t be allowed in West Bengal, Ms. Banerjee said before forcing any citizen out of the state, the BJP “has to throw her out” first.

“Due to NRC in Assam, lakhs of Gorkhas have been rendered homeless. We will not allow that to happen in Darjeeling as long as I am here,” she told the rally in Chowkbazar area.

Ms. Banerjee’s comments come a day after Mr. Shah had accused the opposition parties of “misleading” people on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said that the law will not be scrapped despite protests over it.

218,2020/01/22,BJP’s outreach programme to J&K is nothing but a hoax: Tarigami,"The Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over its public outreach programme in the Union Territory, saying that the move to parachute 36 ministers is a propaganda in panic mode, as the party has failed on every count throughout the country.

“What is the need for the BJP ministers to visit J&K when the government claims everything is normal? Reality is that they want to sell Kashmir’s ‘normalcy’ and ‘all is well’ story for those in mainland India who are ignorant about Kashmir’s ground realities,” senior CPI(M) leader and former legislator M.Y. Tarigami said in a statement.

Reacting to the statement of Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi in Srinagar — that his government’s outreach programme is aimed at resolving all the issues confronting people in Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Tarigami said that the visit is ‘nothing, but a hoax.’

“Did the BJP government assess what has befallen on people of J&K after abrogation of Article 370? How the economy of J&K got shattered due to its misadventure,” Mr. Tarigami said, adding that the abrogation of Article 370 was an assault on the Constitution of India.

In the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 provisions and bifurcation of the erstwhile state into Union Territories in August last year, the Centre launched a major week-long public outreach programme on January 18, to make people aware about the benefits of the move and to disseminate information about the implementation of its policies and programmes for the overall development of Jammu and Kashmir.

“If the BJP claims that its misadventures will bring development to J&K, let it put its report card for last six years in Parliament. Since 2014, the BJP is in power and what has it done for the development of J&K?” the senior CPI(M) leader said.

He said that the political activities of all other parties other than the BJP have come to a standstill in J&K for the last six months.

“Almost all the political leaders are either under detention or their activities have been restricted. In such a situation, parachuting Union ministers to J&K and trying to project all is well theory is nothing but a shame,” said Mr. Tarigami.

He also added that the internet services continue to remain snapped, and the BJP claims its ministers would make people aware about the schemes of the central government.

“The parachuted ministers are inaugurating those projects which had been sanctioned before 2014,” Mr. Tarigami said, adding, “Where was the BJP government and its ministers when horticulture in Kashmir and agriculture in Jammu suffered massive losses due to heavy snowfall in the Valley in November and rainfall in Jammu?”

“Why did the BJP government forget about development that time when farmers of J&K were crying?” he asked.

Mr. Tarigami said, “Almost three months had passed, but proper assessment of losses have not been done as yet.”

He claimed that the people are eking out a tough existence in Kashmir.

“Daily wagers are not able to find work to feed their families. Thousands of businesses cannot pay their staff or keep them on their rolls. ‘Shikara-walas’ (boatmen) of Dal Lake, pony-walas of Gulmarg, handicraft sellers and hoteliers, their staff and their suppliers are facing the worst crisis since last August (when Centre abrogated the Article 370 and announced the bifurcation of the erstwhile state into two UTs),” Mr. Tarigami said.

“More than the losses to the economy, job loss due to clampdown on internet services and restrictions is more worrying. According to a recent report of Chamber of Commerce and Industry, present disruption has resulted in loss of jobs of lakhs of people while J&K economy suffered losses worth thousands of crores,” he added.

The former MLA said that the snowfall in early November caused losses worth thousands of crores to horticulture sector.

“Education sector has been worst affected as most of the schools, colleges and universities remain shut since early August last year,” the CPI(M) leader said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pisqmk/article30595804.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19TARIGAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjps-outreach-programme-to-jk-is-nothing-but-a-hoax-tarigami/article30623494.ece
219,2020/01/22,Jammu-Srinagar National Highway shut for second day due to multiple landslides,"Multiple landslides at several places hampered restoration work on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway which remained closed for the second day on Wednesday, officials said. The highway, the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country, was closed for traffic on Tuesday following fresh snowfall and incessant rains.

Though the weather improved, multiple landslides at Panthiyal, Moumpassi and Digdole coupled with slippery conditions delayed restoration work, the officials said.

“The men and machines are on the job and efforts are on to make the highway motorable as soon as possible,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police (traffic), National Highway, Shemsher Singh.

He said that the Jawahar Tunnel, which experienced nearly one feet of fresh snowfall, was cleared for one-way traffic and around 1500 Kashmir-bound vehicles including trucks carrying essential commodities were allowed to move towards their destinations with drivers asked to drive carefully due to slippery conditions.

Heavy rains in Ramban triggered shooting of stones from hillocks overlooking the highway between Panthiyal and Ramsu throughout the day on Tuesday, while fresh landslides occurred at different places along the stretch, blocking the road, he said.

In Jammu city and other parts of the region it was a sunny day.

220,2020/01/22,Manipur woman IPS officer ‘roughed up’,"The Manipur State Commission for Women has summoned an Assam Rifles jawan for allegedly detaining and roughing up a woman police officer in Tengnoupal district on Saturday. It also forwarded the IPS officer’s complaint to the National Commission for Women.

The Assam Rifles did not react officially to the allegation, but a senior officer said the paramilitary force would “follow the procedures.”

“I have sent summons to the jawan (P.K. Pandey) seeking his appearance before the Commission on or before January 27. I have also sought suggestions from the NCW and the Chief Minister,” MSCW Chairperson Meinam Binota said, adding that Mr. Singh has instructed the police to arrest the jawan.

Tengnoupal’s Superintendent of Police Vikramjit Singh said his team was trying to take all possible legal steps necessary for the case.

The incident on January 18 occurred when Ms. Anupama, posted at Yairipok, was returning from Moreh town on the India-Myanmar border along with four policemen after performing official duties.

Personnel of the 12 Assam Rifles D-Company stopped her vehicle at Khudengthabi check post following which she and a constable went to register the entry of the vehicle and show identification cards as is required.

But the accused rifleman allegedly detained them for unspecified reasons, leading to an altercation before a Major of the Assam Rifles unit brought the situation under control.

In her complaint at the nearest police station, the IPS officer accused the jawan of harassment, misbehaviour and physical assault. She also said the jawan tried to snatch her mobile phone. and complained the matter to the Assam Rifles authorities.

Assam Rifles officials said erring personnel of the paramilitary force are usually tried internally. “No member of the armed forces of the Union shall be arrested for anything done or purported to be done by him in the discharge of his official duties except after obtaining the consent of the Central government,” says Section 45 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The section further says: “The state government may, by notification, direct that the provisions of Sub-Section (1) shall apply to such class or category of the members of the force charged with the maintenance of public order as may be specified therein, wherever they may be serving, and thereupon the provisions of that Sub-Section shall apply as if for the expression ‘Central government’ occurring therein, the expression ‘state government’ were substituted.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-woman-ips-officer-roughed-up/article30620025.ece

222,2020/01/22,Medical team in Odisha carries a critically ill woman over 30 km of hilly terrain,"Walking nearly 30 km through hilly jungle terrain, carrying an ailing expectant mother in a makeshift stretcher, a medical team saved the life of the woman in Odisha’s Malkangiri district.

The six-member medical team from the Kalimela Community Health Centre (CHC), led by a young physician, Dr. Radheshyam Jena, undertook this exemplary show of service. The medical team had been on a two-day trip by foot to remote villages in the Kalimela Block for pulse polio immunisation and malaria screening. These villages do not have any road connectivity.

Inaccessible village

While at the inaccessible Kodidulagundi village, which falls under the Kurmanur Panchayat, on January 20, they had received information pertaining to Rinama Bare, a tribal woman in extreme labour pain over the previous 24 hours. Dr. Jena, along with his assistant Sukant Sahu, and health workers Dinesh Biswas and Sundarmihan Tudu, immediately rushed to her home. The team could ensure Ms. Bare delivered a baby boy. However, she was carrying twins.

“Without the necessary medical equipment, it was not possible for me to oversee the next delivery as the condition of the patient had deteriorated. Her pulse was feeble and she was also bleeding. Her life was in danger. So, we decided to save her by immediately shifting her to the nearby medical centre at Kalimela,” said Dr. Jena. But there was no one at the village to help as all the men were away working.

Makeshift stretcher

Having no other way out, Dr. Jena and his team converted a cot into a makeshift stretcher for Ms. Bare, which they carried on their shoulders towards Tekguda, from where they could reach Kalimela by a vehicle.

They started their 30 km trek over hilly terrain at about 2 p.m. and reached Tekguda at about 8 p.m. From there, the woman was immediately shifted to the Kalimela CHC, where she delivered a dead child. Nevertheless, Ms. Bare’s life could be saved.

The young Dr. Jena hails from Balasore district. He completed his MBBS degree from the MKCG Medical College in Berhampur in 2017, and took up government service in March 2019. “I feel saving life of a patient is the greatest joy for any physician and I am happy that I got the chance to do it,” said Dr. Jena.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/i2cppc/article30617358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200121-WA0004,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/medical-team-in-odisha-carries-a-critically-ill-woman-over-30-km-of-hilly-terrain/article30617359.ece

According to forest officials, the elephant has strayed out of a herd that has entered the Berhampur forest division from the Lakhari elephant sanctuary. For the past one week, this herd is roaming around and destroying standing crops at villages on the outskirts of Berhampur and in Chikiti block.

The lone elephant has been moving around in the Changudidei hill area in the Digapahandi forest range. Around 3 a.m. on Tuesday the tusker reached a paddy harvesting point at Nimapalli in search of food. Mr. Laccheya was sleeping there to guard the harvested paddy. When the elephant reached near him, he suddenly got up and flashed a torch at the pachyderm. This irked the elephant which trampled him.

226,2020/01/22,Trinamool gives meeting with Bengal Governor a miss,"No representative of the ruling Trinamool Congress turned up on Tuesday at a meeting called by West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on the pendency of two crucial Bills.

The meeting was called to discuss The West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019, and The West Bengal State Commission for SC and ST Bill, 2019. Only representatives of three parties, Congress MLA and Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan, CPI(M) MLA Sujan Chakraborty and CPI MLA Ashok Dinda participated in the meeting.

‘Talks fruitful’

A press statement from Raj Bhavan described the meeting as “fruitful”.

“While discussion on The West Bengal State Commission for Scheduled Castes/Tribes Bill, 2019 was completed, the discussion on The West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019 remains inconclusive and would resume after January 26,” the statement said.

The statement added that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was also invited and her office had informed that she would not be able to attend the meeting which was earlier scheduled for January 17. “The Governor urged the Chief Minister to give priority to this matter and spare time at the earliest and the same may be communicated,” the statement said.

Representatives of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, the BJP, and the All India Forward Bloc were also not present at the meeting.

Speaking to journalists, Mr. Mannan said he had pointed out the technical irregularities in the way the Bill against lynching was passed in the Assembly, but added that in the interest of the people, the Bill should not be delayed.

227,2020/01/22,Resolution against CAA in Bengal Assembly on January 27,"The Trinamool Congress government will bring a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the West Bengal Assembly at a special session on January 27, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee said on Tuesday.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said on Monday that her government would pass a resolution in the Assembly against the contentious Act.

Leaders of the Left parties and the Congress had suggested that a resolution against the CAA be passed at the single-day session of the Assembly held earlier this month.

‘Win-win situation’

Mr. Chatterjee appealed to the Left and the Congress to support the resolution. The Minister said it was not about who was the first to call for a resolution, but it was about standing in solidarity with the people.

“It is not about winning or losing; if we work for the people, it will be a win-win situation for all,” he said.

Leader of the Left Legislature Party Sujan Chakraborty, of the CPI(M), pointed out that the Left Democratic Front government in Kerala and the Congress government in Punjab had passed resolutions in their Assemblies against the Act. Questioning the delay in West Bengal, he said, “It seems the Trinamool Congress government was waiting for a nod from Delhi.”

In September last year, the West Bengal Assembly passed a resolution against the National Register of Citizens.

228,2020/01/22,New video with PM’s image morphed over Shivaji stirs row,"A row has erupted over a video wherein an image of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj has been morphed with that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The video follows a book along similar lines. Following criticism, the BJP distanced itself from the video on Tuesday.

In the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections, a video clip from the recently-released movie Tanhaji shows the faces of PM Modi morphed on the actor playing Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Home Minister Amit Shah’s face morphed on the actor playing Tanaji Malusare and Arvind Kejriwal’s face morphed on the actor playing Udaybhan.

Reacting to the video, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said, “A few days ago, some people created a ruckus in Maharashtra. I am waiting for their reaction. Some people had shut down Satara, some had shut down Sangli. Those who asked us questions, where are they now? We will not tolerate an insult to Shivaji Maharaj,” said Mr. Raut, referring to the king’s descendants Udayanraje Bhosale and Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati. Mr. Bhosale had contested the Lok Sabha polls on a BJP ticket.

Congress leader and Minister Amit Deshmukh said, “This is not appropriate. If someone is using this video for campaigning, the Election Commission should take note of this.”

Following sharp criticism, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati tweeted on Tuesday, without naming the BJP, “The party concerned must make its stand clear on this. The Central government should conduct an inquiry and take action against the guilty. This is intolerable. Nobody should use Maharaj for dirty politics.”

The BJP’s Ram Kadam said on Tuesday this is not an official BJP video, the party has nothing to do with it, and it is not being used for campaigning in Delhi. “Why is Raut commenting based on half-knowledge? Jitendra Awhad (NCP leader and State minister), Ashok Chavan (Congress leader and State minister) insulted Hindus. Where is the Shiv Sena’s Hindutva? They have already forgotten Savarkar. First ask questions to these two,” he said.

State BJP chief Chandrakant Patil said, “The BJP condemns the video; we should not be questioned about it as we have nothing to do with it. Nobody can be compared to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. Those who ask questions to Maharaj’s descendants, they have no moral right left to talk about Maharaj.”

230,2020/01/22,Six CM secretariat desks begin work outside Mumbai,"In an attempt to reduce the crowd coming to Mantralaya and to make the Chief Minister’s Office accessible at the local level, the State government has set up a ‘CM Secretariat Desk’ at all six Divisional Commissioner offices. The offices began functioning on Monday.

In the Nagpur winter Assembly session, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced the desk at every Divisional Commissioner’s office to bring in people-oriented, transparent and speedy administration. All Divisional Commissioner offices in Konkan, Nashik, Pune, Aurangabad, Amratvati and Nagpur have set up the desks.

“The idea is to save people’s time, money and energy, and avoid unnecessary trips to Mumbai to solve daily and local problems. It aims to solve regional problems on a regional level,” Mr. Thackeray had said. Applications and requests addressed to the CM can be submitted at these division-level CM Secretariat Desks.

The applications and requests will be sent immediately to the regional administration for processing, and will be reviewed on September 15, Democracy Day.

The division-level desks will help solve citizens’ problems in a short time. Divisional revenue deputy commissioners will be designated as special task officers at these desks, which will also have a deputy tehsildar, a clerk and a typist.

Applicants will get a receipt after submission. The Divisional Commissioner will forward applications to the relevant regional officer.

Applications which need to proceed at the government level or are policy-related will be forwarded to the principal secretary. Information on applications submitted at the regional level, followed-up proceedings and pending applications will be submitted to the CM’s Secretariat on the fifth of each month.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/six-cm-secretariat-desks-begin-work-outside-mumbai/article30619792.ece
231,2020/01/22,Sai Baba birthplace row: Parbhani group to ask CM to form committee,"While the residents of Shirdi, the trustees of the Sai Baba temple and politicians from Ahmednagar have withdrawn their strike over the controversy over Sai Baba’s birthplace, the row refuses to die down. Elected representatives from Parbhani district on Tuesday called for a State-level committee to determine that Pathri village in the district is the mystic’s birthplace.

On Monday, a delegation from Shirdi, including members of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, Congress leader and Revenue Minister Balasaheb Thorat and Shiv Sena MP Sadashiv Lokhande, had expressed satisfaction over Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s assurances.

However, elected representatives, local legislators and members of the Sri Sai Janmasthan Temple in Pathri passed a resolution at a gram sabha in Pathri that a delegation would shortly meet the CM and submit concrete evidence of the village being Sai Baba’s birthplace.

“When the Chief Minister recently announced a ₹100 crore grant for the development of Pathri, we take it that the development of the village into a site for spiritual tourism was based on the fact that it was Sai Baba’s birthplace … So, we are not seeking funds merely for Pathri’s development, but on the basis that it was Sai Baba’s birthplace,” said MLC and NCP leader Babajani Durrani, a trustee of the Pathri temple.

Mr. Durrani said they will submit all 29 pieces of proof which allegedly show Pathri to be Sai Baba’s birth place, and that they would urge the CM to form a committee to settle the matter.

Sena MP from Parbhani, Sanjay Jadhav, said he was willing to resign if it was proved that Pathri was not the mystic’s birthplace. “We are not saying this just for the sake of it. It is clearly mentioned in government records. The 1967 district gazette shows Pathri as the saint’s birthplace … If Shirdi can give proof to the contrary, we will accept it, else they should accept our contention,” Mr. Jadhav said.

Both leaders also objected to an editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana which said nobody could say where Sai Baba was born and he simply “appeared” in Shirdi. The editorial said the controversy was “unwarranted” and Mr. Thackeray ought not to be blamed for it, as he had not referred to Pathri as Sai Baba’s birthplace of his own accord, but on the basis of some historians’ version.

“The editorial is written by Saamana’s editor [Sena MP Sanjay Raut]. It may be his personal opinion, but I do not believe it is the Shiv Sena’s … we will convince Mr. Thackeray that Pathri is indeed Sai Baba’s birthplace,” Mr. Durrani said.

On Sunday, Shirdi had observed a total shutdown in protest against Mr. Thackeray’s statement that Pathri was Sai Baba’s birthplace.

Parbhani residents have alleged that their Shirdi counterparts fear that the development of Pathri would have a detrimental effect on Shirdi’s economy by reducing the devotee footfall. Shirdi residents have argued that while they have no problems with funds being given to Pathri, the village should not be decreed Sai Baba’s birthplace because he had never mentioned his place of origin or religion.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/44sgmf/article30595992.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SHIRDI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sai-baba-birthplace-row-parbhani-group-to-ask-cm-to-form-committee/article30619656.ece
232,2020/01/22,High Court stays CAT order on Punjab DGP’s appointment,"The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday granted stay on the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, which had set aside the appointment of Punjab’s Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta from the top post.

Senior advocate Puneet Bali, the counsel for DGP Gupta, said the High court has stayed the CAT order.

The High Court also issued notice to the Punjab government, the Central government and other respondents.

The next date for hearing has been fixed for February 26.

In its directions, the High Court also ordered the Punjab government to file an affidavit on material that was sent to the Union Public Service Commission with regard to all the officers considered.

The Punjab government and the DGP had on January 20 approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the order of the CAT.

Last week, the CAT had set aside the appointment of Mr. Gupta as Punjab DGP. The CAT’s decision came on an appeal filed by two IPS officers, Mohammad Mustafa and Siddhharth Chattopadhyaya. Both officers had separately moved the tribunal last year challenging Mr. Gupta’s appointment and seeking its quashing.

233,2020/01/22,2 States junk NITI Aayog’s PPP model for health care,"Calling out the Centre’s purported attempts to privatise public health care, the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have junked a plan to link private medical colleges with government-run district hospitals through a public-private partnership (PPP) model across the country.

Pointing at the shortage of qualified doctors, the NITI Aayog admitted it was “practically not possible” for the Central and the State governments to bridge the gaps in medical education with their limited finances. Hence, the scheme, by combining the strengths of public and private sectors, would augment medical seats and rationalise the cost of education.

“We reject this scheme and will not implement it,” Madhya Pradesh Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat told The Hindu. “The intent of the State government is to provide complete health care services and continue doing that.”

If district hospitals were handed over to private players, where would the poor go, he asked. “Dalits, Adivasis, labourers, the last person in society, all depend on these hospitals. How can we give it in private hands?” he said.

Terming the “selling” of public health care to private players by the BJP government at the Centre “unacceptable” and “condemnable”, Chhattisgarh Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo had earlier said, “This assault on the common man by the BJP to help its few rich friends will not be tolerated. We have to understand that allowing private players in health care would mean higher expenses and an attack on common man’s pocket.”

Furthermore, he claimed on Twitter, it was another attack on cooperative federalism. “By snatching the subject of health care from the States the BJP wants to further its authoritarian agenda. We must oppose this tooth and nail... the BJP shouldn’t try to impose its anti-poor crony capitalist agenda on us.”

Additional expenditure on defence and burden of economic slowdown had compelled the Centre to see public health services as a source of revenue rather than fulfilling its commitments as a welfare state, according to the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a network of nonprofits working in the sector.

Under the scheme, the concessionaire, a private party, shall design, build, finance, operate and maintain the medical college and also upgrade, operate and maintain the associated district hospital with a minimum annual student intake of 150 MBBS seats.

The model agreement will allow the party’s control over the land and assets for 60 years, with a provision for extension. Moreover, the lease agreement for the site of the medical college would be for 99 years, at a subsidised lease rent of “8% of the circle rate of the land”.

“It is incomprehensible how the proposal to hand over public facilities to private entities for 60 years, that is for a whole generation, is being made,” said Amulya Nidhi, JSA member.”This means a whole generation will be at the mercy of this revenue generation model.”

The model distinguishes between ‘free patients’ and others based on their ability to pay, with the former requiring an authority’s sanction to procure a document proving it. The ‘free patients’ would be provided free consultation, drugs and diagnostics, but incur a Rs.10 registration fee too. The rest would be charged at “market competitive rates”.

Moreover, all the beds will be categorised as ‘regulated beds’ and ‘market beds’. With at least 750 minimum beds at a hospital, a minimum of 300 plus 20% of the remaining beds would be for ‘free patients’. Yet, the concessionaire will have the discretion to charge all patients alike on ancillary facilities like vehicle parking or cafeteria.

“The ‘regulated beds’ are implicitly for patients who are covered by Ayushman Bharat Yojana or other insurance. So though it is stated as ‘free’ care, the payment for these patients would mostly come from government itself,” said an analysis document prepared by the JSA.

As for medicines, while ‘free patients’ would get them free, others would be provided with them at subsidised rates.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/2-states-junk-niti-aayogs-ppp-model-for-health-care/article30619547.ece

235,2020/01/22,‘Need more women in politics and conflict resolution’,"Women’s participation in politics is essential to ensure policy making is more inclusive and the needs and concerns of women are better represented, says U.K.’s Special Envoy for Gender Equality Joanna Roper.

In India last week to attend the Raisina Dialogue, Ms. Roper also met officials of the Ministry of Women and Child Development to discuss possible India-U.K. collaboration on gender equality issues, school and college students and British businesses operating in India, with whom she held talks on tackling sexual harassment in the garments sector.

She advocates for a greater role for women in conflict resolution to ensure long-lasting peace. “Supporting women and girls’ meaningful mobilisation and participation in political life, mediation, conflict prevention, peace-building and in post-conflict processes to rebuild their countries and communities is essential to building lasting peace and stability. The U.K. will pursue diplomatic policies at multilateral and bilateral level to influence and transform the political environment in fragile and conflict-affected States to enable and encourage the participation of women in decision-making and support programme initiatives to enable women to play leadership roles,” Ms. Roper said in an interview with The Hindu.

Ms. Roper, appointed in February 2017, is the U.K.’s first Special Envoy for Gender Equality. Her role involves visiting different countries to work on domestic, diplomatic, development and defence issues. “Women account for a mere 2% of mediators, 8% negotiators and 5% witnesses to peace processes.

236,2020/01/22,CAA: parties poke fun at SAD,"With the BJP’s long-standing alliance partner, the Shiromani Akali Dal, deciding not to contest the Delhi Assembly polls, political parties in Punjab on Tuesday wasted no time in taking a dig at the Akali Dal.

SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal said the party had recorded its dissent and demanded that Muslims also be included in the new Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

“We have preferred to forsake contesting the Delhi Assembly elections rather than giving up our principled stand on the issue,” said Mr. Badal.

Chief Minister Amarinder Singh challenged the Akalis to quit the alliance at the Centre to prove their sincerity with regard to the legislation, which they were a party to passing in both the Houses of Parliament.

“Why don’t you (Akalis) walk the talk and show the people of India that you really stand against the divisive and destructive CAA?” quipped the Chief Minister. He urged the SAD Ministers in the Union Cabinet to immediately resign in support of their stated stand on the controversial legislation.

“If you found the CAA to be anti-Muslim, why did you support and pass the legislation in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha?” Capt. Amarinder asked the Akalis, adding that the support extended by the SAD to the legislation in Parliament was a matter of record.

‘Claim unacceptable’

Pointing out that Delhi was the second State after Haryana where SAD had decided not to go with their ally, the BJP, the Chief Minister said its claim that it had decided against contesting the Delhi polls on account of differences on CAA was preposterous and unacceptable.

“The decision to opt out of the Delhi elections was clearly motivated by political compulsions as the SAD had evidently realised it had no ground support and could not win even a single seat in the national capital,” he added.

Mr. Badal asked Capt. Amarinder to clarify if he was opposed to giving relief to the persecuted Sikhs under the CAA.

He said that by opposing the CAA, the Chief Minister was denying the relief given to Sikhs under the Act. “This does nothing except fulfil the anti-Sikh agenda of the Congress. If Capt. Amarinder is really serious about giving relief to the persecuted Sikhs in Pakistan and Afghanistan, he should join the SAD in seeking inclusion of Muslims in the CAA,” he said.

He added the SAD had simultaneously made it clear that it was against the National Register of Citizens.

The principal opposition, AAP, also hit out at the Akali Dal.

Senior leader of AAP and Leader of the Opposition, Harpal Singh Cheema, said: “The Badals favoured the CAA in Parliament, and back home in Punjab were shedding crocodile tears to exhibit their abiding love for the Muslim community.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/33ibpy/article30619531.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22CAPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/caa-parties-poke-fun-at-sad/article30619532.ece
237,2020/01/22,HR&CE official admits making false charge against judiciary,"An official from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department, who accused the judiciary of constructing a combined court building in Kangeyam on a land allegedly belonging to his department and demanded ₹450 crore as compensation, has now admitted that his accusation was false.

The admission was made during an inquiry conducted by Tiruppur Principal District and Sessions Judge S. Alli on January 8, legal sources privy to the developments told The Hindu. M. Kannadhasan, an Assistant Commissioner of HR&CE, who was the Executive Officer of Subramanyaswamy Temple, Sivanmalai, wrote the letter in October 2019. The letter was addressed to higher officials in the HR&CE Department and the judiciary, including Ms. Alli. He calculated this amount for a period between July 14, 2012 and October 31, 2019, according to legal sources.

Land acquisition

Following this, Ms. Alli ordered an inquiry based on records available with the Revenue Department, which revealed that the land in Kangeyam, upon which the court building was constructed, was acquired as early as in 1932 by the then Coimbatore District Collector. In 1999, the State government issued an order (G.O. No. 156) to hand over the land to the judiciary. The HR&CE Department had nothing to do with this piece of land, legal sources said.

During the inquiry on January 8, Mr. Kannadhasan allegedly admitted that he wrote the letter in his “assumption.”

In a statement, he wrote that he was not aware that the land was handed over to the judiciary until the inquiry process began, according to legal sources. Ms. Alli is yet to decide on further action in this issue.

A senior HR&CE official, who attended the inquiry, said he was unaware of the intent of Mr. Kannadhasan in writing a letter without proper evidence. Further action would be taken against him after obtaining all details of the inquiry, the HR&CE official said. Mr. Kannadhasan was not available for comment.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hrce-official-admits-making-false-charge-against-judiciary/article30628192.ece

239,2020/01/22,Grant for electricity discoms: industry welcomes move,"The Tamilnadu Electricity Consumers’ Association has welcomed the proposal of the Central Government to extend a grant of ₹1.1 lakh crore to State Power Distribution Companies (discoms) under a new bailout scheme.

The Association president S.R. Rabindar said the proposal, when implemented, wouldl boost the discoms that were financially weak and are unable to make further investments.

“It is a positive measure for the power sector, given availability of grants for infrastructure upgrade and chance to improve operational efficiency of the discoms,” he said.

Infrastructure upgrade

The Scheme mandates that such discoms either privatise operations or appoint distribution franchisees and invest in infrastructure upgrade.

The Government expects to spur nearly ₹3 lakh crore investment in the distribution sector through the restructuring scheme.

“The scheme is a reform and result-oriented where distribution companies will invest first and get money later - only when they perform,” according to the Association.

Proper investment in the distribution sector will curtain distribution loss and improve efficiency of power. “We also feel, subsidy release from government to discoms will remain critical for ensuring a sustainable improvement in financial position of discoms,” Mr. Rabindar said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/grant-for-electricity-discoms-industry-welcomes-move/article30628175.ece

Viktor Soderberg, partner at JRS Asset Management and chairman of AGERUS AM, a technology company, who was in the city recently, told The Hindu that there are several companies in Sweden that have exposure to India and other emerging markets, including Brazil, south east Asia and now African countries.

“So, it is relevant to keep track of the emerging markets,” he said on the purpose of his visit to India.

Stockholm is a hub for technology companies and there is a huge need for IT workforce. “That is an added reason why I came to India,” he said. Mr. Soderberg is looking at holding meetings with IT companies in which his company has invested in or work with in Sweden and see how capacities can be developed and collaborations can be established with IT companies in India, including Coimbatore.

He also wants to facilitate joint ventures between Indian and Swedish companies so that capital investments can be made later in India.

In India, English knowledge, IT competency, economy based on private initiatives, and the potential to be tapped are all advantages.. “That makes it interesting to invest here, personally for me and with my partners,” he said. However, there is a lack of investment in infrastructure and India should have direct flight connectivity with Stockholm.

Investment in small infrastructure projects such as roads and water are opportunities. In Sweden there is a lot of interest in sustainable textiles.

243,2020/01/22,Delay in construction of classrooms forces students to sit in the open,"Delay in construction of classrooms has forced the students of the upgraded Government Higher Secondary School at Devarmalai in Bargur Hills to study in the open.

Started in 1963 to educate children from the villages of Eratti, Minthangi, Onthanai, Vellimalai, Elachipalayam, Kalavari and a few other areas, the school was upgraded as elementary school in 2002 and as high school in 2011. Though upgrading of the school helped students continue their studies after Class VIII, the school lacked enough classrooms to accommodate all students.

The school has a strength of 220 students in Classes I to V, and 306 students in Classes VI to X. The State government in 2016 allotted ₹1.68 crore for construction of a building for the high school with 12 classrooms. Delay in identification of land took two years and finally a land was identified, about half a km from the school, and work began in 2018. In the same year, the school was upgraded as higher secondary and now there are 11 students in Plus One. Since classrooms are not available, five classes are conducted under the shade of a tree, and two classrooms function from a community hall in the area.

“The situation turns worse during rainy season and summer, as students cannot sit in the open”, a parent said.

The school needs a minimum of 14 classrooms, four rooms for laboratory, library and office and a staff room for teachers. Though the school received 20 computers, due to non-availability of a lab, they remain unpacked. Speaking on anonymity, a villager said that the situation was same for many years now. “New building work began two years ago and is yet to be completed”, he said and wanted the works expedited.

Chief Education Officer R. Balamurali told The Hindu that flooring work needs to be done in the new building after which power connection would be given.

Senthilkumar, coordinator of Friends of Police (FoP) in Coimbatore, and two of his associates for allegedly duping a man of ₹ 3.98 lakh by promising to allot housing plots near Annur.

The Peelamedu police (Crime) said that Senthilkumar, who is also into real estate business, his associates R. Eswaran and Krishnamoorthy were booked under Sections 120B (Criminal conspiracy) 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust) and 420 (Cheating) of the IPC on Tuesday based on a complaint filed by V. Vijayakumar of Balan Nagar near Peelamedu.

According to the police, Vijayakumar knew Senthilkumar for 15 years. He alleged in his complaint that Senthilkumar proposed him a deal in 2013 for the sale of two plots of a property named Aishwaryam Garden at Kanuvakkarai near Annur for monthly instalments.

Property

Trusting Senthilkumar, the complainant decided to buy the property and paid ₹ 20,000 as advance to Eswaran in the form of a cheque.

Eswaran later signed an agreement with the complaint that assured him to allot plots 78 and 79 of Aishwaryam Garden for ₹ 2,91,800 including the advance payment and monthly instalments of ₹ 7,550 for 36 months.

As told by Eswaran, the complainant paid the monthly instalments to Krishnamoorthy for which receipts in the name of Selvanayaki Promoters and Selvanayaki Real Estate were given.

Though the complainant asked the accused to complete the registration of the plots by paying the full amount before September 2016, he was told that the plots were yet to get approvals for sale. Instead, the accused proposed to sell plots 12, 21, 30 of Aishwaryam Garden by paying an additional sum of ₹ 1,85,500.

The police said that the complainant was not allotted the plots though he paid ₹3,98,600 to the accused in total including the ₹ 1,85,500 and monthly instalments from 2013. Also, he found that the housing plots assured by the accused were already sold to another person.

The police said that a detailed investigation was under way in connection with the alleged cheating.

An additional sum of ₹ 15 lakh was sought as the forest division found the initial sum released by the Finance Department was inadequate, said the official.

According to Debasis Jana, Additional Principal Conservator of Forests, (Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle), at least ₹ 25 lakh is required for the construction of a kraal.

He said that a proposal was already sent to senior officials of the Forest Department which forwarded it to the Finance Department. The forest division was yet to get a communication on the allocation of additional funds, he said.

According to him, best quality log is required for the construction of the kraal.

In October 2018, forest department officials had said that ₹ 10 lakh was released under the ‘Project Elephant’ scheme for the construction of a kraal at the Chadivayal elephant camp.

The construction of a kraal was proposed by Coimbatore forest division as it does not have the facility for the rescue and rehabilitation of wild elephants in Coimbatore.

249,2020/01/22,"Public exams: teachers, officials hope for a bump up in State rankings","With less than two months to go for the public examinations, teachers and education officials hope for a bump up in State rankings for Coimbatore district this year.

In 2019, the district ranked fourth in the State in the Class XII public examinations with a pass percentage of 95.01. The district ranked 14th in the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examinations for Class X with a pass percentage of 96.44. In Class XI public examinations, Coimbatore district stood third in the State with a pass percentage of 97.67 last year.

T. Arulanandam, State body member of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers Association, said there was a good chance for improvement in results in Class XII with the introduction of internal marks and reduction in the evaluation marks. “Earlier, students were writing for 200 marks. Now, for physics, chemistry, botany and zoology, they will be writing for only 70 marks,” he said. This might prove to be an advantage for the students and enable them to score better, according to Mr. Arulanandam, who is also a teacher in a government-aided school in the city.

This year, for the first time, the students of Class V and Class VIII will be facing public examinations. According to an education official, the schools have collected the particulars of students studying in Class V and Class VIII in all the four educational districts (Coimbatore, Perur, S.S. Kulam and Pollachi) and have started uploading those into the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) portal.

Allaying apprehensions expressed by sections of parents and teachers, the official said that Class V and VIII students would not be detained or “failed” based on the performance in these examinations. “There is no pressure among the students and teachers,” the official claimed, adding that these examinations would help students strengthen their basics as they moved on to higher classes.

Echoing a similar opinion, Mr. Arulanandam said that it would help the students have some ‘seriousness’ for Class IX examinations from next year. “This is the first time in nearly 10 years that the Class IX students are required to study the entire syllabus for the exams and they are struggling,” he said, as the students were used to giving only term-wise examinations until last year. However, Mr. Arulanandam said that the Department of School Education must provide adequate clarity on the question paper pattern for the public examinations to allay confusions in the minds of students.

Regarding the uncertainty over the examination centre for Classes V and VIII, the officials said no announcement had been made from the Department of School Education yet. The Class V and VIII students would mostly not be instructed to write the examinations in other schools, the official opined.

Another education official said the schools had been instructed to focus more on Class X to improve the SSLC ranking, with special classes and revision tests being conducted for the students. “They will be writing three revision tests prior to the public exams,” the official said, with each exam testing the students in the complete syllabus.

The Class XI and Class XII students would write two revision tests prior to the public exams. The students of Classes X, XI and XII were also preparing for the practical examinations scheduled to be held on February 3.

P. Ayyanan, Coimbatore Chief Educational Officer, said there would be an improvement in the public examinations for Classes X, XI and XII. “There will be a subject-wise review meeting for the headmasters and teachers to discuss the improvement in the results,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ep9vmu/article30619498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB22SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/public-exams-teachers-officials-hope-for-a-bump-up-in-state-rankings/article30619499.ece

254,2020/01/22,Remove illegal constructions from south Delhi forests: NGT,"The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi government to remove encroachments in south Delhi’s Jaunpur and Dera Mandi forest lands and restore it to its original condition.

A Bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel observed that monitoring is required to be at a higher level. “Let further steps in the matter be taken expeditiously,” the Bench said.

The directions came when the green panel was hearing petitioner Amarjit Singh Nalwa and others seeking execution of an order passed by the NGT in 2015, which had directed the government to remove encroachments.

The plea had contended that unauthorised constructions were taking place in the area and authorities had not taken steps to curb the violations. However, during the hearing, the Forest Department had informed the Tribunal in August 2019 that the illegal constructions were demolished. The Delhi High Court had later ordered status quo on the demolition process after certain petitioners moved court against the demolition.

While observing that facts were “not projected” before the court, the NGT said: “It is admitted that counsel for the department itself made a statement that there was no demolition programme which was sought to be later on withdrawn.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/remove-illegal-constructions-from-south-delhi-forests-ngt/article30619671.ece
255,2020/01/22,"Senior citizens, widows demand pension hike before elections","Shanti Devi, a 70-year-old widow, spends her days cleaning houses in Okhla to earn a meagre sum as she has not got her government pension for over two years. “I went to the social welfare office. I showed them my passbook, my Aadhaar card, but they just gave me a slip saying my pension has been stopped and told me to approach the local MLA,” she says, pulling a creased bank passbook out of a small shopping bag held together with a safety pin. She can’t read it with eyes dulled by cataract, but it clearly shows that she last received her pension in October 2017.

She was one of the hundreds of elderly people, mostly women, who gathered at Jantar Mantar for a protest under the Pension Parishad banner on Tuesday, demanding universal old age pensions of at least half the minimum wage. Delhi currently gives a monthly pension of ₹2,000-₹2,500 (depending on age and community) to five lakh pensioners, including senior citizens, widows and differently abled. The minimum wage in the State is ₹14,842.

“This needs to be a poll issue. There are 18 lakh voters in Delhi who are senior citizens and along with their families, they are an important vote bank. Delhi’s political parties must take their demands seriously,” said Nikhil Dey, convener of the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, one of the over 100 organisations belonging to the Pension Parishad. He estimated that 10 lakh Delhi residents would be eligible for a pension.

What leaders say

Speaking at the event, Congress MP Kirti Azad reiterated his party’s promise to provide a universal monthly pension of ₹5,000 if they come to power in the State. He pointed out that given the spiralling prices, poor families were unable to take care of their elderly relatives with dignity without the support of social security nets such as a reasonable pension.

Aam Aadmi Party leader Ajoy Kumar was more circumspect. He only promised to “open up” the pension system, noting that budgetary concerns need to be taken into account.

“You need to cut your cloth according to your budget...Delhi already pays one of the highest pensions among States. It is more important to increase the base of pensioners before we consider hiking the amount.Our first step will be to ensure direct transfer of pension to bank accounts so that beneficiaries do not have to go running from pillar to post. Next, we will look at a detailed survey to identify cut-off criteria.Those who are income tax payees or get a company pension do not need government help,” Mr. Kumar said.

He also claimed that the infamous “MLA quota system” had already been removed. However, elderly people at the protest site claimed they were being told that the “quota” of pensioners for their constituency was closed, and referred to their local legislators for help to get into the quota. Pension Parishad activists also said the government demanded extensive documentation which result in the wrongful exclusion of many people, especially migrants and widows.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/5p3yb9/article30619662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DEOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/senior-citizens-widows-demand-pension-hike-before-elections/article30619663.ece

The situation in the university is turning normal and students who want to study should not be disturbed, the Minister said.

Last year in October, JNU administration announced a hike in hostel fee, including introduction of service and utility charges. Following this, students took to streets demanding a roll back, prompting the HRD Ministry to form a panel to mediate between the agitating students and the administration.

257,2020/01/22,JNUSU moves HC against hostel manual amendment,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court challenging the Inter Hostel Administration (IHA) decision amending the hostel manual which has provisions for fee hike.

The university students have been on a strike for over three months over the hike in hostel fee.

The petition filed by JNUSU president Aishe Ghosh has sought quashing of the minutes of the 283rd meeting of the Executive Council (EC) held on November 13 last year ratifying the IHA decision and the high-level committee of November 25, 2019 making further amendments to the hostel manual.

The petition said, the “decisions are malafide, arbitrary and illegal and adversely affect the student community of the university bringing far reaching changes to the provisions of the hostel manual”.

Various changes

The amendments to the hostel manual pertains to increase in hostel fee, affects rights of those in the reserved categories vis-a-vis allocation of hostel rooms and also reduces the representation of the JNUSU in the IHA.

The petition pointed out that the minutes of the IHA meeting also stated that mess services, sanitation services, room charges, amongst others category of charges will be increased by 10% every academic year, i.e., from the monsoon semester.

The students’ union further contended that the IHA was held with no student representation, “defeating the mandate of the hostel manual of including the views of the stakeholders when changing the provisions of the manual”.

Subsequent to the amendments, JNUSU and hostel presidents wrote to the JNU administration on various occasions bringing to their attention the illegalities. “However, the university refused to take any action and in fact allowed the ratification of this illegal meeting,” the petition stated.

It had asked the High Court to quash the decisions of the IHA and to reconvene a fresh IHA as per law.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ke48r2/article30619545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL22-HC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnusu-moves-hc-against-hostel-manual-amendment/article30619546.ece

Varma wrote a letter to party president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar asking for “ideological clarity” on the alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar.

He sought Mr. Kumar’s opinion “especially at a time when the BJP, through the CAA-NPR-NRC combine, has embarked on a massive socially divisive agenda”.

“This is the first time that we will broadening and extending our party’s association with the BJP through a formal electoral alliance, beyond Bihar…I am deeply perplexed by this development and look to you for ideological clarity,” wrote Mr. Varma, who is also the JD(U) national general secretary.

In the two-page letter, Mr. Varma also reminded the CM of his confession to him about “grave apprehensions” regarding BJP-RSS combine.

“In my first meeting with you in Patna in August 2012 you had spoken to me at length and with conviction on why Narendra Modi and his policies are inimical for the country,” wrote Mr. Varma. “When you were leading the Mahagathbandhan you had openly made a call for RSS Mukt Bharat… these views articulated for a sustained period, are a matter of public record”.

The JD(U) will be contesting the Burari and Sangam Vihar seats in Delhi. It had earlier said it would fight in all 70 seats. The LJP will contest from Seemapuri.

Mr. Varma had earlier written a letter Mr. Kumar urging him to not support CAA, NRC and NPR.Party sources told The Hindu that Mr. Varma and JD(U) leader Prashant Kishor, have fallen out of Mr. Kumar’s proximity. The leaders also do not figure in the list of 20 star campaigners of JD(U) for the Delhi elections.

“I remember your confession to me about how the current BJP leadership has humiliated you. You maintained that the BJP is leading India into a ‘dangerous space’ and is destroying institutions and that there is a need for democratic and socialist forces within the country to regroup, a task for which you assigned a senior party official,” Mr. Varma wrote.

“If these are your real views, I fail to understand how the JD(U) is now extending its alliance with the BJP beyond Bihar when even long-standing allies of the BJP like the Shiromani Akali Dal, have refused to do so”, he wrote.

261,2020/01/22,Shaheen Bagh protesters send legal notice to BJP IT cell chief,"Upset over allegations that they are being paid to protest against the amended citizenship law, the women at Shaheen Bagh have sent a defamation notice to BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya demanding an apology and ₹1 crore in damages.

Two of the protesters sent the notice to Mr. Malviya accusing him of spreading “false propaganda”.

“You [Mr. Malviya], and other entities, have raised several false allegations, such as protesters comprise of people paid for becoming a part of the crowd,” read the legal notice sent through advocate Mehmood Pracha.

“A video posted and endorsed by you on Twitter, which has been played across several media platforms, alleged that the protesters are taking ₹500-₹700 to be a part of the protest,” the legal notice read.

“Such statements are not only false but also have an effect of defaming the protesters in the national and international community,” it read. The notice also asked Mr. Malviya “to cease and desist from spreading propaganda against the protesters”.

“The protesters at Shaheen Bagh have carved out a unique identity owing to several factors such as the involvement of women, and the completely peaceful and lawful conduct of the protestors for over a month despite vociferous and fervent voice of dissent which they are raising,” said Mr. Pracha.

He added that the protesters belong to a wide socio-economic spectrum, “the rich, the poor; Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, and all other religious groups; and people from all castes and creeds”.

The legal notice further read: “Due to the inability of the law enforcement agencies and other figures to quell the protest by various means, now steps are being taken to discredit and defame the protesters by spreading propaganda about their credentials, through media and individuals”.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lu5mwv/article30619481.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22DEBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-protesters-send-legal-notice-to-bjp-it-cell-chief/article30619482.ece
262,2020/01/22,Exercise for preparing ‘realistic’ budget outlay commences,"Telangana government is getting ready for its budget preparation for 2020-21 with the Finance Department starting its department-wise meetings from Wednesday.

A preparatory meeting held by the Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar last week with various department officials made it clear that the budget estimates for the 2020-2021 financial year should be realistic in tune with the prevailing economic situation.

The budget is expected to be presented in the third week of February after the presentation of Union Budget on February 1 that gives clarity about Central fund allocation to the State.

The department-wise meetings with the Finance Department will be wrapped up before this month-end and then the departments will discuss their proposals with the Chief Secretary, and finally the Chief Minister, for approval.

The expectation is that the budget outlay for 2020-21 will not be much higher than that of ₹1.46 lakh crore of current fiscal given the fall in the GDP growth of the country and fall in expected revenue for the State due to slowdown.

The departments would look at the expenditure incurred so far in the nine months of the current fiscal and prepare the estimates realistically for the next budget 2020-21. The approval of the Minister concerned for the budget estimates should be obtained and new works with high expenditure would be set aside and those projects that were already commenced and nearing completion be given priority.

The Chief Secretary also gave instructions that there should be no dearth of funds for government’s priority programmes in the budget estimates.

The vote on account that was presented in February 2019 with an outlay of ₹1.82 lakh crore was pruned to ₹1.46 lakh crore in September last year when full budget was presented for 2019-20 owing to economic slowdown witnessed across the country.

Instructions

About two months ago, instructions were also given to the departments to restrict their expenditure in tune with fall in the revenue.

Of the ₹1.46 lakh crore outlay, ₹10,000 crore has been expected to be mobilised from land sales but that did not materialise.

Thus the actual budget outlay for 2019-20 is ₹1.36 lakh crore.

At one time, the shortfall in the revenue expenditure was about ₹15,000 crore but with recent revision of liquor prices, the tax revenue improved and the revenue growth rate by the end of December increased to 9.1% from below 3%.

The official sources said that they hoped to close the financial year by bringing down the shortfall to meet the estimated budget expenditure for 2019-20.

The government the other day gave administrative sanction for ₹5,100 crore under Rythu Bandhu and ₹3,000 crore would be released first once the Agriculture Department furnished the details of bank accounts of farmers in a day or two.

Market borrowings

Meanwhile, the State, which availed ₹27,000 crore loans through market borrowings so far, can avail another ₹6,000 crore under the FRBM limit of 3.25% of GSDP by the end of current fiscal.

This should help in meeting the estimated budget expenditure for the current fiscal, sources said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nzw5tz/article30628041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY23ASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/exercise-for-preparing-realistic-budget-outlay-commences/article30628042.ece
263,2020/01/22,"Petition against CAA, NRC demonstrations in Old City","A businessman knocked the doors of Telangana High Court seeking a direction to police department not to permit the proposed demonstration to be held by United Muslim Action Committee (UMAC) and the Majlis-e-Ithehadul Muslimeen (MIM) party on January 25 midnight at Charminar in Old City.

The petitioner said the police should also be instructed to ensure that the UMAC and the MIM stopped the campaign for the meeting as no permission was granted to them yet. The petitioner T. Uma Mahendra of Petlaburj apprehended that the demonstration protesting Centre’s Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) might trigger trouble in the communally sensitive Old City.

The petitioner contended that some legislators of MIM had a history of making provocative speeches and were facing cases in this regard. If permission was granted to the demonstration, the possibility of recurrence of such speeches could not be ruled out, the petitioner stated. Violence erupted in some parts of the country while staging demonstrations and rallies against CAA and NRC, the petitioner maintained.

The procession and demonstration was at midnight and being organised at a point which had in the past witnessed communal violence, the businessman said in the petition. Since the event was being planned the night before Republic Day, adequate police force would not be available for security arrangements, the petitioner said.

The UMAC and the MIM had taken out a rally culminating in a meeting at Shastripuram on the same issue on this January 10. The organisers announced at that meeting that they would hold a protest rally and demonstration on the midnight of January 25 though by then the police had not granted permission to them for the event, the petitioner said.

While the organisers continued to make statements about the meeting calling people to attend it despite not securing permission, the police had not made any efforts to stop them from doing so, the petitioner charged.

264,2020/01/22,Mockery of democracy: BJP,"The BJP has charged the TRS government of misusing the official machinery, resorting to distribution of money and liquor in the polls held for the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), and making a ‘complete mockery of democracy’.

“The TRS bigwigs claimed that their schemes and performance will fetch them votes but the manner in which the party went about with its intimidation tactics in several places, making use of the police, especially targeting our party candidates, exposed their hollow claims,” charged party president K. Laxman.

Addressing a press meet, he claimed at several places the TRS party activists resorted to large scale irregularities, “raided” Opposition candidates, and more so the BJP candidates, with the police refusing to register any case or take action. It was more blatant at Ramagundam where former MLA S. Satyanarayana had to hold a protest outside the police station demanding action.

“The TRS bragged we are not even in the fray, then why were they so desperate to threaten our party candidates? They first deleted the voters names arbitrarily and then resorted to bogus voting in many municipalities. It was evident at Nizamabad where 10 women were held by the police,” he said.

Nevertheless, the BJP, which is contesting the ULBs independently for the first time - in 2,070 wards and supporting 200 independents in municipalities and 344 divisions with extending support to 20 independents in municipal corporations - will spring a surprise as it was the main opponent to the ruling party, he observed.

Mr. Laxman welcomed the introduction of the facial recognition app introduced by the State Election Commission (SEC) and demanded it be made mandatory in all future elections to control the bogus voting.

“It is not at all surprising that the Majlis are objecting to it because they depend a lot on bogus voting,” he said. However, the party president found fault with the SEC for not directing the IT/ITES firms to give a holiday to employees to enable them to vote.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/mockery-of-democracy-bjp/article30628004.ece
265,2020/01/22,"With a peaceful poll, Bhainsa sets aside communal divide","Peace that had prevailed during polling for the Bhainsa Municipal Council election, and voters’ enthusiasm as they queued up outside the polling stations on Wednesday perhaps presented a solution to bridge the deep communal divide.

There is no denying the fact that citizens of this communally sensitive town in Nirmal district got sharply polarised post January 12 and 13 communal violence. But it has also shown that there is hope for communities to co-exist peacefully.

Glaring example

A glaring example is voters of the violence-hit Korbagalli, which falls under ward number 24. A Muslim candidate, Nishab Kausar, contested on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ticket, and was assured support from the ward’s Hindu voters, according to a voter whose house in Korbagalli also suffered damage during the recent violence.

Top police officials, including Nirmal Superintendent of Police (SP) C. Shashidhar Raju, are of the strong opinion that the solution lay in community policing. “It is because of such unstinting efforts for the last 10 days that today’s proceedings were peaceful,” he asserted.

Polling percentage in the 23 wards where election was held confirmed to the general trend in other municipalities in the former composite Adilabad district. This is an indication that locals have got back to their usual business, and peace restored. In fact, more voters seem to have voted in the six hyper sensitive polling stations since the start of polling.

Peaceful atmosphere

“We interacted a lot with people from both sides, assuring them of creating a peaceful atmosphere so that they can vote fearlessly,” said Mr. Raju, heading a sizable force keeping peace in the town. “The atmosphere was indeed peaceful,” vouched Jingurolla Poshetti, a voter from Korbagalli, who participated in the polling.

“The Rapid Action Force and Telangana State Special Police contingents have been patrolling localities on foot. Election General Observer Shruti Ojha also interacted with voters,” the SP recounted, giving some confidence-building measures taken up for maintaining peace during polling.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/c1wb8k/article30631164.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/bhainsajpeg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/with-a-peaceful-poll-bhainsa-sets-aside-communal-divide/article30631166.ece

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy instructed the NIT to convey the decision of the senate on the student’s plea to it on Monday. The petitioner, a first year B. Tech student, filed an appeal before the bench seeking a direction to the NIT to permit him to appear for classes.

Referring to the counter affidavit filed by the NIT, the bench observed that it appeared to be questioning the rights of the student to approach the court rather than reasoning the multiple punishments awarded to the student. NIT counsel Mahender Rao told the bench that if the barred student was permitted to appear for classes, it would set a precedent and other students facing similar situation might move the HC seeking similar relief.

But the principles of natural justice provide an opportunity for the aggrieved party to approach the court and the student cannot be deprived of such right, the bench noted. Mr. Rao told the court that the petitioner had an option to appeal over the decision before the senate but instead approached the court.

In that case, the senate could hold a meeting and take a decision on the student’s plea at the earliest, the bench said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-directs-nit-to-hold-senate-meeting-on-students-plea/article30627509.ece
267,2020/01/22,End in sight to row over staff repatriation,"The stalemate over repatriation of over 700 Class III and Class IV employees of Telangana origin allotted to Andhra Pradesh post-bifurcation appears to be heading for a resolution.

Vacancy position

The State government is understood to have asked the Secretaries and heads of departments to come up with vacancy position in their respective departments so that these employees can be brought back to the State.

According to estimates prepared by the officials, of the more than 56,400 employees who were allotted between the two States after bifurcation, 936 employees who opted for Telangana were allotted to Andhra Pradesh.

About 100 employees who did not exercise the option and another 15 who accepted to work in either of the States too were allotted to the neighbouring State, taking the total number to around 1,050.

The number of Class IV and Class III employees among those allotted to AP is little over 800. Of these, around 100 retired from services over the past five-and-half years since bifurcation.

In all, 176 employees of Telangana origin are still working in the AP Secretariat and 538 in the offices of the heads of departments who made several representations for their repatriation ever since the Andhra Pradesh government formalised its plans to shift a major chunk of Secretariat departments as well as HoDs to Visakhapatnam. It was accordingly decided to ascertain the vacancy position first, based on which a formal request seeking repatriation of the employees could be forwarded to the AP government.

Priority categories

The Telangana government, according to sources, has decided to first bring back Class IV and Class III staff working in Amaravati. Among these, top priority would be given to widows, single women and those nearing the age of retirement.

“The remaining employees too will be brought back based on the vacancy position,” a senior official told The Hindu.

The departments concerned had been asked to furnish the details of vacancies as early as possible so that modalities for bringing back the Telangana origin employees could be worked out and necessary proposals could be sent to the neighbouring State after obtaining the consent of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/end-in-sight-to-row-over-staff-repatriation/article30627480.ece

“The incident happened in M S Makhta area. This is the winter season and the time when dogs mate. What could have happened is that the dog was mating, and was disturbed.

273,2020/01/22,Digital museum on Kanchi Mahaswami opened,"Sri Kanchi Mahaswami Vidya Mandir, Rajakilpakkam, Tambaram, a residential school, which offers an integrated system of Vedic and regular stream of education, witnessed an important event — the dedication of a permanent exhibition on the life and teachings of the 68th head of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati. ‘Anugraha Varsha,’ the digital museum, inaugurated on Tuesday, January 21, comes as a crowning glory to the school — a unit of the Sri Kanchi Mahaswami Trust. The institution is a pioneering initiative of the Pitam to keep the Vedic root alive even while adapting to the demands of a modern society.

Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati, 70th pontiff of the Pitam, led the illustrious team of guests — Mohan Bhagwat, head of Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh and Swami Omkarananda, Swami Chidbhavananda Ashramam, Vedapuri, Theni. Mr. Bhagwat had airdashed from Nagpur especially to attend the inauguration ceremony. He toured the tastefully mounted images in the air-conditioned museum stopping to look at each exhibit with the Sankaracharya and Dr. V. Shankar, Trust Chairman, explaining the context and significance. In his keynote address, Dr. Shankar underlined the success of the Vedic-CBSE curriculum, with the huge gathering of students, parents and guests cheering.

The Rajakilpakkam campus was one of the first of its kind to impart education in two different streams, both combining in harmony to shape an individual — sharp in mind, strong in body and sound in intellect. “A human being is not complete without a well-rounded core, which is trained in the matters of body, mind and soul. Victory without values has no merit; a meaningful life rather than a successful life elevates a man. A beginning in this direction is made in this school, which offers young vidyartis (students) an integrated module of education,” said Mr. Bhagawat. “Mahaswami did not stop with advocating Dharmic principles but himself lived such a life, setting an example. The exhibition, which clearly shows his remarkable life, should be seen by all,” he said.

In his address, the Sankaracharya lauded the efforts of the Trust, led by V. Shankar, Chairman, in making the concept a thriving model. The museum, an impeccable reflection of Mahaswami’s life and philosophy, should expand to include the history of the Kanchi Kamakoti Pitam, established by Adi Sankara. His Anugraha Bhashanam was followed by the launch of the Hindi translation of Deivathin Kural, a mammoth work by R. Ganapati, who compiled the preachings of Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati. Param Vani, a publication of Sri Kanchi Mahaswami Trust, was released by Mr. Bhagwat. In his address, Sri Omkarananda blessed the Trust’s endeavour and the museum, which is the latest addition to its impressive gallery of achievements.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/czybn0/article30625335.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24FRKANCHI,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/digital-museum-on-kanchi-mahaswami-opened/article30625337.ece

275,2020/01/22,Agropark to open industrial park at Koothattukulam,"Agropark, the Piravom-based agri and food business incubator, is all set to open an industrial park at Koothattukulam.

According to Agropark chairman Baiju Nedumkery, the private industrial park would be a welcome addition to the space provided by Kinfra.

The park, which is expected to be thrown open to industrialists in the first week of February, has a built up space of 2 lakh sq. ft. spread over a campus of 13 acres. “The infrastructure is near complete and we have already inquiries for about 20,000 sq. ft. Many of the entrepreneurs maturing out of the Agropark are also in need of space. We will be offering space starting from 1,000 sq. ft. onwards. Once fully up and running it is likely to generate around 1,000 jobs,” said Mr. Nedumkery.

Apart from offering space, the park will have a licence and registration help desk, which effectively means that industrialists can just walk in and start operations without being bogged down by the formalities for securing licences. “We will also offer the occupants with support for marketing their products and to conduct and participate in exhibitions,” he said.

A staff recruiting cell, affordable rent pattern, canteen and hostel facility, board room and seminar hall, round-the-clock power backup, and MC Road connectivity are among the other features of the park.

Plans are there to offer special benefits to woman industrialists like relaxations in rent. “Besides, industrialists setting up shop in the park will be extended the service of the Kerala Bureau of Industrial Promotion, which will facilitate their participation in exhibitions in India and abroad,” said Mr. Nedumkery.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/private-industrial-park-at-koothattukulam/article30621687.ece
276,2020/01/22,Container lorry strike called off,"The indefinite strike called by a group of drivers of lorries serving International Container Transshipment Terminal on Vallarpadam Island was withdrawn following talks held with District Collector S. Suhas here on Tuesday evening.

The drivers had decided to go on strike from Tuesday midnight after they complained that a scanner established at the container terminal for cargo clearance posed a possible health risk.

An official release said that drivers would not be forced to go through the scanner. Only those who were willing need to take the lorries through the scanner, it said.

Charles George of the Coordination Committee had said that a section of the drivers of the nearly 100 container lorries serving the transshipment terminal had decided to organise a strike to press their demands that included arrangements to examine whether the drivers taking the lorries through the scanner had not suffered from the effects of radiation as well as a special insurance scheme for these drivers.

The Coordination Committee had also demanded awareness classes on the use of the scanner for the stakeholders so that the fears expressed by them could be dispelled. The strike was described as an uncalled for one since the medical board constituted to examine the fears expressed by the drivers had certified that there was no health risk involved in taking the container lorries through the scanner. Port Trust sources said that the medical board report was categorical in its report on the health issue of the drivers.

The medial board report had also suggested that a special pool of drivers formed more than a year ago to take the container lorries through the scanner could be disbanded in view of the findings of the board.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/container-lorry-strike-called-off/article30621629.ece

278,2020/01/22,For an inclusive stage,"Of late, Hyderabad has been slowly and steadily making room for the queer community. Now, theatre heralds this inclusive environment by opening its space to a new artiste — transwoman Harshini Mekala who plays the role of Bindiya in Badlav a Hindi production. To be staged by city-based theatre group The Unknown Pen, the play written and directed by Amaan Ahmed revolves around the consciousness of a person and tackles it with a dose of existentialism, surrealism and absurdism. Having staged it twice so far, a show each at Phoenix Arena and Lamakaan, the team gears up for a third show, this time at Lamakaan, on February 6.

Amaan breaks barriers as the play brings a bold story on stage; protagonist Gayatri likes her step brother Ramesh, who wants to transform into a woman — Bindiya. “Any individual is free to think and become what they want to be; why should society create hurdles,” asks Amaan whose search for a transgender to play Bindiya’s character led him to Harshini, a HR executive in Jones Long LaSalle (JLL).

Harshini had shifted to Hyderabad from Mumbai only six months ago and found this opportunity a stepping stone to her acting dreams. After a month-long theatre training, Harshini honed her skills and gait, voice, eye movements and facial expressions. “Some people were intrigued watching her perform but no one knew she was a transwoman,” recalls the director. Appreciating her quick learning skills, Amaan remarks art should not have any restrictions. He says, “Art should be free and wild. I know many people who are homophobic and I want to to break that mindset and bring transgenders and drag queens on stage so that they too explore and learn.”

Three years ago Rammohan Holagundi of Nishumbita theatre group wanted to cast a transgender artiste in his play Life of a Hijra. “I didn’t find any transgender artiste,” he recollects. His actors transformed into four trans characters. The two-hour play traced the journey of a transgender person, the desires and dreams, and identity. “It portrayed raw emotions and showed how painful and difficult feelings are when a woman is trapped in a man’s body. Theatre in Hyderabad is opening up finally, and I am glad it is happening now.”

Harshini was eight when she realised she was in a ‘wrong body.’ Although her biggest support was her mother, she worried transgenders had a rough deal and their only livelihood would be through begging or prostitution. “She wanted me to live with dignity, so she even went against my farmer father to help me pursue post-graduation,” she says, adding that she studied as a male as colleges would not give admission to people like her.

After graduation, Harshini went to Mumbai with two transgenders but returned home in just three days as she couldn’t adjust to the demeaning lifestyle. With an aim to transform her life through studies and work, she enrolled in post-graduation and also worked as a lecturer for a while . Then she went to Mumbai again, this time to work with an NGO Triveni Samaj Vikas Kendra. With her savings and a loan, she got a sex reassignment surgery as well as a new identity with a changed PAN and Aadhar card. Explaining the difference between a a transgender and transwoman, she says, “Transgender is about gender identity whereas a transwoman gets a harmone replacement or sex reassignment surgery.”

In Mumbai, she tried modelling, acted in two short films Revenge and Growing India and was a Miss Transqueen India participant. “I was among the top six contestants and got Miss Beautiful Smile jury award,” she says. However, being a Telugu, she wants to be recognised in the Telugu land; hence she shifted to Hyderabad.

With dreams of being actress, she wonders if Telugu cinema directors or producers will ever give her a chance. “There are many examples of actors/actress donning the role of a transgender. If they can do it so convincingly, why can’r a transgender /transwoman play a female character?” she asks. “I struggled a lot in my village; I want to act in a movie to tell my life story.”

Life came a full circle when she recently visited her hometown for Sankranti. “People had seen my interview on YouTube and came to appreciate me; they were proud that I was inspiring many others and remarked that I look beautiful. I felt happy.”",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/6oq9sj/article30624246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym22harshini1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/transwoman-harshini-mekala-on-her-role-in-the-play-badlav/article30624252.ece
279,2020/01/22,Systematic attempt to ‘incapacitate’ RBI-Kolkata: staff association,"The Reserve Bank Employees’ Association has alleged that the Central government is trying its best to ‘incapacitate’ the Kolkata office. Association’s general secretary Samir Ghosh said there is “a systematic attempt to incapacitate RBI-Kolkata” as only a few of the recently approved RBI posts are located there. However, it is the “second largest office” of the bank, a press note said.

In December last, the RBI issued a notification approving 926 jobs against vacancies of which only 12 are for the Kolkata office while one is for Sikkim. The largest office in Mumbai got 419 and Delhi 34. This has irked the Association and Mr. Ghosh has already written to the RBI Governor flagging the issue.

Mr. Ghosh said, “In a planned manner departments here are denied staff.” In 2012, 1,000 persons were recruited and Kolkata got 145 which was ‘satisfactory’. But this has reduced significantly over the last decade. “In 213 Kolkata got 50 of 525 and 30 out of 506 in 2014.” The denial of staff became more pronounced after the BJP had come to power, he said. “Thirty out of 504 in 2015, 30 out of 610 in 2016 and 20 out of 623 in 2017…and now it has come down to 11,” he told journalists.

Mr. Ghosh also said four crucial departments including the one for minor non-banking financial companies are shifted out of Kolkata. “It is an attempt to slowly asphyxiate the office.” The local RBI office has not reacted to the allegation.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/pf6qy7/article30626514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RBIKOLKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/systematic-attempt-to-incapacitate-rbi-kolkata-staff-association/article30626515.ece
280,2020/01/22,"Govt. plans renovations, increasing displays at Kolkata’s Indian Museum","Kicking off the Centre’s plan to revamp five museums in the country, renovations at the Indian Museum in Kolkata, the oldest museum in the Asia Pacific region, and an expansion of the number of displays would be done soon, Culture Minister Prahlad Singh Patel said on Tuesday.

The museum, founded in 1814 as the Asiatic Museum and Imperial Museum, would be the first of the five museums to be revamped as per international standards. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on January 11 said during a visit to Kolkata that five iconic museums would be renovated to international standards. A Culture Ministry official said the renovation work, including sprucing up displays and information panels describing the exhibits, would be started in 2020.

Mr. Patel told The Hindu that a project proposal would be drawn up after conducting a thorough survey of the museum’s collection.

“The National Museum in Delhi displays about 9-10% of its collection but the Indian Museum in Kolkata manages to display just about 5-6%. We will have to see how to increase the exhibits, perhaps if we need to create additional space somewhere else because the museum holds some of the most unique artefacts,” he said.

The present building of the museum was opened to the public in 1878 with two galleries — on archaeology and birds. It has six sections — art, archaeology, anthropology, zoology, geology and botany, the museum’s website says. Among the attractions are a 4,000-year-old Egyptian mummy, coins from the 5th century BC till 2nd century AD and miniature paintings from different eras.",kolkata,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/6j39mr/article30617460.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-INDIANMUSEUM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/govt-plans-renovations-increasing-displays-at-kolkatas-indian-museum/article30617462.ece

282,2020/01/22,Confusion over reservation norms for teaching posts,"Lack of clarity in reservation categories is reportedly putting off aspirants from applying to the post of teaching staff at Calicut University where the recruitment process is happening after a long time. It is learnt that the number of applicants is not that high even though the last date for submitting application online is February 5.

As many as 116 posts — 24 Professors, 29 Associate Professors, and 63 Assistant Professors — are to be filled in various departments and the varsity had issued a notification on December 31, 2019, for the purpose. However, the aspirants are not able to understand if they are eligible for a particular post as the notification does not specify the reservation categories of posts in each department. It considers the university as a whole unit. One of the aspirants who wished not to be quoted told The Hindu that applying to any post without understanding the reservation category would be a futile exercise.

He wondered why anyone would spend ₹2,000 as application fee, which was unlikely to be refunded if the reservation category turned out to be not in their favour. Teachers in even aided and government colleges are reluctant to apply, it is learnt.

Meanwhile, there have been allegations of political interference too. Teachers’ organisations affiliated to the Congress claim that pro-Left unions are calling the shot in the appointment to ensure that only their candidates sail through.

The university authorities, however, defended their action citing a Kerala High Court order in 2016 and said the reservation would be applied at the time of appointment.

“But, the Supreme Court, in January 2019 had ordered that the reservation quota in colleges and universities should be calculated department-wise, not considering the varsity as a whole unit. The University Grants Commission too had issued guidelines to this effect. With the latest apex court order, the High Court order becomes infructuous,” another aspirant said.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/confusion-over-reservation-norms-for-teaching-posts/article30627876.ece

284,2020/01/22,"Need for gender-based festivals, forums stressed","Ideas of woman empowerment should not be put so blatantly, but infused into the themes in a subtle manner, said M.G. Mallika, feminist activist, also a member of faculty at Zamorin’s Guruvayurappan College, Kozhikode.

Speaking on the topic ‘Women directors and feminist cinema’ at the open forum organised as part of the Women’s International Film Festival of Kerala here on Wednesday, she said that patriarchal mindset is deeply ingrained in a large section of the female population in the State, despite their education and higher rates of employment.

K.R. Ragi, Assistant Professor at Government Arts and Science College, Meenchanda, said that gender-based festivals and forums were necessary as long as gender neutrality remained a vision and not a reality. “As long as women face problems, there need to be a forum to address it,” she added.

Mukta Deedi Chand, documentary film maker, said that women were still very apologetic when it comes to their advancement in society as they have been conditioned to be so. “Declarations like ‘I am not a feminist’ and ‘fractions like women’s writing was not needed’ come from this apologetic attitude.”

She said that she has around 10 short films in various stages of production as she decided to do most of the technical tasks herself. “It is easier to do it alone than convince the male technicians the way I wanted my films to be,” she explained.

This led to discussions on why some women directors, who started off with meaningful cinema later drifted into the commercial variety. Ms. Ragi said it was the only way they could survive while actor Anumol suggested the need to raise some background infrastructure that would support women who wanted to make meaningful cinema.

286,2020/01/22,Govt. blamed for not solving Bandipur night traffic issue,"The State Government’s request before the Supreme Court to postpone the case of the night traffic ban through Bandipur forest has been drawing flak from various stakeholders in Wayanad and Kozhikode districts for its indecisiveness in properly addressing the issue.

The apex court decided to adjourn the case for four more weeks since the government filed a sketchy affidavit though it had got five months to do, the Nilgiris-Wayanad NH and Railway Action Committee, which has been spearheading the campaign to revoke the decade old night traffic ban, alleged.

T.M. Rasheed, convener of the action committee, and one of the petitioners, said that even the draft of the additional affidavit prepared by the government to be filed in the Supreme Court demanding lifting of the ban had glaring mistakes.

Wide spread agitations were staged in Wayanad following an order of the Supreme Court on August 8, 2019 on banning vehicles through the NH 766 during night hours. This was after the government also accepted the suggestion to make the alternative Mananthavady- Kutta- Gonikuppa- Mysuru road to connect Kozhikode with the neighbouring State of Karanataka, he said.

The affidavit was crucial as the Supreme Court had in August asked the Ministry of Environment and Forests to submit a report on upgrading NH 275 and SH 90 (alternative route from Wayanad to Mysuru through Kutta and Gonikuppa) so that NH 766 can be closed down completely.

Before holding discussions with the different stakeholders, Mr. Rasheed said, the State government had moved the affidavit in the Supreme Court. Even Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran and Forest Minister K. Raju were kept in the dark about the developments, he alleged.

Thereafter, the government prepared another draft for three alternative routes. And it also apprised the Centre of agreeing in principle to the Manthanvady- Bavaeli- Mysuru road. However, in the wake of opposition to this newly suggested route, the government was compelled to seek more time to file a fresh affidavit, Mr. Rasheed pointed out.

He said the government should have suggested the Sulthan Bathery-Chikkabargi Bypass instead of unrealistic routes such as Panamaram-Payyambilli- Kutta- Gonikuppa. Incidentally, the Sulthan Bathery-Chikkabargi Bypass route was also recommended based on a study carried out by the National Transportation Planning and Research Centre (NATPAC).",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/govt-blamed-for-not-solving-bandipur-night-traffic-issue/article30626418.ece

A Sub-Inspector of Police, A. Kalidass, who was sentenced to life for gunning down an accused during an interrogation at a police station in Ramanathapuram district, appealed against the award of life term before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday.

Kalidass challenged the sentence awarded by the Principal District Judge, Ramanathapuram, for having shot dead K. Syed Mohammed in 2014, during an interrogation at SP Pattinam police station.

In his appeal, Kalidass said that Syed Mohammed was being interrogated at the station based on a complaint by a two-wheeler mechanic. The mechanic had alleged that Syed Mohammed had attempted to murder him following a dispute over returning a two-wheeler left for repair.

He claimed that during the interrogation, Syed Mohammed attempted to assault him with a knife and in self-defence he used his service revolver and fired three rounds at the accused. He said that had he not opened fire, he would have been stabbed to death by the accused.

There was no motive to kill the accused. Even when the police secured the accused, he had used filthy language against them under the influence of alcohol, Kalidass said. He prayed that the sentenced imposed on him by the lower court be suspended.

The Thatchanallur police are likely to dig up a suspected spot where a missing youth had been reportedly buried after he was murdered by unidentified persons.

As S. Masanamurthy, 24, an earthmover operator from Karaiyiruppu, went missing after he had gone to his nearby farm on January 15 morning, his father Sudalaimuthu filed a complaint with Thatchanallur police station on the next day.

When there was a delay in finding out the missing youth, his wife Krishnaveni submitted a petition to Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish on last Monday seeking her help to expedite the action on the petition.

Even as the investigation was going on, police got information that Masanamurthy was murdered and buried in a secluded place at Vaeppankulam close to Chidambara Nagar under Thatchanallur police station limits. When the police visited a spot, they could locate a heap of thorny bush kept on a newly closed pit and hence suspect that the body could have been buried there.

The police also picked up Masanamurthy’s friend who reportedly told the law-enforcers that they consumed liquor at Veppankulam to celebrate ‘Pongal’ and he left the spot after Masanamurthy became senseless due to an excessive consumption of alcohol.

Meanwhile, relatives of Masanamurthy blocked the Tirunelveli – Madurai Highway on Wednesday evening demanding the early retrieval of the missing youth. After the police and the revenue officials pacified them, the agitation was withdrawn.

Several farmers from Oddanchatram and surroundings laid siege to the office of the Tahsildar for land acquisition in the ongoing four laning project of Dindigul to Pollachi highway, here on Wednesday.

They alleged that the land is being acquired by force and for unjustifiably low prices and demanded that the government should compensate the farmers on a par with the market value.

G. Palanisamy, Oddanchatram taluk secretary of Tamilnadu Vivasayigal Sangam, said that one square metre of land is quoted at ₹ 800 as per market value but the government is acquiring the land for less than ₹100 per square metre.

“Several farmers from the villages of Reddiyapatti, Arasapillaipatti, Veeralapatti, Kaveriammanpatti, Manjanayakkanpatti, Velarpatti, Chathirapatti and Palanikavundanpudur are standing to lose large tracts of agriculture land. The government should compensate them properly,” he said.

The 117.072-km stretch of the highway is being widened into a four-lane highway and is expected to reduce travel time between southern districts and the western districts.

Minister for Dairy Development K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji on Wednesday said that Virudhunagar police would ensure exemplary punishment to those who murdered a girl near Sivakasi on Monday.

The Minister, along with Virudhunagar Collector R. Kannan, and Superintendent of Police P. Perumal, visited the girl’s family and consoled her parents.

When the girl’s mother said such a crime should not happen to any other child, the Minister said Tamil Nadu police would ensure exemplary punishment to the culprits. Suggesting that the girl could have been sexually assaulted, the Minister said the punishment would be a deterrent to perpetrators of such heinous crimes.

When asked about whether the culprits could be punished through “encounter” as witnessed in Hyderabad, Mr. Bhalaji said no one staged an encounter wantonly. “The responsibility of the Tamil Nadu police is to identify the culprits and bring them to book,” he said.

Mr. Bhalaji also said the district administration would create awareness among young girls that they should not talk to strangers and go alone to secluded places.

The eight-year-old girl, who was studying class 3, went missing on Monday evening when she went to attend the call of nature. She was found dead with bruises on her body amidst shrubs on Tuesday morning.

“Though the bruises and other marks suggest that the girl could have been sexually assaulted, we can confirm that only with the post-mortem report,” the SP said. Though five special teams have been formed, the district police are yet to achieve any breakthrough in the case.

298,2020/01/22,Stories of hope from Tirunelveli countryside,"Inside a hole-in-the-wall house in Ervadi village in remote Tirunelveli district, a group of women gather to showcase the products they sell ranging from hand-made art pieces to fancy blouses for women. They all belong to the Bismi Self-Help Group, one of the numerous such self-sustained women groups in the region, supported by the Srinivasan Services Trust, the social arm of TVS Motor Company. Thanks to the guidance and support of SST that Bismi today is a success story with all its members becoming entrepreneurs.

“It started as a small tailoring unit and none of us knew anything beyond the kitchen back then. We were guided by the volunteers from SST, who helped us get loans from banks and that’s how we set up the SHG. We practice micro lending amongst us and help each other. SST has also dissolved differences of religion and caste in these rural pockets,” says Mohammed Peer Banu, one of the members.

A few kilometres away from Ervadi is a village named Arasarkulam, where 45-year-old Dhanalakshmi and her flock of all-women workforce are busy under a tin-roof workshop, attached to Dhanalakshmi’s house. They are engaged in making of serial bulb sets. Two decades ago, only Dhanalakshmi’s husband was involved in the work and it was a male bastion, as the work was laborious. Then stepped in the volunteers of SST, encouraging the women to take it up.

“Today, I run a lucrative business and I am also able to support a dozen women from my village. I give them work and they also earn a livelihood,” says Dhanalakshmi, who now supplies serial bulb sets to various parts of Southern India. Elaborate and colourful bulb sets are sent fro festivals in temples and churches, public meetings and rallies by political parties and weddings.

The Trust has not only developed economically viable business models for these women but also has worked to improve infrastructure in the rural areas. Take for instance the Government higher secondary school in Kalakkad, where the Trust has constructed a toilet block for girl students that also houses a napkin incinerator. “After the construction of the toilet, the strength of girl students has gone up. Though there was a toilet block earlier, it was in a bad shape and we were scrambling for funds,” says P. Vijayalakshmi, the Headmistress of the school.

Similarly, SST has built toilet complexes for men and women at the Primary Health Centre in Moonanjipatti, serving thousands of people in the surroundings. “The PHC is equipped with a 20 bed post-parturition ward, where sufficient toilets were an absolute necessity. The Trust also brings people from various villages for regular health check up camps that we organise. They help us keep track and follow up on patients and their treatment,” says Dr. Karpagam, one of the duty doctors at the outpatient ward.

Srinivasan Services Trust with its office in Tirukkurungudi, the home turf of TVS group of companies, today serves over 5000 villages in all the southern states. In Tirunelveli, they also help out farmers by spreading awareness about the various schemes in the government and also get them for the farmers from the agriculture and agriculture engineering departments. For instance, the trust has helped in the desilting of an irrigation tank in Pappankulam village and with the good monsoon, the tanks now holds water that’s being used for agriculture.

The Tirukkurungudi office of the SST works in three panchayat unions of Cheranmahadevi, Kalakkad and Nanguneri that has 66 panchayats and 583 villages. They work with 451 SHGS in the area apart from many groups of farmers and rural homepreneurs, contributing to a socio-economic development in the countryside.

303,2020/01/22,Waiting for metro: stakeholders pitch points,"How about taking a metro ride from the airport to MGR Integrated Bus Stand? This may sound like wild imagination, but industrialists in the city call it futuristic vision.

A metro rail connectivity is the need of the hour and inevitable for the burgeoning city, they say. Madurai, in the next five years, will explode with traffic congestion and growing vehicular population and metro train will be the only viable solution to the problem, they add.

For hassle-free commute

“A metro rail network will be a boon to the city and its people, as commuting is a big challenge. The buses are quite insufficient, especially from suburban pockets and the outskirts,” says R. Rajkumar, working at the IT park in Ilanthaikulam on Pandikoil Road.

He commutes everyday from Tirumangalam, about 30 km away, and sometimes has to change two buses and shell out at least ₹40 for a single way.

Another young professional, B. Prakash, working at Kappalur industrial estate, spends close to two hours travelling from his home in Melur on a daily basis. “I travel for about 40 km single way and spend a lot on fuel. As rents are high inside the city limits, I am left with no option but to travel long distance,” he says.

Regular commuters opine that ideally a metro network in a city such as Madurai should connect pockets around the main city such as Tirupuvanam, Tirumangalam, Melur and Nagamalai Pudukottai, apart from connecting bus stations and railway junction to the airport.

Qualifies for facility

“Madurai has a sizeable population of young professionals and office goers who commute from one part of the city to the other. If the purpose of metro rail is to ease congestion, then Madurai surely should be considered as traffic jam is the order of the day here,” says N. Jegatheesan, president of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

“Apart from better and faster connectivity, a metro rail transport system will also pave way further industrial growth, give impetus to the overall development of the region and create job opportunities.”

He adds that Madurai qualifies for a metro rail network as the population is well about 15 lakh and the city expanse has touched a circumference of 50-odd km. “The Central government has proposed to invest ₹105 lakh crore for infrastructure development in the next five years. A list of 25 cities across the country will be selected for metro rail connectivity. Political leaders from the region should take efforts to bring the city in that list,” he says.

“Any transport facility will enhance industrial growth. There is no doubt that metro rail network will give an impetus to business,” says M. S. Sampath, secretary of MADITSSIA, who runs a food processing unit at SIDCO industrial estate in Pudur. “A majority of my staff come from Melur and in order to get them for work on time, we have arranged for a staff bus. A metro connectivity shall ease such problems.”

However, Nagaraj Krishnan, Chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry, feels that Madurai still has a long way to go before qualifying for a metro rail network. “Whether people of the city will patronise metro rail, given the high costs, remains a question. More number of flyovers and bridges should ease transport issues for now,” he says.

Political push needed

Industrialists and business segment in the city complain that Madurai gets neglected by successive governments in development. Despite being the central nodal point for over 13 districts in the south and south central region of the State, the city has hardly seen any infrastructure facilities on par with other cities such as Chennai, Coimbatore and Tiruchi.

They say that a political push is needed to bring metro rail to Madurai.

“Despite the State cabinet having many ministers from the southern region, there is no push to promote Madurai. Major facilities and projects always get diverted towards other cities. Even AIIMS project came to Madurai only after a lot of efforts and petitions in the court,” says an activist.

Madurai MP Su. Venkatesan vouches to bat for the facility in Parliament. “It is in places like Madurai, where the density of population is higher, that a metro rail connectivity is needed. I visited a rail expo in Delhi recently, where the prototype of a low cost metro rail project was on display. So, a metro rail connectivity need not necessarily be associated with the elite. It is a transport mode meant for the masses,” he says.

“The patronage will come with time but there is a need to think ahead of time. That way, metro rail connectivity is something necessary for a growing burgeoning city like Madurai and I will raise the demand in Parliament. I have also mentioned it in the election manifesto,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/zbp3x7/article30619210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/22MAMetroRail,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/waiting-for-metro-stakeholders-pitch-points/article30619211.ece
304,2020/01/22,Focus must shift to nutrient-rich food to address malnutrition: expert,"Ṭhere is a slowdown in the pace of reduction in undernourishment among people in Asia-Pacific region in the last three years. To achieve ‘Zero Hunger’ by the end of 2030, more than three million people in the region have to escape hunger every month. Hence, the focus must shift from the quantity of food consumed to the consumption of energy-rich food with essential micronutrients, according to former Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Asia and Pacific of Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations Kundhavi Kadiresan.

Addressing students of the Department of Economics of Fatima College here during a conference on food and agriculture on Tuesday, Ms. Kadiresan spoke on the current trends in agricultural production, food consumption and the interventions necessary to address the issue of malnutrition. India was one of the countries in the region where the prevalence of stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height) among children aged below five, and anemia among women was higher, she said.

“To address this, there is a need for multi-dimensional approach. Feeding of nutritional food for the first 1,000 days since the birth of an infant, availability of safe drinking water, hygienic environment and strong pre and postnatal care are essential. Also, the government policies must aim at improving the livelihood of the poor and the marginalised to ensure that they have nutritious food,” she said.

Speaking on the current trends in agriculture, Ms. Kadiresan said that while the area of cultivation and the contribution of agriculture to Gross Domestic Product had decreased, the population involved in farming activities had increased. “Thus farming activities must use advanced techniques like precision farming, cellular agriculture and vertical farming. Urban-based agriculture and distribution are essential to shorten the supply chain and reduce wastage.”

The government must focus on policies to facilitate sustainable agriculture, support for research activities, provide incentives and make agriculture more inclusive for the youth, she added.

Francisca Flora and Head of the Department Shobana Nelasco were also present.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/v0qj2m/article30621314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kundhavi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/focus-must-shift-to-nutrient-rich-food-to-address-malnutrition-expert/article30619197.ece
