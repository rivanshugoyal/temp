0,2020/02/01,Leading from the front,"Raghunath Reddy Unadi traces his fascination for climbing mountains back to his school days at Tadepalli, a small town in Guntur district where he would climb a hillock not too far away from his house on weekends. “Holidays meant exploring the meadows, the vast stretches of fields and the rocky terrains,” he recalls, adding that he spent a lot of time playing amid Nature.

After finishing school, he moved to Hyderabad to study engineering, which led him to a corporate job. But family responsibility brough him back home in three years. The adrenalin junkie did not allow this to stop him. In association with the Hyderabad Trekking Club, he started organising trekking events and collaborated with Transcend Adventures, also Hyderabad-based, and organised adventure activities like rappelling and Himalayan treks for corporate firms.

In 2012, Raghunath (31) along with and his two friends Kaluva Suresh who had a software background, and banker Katragadda Venkata Ramdas founded the Vijayawada Adventure Club. The next year, Raghunath headed to Kashmir for a month-long mountaineering course.

For as long as he can remember, he has wanted to climb Mt Everest but hasn’t done so because he cannot afford the expenses involved. He says for as long as he can remember, he wanted to climb Mount Everest, a desire not yet fulfilled because of the high expenses involved in the expedition which he cannot afford. The closest he came to his dream was in 2016 when AP government officials asked him to train and lead a team of students on an expedition to the world’s highest peak. But Raghunath had to stop at the base camp and mapthe route for the summiteers. He did everything from setting up camp to fixing routes to helping the young climbers change their oxygen cylinders. “It was like having a personal climbing assistant,” he says, recalling how the young climbers, drawn from the Department of Youth Services and AP Social and Tribal Welfare Residential Schools, had to be taught even the basic rules of climbing. His training paid off when the team successfully reached the summit..

Life at base camp, he says, is an odd mix of mundane domesticity, logistical challenges and the occasional flash of life-or-death drama. He kept reminding the team members that they couldn’t use all their energy in climbing alone and that they had to save some for the descent too. “When you remove your fogged goggles to get a glimpse of your surroundings, you feel your corneas start to freeze,” he says, adding that his main worry was the students’ possible encounter with dead bodies en route. “To prepare them, I looked into their eyes and told them they could either push on or turn around.”

He also advised them to practice sleep deprivation. “Sleep is a luxury at extreme altitudes. When you finally head to the summit after weeks of preparing, you hike all day, rest for a few hours and leave for the peak in the middle of the night.”

Raghunath is also secretary of Adventure Sports Academy at Gandikota village in Kadapa district, recently started by the AP Tourism Department, to kindle the interest of the youth across the State in adventure sports. Though he works as an education consultant for a living, Raghunath follows his passion in the after work hours. He trains young people in outdoor activities like trekking, hiking, rappelling and rock climbing but mountaineering remains his all-time favourite. Of the seven highest mountains in the seven continents, he has scaled three: Kilimanjaro, Elbrus and Kosciusko.

Mountains are the ultimate classroom, he says, and is eager to conquer the remaining four highest peaks. “I know it will happen, it is only matter of time,” he says emphatically, “It is not about spending a couple of minutes up there on the top, its about the lessons you learn along the way.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/luqj7s/article30715722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BZ01RAGHU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/leading-from-the-front/article30715725.ece
1,2020/02/01,Premier Badminton League | Warriors’ impressive run continues,"North-Eastern Warriors continued its impressive run in the Premier Badminton League (PBL) with a convincing 5-0 win over Pune 7 Aces at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Saturday.

Even as the match was effectively sealed in Warriors’ favour by the time Rituparna Das took on World No. 10 Michelle Li, the highlight was the former’s brilliant fightback under pressure.

After winning the first game with ease, Michelle was surprised by Rituparna’s tenacity and grit in the second.

In the decider, Michelle took a comfortable 9-4 lead before Rituparna scored four points in-a-row to put pressure on her more reputed rival with delectable net game. At 13-14, the Pune shuttler’s erratic backhand return saw Michelle avoid a major embarrassment.

In the first match of the evening, World No. 45 Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk of Warriors came back strongly after a dismal start to defeat a fighting Kazumasa Sakai.

Major upset

In a major upset, Lee Yong Dae and Kim Ha Na of Warriors shocked the World No. 13 pair of Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock with a clinical performance in Pune’s Trump match, giving the team a 2-0 lead.

World No. 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu made it 3-0 when he outclassed World No. 31 Lo Kean Yew. Lee was vastly superior and had an amazing range of strokes. His jump smashes to the corners of the seemingly hapless opponent were just too good.

The only win for Pune came from the men’s doubles combine of Chirag Shetty and Hendra Setiawan.

The results:

North-Eastern Warriors bt Pune 7 Aces 5-0 (Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk bt Kazumasa Sakai 15-13, 15-14; Lee Yong Dae & Kim Ha Na bt Chris Adcock & Gabrielle Adcock (T) 15-6, 15-8; Lee Cheuk Yiu bt Loh Kean Yew 15-12, 15-8; Michelle Li (T) bt Rituparna Das 15-8, 13-15, 15-13; Bodin Isara & G.

2,2020/02/01,Thousands turn out to mourn Kobe Bryant as Lakers return to the court in LA,"Tens of thousands of Kobe Bryant fans flooded the grounds around Staples Center on Friday ahead of his former team's first game since his death in a helicopter crash earlier this week that stunned basketball fans in the city and worldwide.

Fans wearing Bryant's Los Angeles Lakers jerseys laid flowers, wrote messages on temporarily erected white walls and shared stories of the 41 year old, who perished along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other people on January 26.

“Kobe Bryant meant a lot to me. I've been watching him for 20 years since he came into the league and I just love him,” said Lakers fan Karina Mendoza. “I want to thank him for everything he has done for us here in L.A.”

“It's a sad and a beautiful day. You can see all the people here and all the Lakers fans. We're like family. Love you Kobe, love you Gigi and all the families.”

Inside the arena, where tributes were expected throughout the game, Kobe and Gianna jerseys were placed on the two courtside seats where the pair sat at their last Lakers game. “I was surprised to see how much it affected me as soon as I got here and saw these makeshift memorials,” said 71-year-old Lakers fan Jim Bendat. “My kids grew up with Kobe and Kobe meant so much to all three of my children. So I sort of experienced all that along with my kids. It's almost like losing a child in a way.”

Bryant and the eight others died when the helicopter they were taking to a girls' basketball tournament crashed in foggy weather on a hillside northwest of Los Angeles, plunging fans into mourning and sending shockwaves through the sporting world.

Following Bryant's death, the National Basketball Association (NBA) cancelled a game scheduled for Staples Center on Tuesday between the Lakers and the Los Angles Clippers, citing the need to give the team time to grieve.

Lakers coach Frank Vogel this week said the tragedy was bringing the Western Conference-leading Lakers, an already tight-knit group, even closer together and credited team leaders LeBron James and Anthony Davis with helping the players manage their emotions.

Practice on Thursday began with some flag football on an outside field near the Lakers' practice facility in what Vogel called “therapeutic” Southern California sunshine. “We are striking a balance of trying to make us feel good,” Vogel said. “Laughter is always a good remedy for something like this when it's appropriate.”

It was not clear if surviving members of Bryant's family would attend Friday's game.

Although Friday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers will mark the first for the Lakers since his death, Bryant was remembered at Staples Center on Sunday night by performers at the Grammy Awards as fans gathered outside the arena in a spontaneous vigil.

3,2020/02/01,Premier Badminton League | Tai on fire as Raptors down Hunters,"Former World No. 1 Tai Tzu-Ying served a reminder about her reputation as one of the most complete players in world badminton when she came back from the early blues to stun World champion P.V. Sindhu.

Tai’s performance helped defending champion Bengaluru Raptors notch up its first win, a 3-0 verdict over Hyderabad Hunters, in the Premier Badminton League at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Friday.

Sindhu was more dominant after a sluggish start in the first game, coming up with her trademark smashes on either flanks to get the better of Tai whose net game was surprisingly erratic, especially in the closing stages of that game.

Vintage stuff

But what the fans saw in the second and third game was vintage Tai as she pushed Sindhu to the baseline to pick the corners with ease and then smashed some stunning cross-court winners. Watching all this was Sindhu’s father P.V. Ramana, who was in the commentary box for a brief period.

In the third game, an awesome body smash from Tai and a Sindhu return falling in her own court signalled the end of the contest.

Roaring start

In the first match, the men’s combine of Chan Peng Soon and Rian Agung Saputro of Raptors got the better of the more experienced and powerful duo of Ben Lane and Vladimir Ivanov, winning the big moments.

Hunters suffered another setback when World No. 28 Sourabh Verma lost the Trump match to World No. 39 Brice Leverdez, paying a heavy price with his erratic returns in the decider.

Hunters’ only win came through the mixed doubles pair of Vladimir Ivanov and N. Sikki Reddy.

The results:

Bengaluru Raptors bt Hyderabad Hunters 3-0 (Chang Peng Soon & Rian Agung Saputro bt Ben Lane & Vladimir Ivanov 15-13, 9-15, 15-12; Brice Leverdez bt Sourabh Verma (T) 15-12, 10-15, 15-6; Tai Tzu Ying bt P.V. Sindhu 11-15, 15-13, 15-9; Chan Peng Soon & Eom Hye Won (T) lost to Vladimir Ivanov & N. Sikki Reddy 13-15, 11-15; B.

7,2020/02/01,Sofia Kenin's Melbourne heroics forged from early family hardships,"Sofia Kenin's father reflected on their journey from the Soviet Union all the way to Saturday's Australian Open final, saying it helped make his daughter the player she is today.

The 21-year-old Kenin, who beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza in the Melbourne final, has made a name for herself in the past fortnight for her aggression and tenacity.

Kenin - who prefers to go by the name “Sonya” - was born in Moscow but is a fiercely proud American.

The 14th seed, who stunned world number one Ashleigh Barty in the semi-finals, has a racquet decorated with the stars and stripes.

On the eve of the biggest match of her fast-burgeoning career, her father Alexander, who is also her coach, retold the family story.

He and wife Lena left the Soviet Union in 1987, initially for New York, returning to Russia for Sofia's birth in 1998 so a grandmother could help with the newborn.

The family would later settle in Florida and Kenin says her parents sacrificed themselves “so I could have the American dream”.

Alexander said: “I wanted a better future for my kids and it (then Soviet Union) was a completely different country (to what it is today).

“Nothing was allowed and we tried to get out for eight years.

“They controlled everything, we didn't see the world, you were just stuck.”

Taxi driver

Leaving friends and family behind and heading into the unknown of the United States was a wrench, said Alexander, and life was tough eking out a living in New York.

Alexander was a taxi driver by night and went to English and computer school by day.

“I don't think she experienced all the sacrifices we had to go through, but she knows about them,” he said.

“It was very, very tough. I had to work at night, go to school in the morning. Driving in New York, speaking English on the (taxi) radio. I had no idea what they were saying.

“But it's amazing the things you do to survive. She knows about that and I think it made her tough.”

Kenin picked up a racquet for the first time at three-and-a-half, hitting balls in the driveway of their Florida home.

She never showed any interest in dolls, her father said.

Unlike Kenin's hero Maria Sharapova, who made a similar journey with her family to the United States but represented Russia, Alexander says there was never a debate about where her loyalties lay.

“She has very little connection with Russia, except the fact she was born there,” he said.

8,2020/02/01,Australian Open | Sofia Kenin beats Garbine Muguruza to win first Grand Slam title,"American Sofia Kenin counter-punched her way back from a set down against Garbine Muguruza to win her first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open with a 4-6 6-2 6-2 win on February 1.

The 21-year-old Kenin, seeded 14th at Melbourne Park, converted her second matchpoint against the twice Grand Slam champion, who double faulted on the final point, to end an engrossing contest that lasted more than two hours.

Kenin and Muguruza produced a fitting and intense final under the closed roofs of a packed Rod Laver Arena.

Muguruza had arrived in Melbourne suffering from a virus that forced her to quit the Hobart International, but the Spaniard was soon back to playing to her strength which helped her reach the top of the women's rankings in 2017.

Some of the inconsistency that led to her slipping to 36th in the rankings last year resurfaced against Kenin, however, as the Spaniard blew hot and cold with her serve, getting 57% of her first serves in while mixing her nine aces with eight double faults.

Kenin came to the match with a game plan, mixing deft drop shots with her deep forehand groundstrokes to catch Muguruza by surprise initially.

But the Spaniard soon found her range and converted her third breakpoint in the third game to nose ahead in the opening set.

Kenin, who beat Ash Barty in the semi-final despite trailing the world number one for most of the match, refused to throw in the towel and boosted her confidence by saving four breakpoints to hold the seventh game.

She was rewarded for her tenacity in the next game with two consecutive double faults from Muguruza that gave the American a break back, and brought the set back on serve.

But the Spaniard came out firing on all cylinders to break the Moscow-born Kenin again and took the opening set when her opponent missed the sideline with her forehand.

Kenin took the court in the second set with renewed vigour as the power behind her shots went up a notch. She got the break in the fourth game and then a confident hold gave her a 4-1 lead.

There was no comeback for Muguruza from there as the American levelled the match with the second break of her serve.

The intensity of the deciding set rose considerably with Muguruza slapping her thigh to egg herself on while Kenin was almost reduced to tears out of frustration at some of her shots.

Down 0-40 in the fifth game and with her back to the wall, Kenin probably produced her best tennis. She painted the sidelines with three scorching winners while also producing an ace to hold serve for 3-2.

A fifth double fault from the Spaniard gave Kenin a 4-2 lead, and she was suddenly within striking distance of victory, which she sealed by breaking her opponent again.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/4e968b/article30712424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kenin,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-sofia-kenin-beats-garbine-muguruza-to-win-first-grand-slam/article30712425.ece

The plane reached Delhi around 7.30 a.m., they said.

The National Statistics Office (NSO) on Friday released revised estimates for economic growth in the last three years, pegging actual GDP growth in 2018-19 at 6.1% instead of the 6.8% provisional estimates reported earlier in May 2019.

In an effort to put to rest all speculation over the accuracy and reliability of India’s GDP data, India’s Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian on Friday asserted that there is “no evidence” of mis-estimation of growth of the Indian economy. The debates on the issue were kicked off last year after Mr. Subramanian’s predecessor, Arvind Subramanian — in a research paper published by Harvard University last year — had said India’s GDP growth in the period 2011-12 to 2016-17 is likely to have been over-estimated.

The death toll from China’s new coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259 and the tally of confirmed infections has surged to nearly 12,000, the government said on February 1.

The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease.

The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has undertaken a major overhaul of departments and reporting structure that will effectively empower seven different Additional Secretaries and re-organise their tasks along themes like culture, trade and development, and consolidated geographical divisions for better coordination.

President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday kick-started the Budget session of Parliament with an address to both Houses. He lauded the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that, he said, fulfilled the wish of Mahatma Gandhi who had said that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan who didn’t want to stay there could come to India.

The Centre’s imposition of stock limits in a bid to control the soaring prices of onions over the last few months actually increased price volatility, according to the Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in Parliament on Friday. The finding came in a hard-hitting attack in the report against the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and other “anachronistic legislations” and interventionist government policies, including drug price control, grain procurement and farm loan waivers.

The Election Commission of India on Friday filed a proposal jointly with petitioner-advocate A.K. Upadhyay for making election candidates as well as political parties fielding them, equally liable for disclosing their criminal antecedents. A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman reserved orders on a contempt petition filed by Mr. Upadhyay against authorities and parties for not complying fully with a Constitution Bench judgment in 2018, which had directed political parties to publish online the pending criminal cases of their election candidates.

As vocalist T.M. Krishna’s book, Sebastian and Sons, on Dalit Christian mridangam makers, is to be released on Sunday, the family of mridangam maestro Palghat T.S. Mani Iyer said they felt that the author had ‘deceived’ them by not revealing the scope of the book. “While gathering information about Mani Iyer and his relationship with the mridangam makers, their family and his approach towards maintenance of the instrument, he did not tell us that the book was about caste, religion, and politics. We actually feel cheated and deceived,” vocalist Palghat R. Ramprasad, grandson of Mani Iyer, said.

Britain on Friday ends almost half a century of integration with Europe, finally making its historic departure from the EU to begin a new — uncertain — future, with emotions running high following years of wrangling and several false starts. As the clocks strike 11:00 p.m. (2300 GMT) in Britain, the bloc’s often reluctant member becomes the first to leave an organisation set up to forge unity among nations after the horrors of World War II.

The Economic Survey says India has an unprecedented opportunity to chart a China-like, labour-intensive, export trajectory by integrating “Assemble in India for the world” into Make-in-India policy and thus can raise its export market share to 3.5 % by 2025 and 6% by 2030.

The U.S. Senate on Friday rejected Democratic calls for new witnesses at Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, paving the way for the president to be acquitted next week of the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Following the 51-49 vote, Republican senators said a vote for acquittal is expected at 4.00 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Wednesday. That would mean the trial will not have concluded before Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his nationally televised annual “State of the Union” speech on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress.

India captain Virat Kohli, on Friday, said he has learnt an important lesson in the back-to-back Super Over finishes against New Zealand. “There’s something new I’ve learnt in the last couple of games: when the opposition is playing well, you stay calm till the end and try to come back,” Kohli said. The India skipper said, having come out victorious in two consecutive Super Overs for the first time proves the character of the team.

High fees at the institutes of higher education push the poor and underprivileged out of the education system, the Economic Survey notes.

12,2020/02/01,China faces more border curbs as coronavirus toll rises to 259,"The number of deaths from a coronavirus epidemic in China has risen by 46 to 259, the country’s health authority said on Saturday, as the U.S. and other nations announced new border curbs on foreigners who have been in China.

The central province of Hubei, the centre of the epidemic, is under a virtual quarantine, with roads sealed off and public transport shut down. Elsewhere in China, authorities have placed restrictions on travel and business activity.

In its latest figures, China’s National Health Commission said there were 2,102 new confirmed infections in China on Friday, bringing the cumulative total to 11,791. Around two dozen other countries have reported another 137 cases.

Data collection

The Chinese data would suggest it is less deadly than the 2002-03 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , which killed nearly 800 people of the some 8,000 it infected, although such numbers can evolve rapidly.

In Beijing, counters were set up at the entrances of housing estates, where volunteers wearing red arm bands and masks noted down details of residents coming back from their hometowns after the Lunar New Year holiday.

“As long as I am properly protected and don’t go to crowded places, I don’t feel scared at all about my hometown or Beijing, said a 58-year-old migrant worker surnamed Sun.

“There will be a huge number of people returning to the city, I think it will put Beijing at risk of more infections,” said Zhang Chunlei, 45, another returning migrant worker.

Singapore and the U.S. has announced measures to ban foreign nationals who have been in China from entering their territories.

Nearly 10,000 flights have been suspended since the outbreak of the new coronavirus, according to travel and data analytics firm Cirium, illustrating concerns about a slowdown in economic activity in China.

Many nations have put on charter flights to repatriate citizens from China and then place in isolation for around two weeks, the incubation period of the virus. More than 300 South Koreans arrived home on Saturday and Indonesian officials said around 250 nationals were being evacuated from Hubei.

Infections have jumped in two cities flanking Wuhan, raising concerns that new hot spots are emerging despite strict travel restrictions.

13,2020/02/01,Britain embarks on a future outside the European Union,"Britain began an uncertain future outside the European Union on Saturday after the country greeted the historic end to almost half a century of EU membership with a mixture of joy and sadness.

There were celebrations and tears on Friday as the EU’s often reluctant member became the first to leave an organisation set up to forge unity among nations after the horrors of World War II.

Little has changed as of Saturday as the U.K. is now in an 11-month transition period negotiated as part of the divorce.

Britons will be able to work in the EU and trade freely — and vice versa — until December 31, although the U.K. will no longer be represented in the bloc’s institutions.

But legally, Britain is out.

Thousands of people waving Union Jack flags packed London’s Parliament Square and sang the national anthem to mark that reality as Brexit became law at 11 pm (2300 GMT) — midnight in Brussels.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a private party in his Downing Street office with a clock projected on the walls outside counting down the minutes to departure.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is preparing to impose full customs and border checks on all European Union goods entering Britain from next year, in an attempt to increase pressure on the bloc in trade talks, The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.

“We are planning full checks on all EU imports — export declarations, security declarations, animal health checks and all supermarket goods to pass through Border Inspections Posts,” Saturday’s Telegraph quoted a senior government source as saying.

Deep divisions

15,2020/02/01,Palestinians have cut security ties with U.S. and Israel: Abbas,"The Palestinian Authority has cut all ties with the U.S. and Israel, including security relations after rejecting a West Asia peace plan presented this week by U.S. President Donald Trump, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Saturday.

At a meeting of Arab Foreign Ministers in Cairo, Mr. Abbas reiterated his “complete” rejection of Mr. Trump’s peace plan, which calls for creating a demilitarised Palestinian state with borders drawn to meet Israeli security needs.

“We’ve informed the Israeli side... that there will be no relations at all with them and the U.S. including security ties,” Mr. Abbas told the one-day extraordinary session to discuss Mr. Trump’s plan.

Israeli officials had no immediate comment on his remarks.

Israel and the Palestinian Authority’s security forces have long cooperated in policing areas of the occupied West Bank that are under Palestinian control. The PA also has intelligence cooperation agreements with the CIA, which continued even after the Palestinians began boycotting the Trump administration’s peace efforts in 2017.

Mr. Abbas also said he had refused to discuss with Mr. Trump his plan by phone or to receive even a copy of it to study it.

The Trump plan, unveiled on Tuesday, also calls for U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israel’s indivisible capital.

16,2020/02/01,Maldives rejoins Commonwealth after over three years,"The Maldives on Saturday re-joined the Commonwealth, more than three years after the Indian Ocean island nation quit the association amid mounting criticism of its human rights record then.

In 2016, the Maldives pulled out of the Commonwealth terming “unjust” the grouping’s decision to penalise the country over former President Mohamed Nasheed’s controversial ouster in 2012. It followed the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)’s warning to Maldives of suspension from the bloc, voicing “deep disappointment” over the country’s lack of progress in resolving the political crisis during former President Abdulla Yameen’s presidency, whose authoritarian slant sparked concern domestically and internationally.

However, months after President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won the 2018 presidential elections, promising to restore democracy, he wrote to the Commonwealth, requesting to re-join the bloc.

Following the island nation’s readmission Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said: “The reform process under way in Maldives aligns with the values and principles of the Commonwealth and we encourage the nation to continue on this path.”

President Solih said in a tweet: “A short while ago, I had a conversation with the Commonwealth’s Secretary General who informed me that the Maldives has been formally reinstated into the Commonwealth as its 54th member state. We shall long strive to uphold the Commonwealth’s values of democracy and human rights.”

India lauds inclusion

The Government of India congratulated the Government of Maldives on its readmission to the Commonwealth of Nations as its 54th member. “India has always been a key supporter of Maldives’ readmission and for it to play a larger role in international organisations and the comity of nations. We are committed to working closely with Maldives on shared Commonwealth goals like development, democracy and peace,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.

New Delhi-Male ties witnessed a significant shift following the poll defeat of former President Yameen, perceived to be a friend of China.

Acknowledging the “efforts of the government of President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih to participate actively in international organisations” such as the United Nations and IORA and increase the global profile of Maldives “as a democratic, dynamic and responsible member of the comity of nations”, India said it would continue working with Maldives in achieving its “democratic and developmental aspirations.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/50xoqg/article30712545.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Capture,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/maldives-rejoins-commonwealth-as-united-kingdom-leaves-european-union/article30712478.ece
17,2020/02/01,Pakistan declares national emergency to battle locusts,"Pakistan, which is facing its worst locust attack in decades, has declared national emergency to tackle the insects destroying crops on a large scale in Punjab province, country’s main region for agricultural production.

The decision was taken at a meeting convened by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday. The meeting, attended by federal ministers and senior officials of the four provinces, also approved a National Action Plan (NAP) that requires a sum of Rs 7.3 billion to overcome the crisis.

Minister for National Food Security Khusro Bakhtiar informed the National Assembly about the gravity of the situation and the steps so far taken by the federal and provincial governments to deal with the crisis, the Dawn newspaper reported.

During the meeting at the Prime Minister’s Office, which was also attended by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Hafeez Shaikh among others, a detailed briefing on the overall situation was given to the prime minister.

The meeting was informed that besides involving the officials concerned at the provincial and district levels, different tasks have been given to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), provincial disaster management authorities and federal and provincial departments to deal with the threat.

Prime Minister Khan ordered formation of a high-level committee to be headed by Mr. Bakhtiar to take decisions at the federal level for the elimination of insects.

The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to make immediate measures on the basis of damage of ripened crops.

“Protection of farms and farmers is the highest priority of the government. Therefore, the federal government should take all necessary steps to save national crops and provide required resources to the quarters concerned,” Mr. Khan was quoted as saying in the report.

Mr. Bakhtiar informed the house that it was for the first time that after attacking Sindh and Punjab, the swarms of locust had entered Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

“A sum of Rs 7.3 bn is required to avoid further destruction,” he said.

“Declaration of national emergency was eminent to handle the situation; besides, Parliament must have a role in monitoring the situation,” he added.

Bakhtiar claimed that the government had managed to save cotton and winter crops to a large extent, adding that climate change was one of the reasons for delay in the exit of locusts. He said the situation was worse than the one Pakistan faced in 1993.

The swarms of locust are currently on the Pakistan-India border along Cholistan, the minister said, adding that insects had entered Cholistan and Nara from Sindh and Balochistan.

Locusts used to move to Iran after sometime, but perhaps this time due to low temperatures they are still in Pakistan, he said.

Nawab Yousuf Talpur of Pakistan Peoples Party said that in 1993 when locusts had attacked the country, the situation had been handled in four days with limited resources, the report said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4j4zsx/article30711278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LOCUSTSGUJARATDECEMBER2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-declares-national-emergency-to-battle-locusts/article30711279.ece
18,2020/02/01,Billionaires bombard U.S. presidential campaign with hundreds of millions in cash,"Two billionaire Democratic presidential hopefuls, Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, collectively spent about $389 million last year on their campaigns, more than the rest of the remaining Democratic field combined, according to disclosures filed on Friday.

Mr. Bloomberg launched his campaign in November and spent more than $188 million in two months, a sum sourced entirely from his personal wealth.

Mr. Steyer, who was also considered a late addition to the field of candidates when he launched his campaign in July, spent $201 million in 2019 which largely came from $202.5 million of his own money he put into his campaign and about $3 million raised in donations.

While the rest of the Democratic field is heading to the Iowa caucuses that will be held on Monday, spending on advertising and staff in the small state, Bloomberg is skipping the first four contests. Instead, he has turned his focus to the more than one dozen states that will vote on “Super Tuesday” on March 3rd.

The Iowa caucuses are the first contest in a series of state-by-state votes that are used to pick nominees. There are 11 Democrats vying to be their party's pick to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in November 2020.

Mr. Bloomberg is hoping to overcome any momentum winners in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada might gain by blanketing the airwaves in Super Tuesday states with television ads touting his candidacy.

Mr. Bloomberg's spending appears to be paying off, with his standing in national polls continue to climb. Mr. Steyer has done well enough to qualify for debates, but has struggled to exceed 2% in national polls.

Spending by the rest of the Democratic field pales in comparison.

U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, who ranked third in campaign spending, spent $90.7 million over the 10 months in 2019 he was running for president.

Mr. Bloomberg even outspent Mr. Trump, whose campaign reported spending about $148 million since he launched his reelection in January 2017.

Candidates for president are required by law to file regular disclosures with the Federal Election Commission detailing the how much money their campaigns have raised and how it was spent.

Mr. Bloomberg's spent more than $132 million on television ads through the end of 2019. Independent media trackers estimate that the total Bloomberg has spent on his campaign exceeded $250 million in January.

Mr. Steyer also spent mainly on advertising, pumping $117 million into TV ads and $44 million in online ads.

U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren's largest campaign expense was salaries. She spent more than $16 million on staff in 2019.

Over the course of the year, Mr. Sanders also spent the most on staff, disclosing almost $14 million in payroll. His spending on advertising was a close second, $13.5 million on television and about $9.7 million in online ads.

Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Buttigieg's biggest expense for 2019 was online advertising, spending about $11.6 million on the ads. His payroll came in at $9.9 million and he spent $9.4 million on television.

19,2020/02/01,Four dead as protests grow in Chile,"A man died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a supermarket was torched in Chile's capital on Friday, and another succumbed to injuries sustained in clashes with police, bringing the death toll in a new wave of unrest to four.

Protests that flared up in October — initially over a rise in metro fares — had appeared to have calmed down during the summer holidays in Chile.

But there has been a spike in violent protests this week.

A mob looted and then set fire to the supermarket in southern Santiago in the early hours of Friday. When firefighters arrived they found a dead man aged 30 to 40 and two other people suffering from signs of asphyxiation. He died from ""asphyxiation by inhaling carbon monoxide,"" police chief Carolina Nunez told local media.

Another man died Friday, two days after being shot in the head during a protest near a police station in southern Santiago. On Wednesday a young man died after being hit by a hijacked bus and a football fan was killed on Tuesday after he was hit by a police van.

Another supermarket in the capital was looted overnight while police arrested 16 people. Burning barricades could be seen in several roads in Santiago on Friday morning.

More than 30 people have died in protests that began initially as a reaction to a modest hike in metro fares in the capital. They quickly mushroomed into wider discontent at inequality and the rejection of billionaire President Sebastian Pinera and his government. Pinera has launched a raft of measures to try to quell the unrest, including a rise in the minimum wage and state pensions, and health reforms. He will also hold a referendum in April on changing the dictatorship-era constitution.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9vl54k/article30709654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OL6NV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/four-dead-as-protests-grow-in-chile/article30709656.ece
20,2020/02/01,Africa mobilises against coronavirus as fears mount,"African countries are scrambling to avert an outbreak of the rapidly spreading coronavirus strain, as health officials warn that the poorest countries are ill-equipped to combat the deadly disease.

Across the continent, governments have stationed nurses at airports to check for feverish passengers and have suspended Chinese entry visas, while ordinary people grow increasingly nervous.

There have been no verified infections in Africa to date, but deep trade links with China and often overstretched healthcare systems are raising concerns about the capacity to respond to an outbreak.

The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday declared a global emergency as coronavirus infections spread, after initially downplaying the threat.

An image of a coronavirus.

""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

J. Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the disease risked taking root if it reaches certain African countries.

He warned that such a scenario could usher in a ""global pandemic"".

Several poor African states have recently suffered disastrous viral outbreaks -- and they're keenly aware of the threat.

The Ebola virus raged through Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in 2014-2016, killing about 11,300 people.

Mosoka Fallah, the head of Liberia's public health institute, told lawmakers this week that the rapid spread of the new coronavirus was ""catastrophic"".

""Steps must be taken as early as possible to prevent it from entering here,"" he said, adding that the government had ramped up airport checks.

Anciao Fabiao Paulo, an Angolan student, told AFP that ""it's over"" if coronavirus reaches his country.

""Our health system is vulnerable and there are no good specialists. With malaria, people are already dropping like flies,"" he said.

Coronavirus has killed more than 200 people in China -- where it emerged in the central city of Wuhan -- and infected thousands more.

- Screenings at airports -At Senegal's Blaise Diagne International Airport, health officials peer into a small thermal camera before the passport check.

""The first sign of these communicable diseases is a fever,"" said Barnabe Gning, in charge of sanitary control in the West African country's airports.

The doctor, who previously helped prevent Ebola from reaching Senegal, said the airport installed the safety system late last week.

It was only able to do so quickly because, by chance, it had held disease-outbreak training in November.

However, Gning cautioned that thermal cameras are not foolproof.

Similar thermal cameras which detect feverish passengers are now going up across African capitals.

These allow people with a high temperature to be identified -- the camera screen shows their body heat -- and then quarantined pending a lab test confirming a coronavirus infection.

John Nkengasong, the director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters this week that some countries were being watched more closely than others.

Egypt, Morocco, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda and Mauritius are expected to ""enhance screening"" because of frequent traffic with China, he said.

'Avoid Chinese shops'

Elsewhere, governments have enacted travel bans or urged people to remain indoors, adding to a sense of alarm.

Fears of an outbreak were rife in Nigeria this week, for example, when authorities shut a Chinese supermarket in the capital Abuja. But they did so to remove expired products.

The southern African country of Botswana announced a suspected case on Friday, also sparking fears.

""The first thing is to avoid going to Chinese shops as much as possible,"" said Mqondisi Dube, a journalist in the capital Gabarone.

And in the West African archipelago of Cape Verde, locals are rushing to buy fennel because of false claims it heals coronavirus.

In a sign of extreme caution, some governments are also asking Chinese nationals to remain indoors.

Nigeria has urged any person arriving from China to ""self-isolate"" for at least two weeks, even if they are not ill.

The Chinese embassy in Mauritania has similarly asked its recent arrivals in the West African country to remain indoors for two weeks.

In Mozambique, the government has suspended visas for Chinese citizens and forbidden its citizens from travelling there.

South African authorities are checking passengers' temperatures at airports and have listed 11 hospitals that will deal with emergencies if they arise.

- Suspected cases rising -Though Africa is one of the few continents not to have confirmed coronavirus cases, the number of suspected cases is increasing.

Several countries, including Ethiopia, Kenya, Angola, Botswana and Ivory Coast, have signalled possible infections.

But confirming coronavirus can take time, as health authorities lacking expertise have to send samples to labs in countries such as South Africa.

""It is very possible that there are cases that are going on the continent that have not been recognised,"" Nkengasong, the Africa CDC director, told reporters on Tuesday.

""This strain is big. I have not seen a rapidly evolving outbreak like the one we are dealing with,"" Nkengasong said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/article18591376.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28THWHO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/africa-mobilises-against-coronavirus-as-fears-mount/article30709607.ece

22,2020/02/01,Alleged leader of Iraqi al Qaeda group arrested in Arizona,"A man accused of killing two police officers while acting as the leader of an al Qaeda group in the Iraqi city of Fallujah was arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, federal officials said on Friday.

Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, 42, is wanted in Iraq on charges of premeditated murder of the Iraqi police officers in 2006, according to a statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office District of Arizona.

An Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Al-Nouri's arrest and the government there issued an extradition request to the U.S. Justice Department, the statement said.

The Justice Department sought an arrest warrant for Al-Nouri and he was taken into custody on Thursday in Phoenix.

He appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Phoenix on Friday in connection with proceedings to extradite him to Iraq, the statement said.

According to the Iraqi government, al-Nouri was the leader of an al Qaeda group in Fallujah which planned operations targeting Iraqi police.

The statement noted the details in the Iraqi complaint were allegations that had yet to been proven in court.

Al-Nouri's extradition would have to be certified by the U.S. court and the U.S. Secretary of State would then decide whether to surrender him to Iraq, the statement said.

It was not immediately possible to contact Al-Nouri for comment or determine whether he had hired a lawyer.

The statement did not provide information on when Al-Nouri entered the United States or how long he had lived in Phoenix.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e09x8t/article30458480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BreakNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/alleged-leader-of-iraqi-al-qaeda-group-arrested-in-arizona/article30709541.ece
23,2020/02/01,Joy and sadness: how the world reacted on Brexit Day,"The United Kingdom left the European Union on Friday, ending its 47-year membership of the world's biggest trading bloc.

Reactions from leaders in Britain, and from around the world, were a mix of joy, resolve, sadness and resignation.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson

“Our job as the government my job is to bring this country together and take us forward,” Johnson said in a statement.

“And the most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning. This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act. It is a moment of real national renewal and change.”

French President Emmanuel Macron, in address to French citizens

“I remember how much the 2016 (referendum) was made up of lies, exaggeration and simplification, of cheques that were written but will never be honoured... Between France and the United Kingdom there is a long history, founded on blood, freedom, courage, on battles that we have shared... This is a sad day, there's no hiding it. But it's also a day which should prompt us to proceed in a different way. To build with more determination a European Union that is powerful, effective, which you find more convincing and which rediscovers the historical path that makes this European Union a unique and, in my eyes, irreplaceable adventure.”

Former British Prime Minister Theresa May

“At 11 pm tonight, Britain will leave the European Union. After more than three years, we can finally say that we have delivered on the result of the 2016 referendum and have kept faith with the British people.”

British Opposition Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn

“Britains place in the world will change. The question is what direction we now take,” Corbyn said in a statement.

“We can build a truly internationalist, diverse and outward-looking Britain. Or we can turn inwards, and trade our principles, rights and standards to secure hastily arranged, one-sided, race-to-the-bottom trade deals with Donald Trump and others.”

Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, On Twitter

“Happy Brexit Day! ... At last the day comes when we break free. A massive victory for the people against the establishment....11 pm tonight marks the point of no return. Once we Leave, we will never rejoin the European Union. Time to celebrate.”

Carl Bildt, former Swedish Prime Minister

“It was in 1962 Dean Acheson famously said that Britain had 'lost an empire, and failed to find a role.' A decade later, it found a European role, made a success of it, but decided to throw it away half a century later. And now? No one really knows. It's back to square one.”

Donald Tusk, Ex-President of European Council

“My dear British friends. We were, we are, and we will always be a Community. And no Brexit will ever change that.”

EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier

“Today my thoughts go the millions of British citizens who are sad, as we are sad today,” Barnier told BBC TV.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo

“The British people wanted out of the tyranny of Brussels,” Pompeo told the Daily Telegraph. “They wanted the capacity to make their own decisions. We want that for the British people too.”

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon

“Tonight, the UK will leave the European Union. That will be a moment of profound sadness for many of us across the UK. And here in Scotland, given that it is happening against the will of the vast majority of us, that sadness will be tinged with anger,” she said.

“I want to focus on something much more important. Hope of a different and better future for Scotland ... After tonight, that future is only open to us with independence.”

David Cameron, former British Prime Minister

“It's obviously a very big day for our country,” Cameron, who called the 2016 referendum and quit after the vote for Brexit, told Sky News.

“I always accepted the referendum result and knew this day would come. We are one of the biggest economies in the world ... we can make a success of the choice that we make and I'm sure that's exactly what we will do.”

Tony Blair, former British Prime Minister

“I opposed Brexit with every fibre of my political being. I still deeply regret it, politically and emotionally... But Brexit is happening, and our attitude now should be to strive to make the best of it; to approach it with determined optimism, not looking over our shoulders in unrequited longing for what was.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/3gthrj/article25926072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/7THBREXIT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/joy-and-sadness-how-the-world-is-reacting-on-brexit-day/article30709398.ece
24,2020/02/01,"U.S. declares coronavirus health emergency, bars foreign nationals who visited China","The Trump administration, while insisting the risk to Americans from coronavirus is low, nevertheless declared a public health emergency on Friday and announced the extraordinary step of barring entry to the United States of foreign nationals who have recently visited China.

In addition, U.S. citizens who have traveled within the past two weeks to China's Hubei Province - epicenter of the coronavirus epidemic - will be subject to a mandatory quarantine of 14 days, the incubation period of the virus, officials said.

Americans who visited other parts of mainland China will undergo special health screening upon their return, followed by up to 14 days of “monitored self-quarantine,” under the temporary restrictions.

The emergency measures were unveiled by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar at a White House briefing, shortly before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local health authorities announced a seventh U.S. coronavirus case had been confirmed in Northern California.

The latest U.S. patient was identified only as a man in Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, who became ill after traveling to China and has “self-isolated” at home, Sara Cody, director of public health for the county, told reporters.

She said the CDC was seeking to determine whether the man was infectious while flying home.

The U.S. entry ban on foreign travelers to China and the quarantine for Americans returning from Hubei go into effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. EST (2200 GMT), Mr. Azar said.

At the same time all commercial flights from China would be restricted to international U.S. airports in one of seven cities - New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle and Honolulu.

An average of more than 14,000 people traveled by air to the United States from China each day last year, either by direct or indirect flights, according to the White House.

Keeping risk low

CDC Director Robert Redfield told reporters the U.S. government acted after the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Thursday over the spread of the respiratory disease.

“I want to emphasize that this is a serious health situation in China, but I want to emphasize that the risk to the American public is currently low,” Redfield said. “Our goal is to do all we can do to keep it that way.”

The U.S. State Department warned Americans on Thursday not to travel to China because of the epidemic.

The ban on U.S. entry of foreign nationals who have traveled to China during the past 14 days would exempt immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent U.S. residents, Azar said.

The suspension-of-entry proclamation, signed by President Donald Trump, says the ban stays in effect until the president lifts it, and that the HHS secretary will recommend every 15 days whether to do so.

The flu-like coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in a seafood and animal market in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, and was first identified earlier this month, has resulted in 259 deaths in China.

More than 11,700 people have been infected in China, and more than 130 cases reported in at least 25 other countries and regions, with Russia, Britain, Sweden and Italy all reporting their first cases on Thursday or Friday.

None of the U.S. cases has been fatal, and all but one of the patients in the United States was believed to have contracted the disease while they were traveling in the Wuhan area of China.

First U.S. quarantines

The first quarantines of U.S. citizens potentially exposed to coronavirus in China began hours before the White House announcement.

Nearly 200 Americans evacuated earlier this week from Wuhan and voluntarily confined to a California military air base for 72 hours of health screenings were placed under a mandatory 14-day quarantine on Friday. It marked the CDC's first quarantine order in 50 years.

The State Department said Friday it was working with Chinese agencies to arrange additional flights of Americans out of Wuhan. Washington also plans to evacuate non-essential government employees and family members from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang due to the outbreak, a State Department official said on Thursday.

The two-week quarantine of the 195 Americans at March Air Reserve Base, near Los Angeles, runs from the time the evacuees left China on Tuesday.

The original plan was to release the passengers after 72 hours of evaluation and tests, absent any indication of illness, and permit them to take public transportation home. Local health authorities would then continue monitoring the evacuees through the remainder of the incubation period.

CDC officials said then that such a plan posed little or no risk of spreading the virus because individuals incubating the infection before symptoms appear are generally not contagious.

But Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters on Friday that experts' understanding of the virus was still evolving.

She cited emerging evidence the virus can be spread by someone who is infected but not yet showing signs of being ill, such as fever, cough and other respiratory symptoms.

The CDC also pointed to a limitation of its screening test for the virus - a negative result is merely a “point-in-time” snapshot that cannot conclusively rule out the risk of a person developing the disease during the 14-day incubation period.

The blanket quarantine at March air base was instituted after one passenger sought to leave the base without permission on Wednesday night, and was immediately slapped with an individual quarantine order by local health officials.

As of Thursday, none of the group at the base had exhibited signs of the disease, local health officials said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/o9aybo/article30670855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-declares-coronavirus-health-emergency-bars-foreign-nationals-who-visited-china/article30709395.ece
25,2020/02/01,"Coronavirus | Death toll rises to 259, nearly 12,000 confirmed infections in China","The death toll from China’s new coronavirus outbreak has risen to 259 and the tally of confirmed infections has surged to nearly 12,000, the government said on February 1.

The National Health Commission said in its daily update that 46 more people had succumbed to the respiratory disease.

All but one of the new deaths came in hardest-hit Hubei province, the epicentre of an outbreak that has spread around the world.

The virus emerged in December in Hubei’s provincial capital Wuhan, and has been traced to a meat market that sold wild game.

The number of infections in China also rose, by 2,102, bringing the nationwide total to 11,791.

That’s despite unprecedented quarantine measures imposed last week on millions of people in Hubei and aggressive preventive steps elsewhere in the country.

The number of new deaths and newly confirmed cases have both spiralled higher on a daily basis since China sounded the nationwide alarm a week ago.

The epidemic has spread far and wide as huge numbers of Chinese travelled within and outside the country for the Lunar New Year holiday that started last week.

It has since ballooned into a global health emergency with cases in more than two dozen countries.

26,2020/02/01,Chief Justice John Roberts says he won’t break a tie in Trump impeachment trial,"Chief Justice John Roberts was never going to be vote No. 51.

Justice Roberts said Friday that he had no intention of breaking a tie in President Donald Trump’s Senate impeachment trial, dispelling something of a mystery that had hung over the proceedings.

The statement from Justice Roberts came before senators prepared to vote on a resolution setting the schedule for the final stages of the trial. Senators are expected to vote Wednesday on whether to acquit Trump. Earlier in the evening, they voted by a 51-49 margin to reject witnesses at the trial.

The question of whether a chief justice is empowered to break a tie in an impeachment trial is regarded as an open issue among legal scholars.

Justice Roberts was responding to a question from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who asked Justice Roberts if he was aware that in the impeachment trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868, the presiding chief justice cast two tie-breaking votes.

Justice Roberts said he was, explaining that one concerned a motion to adjourn while the other involved a motion to close deliberations.

""I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties,” Justice Roberts said. “I think it would inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/vv2uhr/article30598726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPIMPEACHMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chief-justice-john-roberts-says-he-wont-break-a-tie-in-trump-impeachment-trial/article30709338.ece
27,2020/02/01,Trump impeachment verdict next week after Senate rejects call for new witnesses,"The U.S. Senate on Friday rejected Democratic calls for new witnesses at Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, paving the way for the president to be acquitted next week of the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Following the 51-49 vote, Republican senators said a vote for acquittal is expected at 4.00 p.m. (2100 GMT) on Wednesday. That would mean the trial will not have concluded before Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his nationally televised annual “State of the Union” speech on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress.

President Trump is all-but-assured of being acquitted by the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats to 47 for the Democrats and a two-thirds majority — or 67 senators — is needed to remove the President.

Two Republican senators — Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine — joined 47 Democrats in voting to introduce further witnesses and documents into the historic trial of the 45th U.S. president. Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer denounced the refusal to introduce new witnesses into just the third impeachment trial of a president in US history, calling it a “grand tragedy.”

“If the president is acquitted with no witnesses or no documents the acquittal will have no value,” Mr. Schumer said.

‘Sham trial’

“America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, where the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial,” he said.

Democrats had been eager to hear from John Bolton following reports that the former national security advisor claims in an upcoming book to have been personally told by Trump that military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his Joe Biden, his potential Democratic rival in November's presidential election.

The charge is at the heart of the December 18 impeachment of Trump for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said House prosecutors had already presented enough evidence to make their case and there was no need for further witnesses.

“A majority of the U.S. Senate has determined that the numerous witnesses and 28,000-plus pages of documents already in evidence are sufficient to judge the House Managers’ accusations and end this impeachment trial,” he said.

“There is no need for the Senate to re-open the investigation,” Mr. McConnell said. “Never in Senate history has this body paused an impeachment trial to pursue additional witnesses.”

Mr. McConnell said he would consult with fellow senators, White House lawyers and Democratic House prosecutors “to determine next steps as we prepare to conclude the trial in the coming days.”

‘Partisan nature’

Democrats had been hoping to sway enough Republicans to support the call for further witnesses but efforts collapsed when Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she would vote “no” to new testimony.

“Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,” said Ms. Murkowski, one of four Republicans whose votes were seen as decisive on the witness issue.

“I don't think the continuation of this process will change anything,” she added. Minutes before Friday's Senate session, a bombshell news story injected fresh controversy into the trial.

In the latest of a series of reports on Bolton's yet-to-be-published book, The New York Times said the White House aide claims that Trump directed him in May to help pressure Ukraine for damaging information on Mr. Biden, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Also taking part in that conversation, the book reportedly claims, were Trump chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, whom Democrats also sought to subpoena; Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani; and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel leading Trump's impeachment defense.

In a White House statement Trump denied one specific aspect of the Bolton story, that he ordered Bolton to set up a meeting between Mr. Giuliani and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Mr. Giuliani told the Times there was never any conversation between the five on Ukraine. “It is absolutely, categorically untrue,” he said, according to the newspaper.

Adam Schiff, the leader of the House impeachment prosecutors, opened Democrats’ last-ditch arguments on Friday by saying the Bolton news underscored the need for witnesses. “This trial is supposed to be a quest for the truth,” Mr. Schiff said. “Let’s not fear what we will learn.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/sj76oe/article30709320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OK2M7jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/senate-rejects-calling-new-witnesses-in-trump-impeachment-trial/article30709285.ece
28,2020/02/01,Brexit Day: Britain bids farewell to the European Union after nearly 50 years,"Britain on Friday ends almost half a century of integration with Europe, finally making its historic departure from the EU to begin a new — uncertain — future, with emotions running high following years of wrangling and several false starts.

As the clocks strike 11:00 p.m. (2300 GMT) in Britain, the bloc’s often reluctant member becomes the first to leave an organisation set up to forge unity among nations after the horrors of World War II. The country’s departure has exposed deep divisions in British society — and soul-searching in Brussels about the impact of the loss of 66 million people, a global diplomatic big-hitter and the clout of the City of London financial centre.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson was a figurehead in the 2016 referendum vote to end 47 years of increasingly close ties between the British and more than 500 million of their nearest neighbours. He has promised to unite the island nation in a new era of prosperity, forging new links further from home.

“This is not an end but a beginning. This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act,” Mr. Johnson said.

Historic warning sign: Macron

EU institutions began removing Union flags in Brussels on Friday in preparation for a divorce that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called it a “sea-change” for the bloc, while French President Emmanuel Macron described it as a “historic warning sign” that should force Europe to stop and reflect.

Britain’s departure was sealed at an emotional EU Parliament hearing this week that ended with MEPs singing a chorus of Auld Lang Syne, a traditional Scottish song of farewell. Although almost nothing will change immediately due to an 11-month transition period negotiated as part of an EU-UK exit deal ratified this week.

Britons will be able to work in and trade freely with EU nations until December 31, and vice versa, although the UK will no longer be represented in the bloc's institutions. But legally, Britain is out.

And while the exit terms have been agreed, Britain must still strike a deal on future relations with the EU, its largest trading partner. Both will set out their negotiating positions Monday. “We want to have the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom, but it will never be as good as membership,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels.

Years of tumult

Getting this far has been a traumatic process. Despite Britain’s resistance to many EU projects over the years — it refused to join the single currency or the Schengen open travel area — the 2016 vote to leave was a huge shock. It unleashed political chaos in London, sparking years of bitter arguments that paralysed Parliament and forced the resignations of Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May.

In the debate about why Britain voted to leave, some said voters saw the distant EU as a convenient scapegoat to punish the government in London, which backed staying in, for years of cuts and austerity that left many worse off.

Mr. Johnson brought an end to the turmoil with last month’s decisive snap General Election victory and parliamentary majority to ratify his revised Brexit deal. But Britons remain as divided as they were nearly four years ago, when 52% voted to leave and 48% voted to remain in the EU.

In Scotland, where a majority in 2016 backed Britain remaining in the bloc, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called it a moment of “sadness... tinged with anger”. She vowed to step up the campaign for Scottish independence, which Scots rejected in a 2014 vote.

In Northern Ireland, where there are fears Brexit could destabilise a hard-won peace after several decades of conflict over British rule, europhiles rallied in Belfast, parking a billboard in front of the devolved assembly. It read: “This island rejects Brexit.”

Parties and vigils

Mr. Johnson, himself a polarising figure, has said he is avoiding any major celebrations that might exacerbate divisions. The Conservative leader hosted a special cabinet meeting in the northeastern city of Sunderland, which was the first to declare for Brexit in the 2016 vote.

A Downing Street spokesman said ministers discussed aiming to have 80 percent of Britain's commerce covered by free trade agreements within three years. At 10:00 p.m., Mr. Johnson will broadcast to the nation, as a countdown clock is beamed onto the walls of Downing Street, before marking the occasion at a reception with English sparkling wine, and canapes topped with roast beef, Yorkshire pudding and Shropshire blue cheese.

Government buildings were lit up in the red, white and blue of the British flag. Millions of commemorative 50 pence coins will go into circulation. Ex-MEP Nigel Farage, who has spent decades campaigning to leave the EU, is planning a large rally in nearby Parliament Square -- one of several pro-Brexit parties being held around the country.

“I'm pleased, it’s about time, this has took far longer than it should have,” said Eric Horsley, 67, from Hartlepool, northeast England. Not everyone is celebrating, with vigils planned by pro-EU supporters. “Today is a day of mourning,” said Katrina Graham, 31, an Irish women’s rights activist who lives in Brussels, at a protest in central London.

Up in flames

Brexit supporters on Friday burnt a European Union flag in central London. An AFP photographer at the scene saw one man draped in a Union flag set fire to the blue and yellow emblem of the soon-to-be 27-member organisation in front of crowds.

Crowds gathered in and around Parliament Square, which the government was marking by lighting up government buildings in red, white and blue. Some chanted “Bye bye, EU, bye bye!” Pro-EU supporters in and around government offices on Whitehall countered with chants of their own.

Trade talks loom

From Saturday, Britain will be free to strike trade deals around the world, including with the United States. But exactly how that will work — and at what cost to firms that depend on EU business — is unclear.

Mr. Johnson has given himself just 11 months to negotiate a new partnership, covering everything from trade to security cooperation. Brussels has already warned he must either limit his ambitions or ask for more time.

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned Friday that a failure to reach a post-Brexit trade deal by the deadline would pose an “existential threat” to his country.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/qbps4n/article30707527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OL4FNjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/britain-bids-farewell-to-the-european-union-after-almost-half-a-century/article30707525.ece
29,2020/02/01,"Number of coronavirus-infected in Wuhan 10 times official tally, says University of Hong Kong study","More than 75,000 people — ten times the official tally of confirmed cases — have been infected with the coronavirus in Wuhan, ground zero of a global health emergency, according to research published Friday.

“We estimate that 75,815 individuals have been infected in Wuhan as of January 25, 2020,” a team led by Gabriel Leung from the University of Hong Kong reported in The Lancet.

As of January 31, the Chinese government said the number of confirmed cases had risen above 9,700 for all of China, including 213 deaths. For Hubei Province, including Wuhan, a city in central China of 11 million, the official figure was nearly 6,000 confirmed cases and just over 200 deaths.

The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the outbreak a global health emergency, but said it was not recommending any international trade or travel restrictions.

A very apparent discrepancy

“The apparent discrepancy between our modelled estimates of 2019-nCoV infections and the actual number of confirmed cases in Wuhan could be due to several factors,” Mr. Leung said in a statement.

A time lag between infection and symptom onset, delays in infected persons getting medical treatment, and the time needed to confirm cases with lab tests “could all affect overall recording and reporting,” he said.

The study found that each person infected with the virus, which emerged in December, could have infected two to three individuals on average, and that the epidemic had doubled in size every 6.4 days.

If the virus spreads as quickly on a national scale, “it is possible that epidemics could be already growing in multiple major Chinese cities, with a time lag of one to two weeks behind Wuhan,” said co-author Joseph Wu, a professor at the University of Hong Kong.

Other outbreak epicentres

“Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could potentially also become outbreak epicentres,” they said.

If the new estimate of cases is accurate, it would mean that the mortality rate of the 2019-nCoV virus is significantly lower than preliminary figures suggested, with well under 1% of cases proving deadly. But a low mortality rate can still result in a large number of deaths if the virus spread widely.

The seasonal flu, for example, kills 290,000 to 650,000 people per year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In the United States, the mortality rate among people infected with influenza is 0.13%, the Centers for Disease Control has calculated.

2019-nCoV is part of the coronavirus family, which was the source of two previous deadly epidemics. The 2002-03 SARS outbreak (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) started in Guangdong Province and killed 774 people out of a total 8,096 infected. The 2012 MERS outbreak (Middle East respiratory syndrome) killed 858 people out of the 2,494 infected.

The respective mortality rates for SARS and MERS patients was 9.5 and 34.5%, far higher than for the new coronavirus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/7hk5t/article30706671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31JANMORPHOLOGYCORONAjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/number-of-coronavirus-infected-in-wuhan-10-times-official-tally-says-university-of-hong-kong-study/article30706670.ece

32,2020/02/01,Brexit a historic warning sign for the European Union: Macron,"Brexit is a “historic warning sign” for the European Union, French President Emmanuel Macron said hours before Britain’s departure from the EU, adding that it meant “we need more Europe”.

“This departure is a shock. It's a historic warning sign which must...be heard by all of Europe and make us reflect,” Mr. Macron said in a short televised address.

The French leader said he believed Brexit had been made possible because EU members had a tendency to “make Europe a scapegoat for our own problems.” President Macron, who was elected on a promise to transform the EU, also argued that Britain’s decision to leave was enabled by the fact that “we did not change Europe enough”.

Faced with competition from China and the U.S., “we need more Europe”, he went on, reiterating the themes of his historic Sorbonne speech of September 2017. Calling Friday a “sad day” he attacked the “lies, exaggerations, simplifications and cheques promised that never arrived” of the Brexit Referendum Campaign of 2016.

“We must always remember where lies can lead our democracies,” he said solemnly. Mr. Macron, who hosted the EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier earlier Friday for talks in Paris, also sounded a firm note on the upcoming negotiations between London and Brussels on their future relationship.

While saying he hoped for the “closest, most solid, most enduring partnership possible” he warned: “It won’t be the same as the relationship we have had for several decades. You cannot be both in and out.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/9i3me3/article30706452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OK11Gjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-a-historic-warning-sign-for-the-european-union-macron/article30706453.ece
33,2020/02/01,CERN shuns Workplace by Facebook app over data privacy,"The European Organisation for Nuclear Research, or CERN, has decided to shun enterprise connectivity platform Workplace by Facebook, citing concerns around the management of user data by the social networking giant.

Announcing that CERN’s presence on Workplace ended on January 31, the organisation said the decision was taken because of a lack of usage by CERN members and concerns about data privacy.

“Reactions were not always positive. Many people preferred not to use a tool from a company that they did not trust in terms of data privacy. To date, about 1,000 members of the CERN community have created a Workplace account and there are roughly 150 active users of the platform per week,” CERN said in a statement.

In October 2016, Facebook made Workplace available to any company or organisation.

“In particular, for CERN, they made the enticing offer of waiving the fees and so we took the opportunity to test the platform. Representatives from HR, IT and IR worked together to carry out dedicated trials within their department/sector to gather feedback,” said the organization.

In July 2019, Workplace announced new account plans and, in October, announced that there were three million paid users.

CERN was then given a choice of either paying to continue with the initially free set-up or downgrading to a free version that would remove administrative rights and CERN single sign-on access and send all data to Facebook.

“Losing control of our data was unacceptable, as was paying for a tool that was not part of our core offering for the CERN community; therefore, we will end the trial of this platform,” said CERN.

To replace key Workplace functionalities, a suite of alternative solutions has been made available to the CERN community.

34,2020/02/01,"Coronavirus enters Web, users hacked with malicious files","Taking advantage of people’s curiosity about the coronavirus that has become the talking point across the globe, cyber criminals have started deploying malicious files on people’s computers in the guise of providing information and safety tips about the virus, security researchers warned on Friday.

The researchers from cybersecurity firm Kaspersky have detected such malicious files that were masked under the guise of pdf, mp4 and docx files about the coronavirus.

The names of files imply that they contain video instructions on how to stay protected from the virus, updates on the threat and even virus detection procedures.

In fact, these files contained a range of threats from Trojans to worms, which are capable of destroying, blocking, modifying or copying data, as well as interfering with the operation of computers or computer networks.

“The coronavirus, which is being widely discussed as a major news story, has already been used as bait by cybercriminals. So far, we have seen only 10 unique files, but as this sort of activity often happens with popular media topics, then we expect that this tendency may grow,” Kaspersky malware analyst Anton Ivanov said in a statement.

“As people continue to be worried for their health, we may see more and more malware hidden inside fake documents about the coronavirus being spread,” Ivanov said.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the Novel Coronavirus outbreak a global health emergency.

To avoid falling victim to malicious programmes pretending to be exclusive content, people should try to avoid suspicious links promising exclusive content and refer to official sources for trustworthy and legitimate information, Kaspersky recommended.

“Look at the downloaded file extension. Documents and video files should not have been made either .exe or .lnk formats,” it added.

35,2020/02/01,"Facebook, Twitter fighting fake news linked to coronavirus","With claims related to false cures or prevention methods for coronavirus, like drinking bleach cures infections, spreading on social media, giants like Facebook and Twitter have started taking proactive measures to fight the spread of harmful content, apart from taking action against those who spread misinformation.

Facebook said it is focusing on limiting the spread of misinformation and harmful content about the virus, while also connecting people to helpful information.

“Our global network of third-party fact-checkers are continuing their work reviewing content and debunking false claims that are spreading related to the coronavirus,” Facebook’s Head of Health Kang-Xing Jin wrote in a blog post.

“When they rate information as false, we limit its spread on Facebook and Instagram and show people accurate information from these partners. We also send notifications to people who already shared or are trying to share this content to alert them that it’s been fact-checked,” Jin added.

Twitter said it has invested significantly in its proactive abilities to ensure trends, search, and other common areas of the service are protected from malicious behaviour.

“As ever, those who engage in these practices will be removed from our service. We do not permit platform manipulation and we encourage people to think before sharing or engaging in deliberate attempts to undermine the public conversation,” Twitter said in a blog post, adding that it has seen over 15 million tweets on #coronavirus in the past four weeks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern.

Twitter said it is also halting any auto-suggest results that are likely to direct individuals to non-credible content on the platform.

“This is an expansion of our #KnowTheFacts prompt, which we specifically put in place for the public to find clear, credible information on immunisation and vaccination health,” it added.

In collaboration with the WHO, Twitter is also working towards launching a dedicated search prompt for India to ensure that when an individual searches a hashtag they are immediately met with authoritative health information from the right sources up top, IANS has learned.

Facebook said it is closely coordinating with leading health organisations to make it easier for people to connect with accurate information about the situation due to the coronavirus outbreak.

“For example, we will help people get relevant and up-to-date information from partners through messages on top of News Feed on Facebook; these will be deployed based on guidance from the WHO,” the Facebook’s Head of Health said.

Social media platform ShareChat said it has multiple third-party fact-checkers reviewing content across 12 languages.

“Prime membership continues to get better for customers year after year.

37,2020/02/01,The iron women of Manipur who live and breathe Olympian dreams,"Ching Juan Neina, a bright-eyed 15-year-old, tapes her wrists and dips her hands into a bowl of chalk. She stands over a barbell stacked with a pair of green 10 kg plates, reaches down, and grips the bar, readying her body for a snatch, one of the two moves central to competitive weightlifting. After a brief pause, she gets into position — chest up, feet directly below hips, back flat, knees bent, core tight and arms straight — and slowly pulls the barbell past her knees. In a single, explosive movement, she drives it past her chest and head, and drops, as weightlifting parlance has it, ass-to-grass. She holds the position for a split second and then releases the barbell. It bounces on the platform, almost sliding off the scuffed wood.

Anita Chanu, wearing a bright yellow jacket with the word ‘Coach’ emblazoned across its back, rolls back the barbell. She walks briskly around the Regular Coaching Centre at the Khuman Lampak Stadium in Imphal, Manipur’s capital, past rusty racks, stacks of bright plates, fraying rubber mats, past grimy, cobweb-tinselled windows, stopping intermittently to correct, reprimand or praise. “Your knees are in the wrong position.” “Faster, faster…” “Try again.” “That was very good,” she says to a girl who has cleared around 65 kg, raising her voice to be heard over the constant thud of barbells, the scrape of wooden-soled weightlifting shoes on bare concrete, and the chatter of the dozen-odd girls and young women who have gathered to train this December morning.

A pioneer of women’s weightlifting in India, Chanu hopes to train more women who will follow in her footsteps. “This is a small, simple training centre,” says Chanu. “But with nothing but honesty and sincerity, we have produced so many international athletes.” Drifting through the air, as palpable as the faint whiff of perspiration and the tired sighs, is a shared ambition for one thing, and one thing alone. “To become an Olympian,” as Neina confesses.

A sporting legacy

The Olympic dream echoes through the lush oval valley surrounded by hills. Sporting activities are inextricably woven into the State’s cultural fabric, and it has been that way for centuries. Polo, for instance, originated here as did other sports, including mukna, a form of wrestling; indigenous martial arts such as thang-ta and sarit sarat; khong kangjei, a version of hockey that also included bouts of wrestling; and yubi lapki, a rugby-like game played with a coconut. By the medieval era, the kingdom was divided into six districts called ‘pannas’ for administrative and military purposes. The pannas competed against each other in sports contests and the winners were rewarded by the king. “Like all nations in the past, Manipur’s people had to keep themselves fit to meet any eventualities, including war,” explains R.K. Nimai Singh, former commissioner of Youth Affairs and Sports in Manipur. So, they engaged in many sports, he adds.

The obsession with sports stayed with Manipur through its tumultuous history. In 1891, when the British conquered Manipur and turned it into a princely State, the panna system died. A sports club culture developed, and an abundance of tiny clubs sprang up. These neighbourhood clubs, created and supported by the local people, remain the primary system for athletic development in Manipur. “You won’t find it anywhere else except West Bengal,” says Singh.

After Independence, Manipur became a reluctant addition to the new India. It had framed its own constitution and even held its first Assembly election by the time the Maharajah of Manipur was forced into signing a merger agreement with India in 1949. Manipuris have since held their integration into India as illegal and unconstitutional, writes Thongkholal Haokip, assistant professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, in India’s Look East Policy and the Northeast.

Through upheavals and all

Independence movements in the State began to gather force in the early 60s. In 1964, the Meitei-led United National Liberation Front became the first separatist faction in the State. Over the last 50 years, more than 30 such groups (some now inactive) mushroomed across Manipur. In response, the Centre came down hard on the secessionists, and in 1980 imposed the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in Manipur. The exercise of these powers, rationalised as necessary to control violence, has often led to human rights violations such as rape, extrajudicial killings, and harassment.

The insurgents retaliate with strikes, blockades, disorder and violence. The ongoing battle may have affected law and order, but there is one thing nobody in Manipur — neither politicians nor rebels — interferes with: sports.

Like millions across the country, Nameirakpam Kunjarani Devi, then 14, and her family, gathered round the TV to watch the 1982 Asian Games over 16 drama-filled days, the first big event broadcast in colour in India. In the little town of Kairang, some 2,000 km from Delhi, where the games were held, Devi watched P.T. Usha, ‘the queen of Indian track and field’, sprinting her way to two silver medals. It triggered her own desire to mount a winner’s podium at international competitions. She tried her hand at every sport she could think of: hockey, football, kho-kho. But at 4 feet, 11 inches, she knew she had little chance in these games.

Strength sports, however, were a different deal.

Anita Chanu and Kunjarani Devi met at the home of their powerlifting coach, Kunja Kishore Singh, in 1983. They trained on the porch of Singh’s house through balmy summers, sodden monsoons, and foggy winters, mindful of nothing but the heft of metal and the weight of their dreams. They lifted makeshift barbells — discarded autorickshaw rods to which they attached weights — and used cut bamboo as squat racks. In those early years, the government allocated no funds to sports development. “We even put in our own money to participate in competitions,” says Devi. Or they turned to friends and families. “When I wanted to go for a championship, all of Manipur would chip in. If anyone had a spare rupee, they were ready to donate it to sports,” she says.

Shorter is better

That year, Devi created a national record in powerlifting, with a 75 kg back squat, 42.5 kg bench press, and 95 kg deadlift. Two years later, Chanu represented India at the World Powerlifting Championship in Vienna. The international exposure whet her appetite. “I thought I should participate in the Olympics,” she says. Except, powerlifting wasn’t an Olympic sport. Then, in 1985, for the first time, India conducted its National Games modelled along the lines of the Summer Olympics. And for the first time, women’s weightlifting was added. Chanu and Devi switched to weightlifting, which tests strength limits using the snatch and clean-and-jerk instead of powerlifting’s bench press, back squat and deadlift. They were soon excelling at it.

Research shows that shorter heights give athletes an advantage in weightlifting because they have a lower centre of gravity, which means greater stability and better leverage. The average Manipuri, says Chanu, has the right build for weightlifting — “short but with good muscle mass” — especially for the lower weight categories. “Our youth have good discipline, dedication and yes, killer instinct,” she says.

Gold is gold

A photograph from the 1985 National Games shows Devi, dressed in a singlet and sporting the same pixie haircut she has today, lunging into the final position of a clean-and-jerk. Her white-gloved hands grip the 85 kg barbell, her biceps are straining. At that time, she weighed only 44 kg, the lowest of the 10 weight categories allowed for women. She went on to win gold in three categories — 44 kg, 46 kg and 48 kg.

“Gold is gold,” says the soft-spoken, bespectacled Devi. “It changed everything for me.” Devi went on to set two new national records at the National Games in Thiruvananthapuram two years later. She trained locally with her old coach until 1989; in her free time poring over the sports magazines that trickled into Manipur.

China had already emerged as a weightlifting powerhouse by then — it holds the most world records to this day — and Devi tracked it through 1985, 86 and 87. Even without focused training, she realised she could lift almost as much as the Chinese champions. “I knew this was my sport,” says Devi.

The Sports Authority of India had by then begun organising national coaching camps. Chanu and Devi began travelling to attend these camps, rarely going home to Manipur for breaks. The trip home would have taken five days each way, if they were lucky not to get stranded at the border by the ongoing insurgency. But that wasn’t the only reason they stayed behind. They feared deconditioning because of the lack of proper infrastructure back home. So, Devi and Chanu would stay back in the camps, tossing around barbells, deepening squats, stretching their limbs to better flexibility.

Giving back

Chanu took part in 11 international contests overall, winning a few medals at various Asian championships, but by 1990 she was battling multiple injuries. “I was very disappointed,” she says. So her focus shifted to coaching. She had been exposed to the best coaches, physiotherapists, masseuses at the camps. “I learned a lot from them,” she says, and decided to share it with the next generation. In 1999, Manipur hosted the National Games and built Khuman Lampak stadium in the heart of Imphal. Chanu opened her Regular Coaching Centre at the stadium the next year.

Devi went on to become the most decorated Indian sportswoman in weightlifting. She started competing internationally by 1989, gathering medals almost everywhere she went, including three silvers at the Women’s World Weightlifting Championship in Manchester that year, bronzes at the Asian Games in 1990 and 1994, a gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games — 68 international medals in all. In 2004, she made it to the Athens Olympics, finishing fifth with a combined lift of 190 kg. She was honoured with the Arjuna Award for Sports, the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna and, in 2011, a Padma Shri.

Devi’s rockstar status both derives from and fuels the empowerment of the women of Manipur, unusual in a country known for its extreme gender inequality. From early times, women’s strength was encouraged and lauded in Manipur. “In ancient Manipuri history there was no sexism,” says lawyer and human rights activist Leitanthem Umakanta Meitei in a paper titled, ‘Voyages of Women in Manipur’.

The ancient Lallup-Kaba, a sort of forced labour system that required every adult male to spend a considerable amount of time away from home, serving the king, created economic independence for women. When the men were away, the women tended to the fields and engaged in trade, male domains in most other cultures.

Today, women run almost all the markets in Manipur, including the Ema Bazaar or Nupi Keithel, a 500-year-old, all-women’s market in the heart of Imphal, by some accounts the largest such in Asia. They’ve fought wars — against both the British and against substance abuse in the State — and spent nights patrolling the streets to prevent human rights violations in Manipur. This strength naturally extends to sports.

A new champion

Tokyo 2020 is around the corner, and India’s hope for it — Saikhom Mirabai Chanu — is training hard. The bobble on her hat bounces as she jogs with a group of young women across the lawns of the National Institute of Sports in Patiala; the shortest in the bunch, she leads the pack in a messy line. They stop and launch into stretches, conditioning exercises and plyometrics under the eagle eye of national weightlifting coach Vijay Sharma. Twenty minutes later, warm-up completed, they shed jackets, change shoes and turn to the barbells that line the weightlifting hall.

“Chal beta,” (go child) says Sharma. Mirabai bends forward, touches her forehead to the barbell — almost as if in prayer — and stands up, her personal ritual before every lift. She bends again, this time drawing the barbell to her shoulder, then squats, stands up and drops it. “Shabash!” says Sharma.

She lifts like a natural, but Mirabai’s entrance into this world was almost accidental. She had wanted to enrol in archery but the enclosure was closed, so she peeked into the weightlifting hall at Khuman Lampak Stadium and was smitten. “I wanted to do it,” she says, nursing a cup of coffee as old Bollywood songs stream out of the tea shop where we meet after her training.

She turned out to be very good at her game. She attributes this to years spent trekking up and down hills carrying firewood on her head. Anita Chanu, Mirabai’s first coach, says she saw great potential in her right from the start: “I told her parents that if they supported her, she would win many medals.”

Mirabai trained at Chanu’s centre for the next four years, daily traversing 20-odd km between her home in the village of Nongpok Kakching to Imphal. Sometimes, she took a shared tuk-tuk, often she cycled or hitched a ride on a truck, crossing straw-strewn fields and fish farms before reaching the city.

It was hard, at first, she remembers. Her father, Saikhom Kriti Singh, earned a paltry salary in the Public Works Department and had six children to raise. “I told my mother it would be difficult for her to spend so much extra on my diet,” she says. But her mother asked her not to worry. Bananas every day, milk and eggs twice or thrice a week, and vegetables that grew around the house fuelled her. “Not really a proper full diet,” she remembers, but enough to keep her going.

She won her first significant medal just one year after training — a gold at the Youth Championships in Chhattisgarh in 2009. Within five years, she was lifting a combined weight of 170 kg, enough to win her a silver at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014. She started working with her current coach Vijay Sharma that year, and by 2016 was lifting a total of 192 kg, breaking Kunjarani Devi’s 12-year-old record of 190 kg.

News of her success has drifted into the village of Nongpok Kakching, her hometown in Manipur, more than 2,000 km away. “I’m really happy about what she has achieved,” says her mother Saikhom Tombi Devi, hauling a couple of wooden chairs into the courtyard of their home. She unearths a prized photograph of her daughter receiving the Khel Ratna in 2018, dusts it with her pink dupatta, and says, “Our village has become famous because of my daughter.”

Olympic dreams

In August 2016, Mirabai travelled with six Manipuri athletes to Rio de Janeiro to compete in the Summer Olympics. Her 192 kg (423 lbs) lift was enough to garner a medal, any medal, she thought. On stage, she blinked at the blinding lights, the weight plates, the row of competitors beside her. She felt a sudden wave of panic. Then she went blank. To this day, she doesn’t remember what happened next. But India did.

The newspapers the next morning went to town: ‘India’s Meltdown at Rio,’ said The Hindu; ‘Weightlifter Mirabai Chanu disappoints, blows away medal chance,’ said The Indian Express; ‘Weightlifter Mirabai Chanu failed to complete her event,’ said The Times of India. The words seared deeply into her psyche as the three letters DNF (Did Not Finish) appeared beside her name on the Olympics scoreboard. Worse, the silver medallist that year, Sri Wahyuni Agustiani of Indonesia, lifted 192 kg, exactly what Mirabai Chanu had lifted at the trials.

She remembers being distraught, questioning her skill and strength, even toying with the idea of quitting. Family support, more training, and weekly sessions with a psychologist came to the rescue. She learned to manage her nervousness. “I read history books or watch videos now,” she says. It helps distil her thoughts, boiling them down to just one idea: the barbell.

Golden aims

It seems to be working. Over the last five years, Mirabai has won multiple accolades. In 2017, she won a gold medal at the World Weightlifting Championship, the first Indian woman to do so after Karnam Malleswari in 1994, proving herself to a world that had written her off.

She chased it with other golds — at the 2018 Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast and the 2019 EGAT cup in Thailand. She bettered her own record at this year’s World Weightlifting Championship, finishing fourth with a combined lift of 201 kg, and ended 2019 with a bang: a gold at the Qatar International Cup.

“Everything is going to plan,” says coach Sharma, who believes the 25-year-old has a good shot at an Olympic medal. Currently, she holds the eighth spot in the Olympic qualifiers ranking list. Sharma is positive but cautious. “We are working hard, let’s see what happens,” he says.

Mirabai wears her dream in an unusual place, her ears. Her small gold earrings, shaped into five interconnected rings, are a gift from her mother, reminding her of her Olympic dream.

It drives her to do what she does: daily training, boiled food, a regimented sleep schedule that leaves little time for fun or entertainment, a constant battle against exhaustion and injury. “If I want something, I have to get it. Besides, everyone has placed so much hope in me. I can’t let them down,” she says.

Harder to deal with, however, are the bouts of homesickness: the longing for textured, green plains; the warmth of a mother’s hug; the delicate flavour of eromba, a mildly-spiced stew of fish and vegetables. “Since I have started competing, I barely go home. I miss it so much,” she says wistfully. There is no room for nostalgia, however, only razor-sharp focus and hard work. And Mirabai knows this. “I have to get that medal at the Olympics. And once I do, I will go home.”

38,2020/02/01,How people have turned to the Constitution to articulate their vision of India,"Last week, Oxford University Press announced that samvidhaan, meaning ‘constitution’, was the Oxford Hindi Word of 2019 — a distinction given to a word that has received much attention over the year and that has captured the mood and ethos. Over the last few weeks, the Indian Constitution has blossomed into a true “people’s document” and a rallying symbol for protesters who invoke its values.

Dalit activist Chandrashekhar Azad had a copy of the Constitution in his hand as he recently walked out of Tihar Jail, where he was incarcerated for over a month for leading a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at the Jama Masjid in Delhi. “The police accused me of delivering a provocative speech at the protest. But all I did that day was read out the Preamble to the Constitution,” he said.

The day after he was released, he returned to the steps of the Jama Masjid and again read the Preamble aloud, as a crowd several thousands strong waved the tricolour. “We are from the depressed communities and the Constitution is all we have. We will fight to save it at any cost,” he said.

Loud and clear

Reading the Preamble aloud as a pledge has become a distinct ritual at several anti-CAA protests across the country, be it at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi or the Gateway of India in Mumbai or at universities and mosques and Eidgah Maidans everywhere. The Constitution has become both a mode and a symbol of protest. As Azad said, “It is a telling comment that reading the Constitution has become an act of protest today, even as the republic completes seven decades.”

In an interesting turnaround and reclamation, it is the protests today that have embraced the nationalist symbols of the tricolour, the national anthem and the Constitution in what is clearly a response to the hyper-nationalistic pitch of the ruling government with its proclivity to brand anyone opposing it as ‘anti-national’.

And in this moment lies also an attempt to rediscover the inclusive nationalism of the freedom movement. “The Preamble is the most succinct articulation of that vision, what we as a country resolved to stand for as we became independent. It is simple, accessible yet very profound,” says Vinita Singh, one of the founders of the We, The People Abhiyan, which runs a two-hour Preamble workshop (over 1,000 held so far) and a short course on citizenship and the Constitution. The Abhiyan has also created videos for social media.

“The Preamble was there in all our textbooks, but it was never discussed in class. Today I have seen it come to life and articulate what I felt so well, overwhelming me with pride for the vision it embodies and with a resolve to fight for it,” says Sumana R., an undergraduate student.

Vision statement

Many thinkers attribute the resurgence of interest in the Constitution to some actions of the government. “The government has brought about far-reaching changes to the structure of the Constitution, which question the vision and character of the country as imagined in the Constitution. So, the people are now engaging with the Constitution, finding that vision attractive,” says Gautam Bhatia, a constitutional law expert and author of the recent book, The Transformative Constitution: A Radical Biography in Nine Acts. A series of changes, including the dilution of Article 370, curbs on freedom of expression through an Internet ban in Kashmir, and the use of force against dissenters have triggered this, besides the discriminatory CAA.

This is not the first time that the ruling party has been accused of motives to reorient the Constitution according to its vision of the nation.

Similar fears were expressed when the NDA regime led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee set up the National Commission for Review of Working of the Indian Constitution, led by former Chief Justice of India M.N. Venkatachaliah, in 2000, when the Republic completed half a century. The Committee, however, steered clear of controversies.

In 2017, Anantkumar Hegde, MP from Karnataka and a Union Minister then, said they had indeed come to power to change the Constitution. He later had to apologise for the remark in Lok Sabha after it caused a furore.

Alternative view

The suspicions concerning the BJP's motives stem from the well-known stance of its ideological mentor, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), its vision of a Hindu Rashtra and its early criticism of the Constitution.

In an attempt to allay these fears, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat recently said: “We do not want any power centre other than the Constitution because we believe in it.”

Ironically, it was this same government that, in 2015, declared November 26 — the day the Constituent Assembly adopted the Constitution — to be Constitution Day. It has been observing the day nationally ever since.

There’s another reason the Constitution has become so integral to the protests. “As against the Hindutva right, the liberal political parties have not been able to articulate what they stand for. It is in this vacuum that young people have taken to the Preamble, as it succinctly articulates a vision that they now find attractive,” says Aakash Singh Rathore, author of the upcoming book Ambedkar’s Preamble: The Secret History of the Constitution of India.

Dissenting voices

“While social media opened up conversations, the troll armies created a sense of free speech being under attack. This was accentuated by how the government dealt with dissent. It has pushed many to articulate their voice in the idiom of constitutional rights,” says Singh.

Justice Nagamohan Das, former Karnataka High Court judge, has launched a campaign called ‘Samvidhana Odu’ (Read the Constitution), interacting with students across Karnataka for over a year now.

He says, “This is a moment of disillusionment. People have lost faith in all political parties. They had already lost faith in the legislature and executive. I feel sad to say this, but of late, they have lost faith in the judiciary as well. They have realised it is only the Constitution that can save the country today. Through this movement, I think they are telling politicians that whoever comes to power must govern as per the Constitution.”

What it also shows is that the movement has gone beyond the question of legality, says Bhatia. “The Preamble is not a legally binding document, but a vision statement we committed ourselves to when the country became a republic. Even if the Supreme Court tomorrow upholds these moves as legally valid, the people are arguing that they are not in line with the vision of the Preamble. This nuance is important.”

For Singh, it’s an invaluable moment. “I hope people, especially the youth, from now on evaluate every legislation and every government through the lens of the Preamble,” she says.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/u8oe8j/article30702083.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02SM1JAMAMASJID2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-people-have-turned-to-the-constitution-to-articulate-their-vision-of-india/article30702085.ece
39,2020/02/01,Goren Bridge by Bob Jones,"South’s slightly aggressive jump rebid caused North to use Key Card Blackwood — standard among today’s tournament players. The fiveclub response showed zero or three key cards, among the four aces and the king of the agreed trump suit. On some auctions, as here, the trump suit is implied rather than specifically agreed. North, presuming three key cards due to South’s jump rebid, continued with five diamonds, asking for the queen of trumps. The sixspade bid promised that queen and denied any side king.

An opening diamond lead would have given declarer no chance. West, however, cannot be faulted for his choice of a club. Most would lead the same thing. South won the opening lead in hand with the queen and drew trumps in two rounds. He now had to decide whether to play on diamonds or hearts. The decision is clear cut, but many players would err by taking the diamond finesse. A successful diamond finesse will lead to one heart discard, but South will still have to guess whether West has the ace of hearts or the queen of hearts.

A successful finesse for the queen of hearts, however, will eventually allow a discard of a diamond from the South hand. The diamond finesse will not be needed. Only having to take one finesse is much better than needing two finesses. Running the 10 of hearts after drawing trumps is the correct play, and it would “bring home the bacon” on today’s deal.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/xgndgu/article30700805.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SM02BRIDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/society/which-finesse/article30700806.ece
40,2020/02/01,"Indian economy experienced abrupt slowdown in 2019, but it’s not in a recession: IMF MD","The Indian economy experienced some abrupt slowdown in 2019 due to turbulence in non-banking financial institutions and major reform measures such as GST and demonetisation, but it is not in a recession, International Monetary Fund(IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.

“The Indian economy indeed has experienced an abrupt slowdown in 2019. We had to revise our growth projections, downwards to 4% for last year. We are expecting 5.8%(growth rate) in 2020 and then an upward trajectory to 6.5% in 2021,” Georgieva told a group of journalists in Washington on Friday.

“It appears that the main reason for this slowdown was the non-banking financial institutions experiencing a turbulence,” she said on the eve of Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presenting the annual budget in Parliament on Saturday.

She said India had undertaken some important reforms that over the longer term would be beneficial for the country, but they do have some short-term impact.

“For example, coming with the unified tax system, and the demonetisation took place. These are steps that over time are beneficial, but of course they might be somewhat disruptive over short term,” Georgieva said in response to a question.

The IMF MD said that there is not a lot of fiscal space in India. But we also recognise that the policies of the government on that side, on the fiscal side have been prudent. We will see how the reading of the budget, the submission of the budget goes, tomorrow, she said. In the medium-term, she said, the IMF remains optimistic about India. This is why we see that upswing potential for the growth in the country, she said.

Georgieva said that the current economic slowdown cannot be described as a recession.

She noted that the consumption in India also slowed down and that contributed to the overall slowdown in the economy. The IMF would be keen to see what India does to get relatively sound macroeconomic fundamentals to pay off in terms of better growth trajectory, she said ahead of the budget.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nlw5ql/article30644875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24THKRISTALINAGEORGIEVA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-economy-experienced-abrupt-slowdown-in-2019-but-its-not-in-a-recession-imf-md/article30709350.ece

Start-ups deserved special attention and the proposal to defer tax payment has indeed came as a positive signal to entrepreneurs to stay invested in the country.

As per the Finance Bill, it applies to employees of the companies which qualify as eligible start-ups under Section 80-IAC, and to be eligible under Section 80-IAC, start-ups have to get a certificate from an inter-ministerial board.

42,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Finance Minister proposes a set of reforms to deepen bond market,"As part of reforms for the financial markets, especially the bond market, the government has proposed increasing the investment limit for foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) in corporate bonds, opening certain government securities for non-resident investors and launching a new debt exchange traded fund (ETF) comprising primarily of government securities.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed that the limit for FPIs’ purchases of corporate bonds, currently capped at 9% of outstanding stock, would be increased to 15% of the outstanding stock.

‘Global bond indices’

“It may be argued that overall interest in Indian bonds is anyway muted for now and hence these expansions may amount to little in the near term,” Suyash Choudhary, head – Fixed Income, IDFC AMC, wrote in a post-Budget note.

“The other view to take could be that incremental ease of operation does bring in more flows (all other things being equal) and that especially the measure on government bonds could be in the direction of ultimate inclusion in global bond indices,” added Mr. Choudhary.

The Minister also proposed to float a new debt ETF consisting primarily of government securities. “This will give retail investors access to government securities as much as giving an attractive investment for pension funds and long-term investors,” she said.

The Budget also highlighted the success of the recent debt-based ETF floated by the government. The Bharat Bond ETF, introduced in December, raised more than ₹12,000 crore, against its issue size of ₹7,000 crore. Bharat Bond ETF invests in AAA rated bonds issued by public sector companies.

The Minister also proposed opening specified categories of government debt securities for non-resident investors.

44,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Green signal for more private trains,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed a budgetary allocation of ₹70,000 crore for the Indian Railways, with overall capital expenditure of ₹1.61 lakh crore for the next financial year in the Union Budget.

While the capital expenditure for 2020-21 saw an increase of a mere 3% from ₹1.56 lakh crore (revised estimates) for 2019-20, the Budget promises increased investment for passenger amenities and safety-related works, including track renewals, level crossings and road over/under bridges.

The ₹1.61 lakh crore outlay comprises ₹70,000 crore from budgetary support, ₹250 crore from the Nirbhaya Fund, ₹7,500 crore from Internal Resources and ₹83,292 crore from Extra Budgetary Resources.

An amount of ₹12,000 crore has been allocated for construction of new lines, ₹10,599 crore for track renewal, ₹2,250 crore for gauge conversion, ₹700 crore for doubling, ₹5,786.97 crore for rolling stock and ₹1,650 crore for signalling and telecom. For passenger amenities, the allocation is ₹2,725.63 crore.

The government expects its revenue receipts to increase by ₹23,880 crore to ₹2.25 lakh crore. In the next fiscal, the Indian Railways expects earnings from passengers to grow to ₹61,000 crore from ₹56,000 crore in 2019-20, and from goods to grow by more than ₹12,000 crore to ₹1,47,000 crore.

“The total receipts of the railways comprising earnings from passenger, goods...sundry other heads and railway recruitment boards are targeted to increase by 9.5% in the Budget Estimates of 2020-21 over the Revised Estimates (RE) of 2019-20,” the Budget document stated.

The operating ratio, which was envisaged to be 95% in BE 2019-20 and revised to 97.46% in RE 2019-2020, is expected to be 96.2% in 2020-21. An operating ratio of 96.2% means that the Railways is spending 96.2 paise to earn 100 paise.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her Budget Speech proposed setting up a large solar power capacity alongside the rail tracks, on the land owned by the railways, besides re-development of four stations, operation of 150 passenger trains via public-private partnership mode and introduction of more Tejas type trains to iconic tourist destinations.

Ms. Sitharaman also proposed a 148-km Bengaluru suburban transport project at a cost of ₹18,600 crore, which would have fares on the metro model.

The Railway Board has said that the third ‘corporate’ train to be run by IRCTC will run between Indore and Varanasi, and is likely to begin operations mid-February. The overnight train, which will have the same rakes as those of the Humsafar Express, will run three days a week — two days via Lucknow and one day via Allahabad.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the LIC would be listed as part of the government disinvestment initiative. The government proposed to sell a part of its holding in LIC through IPO, she said while delivering the Budget 2020- 21 speech.

“We strongly oppose the government’s plan to sell a part of its shares in LIC and the move is against the national interest,” a spokesman of an employees’ union told reporters here. Established in 1956, LIC is fully-owned by the central government and has the highest market share in the life insurance segment in India.

46,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: Major cut in financial allocation for Nepal,"The Union Budget has made a major reduction in the annual allocation for financial assistance to Nepal. Apart from Nepal, aid to African countries has also been reduced.

The 2019-20 Budget had allocated ₹1,200 crore to projects in Nepal but Saturday’s numbers show that India has allocated only ₹800 crore to the projects under way in Nepal for 2020-21. The development is likely to cast a shadow on the work that India partners in the crucial Himalayan neighbour which has in recent months showed warmth towards China.

Substantial cut

The Budget also showed substantial reduction for “other developing countries” that will now receive ₹120 crore compared to last year’s allocation of ₹150 crore.

Similar reduction was also noticed in the African department where ₹350 crore has been allocated for next year in comparison to last year’s ₹450 crore. Allocation for Latin American countries has increased and currently ₹20 crore will be spent on diplomacy with the region which is a favoured area of new Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla.

The figure for Sri Lanka has also been trimmed from previous year’s ₹205 crore to ₹200 crore.

Disaster relief, a chosen area of the Modi government, has also received a jolt with only ₹20 crore being allocated compared to last year’s ₹30 crore.

“In order to incentivise listing of bonds at IFSC exchange, I propose to further reduce the withholding rate from 5% to 4% on interest payment on the bonds listed on its exchange,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman Sitharaman said in her Budget speech.

India International Exchange (India INX) MD and CEO V. Balasubramaniam said the Budget announcement will be “an immense boost to all issuers and immensely help them in attracting more international investors.” Withholding tax is levied by countries on interest or dividends paid to a person who is resident outside that country. India INX has already listed medium-term note (debt) programme worth $47 billion (about ₹3.33 lakh crore) with drawdown of $18.5 billion till date.

48,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Gender budget sees a drop,"The gender budget of the government as a share of the Budget has seen a decline of 0.01% this fiscal - dropping from 4.72% last year to 4.71% - in financial year 2020-2021. The expenditure proposed under it is ₹1,43, 461.72 crore.

As a share of the GDP, it has also reduced from 0.69% of revised estimates for 2019-2020 to 0.63% of proposed estimates for 2020-2021, according to the All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA). However, in absolute terms there has been an increase of 8.9% as compared to last year’s gender budget of ₹1,31,700 crore.

The last Budget announcement proposed setting up of a committee to look at Budget through the gender lens which would suggest actions but its status and outcome are not yet known. The nodal Ministry, i.e. the Ministry for Women and Child Development, has seen an increase of 14% in allocation, which has gone up to ₹30,007 crore in financial year 2020-2021 from ₹26,184 crore in the current fiscal.

The schemes that have seen an increase include the scheme for adolescent out-of-school girls, which has gone up from ₹150 crore to ₹250 crore; working women hostel where the allocation has tripled from ₹45 crore to ₹150 crore.

There is also a 92% increase in the allocation for One Stop Centre which received ₹385 crore.

The government has also allocated ₹500 crore under the Nirbhaya Fund for programmes on safety of women.

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana has seen a paltry increase from ₹2,300 crore to ₹2,500 crore despite demands for higher allocation to improve coverage under the scheme.

Interestingly, though the Finance Minister’s speech was divided into three themes viz. aspiration, economic development and caring society, women’s issues were primarily confined to the last category.

While the FM said ₹28,600 crore was set aside for programmes specific to women, there was no mention of programmes to boost women’s employment. The female labour force participation (FLPR) has seen a sharp decline at 26% in 2018 from 36.7% in 2005.

The FM also announced that a task force will be set up to look at the age at which a girl enters motherhood to reduce maternal mortality rate and improve nutrition levels.

“This is a positive step.

The intention is to reduce the rates as much as to simplify the structure. We wanted to be sure that money is in the hands of the people, by not paying a tax which they don't need to pay. Particularly for the middle class and the lower middle class, we have brought the income tax down. Ideally, a new scheme without any exemptions would have been the best, but still because there are some exemptions which are absolutely indispensable, we have kept it at a minimum.

How will you encourage savings under the new regime?

When there's more money in your hand, then you will be in a better position to decide where you want to save, instead of me directing you. So I am allowing you to have more money in your hand, and depend on your judgement where you want to make a saving.

What will the tax charter entail?

If I am right, there are only three countries in the world which have enshrined the rights of a tax payer in their laws — Canada, U.S. and Australia. It’s an article of faith for us to respect wealth creators. It’s an article of faith for us to make sure that the honest taxpayer is not suspect. And, therefore, we have made it a point to bring it into the Act itself as a charter, the details of which will come out.

Many say that your disinvestment target of ₹2.1 lakh crore is a very stiff target. How will the department achieve this, because we have seen a massive shortfall in this year.

(DIPAM secretary Tuhin Pandey): In November, government took decisions for some big ticket disinvestments — one is BPCL, another is CONCOR, another is Shipping Corporation of India... Some of them will conclude this year, but some of the large ones are going to spill over to the next year and the reciepts are going to come next year. The transactions are all lined up. As you know, the Air India Expressions of Interest are already out and very soon, the BPCL Expressions of Interest are also ready to be out as well. So we are quite hopeful that we will be meeting the disinvestment target next year.

Will it be possible to go from a fiscal deficit of 3.8% to directly achieve the 3.5% target?

Look at the way revenue generation is improving now. In the last three months itself, the GST collection has crossed ₹1 lakh crore, and there will be incentives because of the corporate tax rate cut. So I guess revenue generation improvement will give me that little comfort so that I can come down from 3.8% to 3.5% in the next fiscal, with the disinvestment also going to be effective.

There has been no allocation for recapitalisation for banks this year. Most of the mergers which were announced last year will take place now. So what is your recapitalisation plan?

I have not said I won't give any money for recapitalisation. You’re saying I have not given any numbers for recapitalisation, but I've also not said, ‘No, I will not give’. Which means, as and when there is a need, we'll certainly consider.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/hmgrkj/article30715761.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THNIRMALA-7,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/we-wanted-to-make-sure-money-is-in-peoples-hands-nirmala-sitharaman/article30715762.ece
50,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | E-com platforms must deduct 1% TDS on transactions,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed a new tax levy on e-commerce transactions as part of measures to widen the tax base.

“In order to widen and deepen the tax net, it is proposed to provide that e-commerce operator shall deduct TDS on all payments or credits to e-commerce participants at the rate of 1% in PAN/Aadhaar cases and 5% in non-PAN/Aadhaar cases,” the Minister said in her Budget speech. However, with a view to providing relief to small businessmen, individuals and HUF who receive less than ₹5 lakh and furnish PAN/Aadhaar would be exempt from the TDS norm.

According to the Memorandum that was part of the Budget documents placed before Parliament, an e-commerce operator is defined as any person who owns, operates or manages digital or electronic facility or platform for electronic commerce and is a person responsible for paying to e-commerce participant. An e-commerce participant is defined as a person resident in India selling goods or providing services or both, including digital products, through digital or electronic facility or platform for e-commerce.

India’s e-commerce market is expected to grow to $200 billion by 2026 from $38.5 billion as of 2017, according to a November 2019 presentation by the India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF) on its website. A large part of the industry’s growth had been triggered by increasing Internet and smartphone penetration, IBEF said.

51,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Cheer for science as key departments get a raise,"There is cheer for science in the Budget, with key scientific departments receiving an across-the-board increase of 10% or more.

The Department of Biotechnology (DBT) posted the largest increase, with an outlay of ₹2,786 crore, a 17% increase from the ₹2,381 crore it spent last year.

The Department of Science and Technology got a 14% hike, at ₹6,301 crore, over its expenditure last year, the Earth Sciences Ministry posted a 14% hike at ₹2,070 crore and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research got a 10% hike at ₹5,385 crore.

Overall, the science Ministries received ₹16,542 crore, 13% more than what was spent last year.

The civilian science Ministries work on budgets that are much lower than, say, the Department of Atomic Energy that got ₹18,228 crore and the Department of Space that got ₹13,479 crore.

In previous years, science departments generally posted percentage hikes that were in the single digits, and this is the first time in at least three years that all departments have posted double digit percentage hikes.

“Generally, the hikes revolve round 7%, but this time there’s been a significant signal of the government’s encouragement to scientific endeavours,” said Renu Swarup, Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, “The genomics initiatives as well as encouragement to set up knowledge transfer clusters are among the key sectors that have got a boost.”

The DBT has embarked on projects to map the genes of Indians as well the genetic structure of every plant variety. Another official said the government’s expenditure on science had nearly doubled since 2014.

‘Fluctuations present’

“There are fluctuations within the year...the Finance Minister has stressed on quantum technologies,” said Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, Department of Science and Technology.

“This will be largely led by the Department of Science and Technology, though those allocations are not reflected in this Budget.”",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/yydes/article30715687.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03TH-PG9-SCIENCE2,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-cheer-for-science-as-key-departments-get-a-raise/article30715689.ece
52,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Taking the economic challenges head-on,"The Finance Minister was presented with a tricky set of trade-offs ahead of Budget 2020. On one hand, there are immediate challenges of the slowdown in growth and investments, along with frequent global event risks — including the recent outbreak of the coronavirus. On the other, there are longer-term challenges of climate change, demographic shifts and technological disruptions.

In the limited fiscal room that the government had, the Finance Minister has announced several measures and initiatives to address these challenges and built them around the themes of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society.

Many of these have an element of continuity from the initiatives taken in the past. For example, the option of migrating to a lower tax structure by forgoing exemptions, that was given to the corporates in September, has now been given to cooperatives and to individual taxpayers up to an income of ₹15 lakh. The latter would boost consumption at the bottom of the pyramid, which is quite crucial in the current economic context. The lower corporate tax rate of 15% for new manufacturing investment companies has been extended to power generation companies as well.

The partial credit guarantee scheme for NBFCs is proposed to be expanded. All these are reinforcements of the proactive efforts that the government has been making to reinvigorate India’s growth story.

The FM has rightly acknowledged the issues that have been hampering the competitiveness of Indian manufacturers in certain areas — including the rising trend in imports from FTA partners. The review of rules of origins requirements under the FTAs, strengthening of the provisions related to safeguard duty and the provisions against dumping are welcome steps to ensure a level playing field for Indian companies.

The National Infrastructure Pipeline envisaging an investment of ₹103 trillion that was announced a few weeks back is going to play the most important role in realising India’s growth potential over the medium-term and in achieving the ambitious goal of a $5-trillion economy.

The Budget has made sizeable provisions to get this pipeline going. Timely implementation of these projects will also require concerted and coordinated actions to expedite clearances, to iron out any ground-level issues and to address sectoral policy concerns that may come up.

Given the slowdown in tax collections and the need to maintain spending in a slowing economy, sticking to the original fiscal deficit targets was always going to be difficult. Still, the FM has managed to limit the deviation from the original deficit trajectory to 0.5% of GDP. The next year’s ambitious disinvestment target — which includes selling of stake in LIC and some strategic divestments — will be helpful in this regard.

Building skills

While focusing on these near-term challenges, the FM has not lost the sight of the long-term, structural issues. The demographic dividend that India has been experiencing currently can be fully leveraged only if we are able to invest adequately in skill-building.

The sizeable provision of almost ₹1 lakh crore for the education sector, along with the steps to get more private sector play and foreign investment in higher education, are exciting. The FM talked of different initiatives to link the skilling programmes to the needs of the employers (including special bridge courses to prepare teachers and nurses for the demand in other countries), which is the right way to go.

On another long-term issue of environment and climate change, India has been playing a proactive role with its early initiatives in the aspects of renewable energy and electric mobility. This Budget — apart from taking some additional steps in these areas — has focused on two additional and increasingly critical aspects i.e. addressing the water stress in one hundred districts and incentivising States for improving the air-quality of cities. These announcements reflect that the government is alive to the emerging concerns.

The Economic Survey this year talked of creating a conducive environment for wealth creation by building trust. One sees a reflection of the same in this Budget — the most prominent being the enshrinement of the “taxpayer charter” in the statutes. Faceless appeals and the introduction of the settlement scheme for direct tax disputes are welcome too.

This overall approach of the government, along with the multitude of steps to nurture the growth-generating impulses in the short-term and to build the competitive core of the economy for the long-term, should help the economy scale back to its earlier growth trajectory — sooner rather than later.

53,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | No more double taxation on dividends,"The government fulfilled a long-standing demand of the capital markets when it proposed scrapping the dividend distribution tax (DDT) that is levied on companies. Dividend will now be taxed only in the hands of the investors.

This would come as a relief for companies and capital market participants who have been lobbying hard for the removal of DDT at the company level, which, they felt led to double taxation as such payouts are also taxed at the investor level.

Currently, companies are required to pay 15% tax plus applicable surcharge and cess on the dividends. Further, investors that receive more than ₹10 lakh as dividend in a financial year have to pay 10% tax on such income.

“It has been argued that the system of levying DDT results in increase in tax burden for investors and especially those who are liable to pay tax less than the rate of DDT if the dividend income is included in their income,” said Ms Sitharaman, while presenting her budget.

“In order to increase the attractiveness of the Indian equity market and to provide relief to a large class of investors, I propose to remove the DDT and adopt the classical system of dividend taxation under which the companies would not be required to pay DDT. The dividend shall be taxed only in the hands of the recipients at their applicable rate,” she added while highlighting the fact that the removal of DDT would lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of Rs.25,000 crore.

According to experts, the effective DDT for companies was nearly 17%, which went up to more than 20% in 2014 while that for individuals it was a little less than 15%.

More importantly, the government has also done away with the additional 10% tax on investors and the dividend will now be only taxed at the applicable tax rate based on the income slab of the individual. “Small tax payers would definitely benefit as their effective rate of tax is much lower and would result in substantial saving,” said Ashok Shah, Partner, N A Shah Associates.

“Impact on taxation of large retail investors may be negative, as dividend is expected to be taxable at the maximum slab rate in their hands. The effective tax rate for individuals falling in highest tax slabs is 42.74% i.e. there will be an additional burden of 28.492%,” explained Mr. Shah.

Meanwhile, the government has also proposed allowing deduction for the dividend received by holding company from its subsidiary.

According to Mr Shah, foreign investors can now claim benefit under the double tax treaty where the tax rates ranges from 5% to 15%, which will result in direct saving of 20.56% for such overseas entities.

“... non-availability of credit of DDT to most of the foreign investors in their home country results in reduction of rate of return on equity capital for them... This is another bold move which will further make India an attractive destination for investment,” said the finance minister. The issue of “double taxation” was part of the pre-budget memorandum that Association of National Exchanges Members of India had presented to the government. In its memorandum, the umbrella body of brokers had said that the current form of DDT was “adversarial” in nature leading to double or triple taxation of corporate earnings.

Incidentally, the broker lobby had also sought restoring long term capital gains (LTCG) tax benefits on equities, which was withdrawn as part of the Finance Bill 2018. The government, however, chose not to touch upon the LTCG issue in the budget.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/miwddg/article30715598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Taxes,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-no-more-double-taxation-on-dividends/article30715599.ece
54,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Pat for ‘Beti Padhao’ scheme comes in for flak,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during Budget presentation on Saturday lauded the ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ scheme, which led to an uproar in Parliament. Though the Minister cited an increase in gross enrolment ratio of girls as being higher than that of boys to back her claim, activists point out that the enrolment of girls per se has seen a decline over the years.

“I am pleased to inform the House that ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ has yielded tremendous results. Gross enrolment ratio of girls across all levels of education is now higher than boys. At elementary level, it is 94.32% as against 89.28% for boys. At Secondary level, it is 81.32% as compared to 78%, At higher secondary level girls have achieved a level of 59.70% as compared to 57.54% for boys,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her speech.

However, the U-DISE data of 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 show that the gross enrolment ratio (GER) of girls at elementary and higher secondary levels has seen a decline, while at secondary level it rose only by 0.1%.

For classes 1-8 the GER for girls in 2015-2016 was 95.90%, which dropped to 95.19%; for classes 9 and 10 there was a marginal increase from 80.10% to 80.29%. In classes 11-12 the GER for girls dropped from 56.07% to 55.91% in the same comparative period, notes Priti Mahara, Director, Policy Research and Advocacy, CRY.

Moreover, the entire budget for children as a proportion of the total budget has hit the lowest level in five years, falling to 3.16% of the total budget this fiscal, according to an analysis by CRY.

Last year, the children’s budget was 3.38% of the total budget. While there have been mounting concerns about safety of children and child sex abuse, especially after the Supreme Court took up the Muzaffarpur shelter abuse case, the child protection scheme of the Women and Child Development Ministry remains nearly stagnant with a paltry 1.1% increase — rising from ₹1,350 crore last fiscal to ₹1,500 crore.

The anganwadi programme under which the government provides supplementary nutrition to children between six months to six years has received an increase in allocation of 15%, going up from ₹17,704 crore to ₹20,532 crore; the POSHAN Abhiyaan or the Nutrition Mission has seen an increase of 8.7% from ₹3,400 crore to ₹3,699 crore.

School education has seen an allocation of ₹59,368 crore, an increase of 5% or ₹3,295.55 crore across three prominent schemes — Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan, Kendriya Vidyalaya Samiti and Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti.

For tribal children, the money for post-matric scholarship for ST students has been withdrawn. “The entire Budget registered an increase of 9%, but those for children increased by a measly 3.16%.”

“While there is an increase of 9.2% in the overall Union Budget from last year’s allocation, the corresponding increase in budget for children is only 4.8%, last year it was far better,” Ms. Mahara told The Hindu.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/e1t3fj/article30715569.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TH-PG9-BETIBACHAO,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-pat-for-beti-padhao-scheme-comes-in-for-flak/article30715570.ece
55,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Steep hike in Customs Duty to keep China toys out of reach,"Customs Duty on a range of articles like household goods, electrical appliances, auto parts, footwear, furniture and some mobiles phone parts has been raised in the Union Budget.

This has been done keeping in view the interests of the MSME segment, to facilitate ease of doing business, secure trade borders and to keep uncontrolled dumping under check.

S. Jaikumar, country head, Swamy Associates said, “Raising Customs Duty is aimed at helping MSMEs in the country as dumping from China has been hurting them. This will boost domestic industry, local employment and eventually impact GDP.” The Customs Duty mop-up for FY 2020-21 is seen at ₹1.38 lakh crore.

Duty on toys, tricycles, scooters, scale models and dolls has seen a steep increase from 20% to 60%.

The Customs Duty on the import of food processing products has been raised to 100%, while the levy on auto and auto parts has been raised by up to 10%.

Duty on tableware and kitchenware of porcelain or china, ceramics, clay, iron, steel, copper and aluminium, glassware, padlocks, brooms, hand-sieves, combs and vacuum flasks has been increased from 10% to 20%.

Duty on electrical appliances such as fans, food grinders/ mixers, water heaters, hair/ hand drying apparatus, ovens, cookers, toasters, coffee/ tea makers, insect repellents, heaters and irons have also gone up from 10% to 20%.

Other goods that will see an increase in Customs Duty are: footwear (from 25% to 35%); parts of footwear (from 15% to 20%); furniture such as seats, bedding and mattresses, and lamps and lights (from 20% to 25%); and stationery items (from 10% to 20%). The printed circuit board assembly (PCBA) of mobile phones will attract a Customs Duty of 20% from the earlier 10%. Vibrators/ringers of mobile phones, display panel and touch assembly will attract 10% duty.

Duty cut on newsprint

The Finance Minister has proposed to cut the basic Customs Duty on imports of newsprint and lightweight coated paper from 10% to 5%. She said the reduction has been done with the objective of easing “the burden on the print media at a time when it is going through a difficult phase”.

The Budget also proposes reduction in Customs Duty on raw materials and inputs imported by domestic manufacturers. The Duty of 10% on fuel, chemicals and plastics would be fully removed.

The FM said Customs Duty exemption had been reviewed to weed out entries that are redundant, outdated or have outlived their utility.

As many as 80 exemptions are being withdrawn by making suitable amendment/ rescission of relevant notifications. Imports under Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) are on the rise. Undue claims of FTA benefits have posed threat to the domestic industry. Such imports require stringent checks.

In this context, suitable provisions are being incorporated in the Customs Act, as per the Budget proposal.

The FM said in the coming months, the government would review Rules of Origin requirements, particularly for certain sensitive items, to “ensure that FTAs are aligned to the conscious direction of our policy.”",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/esxfcl/article30715463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shockercol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/steep-hike-in-customs-duty-to-keep-china-toys-out-of-reach/article30715464.ece
56,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Spending on space goes up by 8%,"The Department of Space (DoS) gets a proposed 8% increase in the outlay for fiscal 2020-21, a year when it plans to send out expensive missions such as a third trip to the moon and a test flight ahead of an actual astronaut mission.

The Budget allocation has increased to about ₹13,479 crore, from about ₹12,473 crore that was earmarked in the Budget for 2019-20.

The department’s nodal Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) overshot that budget and spent about ₹666 crore more than its share for the year. Revised estimates for 2019-20 put the total Space spending at about ₹13,139 crore.

At a news conference on January 1, ISRO Chairman and DoS Secretary K. Sivan had said the department had sought about ₹14,000 crore for the coming fiscal. Chandrayaan-3, the country’s second attempt to land near the south pole of the moon and planned for the turn of 2020, would cost about ₹600 crore, he had said.

Bulky spend

During the ongoing fiscal year 2019-20, space technology got the bulk of allocation at ₹8,407 crore; this spending is expected to touch ₹8,991 crore as per the revised estimates released on Saturday.

The new Budget sets aside ₹9,761 crore, or 72%, of the outlay towards this head. The head ‘space technologies’ covers development of spacecraft, launchers, payloads on satellites and the ground system that receives, interprets and provides data for various uses, according to an ISRO official.

Space entrepreneur and policy professional Narayan Prasad said the budget for the Space programme had not seen a massive increase as “the government has already provided for 30 PSLV and 10 GSLV missions — which should keep ISRO busy for some time.”

Also, Gaganyaan, the ₹ 0,000-crore national mission to send Indian astronauts to space for the first time from the country, and a few major missions are in execution mode, he said.

Last April, the government approved phase 4 funding of ₹2,720 crore for 10 GSLVs through 2024.

57,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: MSMEs turnover limit for audit increased,"In a major relief to small retailers, traders and shopkeepers forming the Medium, Small and Micro Enterprise (MSME) sector, the Budget has proposed to raise by five times the turnover threshold for audit from the existing ₹1 crore to ₹5 crore.

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that to boost the less cash economy, the increased limit would apply only to those businesses which carried out less than 5% of their transactions in cash.

Currently, businesses having a turnover of more than ₹1 crore are required to get their books of accounts audited by an accountant.

Cheap imports

To ensure that the labour-intensive sectors, critical for employment generation, are not impacted by low-quality imports, the Budget has proposed to increase customs duty on items like footwear and furniture. The rate of duty for footwear is being raised from 25% to 35%, and for “parts of footwear” from 15% to 20%. The rate for specified furniture goods is being raised from 20% to 25%.

NBFCs will be allowed to extend invoice financing to MSMEs through TReDS and measures have been announced for debt recovery.

The government has also announced a ₹1,000 crore scheme to help mid-sized companies in export development, R&D and technology upgrade.

“The scheme will help the component sector remain relevant and competitive. Being significantly dominated by MSMEs, measures to extend invoice financing to MSMEs and creating access to working capital through a new scheme are a welcome step...,” said Deepak Jain, president Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA).

Meghna Suryakumar, Founder & CEO, Crediwatch, said, “The focus on enabling growth for MSMEs is encouraging.” Since NBFCs could extend invoice financing to the MSMEs through TReDS, it should enhance opportunity to fuel the economy, she said.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/d0p7wk/article30715385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MSME,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-msmes-turnover-limit-for-audit-increased/article30715386.ece
58,2020/02/01,Bottom-up approach to building economy,"The three prominent themes of the Budget this year of Aspirational India, Economic Development and Caring Society give a direction in the way the government envisages economic growth in the country.

The Government of India has taken a bottom-up approach towards building the economy with a strong focus on reviving rural income through various agricultural reforms.

The 16 action points, all aligned to increase farm income, will go a long way in increasing employment opportunities in that segment as well as help in creating avenues of giving more money in the hands of people. This could potentially help boost rural consumption by increasing their purchasing power. There have been some measures announced to enhance employment generation by way of boosting electronic manufacturing, enhanced policies for entrepreneurial ventures and infra-focussed skill development initiatives which can have long-term benefits for the nation.

An increase in bond market investment limit in both government securities and corporate bonds is a welcome move to attract more foreign money into Indian bonds.

This will not only help infrastructure-related bonds get more participation from global investors but also ensure availability of long-term funds to such projects as part of the take-out financing in nature. The effort to deepen the bond market may also help the government get another source of funds to help its borrowing.

This in essence will leave more money in the hands of banks to focus on lending and also bring in the necessary stability in the interest rate.

With respect to maintaining fiscal balance, the Budget has rightly taken the provision of slipping on the fiscal by 50 basis points to boost public spending and revive the economic growth through rural agriculture-related economy, infrastructure development and also health sector-related issues surrounding the economy. It is also a well thought out tax reduction for those who don’t avail any exemption and help them decide between savings and spending.

Middle income earners now can choose to have more money in their hands by availing this new tax regime and spend more or continue to stay with the old tax rate by availing the exemption and increase their long-terms savings pool. Both are good in a way as income tax payers in this segment can choose as it suits each year.

The intent is to simplify the taxation system and as well as encourage better tax compliance through friendlier policies.

The abolition of DDT (dividend distribution tax) is a big benefit for minority shareholders and means more money in their hands for investing or spending.

Dividend Distribution Tax removal also encourages rewarding shareholders more appropriately, leading to long-term value creation for them. It would also improve their return on equity and therefore improved valuation for companies. Of course, in each Budget we all look at what is the missing piece.

One I would assume is the expectation around removal of long-term capital gains towards equity investing and lack of focus in clearing the inventory in the real estate sector, especially in big metro cities, specifically Mumbai and Delhi.

Second, the divestment target of ₹2.1 lakh crore is a big target to achieve in a single year given the fact that this year’s disinvestment target has not been fully met, falling short by ₹50,000 crore against the targeted ₹1.05 lakh crore. Despite this, the overall Budget should be seen as something that addresses the need for growth besides removing pain points in some of the sectors.

Overall, from investors’ point of view, one should look beyond the Budget and repose faith in our economy to create a long-term investment portfolio through the asset allocation model, which remains permanent irrespective of the outcome of Budget.

59,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Health care in focus with ₹69,000 crore outlay","Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced an outlay of about ₹69,000 crore for the health sector in the 2020-2021 Budget with ₹6,400 crore earmarked for the Centre’s flagship health insurance scheme, Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare gets ₹65,011.8 crore up from ₹62,659.12 crore in 2019-20. The Ministry of AYUSH has been allocated ₹2,122.08 crore while there is an allocation of ₹2,100 crore to the Department of Health Research.

Ms. Sitharaman said there are now more than 20,000 empanelled hospitals under the PMJAY.

“We need more in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities for poorer people under this PMJAY scheme. It is proposed to set up Viability Gap funding window for setting up hospitals in the PPP (private-public-partnership) mode. In the first phase, those aspirational districts will be covered, where presently there are no Ayushman empanelled hospitals,” the Minister said.

“This would also provide large scale employment opportunities to youth. Proceeds from taxes on medical devices would be used to support this vital health infrastructure,” she said.

The Finance Minister also announced expansion of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra Scheme to all districts, offering 2,000 medicines and 300 surgicals by 2024. The government, in order to boost domestic industry and to generate resources for health services, has proposed a nominal health cess of 5% on imports of specified medical equipment. Also Mission Indradhanush has been expanded to cover 12 such diseases, including five new vaccines.

The government has proposed setting up of medical colleges in existing district hospitals under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) mode to address the shortage of qualified doctors.

The Finance Minister said the government will encourage large hospitals with sufficient capacity to offer resident doctors diploma and fellow of National Board (DNB/FNB) courses under the National Board of Examination.

Speaking on the budget the Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan said: “Budget estimates for the Department for Health and Family Welfare show an appreciable increase of 3.75%, while there has been a 10% hike in the allocation for the Department for Health Research. This indicates the strong focus of the government on the health sector. The Budget has positioned health as a prime mover in the journey of development and growth of the country.’’

Stating that the focus in Budget 2020 is on medical infrastructure, human resources in the health sector, and holistic health and wellness the MInister said: “As part of strengthening the medical infrastructure, the government will support creation of hospitals in those aspirational districts, particularly in the two and three tier cities, which do not have empaneled hospitals under Ayushman Bharat PMJAY.’’

“In addition, 6500 projects under National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) include projects of healthcare for all. Also, to address the shortage of qualified doctors (specialist and general practitioners), it is proposed to attach a Medical College with existing District Hospitals in PPP mode. Those States that fully allow the facilities of the hospital to the medical college and wish to provide land at a concession would be able to receive viability gap funding from the Centre,’’ he added.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/e67rbi/article30651375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARSHVARDHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-health-care-in-focus-with-69000-crore-outlay/article30715283.ece
60,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Allocation for MGNREGS slashed by ₹9,500 crore","Despite a slowdown in the rural economy and the need to stimulate rural demand, the Centre has slashed budgetary allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme by ₹9,500 crore for the coming year.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced ₹61,500 crore for the scheme in 2020-21, a 13% drop from the 2019-20 revised estimates of ₹71,000 crore.

MGNREGS, which provides 100 days of unskilled work for every rural household, helps generate rural employment and provides a social safety net. Before the Budget, a number of economists had suggested that putting money directly into the hands of rural consumers at the bottom of the pyramid would be needed to create liquidity and spur consumption demand.

‘Will meet demand’

Asked about the cut, Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty said that if additional allocations were required for the scheme, it would be given later in the year.

“MGNREGS is a demand-driven scheme. This year, we went up because there was a demand for this in certain areas and the full money was provided. For the next year, it’s a usual, normal level of funding, which has been provided for MGNREGS. If there is an additional demand from some areas which comes up, we will again meet it accordingly at RE stage,” he said in response to The Hindu’s query during a post-Budget press interaction. “Revised estimates for 2019-20 reflects meeting the demands fully, not rolling them over.”

As of last week, the scheme had already run through its original budgetary allocation for 2019-20, and 15 States were already in the red. The additional money granted in the revised estimates provides some breathing space. However, groups representing rural workers said the lower allocation would have a disastrous impact on rural economy.

“This is a travesty for the rural poor, for whom the MGNREGS is a potential lifeline,” said Rajendran Narayanan, an assistant professor with the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University. “Rural distress has risen to alarming levels. As per the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of 2017-18, rural unemployment has increased by 8% from 2011-12, and overall unemployment is the worst in 45 years. In conjunction with double-digit food inflation levels, this is a serious concern. The situation is much worse for the landless depending on casual manual labour, who constitute more than half the rural population.”

Rakshita Swamy of the People’s Action for Employment Guarantee, an advocacy group for MGNREGS, said pending liabilities have been amounting to nearly one-sixth of each year’s allocation.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/ybod96/article30715199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01KRAMGRNEGANEW,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-allocation-for-mgnregs-comes-down-by-13/article30715200.ece
61,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Government bites the fiscal deficit bullet,"The government has decided to bite the fiscal deficit bullet in the wake of lower tax collections, amid a slowing economy, by allowing fiscal deficit to go up to 3.8% of the GDP for the current financial year, compared with 3.3% projected in the previous year’s Budget.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman cited Section 4 (2) of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act that provides for a trigger mechanism for a deviation from the estimated fiscal deficit on account of structural reforms in the economy “with unanticipated fiscal implications”.

“Therefore, I have taken a deviation of 0.5%, consistent with Section 4(3) of the FRBM Act, both for RE 2019-20 and BE 2020-21,” she said.

The fiscal deficit target for the next year is pegged at 3.5% of the GDP.

“...the return path is being laid before Parliament as a part of the Medium Term Fiscal Policy-cum-Strategy Statement. This fiscal path commits us to the path of fiscal consolidation without compromising on the needs of investment out of public funds,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

The government said net market borrowings for 2019-20 would be ₹4.99 lakh crore and ₹5.36 lakh crore for the next financial year. The Finance Minister said a good part of the borrowings for the financial year 2020-21 would go towards capital expenditure of the government that had been scaled up by more than 21%.

In line with expectations

“For the bond market, the borrowing numbers seem to be broadly in line with market expectations and are unlikely to put a significant pressure on yields in the short term,” said Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank. Bond markets were closed on Saturday.

‘No rate cut possible’

However, market participants said the scope for interest rate reduction is now ruled out with a higher fiscal deficit number. “Increase in fiscal deficit will put pressure on inflation, which is on the rise. The Reserve Bank of India will not have much scope for further rate cut,” said the treasury head of a large public sector bank.

After reducing interest rate by 135 bps between February and October, 2019, the RBI decided to hit the pause button at the last monetary policy review in December, citing inflation concerns.

The RBI Governor had hinted that he would await the budget for future course of action on the monetary policy front.

62,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Finance Minister proposes ‘taxpayer’s charter’ to boost trust,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday proposed a new ‘taxpayer’s charter’ aimed at boosting trust between the citizens and the authorities, in order to improve the efficiency of tax administration.

“Our Prime Minister has laid before us Ease of Living as a goal to be achieved on behalf of all citizens. An important aspect of both ease of living and ease of doing business is fairness and efficiency of tax administration,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her Budget speech. “We wish to enshrine in the statutes a “taxpayer charter”... government would like to reassure taxpayers that we remain committed to taking measures so that our citizens are free from harassment of any kind,” she added.

The charter, which would enumerate taxpayer’s rights, would be incorporated in the Income Tax Act through suitable amendments, the minister said. “I propose to amend the provisions of the Income Tax Act to mandate the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to adopt a Taxpayers’ Charter. The details of the contents of the charter shall be notified soon,” she added.

‘Improving effectiveness’

The Budget also proposed several other measures to smooth the administration of the IT regime including enhanced use of technology.

As part of modification of the existing e-assessment scheme, “it is proposed to amend sub-section (3A) of section 143 of the Act to,- (i) expand the scope so as to include the reference of section 144 of the Act relating to best judgement assessment in the said sub-section; (ii) provide that Central Government may issue any direction under sub-section (3B) of the said section upto 31st March, 2022.”

This amendment would take effect from April 1, 2020.

A provision for e-appeal has also been included as part of the drive to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability to the assessment process.

With the aim of doing away with human interface from the system, the e-appeal scheme, on the lines of e-assessment scheme, would help in “eliminating the interface between the Commissioner (Appeals) and the appellant in the course of appellate proceedings to the extent technologically feasible”.

As part of the process an appellate system would be introduced incorporating “dynamic jurisdiction in which appeal shall be disposed of by one or more Commissioner (Appeals)”.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/xchw6k/article30715185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FM-MoS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-finance-minister-proposes-taxpayers-charter-to-boost-trust/article30715159.ece
63,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: National Logistics Policy to be released soon,"A National Logistics Policy, which will clarify the roles of the Union Government, State governments and key regulators, will be released soon by the Union government, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Saturday.

Presenting the Union Budget 2020-21 in Parliament, she said the policy would create a single window e-logistics market and focus on generation of employment, skills and make MSMEs competitive.

India’s logistics sector is highly fragmented and the aim is to reduce the logistics cost from the present 14% of the GDP to less than 10% by 2022. The logistics sector, with a market size of $160 billion, is very complex, involving than 20 government agencies, 37 export promotion councils, 500 certifications and 10,000 commodities.

It also involves 12 million employment base, 200 shipping agencies, 36 logistics services, 129 ICDs, 168 CFSs, 50 IT ecosystems and banks & insurance agencies. Further, 81 authorities and 500 certificates are required for export and import.

The Indian logistics sector provides livelihood to more than 22 million people and improving the sector will facilitate 10% decrease in indirect logistics cost, leading to a growth of 5 to 8% in exports. Further, it is estimated that the worth of Indian logistics market will be around $215 billion in the next two years, compared to about $160 billion at present.

Musthafa P.C., Co-founder and CEO, iD Fresh Food said: “With regards to perishable goods, measures for its transportation will help minimise the losses that the industry faces due to lack of it. Seamless national cold supply chain through PPP Model for fast transportation on national and international routes will help companies to reach more markets — domestic as well as international — where one can be assured of the freshness of the products.”

Vishal Sharma, CEO, DB Schenker India and Indian Subcontinent, said the fund allocation for infrastructure development for the transport sector, including railways and airports, is a major positive.

“With GST, we started on the path of unifying the country economically, the National Logistics Policy will build on that by enabling seamless transportation through alignment of different modes of transport.”

Umesh Revankar, MD and CEO, Shriram Transport Finance, said National logistics policy will bring in efficiency and reduce the turnaround time of the vehicle.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/jarcg6/article30715147.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Logistics,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/logistics-policy-to-be-released-soon/article30715148.ece
64,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Sops to retire thermal plants,"With several thermal power plants getting flak for not complying with emission norms, the Finance Minister in her Budget speech announced a scheme to encourage State and city governments to eschew old power plants.

“There are yet, thermal power plants that are old and their carbon emission levels are high. For such power plants, we propose that utilities running them would be advised to close them, if their emission is above the pre-set norms. The land so vacated can be put to alternative use,” Ms. Sitharaman said. The new scheme, aimed at encouraging States that are formulating and implementing plans for ensuring cleaner air in cities, would be implemented by the Environment ministry with an outlay of ₹4,400 crore, she added.

C.K. Mishra, Secretary to the Union Environment ministry, said the government already had a scheme in place for getting old coal-fired plants that don’t meet standards to retire their facilities. “We have a ₹3,000 crore allocation for this, but as a broad signal to promoting clean energy, I see it as a welcome step,” he added.

Current rules say that coal-fired power plants have to ensure that they curtail sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions by implementing appropriate technology. While this was originally to be in place by 2017, the ministry has extended the deadline to 2022. Eleven plants in the vicinity of Delhi had a December 31 deadline but only one had actually complied.

According to the Central Electricity Authority, 166 GW of capacity requires retrofitting with flue gas desulphurisation (to meet sulphur oxide emission norms) and 66 GW capacity needs modifications or enhancements to reduce particulate matter emissions.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-sops-to-retire-thermal-plants/article30715144.ece
65,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | States’ tax share to stay at 42%,"The Fifteenth Finance Commission, in its interim report tabled in Parliament on Saturday, has recommended maintaining States’ share in the divisible pool of tax collections at virtually the same level of 42% set by its predecessor, for 2020-21.

To factor in the changed status of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir, the rate at which funds may be shared with the States has been reset to 41%. This is after ‘adjusting one percentage point for the needs, including special ones of the two new union territories of J&K and Ladakh,’ the Commission noted in its report.

An official said that the actual pool of funds available to States will be equivalent to what they were receiving from the 42% share granted by the Fourteenth Finance Commission, as the number of States are now 28 instead of 29. The one percentage point reduction is what would have been earmarked for J&K as a State.

“In the spirit of co-operative federalism, I am pleased to announce that we have, in substantial measure, accepted the recommendations of the Commission,” said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech.

Having missed its original deadline of November 2019, the Commission attributed the delay to new developments that took place when its work was at an advanced stage, such as the enactment of the J&K Reorganisation Act to create two new union territories, the unpredictable and slowing global economy, and India’s own sluggish economy that made revenue projections tricky.

The current slowdown in the Indian economy coincides with major ‘structural reforms’ such as demonetisation and GST taken over the past five years, the Commission noted.

“Short-term transitional difficulties in implementing these structural reforms can create a pessimistic view on the medium term prospects of economic growth and revenue collections,” it said, stressing that all these changes will ‘take time to filter through the economy’ so forecasting efforts based on current trends could be misplaced.

An expert group comprising officials from the Finance, Defence and Home Ministries will examine and propose alternative mechanisms so as to ensure predictable and stable flow of funds for defence and internal security, which was added as term of reference for the Commission.

The Defence Ministry, in its submissions to the Commission, has proposed some radical steps to ensure capital outlays are fully funded so as to ensure ‘complete defence preparedness.’

Arguing that current provisions are inadequate for big defence acquisitions, the Ministry has mooted disinvestment of defence public sector enterprises, levying of a cess, monetisation of surplus land and other assets, as well as the issuance of tax-free defence bonds and the creation of a non-lapsable fund.

“The defence capital outlay was less than the Budgetary provision for five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16. We have noticed a reversal in this trend during 2016-17 to 2018-19,” the Commission noted in its interim report.

The Defence Ministry said that though India is currently not engaged in any conflict, the nature of threats it faces demands complete defence preparedness. The expert group to be constituted by the Commission would consider the detailed modalities and implementation plan for an alternative mechanism such as the proposed non-lapsable fund.

The Commission would submit its final report to the President during the latter part of the year, that would include the devolution formula proposed between the Centre and the States for the five-year period from 2021-2022 till 2025-2026. The interim report was submitted to provide a formula for 2020-21 alone.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/79iva5/article30715113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02NKSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-states-tax-share-to-stay-at-42/article30715115.ece
66,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: Revenue from telecom to double to ₹1.33 lakh cr.,"The Centre expects revenues from the telecom sector to more than double to ₹1.33 lakh crore in the next financial year on the back of increased licence fees and spectrum usage charges by operators, following the Supreme Court’s ruling on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR), along with the upcoming spectrum auctions.

According to the government estimates, in the current financial year (2019-20), its revenues from ‘other communication services’ will be ₹58,989.64 crore against a budgeted amount of ₹50,519.81crore.

“Receipts under ‘Other Communication Services’ mainly relate to the licence fees from telecom operators and receipts on account of spectrum usage charges,” the Budget document said, adding that the Department of Telecom collects the recurring licence fees from various service providers.

According to experts, the increased revenue estimate could point to realisation of some of the AGR dues, along with the proceeds from the upcoming spectrum auctions, including those of the 5G airwaves.

Ankit Jain, assistant vice-president, corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd, said, “Despite the deferral of spectrum payments due in FY2021 and FY2022, the higher BE for FY2021 can be attributable to some participation in 5G spectrum auctions and expectation of payments of AGR-related dues.”

Following the Supreme Court’s October 24 ruling on the definition of AGR, the telecom industry owes the government ₹1.47 lakh crore in licence fees (₹92,642 crore) and ₹55,054.51 crore in spectrum usage charge.

The debt-ridden industry on Saturday expressed disappointment with the Budget, given that none of its demands, including a reduction in levies, was addressed.

COAI upset

Rajan Mathews, DG at the industry body COAI, said, “...it is disappointing that there were no announcements made regarding the rationalisation of levies and taxes currently imposed on the severely distressed telecom sector and ... telecom was not given an infrastructure status even though a slew of crucial reforms has been announced on infrastructure. The telecom sector, which is the backbone of the country’s economy, did not receive significant support.”

Likewise, Prashant Singhal, Emerging Markets TMT Leader, EY, said, “While the telecom sector will be pivotal to realising Digital India’s vision, the Budget brings little cheer for it. The Budget factors in a 2.5 fold increase in communication services receipt for this fiscal at ₹1.33 trillion, which points to realisation of certain AGR dues and proceeds from the 5G spectrum auction. Tariff reset, certain relief on the AGR judgement and a clear policy roadmap is eminent for the industry to be viable and help meet Budget estimates.”",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jdxviw/article30715109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02TOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/revenue-from-telecom-to-double-to-133-lakh-cr/article30715110.ece
67,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Affordable housing gets a leg-up, but reality bites for realty sector","To give further push to the government’s ‘Housing for All’ goal, the Union Budget has yet again laid emphasis on affordable housing, giving a boost to the sector and home-buyers as well.

Last year, an additional deduction of up to ₹1.5 lakh for interest paid on loans taken for purchase of an affordable house was announced. The deduction was allowed on housing loans sanctioned on or before March 31, 2020.

Now, to ensure that more persons avail this benefit, the Finance Minister has proposed to extend the date of loan sanction for availing this additional deduction by one more year till March 31, 2021. Referring to the tax holiday provided on profits earned by developers of affordable housing projects approved by March 31, 2020, the Finance Minister has proposed to extend the date of approval of such projects for availing this tax holiday, by one more year.

Shishir Baijal, CMD, Knight Frank, said, “The extension of benefits for affordable housing for developers as well as home buyers is a step in the right direction. But the real estate sector was hoping that the government would come up with measures to boost housing demand. However, the removal of exemption under the new income tax regime on principal and interest for home loans would be a dampener for the sector.”

Vivek Chandy, joint managing partner, J Sagar Associates, said that the decision to extend tax benefit on affordable housing by one year would not give the industry the stimulus it had been seeking.

According to Rohit Gera, MD, Gera Developers, “The government has not provided the necessary stimulus needed boost the real estate sector. As a result, the sector will see a slow recovery, with more pain for many home-buyers and developers.”

Dr. Niranjan Hiranandani, president, Naredco, said the Budget failed to announce much-awaited economic stimulus to fuel kick-start of $5 trillion economy. “With economy in doldrums and acute slump in consumption, efforts on demand creation incentives are missing. Any fiscal measure in the sluggish real estate sector could provide a fillip,” he said.

To minimise hardships in real estate transaction, the Budget has proposed to increase the circle rate limit of 5% to 10%.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/t22c2d/article30715022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02HOUSING,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-affordable-housing-gets-a-leg-up-but-reality-bites-for-realty-sector/article30715023.ece
68,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Long on words, short on numbers","Expectations, predictions, educated guesses and speculation surrounding the Union Budget are behind us and what we have now is the reality of the Budget documents placed before the Parliament! It was probably unfair to expect miracles from the Finance Minister, given the complex challenges facing the economy. Between keeping the fiscal deficit within reasonable limits, satisfying the clamour for lower rates of personal taxation and simultaneously providing a thrust to growth was clearly a Himalayan task. Be that as it may, one would still have to conclude that even the most moderate of expectations have been belied.

Corporate India, already the beneficiary of the generous tax rate reduction in September, is doubly benefited by the scrapping of Dividend Distribution Tax. But was that the priority? No doubt, the generous allocations for the rural and infrastructure sectors are in line with expectations and indeed, welcome. The latter, in particular, has been one of the key drivers of growth in recent years and deserves to be carried forward. Over the past few months, much has been written about the liquidity issues dogging the NBFC sector. However, banks have been flush with liquidity, as have many of the large and well-managed NBFCs.

In fact, the really worrying factor has been the weak demand, across the two-wheeler, passenger car and commercial vehicle segments, all of which have witnessed significant double-digit declines in sales over the past year.

While it is well-nigh impossible for any Finance Minister to satisfy all sections of the public, one expected a few specific measures to spur demand; sadly, these are conspicuous by their absence.

But the deed is done, and the din and bustle of television debates will run their course. What remains however, is the reality of surplus capacity, depressed consumer sentiment, heightened risk aversion and an uncertain global environment. These, and more, are what we shall have to contend with in the months ahead. The Budget was long on words and short on numbers.

69,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Opposition gives the thumbs down,"Opposition parties gave the thumbs down to the Union Budget, saying Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman failed to give a clear road map on how to pull the economy out of the slump and her two hour and 40 minutes speech was a classic case of filibustering.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury called it the longest ‘non budget’ Budget speech by any Finance Minister. “The less you have to say longer will be the speech,” he said. The Budget had completely failed to address the current economic slowdown. It did not have a road map for a turnaround of the economy. The economy was bordering on recession and Ms Sitharaman failed to answer the crucial question of how to boost public consumption. The Finance Minister was hiding the real numbers. Instead of mentioning tax revenue, she listed out receipts that include Rs 1.76 lakh crore payout by RBI and the funds received by privatisation of public sector units. The government was meeting the revenue shortfall by privatisation like selling a stake in Life Insurance Corporation of India, he added.

NCP leader Supriya Sule said the Minister didn’t elucidate her plan to double farmers’ income.“There is no content in the Budget. They claim that they will be doubling up the farmers’ income in two years but there was not a single word on the minimum support price. So how will they do it? This is just another ‘jumla’ and she just reiterated hackneyed phrases,” she said.

Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav said the Budget did not lay down a road to bring in investments. Ms. Sitharaman deliberately read out a long speech to obfuscate. “We all were hopeful but the Budget was deeply disappointing. This is a bankrupt Budget. The entire banking sector has collapsed, agrarian crisis is still going on, there are no jobs and yet the Budget didn't provide answers to any of these questions,” he said.

Biju Janata Dal Lok Sabha member Pinaki Misra said the Budget failed to address the Odisha government's concern over delayed GST payouts. “I thought it was needlessly too long, full of platitudes and very low on actual content. I think the narrowness of vision of the government is little surprising. A government which is talking about five trillion dollar economy is talking about income tax slabs of 5 lakh or 7.5 lakh and labour over so much over it,” Mr Misra told The Hindu.

TMC MP Derek O' Brien said the Budget took the country from economic crisis to economic disaster. There was no mention of employment generation, relief for the poor or unorganised sector. Instead it had proposed a cess on the health sector. “The government is selling the family jewels, railways, BSNL, Air India and now LIC. And the worst still LIC sale will be used to compensate States on GST. What's going on here?,” he stated.

The speech had bluffed and misled on many counts. At current rate, farmers’ income could be doubled only by 2030. ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’, which the Finance Minister hailed for significant improvement, was a big con. “Rs 644 crore was spent on ‘Beti Bachao Beti Padhao’ for all of India. And 56 per cent of this money was spent on advertisements alone,” he added.

CPI general secretary D Raja said the Budget was a shameless declaration that the government was abdicating all its responsibilities. “This Budget is a budget for privatisation and everything is to be done using the PPP route, including railways, health and infrastructure”. Selling a stake in LIC was a retrograde move. “Despite the repeated claim of the government to double farmers’ income, the distress continues. No hope to be seen in the Budget for millions of unemployed youth of the country,” he stated.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/bqp0xs/article30714991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01KRAYECHURY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-opposition-gives-the-thumbs-down/article30714992.ece
70,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: Govt. not expecting substantial gain from AGR dues in 2020-21,"It may have sought almost ₹4 lakh crore from telecom and non-telecom companies in past dues but the government is not expecting any substantial windfall in the coming year.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who provisioned ₹1.3 lakh crore in receipts from telecom licence fee and spectrum usage charge for the next financial year, said the government is looking to address the dispute over what revenues should be taken for calculating dues in a more comprehensive manner.

In her post-Budget press conference, she said the issue is a complex one and the industry players are in dialogue with the government to resolve it.

“I don’t think I am looking at it purely from what the government will collect. This particular development in the telecom sector is something which all of us have watched, going through the proceedings of the court... it would not be right for me to just comment and say we are looking at this number or that,” she said to a question on enhancing revenue collection target from the debt-ridden telecom sector.

The government on Saturday increased the revenue estimate from the sector by over two-folds to ₹1.33 lakh crore for 2020-21 as compared to the collection target in the current financial year, mainly on account of adjusted gross revenue dues.

“It is fairly complex issue. The industry and affected parties are also in touch with the government. We are engaging with them, the department is engaging with them. We will be addressing this in a more comprehensive manner,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

The government expects ₹58,686.64 crore under communications head in the current financial year as against a budgeted amount of ₹50,519.8 crore in 2019-20.

“Receipts under ‘Other Communication Services’ mainly relate to the licence fees from telecom operators and receipts on account of spectrum usage charges,” the Budget documents said.

The industry is saddled with ₹1.47 lakh crore in additional statutory dues in the wake of a recent Supreme Court ruling on adjusted gross revenue (AGR). Telecom companies owe the government ₹92,642 crore in unpaid licence fee and another ₹55,054 crore in outstanding spectrum usage charges.

The dues of non-telecom public sector firms, including Oil India, GAIL and PowerGrid, as per the demand raised by the Department of Telecommunications, exceed ₹2.4 lakh crore.

ICRA Assistant Vice-President (Corporate Ratings) Ankit Jain said despite deferral of spectrum payments due in the financial year 2020-21 and financial year 2021-22, higher budgetary estimates for 2020-21 can be attributable to some participation in 5G spectrum auctions and expectation of payments of AGR-related dues.

According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly ₹35,586 crore, of which ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).

In the case of Vodafone Idea, this number stands at a cumulative ₹53,038 crore, including ₹24,729 crore of SUC dues and ₹28,309 crore in licence fee.

The remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL and MTNL and some of the shut or bankrupt telecom companies.

The Supreme Court had allowed three months to the affected operators to cough up the amounts — whose deadline expired on January 23 — though the DoT did not take any coercive action against defaulters as their appeals seeking relaxation in payment timelines in pending in the apex court’s order.

Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea Ltd and Tata Teleservices have jointly filed a modification application in the Supreme Court seeking more time to pay the statutory dues.

The fresh plea for relief on the payment schedule came after the Supreme Court last month dismissed the review petitions filed by telecom companies against the apex court’s October 24, 2019, verdict.

The DoT is also working on spectrum auction, which is likely to be held in April-May 2020.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/hgk1p5/article30715298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Telecom,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-govt-not-expecting-substantial-gain-from-agr-dues-in-2020-21/article30714954.ece
71,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Government is pro-business,"The Union Budget for the year 2020-21 was presented in the backdrop of a gloomy economic scenario where all the important levers of growth namely private investments, private consumptions and exports were spluttering.

Whatever growth witnessed was based on heavy lifting by the government. The Budget posited a slippage of 0.5% percent in the fiscal deficit for the next year vis-a-vis the FRBM target. The clear message that can be discerned from the Budget is that the government is now comfortable with being perceived as pro-business and not inclined to stigmatise capitalism — a phrase coined by Former Chief Economic Adviser, Dr. Arvind Subramanian.

There are a number of policy announcements in the Budget which would boost private investments. These include the abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax, the exemption on interest, dividends and capital gains for investment in infrastructure projects by sovereign wealth funds (that will help to tap into global pools of capital) and the relaxation in the limits of foreign portfolio investment in corporate bonds from 9% to 15% (of the outstanding value of the bonds). This will increase investments in the Indian bond market.

The Budget recognises that it would be difficult to kick-start growth without improvement in the business sentiment.

The Finance Minister has tried to achieve this by providing comfort to businesses in a number of her remarks. A good example of this is the ‘Amnesty Scheme’ for direct taxes on similar lines to the indirect tax. The scheme has been labelled ‘From Litigation to Trust’ scheme (‘Vivad se Vishwas’). The scheme provides for complete waiver of interest, penalty and prosecution proceedings if the disputed tax amount is paid by March 31.

Similarly, the other interesting confidence building measure is the incorporation of a charter of commitments incorporated in the direct tax statute which promises a tax-friendly environment. This is similar to the Tax Charter found in developed countries like Canada.

These are important trust building measures which will help both domestic investment and create a favourable climate for foreign investment.

On the consumption side, the government has given relief for taxpayers whose incomes are up to ₹15 lakh.

These concessions are given in an innovative fashion by predicating them on the taxpayers giving up their tax deductions.

The idea is to simplify tax payments by gradually phasing out exemption and having a flat rate. The focus is also on speeding up investment in the infrastructure which will, in turn, boost private consumption because a lot of the investment would generate jobs especially in industries like construction and retail. The Finance Minister also talks about encouraging ‘Assembling in India’ going away from the earlier position of encouraging only those industries in India where the value addition is high. In fact, the Budget talks about encouraging ‘Network Industries’ like electronics and mobile phones which can generate considerable jobs even while assembling on account of the scale effect.

It is well recognised that the best way to boost consumption is to increase good quality jobs in the formal economy. The complaint is that many companies find students graduating without the necessary jobs skills. ‘Unemployable’ is the common refrain. The Budget also talks about skill upgradation and also moots the concept of having bridge courses for categories like teachers, nurses and other semi-skilled workers who are much in demand in foreign countries.

The allocation for infrastructure industries and the social sector has been considerably enhanced but in spite of this, the Finance Minister has been able to keep the Budget deficit within reasonable limits largely on account of huge expectations from disinvestment and monetisation of assets.

These revenues really hold the key for the government to manage its finances in the coming year. A huge target of ₹2.10 lakh crore has been fixed for disinvestment next year. This is sought to be facilitated through partial disinvestment in LIC and IDBI together with the earlier announcements of Air India, BPCL and CONCOR. What is disappointing in the Budget is a lack of strategy to reduce agricultural subsidies, mainly food and fertilizers. It would be better to give assistance directly to farmers and also switch some expenditure from subsidy to agricultural R&D which is badly neglected. Food subsidies are a huge burden and arise mainly on account of government guarantees to borrowings by the Food Corporation of India which maintains a huge inventory of foodgrains of nearly 75 million tonnes when perhaps only 35 million tonnes would suffice. There is also a case for revision of issue prices from the ration shops which have not been raised for a long time. To sum up, the Finance Minister’s expectations about a boost in the economy largely hinges on factors beyond her control — an uptick in global growth, improvement in investment sentiment facilitating higher disinvestment and a downturn in oil prices.

72,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: Allocation up for highways ministry,"The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways saw an increase of 10% in its budgetary allocation, but a large chunk of it is through monetisation of national highways by the NHAI.

The total budget allocation has gone up from ₹83,015 crore last fiscal to ₹91,823.2 crore for financial year 2020-2021. Of this hike of ₹8,808 crore, as much as ₹5,809 crore is through investment in NHAI met from monetisation of national highways. The balance allocation is for road works.

“Accelerated development of highways will be undertaken. This will include development of 2,500 km of access control highways, 9,000 km of economic corridors, 2,000 km of coastal and land port roads and 2,000 km of strategic highways,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her speech. She said that the Delhi-Mumbai Expressway and two other packages would be completed by 2023 .

The Minister said that 12 lots of highway bundles totalling ₹6000 crore would be monetised before 2024.

Ms. Sitharaman proposed to provide about ₹1.70 lakh crore for transport infrastructure, including 100 airports, in 2020-21.

The government also aimed to make sea ports more efficient through the use of technology. The FM announced that at least one major port would be corporatised and then listed on the stock exchanges.

The allocation for the Ministry of Shipping has seen an increase of 18% from ₹1,523 crore last year to ₹1,800 crore this fiscal. In line with the vision laid out by the Minister, the development of ports has seen a 44% increase in allocation, from ₹98 crore last fiscal to ₹142 crore.

The Sagarmala project that aims to exploit India’s waterways and coastline has seen a doubling of allocation from ₹98 crore to ₹211 crore. The budget for ship building has also grown more than three-fold from ₹42.43 crore to ₹151 crore. Similarly, under the head of ports and lighthouses, the allocation has gone up by 50% — from ₹408 crore to ₹621 crore.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cyqzbm/article30714930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-TOLL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-allocation-up-for-highways-ministry/article30714931.ece
73,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020: Powering India with a ₹22,000-crore push","The Union Budget has allocated ₹22,000 crore to the power and renewable energy sector in 2020-21 with an aim to improve the financial health of power distribution firms and boost the use of solar power.

“Taking electricity to every household has been a major achievement. However, the distribution sector, particularly the DISCOMS, are under financial stress. The Ministry intends to promote ‘smart’ metering. I urge all the States and Union Territories to replace conventional energy meters with prepaid smart meters in the next three years. Also, this would give consumers the freedom to choose the supplier and rate as per their requirement. Further measures to reform DISCOMs would be taken,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.

Gas grid

The government plans to expand the national gas grid from the present 16,200 km to 27,000 km.

To deepen gas markets in India, further reforms will be undertaken to facilitate transparent price discovery and ease of transactions.

According to Nabin Ballodia, Partner, Tax, KPMG in India, the Budget provisions have given impetus to clean energy and power.

“The direction to increase the national gas grid indicates the direction of the government to move towards cleaner fuel. Building of solar power capacity along railway tracks in railway-owned land, as well as the support to farmers to set up solar power facilities connected to the grid would help additional power generation,” Mr. Ballodia said.

The Finance Minister promised to provide concessional income tax rate of 15% for new power companies.

Tax reduction

“Reduction in corporate tax rate to 15% for new power generation will help new investments in renewable power. Prepaid smart metering and freedom to choose power supplier will lay the ground to bring competition in the sector and give consumers a choice,” said Santosh Kamath, Partner and Leader, Alternate Energies, KPMG in India.

In addition, the removal of dividend distribution tax (DDT) is likely to boost foreign investment in the sector.

Vimal Kejriwal, MD & CEO, KEC International said, “Allocation towards power and renewable energy and transport infrastructure, upgrade of stations and developing solar in railways, setting up of 100 new airports, five new smart cities and linking 1 lakh gram panchayats with BharatNet augurs well for businesses.”",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/m3n7lc/article30714905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2TH-RENEWABLE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/powering-india-with-a-22000-crore-push/article30714906.ece
74,2020/02/01,Marginal hike in food subsidy bill,"The government’s food, fertiliser and fuel subsidy bill has been pegged marginally higher by 0.24% at ₹2,27,793.89 crore for the 2020-21, according to the Budget document.

The hike comes despite the Economic Survey stating that food subsidies end up creating distortions in the functioning of the free market.

The government has allocated about ₹2,27,255 crore for the food, fertiliser and fuel subsidy in the current fiscal in the revised estimate compared to ₹3,02,094 in the budget estimates. The government spent ₹1,96,769 crore on the food, fertiliser and fuel subsidies in 2018-19.

Of the total subsidy bill, the maximum allocation has been made for food (₹1,15,569.68 crore), followed by fertiliser (₹71,309 crore) with fuel getting ₹40,915.21 crore.

The Economic Survey had called for rationalisation of government intervention in the food grain market. It said the government's role as largest procurer and hoarder of rice and wheat, has led to burgeoning food subsidy burden and inefficiencies in the markets.

“Subsidy as a concept is not a good idea except for few priority sectors. Subsidy is often used for populist purposes and its more political in nature than economic. Urea subsidy is supporting the farm sector, so it is justified. But why do large scale farmers, who don’t pay any income tax, need a subsidy? Providing subsidy through direct benefit transfer scheme below certain threshold should help,” Sachin Menon, Partner & Head -Indirect Tax at KPMG (India), told The Hindu.

For 2020-21 fiscal, the allocation for subsidised foodgrain through the public distribution system (PDS) and other welfare schemes has been increased 6.33% to ₹1,15,569.68 crore; the allocation for subsidised fuel, especially cooking gas and kerosene, has also been increased by 6% to ₹40,915.21 crore.

However, the allocation for subsidised fertilisers has fallen sharply by 11% to ₹71,309 crore from ₹79,997.85 crore allocated in the revised estimate.

Talking about fertiliser subsidy, Kunal Sood, Partner-Food & Agri sector at Grant Thornton told The Hindu, “In my view it shall prove to be strategic in the long run. The subsidy led to increased use of chemical fertilizers (urea overuse) while related increase in productivity is fast declining. Or in other words, costs exceed benefits. It also led to deterioration of soil quality (nutrient deficiency). The FM has proposed to reverse it by reducing subsidies on chemical fertilizer and encouraging organic farming. It is a long term solution which will benefit farmers and food security. Will it encourage industry to focus on designing need based products and educating farmers on efficient and balanced use of fertilizers based on soil health? A farmer is expected to use less fertiliser but more targeted to local conditions. Overall win-win,” said Mr. Sood.

Mr. Dharmesh Kant, Head- Retail Research, IndiaNivesh is negative on agri-chemical manufacturers and fertiliser manufacture after the Finance Minister announced that balanced use of chemical inputs will bring about change in the prevailing regime .

For the current year, ₹38,568.86 crore has been allocated as fuel subsidy. The allocation for LPG subsidy has been increased to ₹37,256.21 crore for the next fiscal from the revised estimate of ₹34,085.86 crore for the current year. However, the allocation for kerosene subsidy has been reduced to ₹3,659 crore for the next year from the revised estimate of ₹4,483 crore for the current year.

“The LPG subsidy is justified as its going to weaker sector of the society. The LPG connections under Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) is going up,” said Mr. Menon.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/twgeh6/article30714872.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PDS-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/marginal-hike-in-food-subsidy-bill/article30714852.ece
75,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Private players allowed to set up data parks,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday announced an allocation of ₹6,000 crore under the BharatNet programme to enhance broadband connectivity in rural areas, while also proposing a new policy to allow private players to set up data parks in the country.

“Our vision is that all ‘public institutions’ at the gram panchayat level, such as anganwadis, health and wellness centres, government schools, PDS (public distribution system) outlets, post offices and police stations will be provided with digital connectivity. So, Fibre to the Home (FTTH) connections through BharatNet will link 100,000 gram panchayats this year. It is proposed to provide ₹6,000 crore to the BharatNet programme in 2020-21,” the Minister said during her speech.

New technologies such as analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) found a lot of emphasis in Budget 2020. In fact, the Finance Minister stated at the start of her speech that she had been mindful of presenting the Budget against the backdrop of a proliferation of technologies, especially analytics, machine learning, robotics, bio-informatics and AI.

Stating that “data is the new oil” was now a cliché, the Minister said that to take advantage of the way new technologies were changing everyone’s lives, the government would “soon bring out a policy to enable the private sector to build Data Centre parks throughout the country”. “It will enable our firms to skilfully incorporate data in every step of their value chains,” she said.

The Minister also highlighted the growing need for the Indian statistical system to meet the challenges of real-time monitoring of our increasingly complex economy. “Data must have strong credibility. The proposed new National Policy on Official Statistics would use latest technology, including AI. It would lay down a road map towards modernised data collection, integrated information portal and timely dissemination of information,” she said.

New business models

The new economy, she said, was based on innovations that disrupt established business models. AI, the Internet of Things, 3D printing, drones, DNA data storage, quantum computing, etc., were re-writing the world economic order. “India has already embraced new paradigms such as the sharing economy with aggregator platforms displacing conventional businesses. The government has harnessed new technologies to enable direct benefit transfers and financial inclusion on a scale never imagined before,” Ms. Sitharaman said.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/k6920z/article30714617.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NetworkNew,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-private-players-allowed-to-set-up-data-parks/article30714618.ece

She peppered this speech with poetic flourishes, making a point of quoting Kashmiri poet Dinanath Kaul, Tamil sage Thiruvalluvar and ancient Tamil poetess Avvaiyar.

77,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Funding for museums to promote tourism,"In her Budget speech on Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a series of steps to set up and renovate museums to promote tourism. As part of this, she announced an allocation of ₹3,150 crore to the Ministry of Culture for the maritime museum coming up at Lothal in Gujarat.

“Our government proposes to establish an Indian Institute of Heritage and Conservation under the Ministry of Culture; it shall have the status of a deemed University to start with. Acquisition of knowledge in disciplines such as museology and archaeology are essential for collecting and analysing scientific evidence of such findings and for [their] dissemination through high quality museums,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her Budget speech, adding that, currently, the lack of trained manpower is a handicap for both these disciplines. “This also affects tourism,” she said.

Five sites

Ms. Sitharaman said five archaeological sites would be developed as iconic sites with on-site Museums. They are: Rakhigarhi (Haryana), Hastinapur (Uttar Pradesh) Shivsagar (Assam), Dholavira (Gujarat) and Adichanallur (Tamil Nadu).

Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced re-curation of the Indian Museum in Kolkata, which is the oldest in the country. Towards this, Ms. Sitharaman said, in the historic Old Mint building in Kolkata, a museum on Numismatics and Trade will also be located. “Four more museums from across the country shall be taken up for renovation and re-curation so that a world class experience can be offered to visitors,” she said, also announcing government support for the setting up of a tribal museum in Ranchi, Jharkhand.

States’ roadmap

Stating that growth of tourism directly relates to growth and employment, Ms. Sitharaman allocated ₹2,500 crore for 2020-21 for tourism promotion. She further added, “I expect the State governments to develop a roadmap for certain identified destinations and formulate financial plans during 2021 against which specified grants will be made available to the States in 2020-21.”

In this direction, she said that India has moved up from rank 65 in 2014 to 34 in 2019 in the World Economic Forum’s Travel and Tourism Competitive Index. Foreign exchange earnings grew 7.4% to ₹1.88 lakh crore for the period January to November 2019, from ₹1.75 lakh crore, she added.

78,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Deposit insurance cover raised to ₹5 lakh,"The government has decided to increase the insurance cover for bank deposits to ₹5 lakh from ₹1 lakh, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her Budget speech. This is the first time since 1993 that the deposit insurance cover has been raised.

The Finance Minister assured that there was a robust mechanism in place to monitor the health of all Scheduled Commercial Banks and that depositors’ money was safe.

“The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) has been permitted to increase [the] Deposit Insurance Coverage for a depositor, which is now ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh per depositor,” she said.

The clamour for higher cover for bank deposits grew stronger following the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank crisis, where depositors are facing restrictions on deposit withdrawals.

The RBI imposed the restrictions following financial irregularities at PMC Bank. At present, the withdrawal from the bank is capped at ₹50,000.

“Raising deposit insurance cover to ₹5 lakh from the current ₹1 lakh is significant and will give a big comfort to depositors,” Shanti Ekambaram, president – Consumer Banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd., said.

The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) had proposed to increase the deposit insurance limit to the ₹3-5 lakh range following the crisis at PMC Bank. The DICGC Act will have to be amended to increase the deposit cover. The increase in deposit cover will increase the cost for the banks.

“The increase on deposit insurance to ₹5 lakh will increase bank premia costs to these institutions,” Abizer Diwanji, Partner & Leader Financial Services - EY India, said. The present premium rate is 10 paise for a deposit of ₹100.

The premium paid by the insured banks to the DICGC is required to be borne by the banks themselves and is not passed on to the depositors.

The DICGC insures all bank deposits such as savings, fixed, current and recurring. Deposits not covered by the Corporation include those of foreign governments and of Central/ State governments, deposits of State Land Development Banks with State cooperative banks, inter-bank deposits, deposits received outside India and those specifically exempted by the DICGC with the prior approval of the banking regulator.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/ti1acj/article30714463.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02CASHDEPOSITS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-deposit-insurance-cover-raised-to-5-lakh/article30714464.ece
79,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | All allocations under Centrally sponsored schemes stagnant: Naveen Patnaik,"Welcoming several initiatives announced in the Budget, Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik expressed concern over several other issues and raised certain demands as well.

“Sensex is an indicator of investor confidence. The drop of almost 1,000 points today [Saturday] shows that there is a huge scope to take a number of measures,” he said.

“Investor confidence is important for fresh investments to come in, to spur growth which is the biggest challenge now. This will have a huge impact on job creation livelihood options for our youth,” said Mr. Patnaik.

The Chief Minister said almost all allocations under the Centrally sponsored schemes have been stagnant. The divisible pool of Central taxes has shrunk by almost ₹59,000 crore and this will reduce Odisha’s share by about ₹3,000 crore, he said.

Observing that drinking water is a national priority, Mr. Patnaik said allocation of ₹11,000 crore nationally against an approved plan of ₹3.6 lakh crore is too little. In fact, Odisha spends about ₹3,600 crore on it, he said.

Mr. Patnaik expressed displeasure over non inclusion of any archaeological site of Odisha in the iconic sites to be developed. “Also Odisha deserves a national tribal museum.”

The Chief Minister, however, welcomed Kisan Rail and Krishi Udan for a seamless national cold supply chain and PM-KUSUM to cover 20 lakh farmers for solar pumps.

He also welcomed the removal of the dividend distribution tax and introduction of concessional component tax.

Saying Odisha had requested for extension of concessional tax rates to cooperatives in line with corporate tax cuts. Mr. Patnaik welcomed the announcement of concessional rates for cooperatives.

The Chief Minister also welcomed the increase of deposit insurance coverage from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh, and announcement for new educational policy and FDI in the education sector.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bm5h69/article29939558.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11NAVEEN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-all-allocations-under-centrally-sponsored-schemes-stagnant-naveen-patnaik/article30714264.ece
80,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Balanced Budget under circumstances,"On the whole I think the Budget by the Finance Minister is a mixed bag, primarily because expectations were too many —few things have been addressed and few have not been. Market has reacted sharply today because foreign investors would not have been there. But I am not so pessimistic and I think under these circumstances, this is a balanced budget.

Since in the run-up to the Budget there has been a lot of discussion about the economy slowing down and the government being sensitive about it, people thought a lot more would be done to kick-start the economy. The market expected that there would be some exemption on LTCG, something more concrete for banks, which didn’t happen. For insurance sector the disappointment is because so many exemptions and deductions are taken away. If the idea was to make income tax simple without any deductions and exemptions then it should have been lowered much more. It should have been dramatic like it happened for corporate taxes, but this is gradual so the benefit would be muted.

Also when there is a plan to do an initial public offering for Life Insurance Corporation of India, then the biggest incentive which has been driving savings into life insurance investments should not have been taken away. Things also look complicated due to the option of using or not using exemption benefits.

However, on the positive side, there are a few things like removing criminal clauses in companies act and many other acts, also the Vivad Se Vishwas scheme to do a trust based thing are positive moves. Also government has kept its focus on rural, agriculture, infrastructure while not going overboard in terms of fiscal deficit. They are trying to keep it within the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) leeway provided. So, I would say it is a balanced act given the circumstances.

Little for private investment

There is very little for the private sector investment. In fact, while the dividend distribution tax has been taken away, which helps foreign investors, the domestic entrepreneurs and promoters are penalised on their profits twice because first they are taxed as company and again taxed on dividends, which in a way is a retrograde step because profits should taxed only once. You could have a higher tax rate that is acceptable but what is happening is that entrepreneurs or investors who reinvest in ventures and drive jobs will be discouraged with this double taxation.

While housing for all by the year 2022 has been the stated mission of the government, unfortunately the tax paid on the exemption for the housing loan is taken away. This may not be good for the millennial or first time home buyers, particularly when interest rates are high. So, I think there are few steps that might work as a counter to what government objectives are like flow of savings into insurance or home loan tax benefits for new buyers. It is possible that during the course of the discussion on Budget some of them may be addressed. But, in the short-term it may not augur well for investment in affordable housing by the end user and also the flow of savings into the financial sector which are more productive.

81,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Changes in Customs duty renew focus on domestic business,"The changes proposed on the Customs duty front indicate that there is going to be a renewed focus on promoting and protecting domestic business. The focus on protecting and promoting domestic businesses is brought out in various ways such as tariff increases, abolition of exemptions, provisions relating to safeguards and anti-dumping duties, regulating Free Trade Agreement (FTA) imports, etc.

There have been quite a few increases in the Customs duty rates that we have seen in this Budget, including several items on which the earlier lower rates or exemptions have been removed. This includes items such as vegetable fats and oils, butter, cheese, molasses, footwear, furniture, etc.

Interesting list

Many of these items are made by the MSME (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) sector, which has been finding it difficult to handle the recent slowdown in the economy. The list of items on which there has been an increase in the Customs duty rates is interesting as many of the items are those where there are sufficient domestic players, especially in the SME space, who manufacture these products. The introduction of the Health Cess on certain items such as medical equipment could also lead to more domestic manufacturing.

The comparative dynamics in terms of make in India or import into India would undergo a significant shift in favour of make in India on account of these rate changes. There is also an overall movement in respect of various products where the Customs duty rates on inputs and raw materials have been reduced, while they have been increased on finished products to encourage more domestic manufacturing.

Safeguards increased

The provisions relating to safeguards and anti-dumping duties have also undergone significant changes. It has been stated that the objective is to prevent an import surge that adversely impacts the domestic industry. There have been several domestic businesses that have faced the brunt of cheap imports in recent times, who would benefit by these measures.

It is clear that the objective is to provide a level playing field for domestic businesses that have been grappling with a demand slowdown and a working capital squeeze in recent times. New provisions have been proposed to avoid cases where the description, name or composition of an imported article is altered in order to overcome the anti-dumping duties imposed on that product. Similarly, any attempt to circumvent the anti-dumping duty provisions by changing the trade practices, pattern of trade or channels of trade would also not be possible in future. There is also an umbrella provision that has been inserted to take care of any other case where the anti-dumping duty imposed is rendered ineffective by any measure adopted by the exporter or importer.

FTA imports

A need has also been felt to regulate imports from FTA (Free Trade Agreement) countries as there is a view that several entities are taking undue advantage of the benefits provided by FTAs. Unregulated imports under the existing FTAs appear to be causing distress to domestic producers. The norms relating to rules of origin, value addition requirements etc., would be more effectively enforced in order to ensure that only those imports that fulfil the FTA requirements are permitted. A review of the rules of origin is also proposed in the coming months in order to ensure that FTAs are not misused.

The Customs duty changes are oriented towards promoting and protecting domestic businesses and ensuring that they have a level playing field whilst they deal with global headwinds.

82,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: A boost for technical textiles,"Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget on Saturday announced a National Technical Textiles Mission, which is expected to give thrust to production of a wide variety of textiles used in sectors such as healthcare, infrastructure, automobiles, defence, and agriculture.

The ₹1,480-crore Mission, to be implemented from 2020-2021 to 2023-2024, aims at positioning India as a global leader in technical textiles.

Huge imports

“India imports significant quantity of technical textiles worth $16 billion every year. To reverse this trend and to position India as a global leader, a National Technical Textiles Mission is proposed,” she said.

According to K.S. Sundararaman, chairman of the Indian Technical Textiles Association, the size of the technical textile industry in the country is approximately ₹12,000 crore, excluding the hygiene industry. The last time the sector received focus was a few years ago to set up six centres of excellence across the country. With the need to create a domestic base for raw material production, push for manufacture of high end technical textile products, boost investments, and increase per capita consumption, there is a need for a Mission.

Nodal office

“We need to see how this Mission will be implemented. There should be an empowered nodal office that will coordinate all the efforts and make the Mission beneficial to the industry,” he said.

Another major announcement in the Budget, which is expected to give a thrust to the polyester fibre sector, is abolition of anti-dumping duty on PTA (Purified Terephthalic Acid). This is the raw material for production of polyester fibre.

T. Rajkumar, chairman of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said this was one of the long-pending demands of the industry. “Abolition of anti-dumping duty will bring polyester price in India on a par with international price. Polyester will be the future engine of growth for the Indian textile industry.”

The Budget estimates for the textile and clothing sector for 2020-2021 is ₹3,514.79 crore against ₹4,831.48 crore for 2019-2020.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ko9bw7/article30715783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TextileNew,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2020-21-a-boost-for-technical-textiles/article30713794.ece
83,2020/02/01,16-point action plan for agriculture evokes mixed response,"The proposed 16-point action plan to boost agriculture and farmer welfare presented in the Union Budget proposals 2020-21 on Saturday has evoked a mixed response from industry players and farmer outfits.

Expressing disappointment, edible oilseed industry body Solvent Extractors’ Association of India said they expected at least this year the Union Finance Minister will come out with a package of incentives for higher production and productivity of oilseeds to reduce our dependence on import of edible oils.

“The expectation of the industry was higher. We were expecting that the Finance Minister will also announce creation of an “Oilseed Development Fund”. It is disappointing that the above did not reflect in the Budget,” said Atul Chaturvedi, Executive Direstor, SEA.

Terming the Budget as anti-farmer and pro-corporates, the farmer body All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said a nationwide protest would be held on February 13 against the pro-corporate proposals and failure to address the problems of rising peasant debts, cost of inputs and failure to secure profitable sale of crops.

“It was expected that budgetary support will be given to ensure remunerative MSP of at least 50% profit margin over the comprehensive cost of production C2 and PM-AASHA scheme will be furthered. There should have been measures for relief from debts, for compensation for crop loss, protection from stray animals etc. But these have not been touched,”, it said.

The government has budgeted ₹2.83 lakh croresfor agriculture and rural development, which is an increase of only ₹15,000 crore, or 5.6% over ₹2.68 lakh crores budgeted last year. This is less than the rate of inflation, it added.

Vijay Kumar, MD & CEO of the National Commodity Derivatives Exchange, said the village storage scheme by Self-Help Groups (SHGs) shall play a crucial role in farm level warehousing and will help farmers in efficient post-harvest management. “The Exchange is pleased to note that the financing on Negotiable Warehousing Receipts (e-NWR) has crossed more than ₹6,0,00 crore and it will be integrated with National Agriculture Market (e-NAM). The announcements to provide fund allocation of ₹2.83 lakh crore to agriculture, irrigation and rural development will provide impetus in re-energising the sector,” he said in a statement.

84,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Big jump in allocation to MHA with a separate fund for J&K,"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was allocated ₹1,67,250 crore for fiscal 2020-21 when compared with ₹1,19,025 crore allocated in the previous year. The major jump in the Budget for the MHA is due to the setting aside of a separate fund for the newly created Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh. The annual Budget was presented in the Lok Sabha on Saturday by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

‘Less than before’

A total sum of ₹30,757 crore has been allocated to J&K, while Ladakh gets ₹5,958 crore. A senior government official explained that the allocations were less than the previous year’s, when J&K was a State and was entitled to devolution in the form of grants and a share of Central taxes.

According to the 2018-19 Budget of the erstwhile State of J&K, it received ₹47,314 crore revenue from the Centre. Around 70% of J&K’s revenue is borne by Central transfers.

J&K’s special status under Article 370 was revoked by the Parliament on August 6 last year and the State was downgraded and bifurcated into two Union Territories.

The MHA deals with all legislative and Constitutional matters relating to the nine Union Territories.

Delhi and more

Poll-bound Delhi has been allocated ₹1,116 crore in the Budget.

Ms. Sitharaman proposed the setting up of a National Police University and a National Forensic University.

As the work for the Census 2021 has begun, the government has allocated ₹4,278 crore under the head ‘Census Surveys and Statistics’.

The Budget allocated ₹1,126.62 crore for relief on account of natural calamities and ₹842.45 crore for social security and welfare schemes.

Lion’s share

The lion’s share of the MHA’s Budget has gone to paramilitary forces, which bagged a total allocation of ₹92054.53 crore for 2020-21.

85,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Confidence building measures in Budget enthuses industry,"The Union Budget has taken multiple measures that will build the confidence of industry. These include the measures to reduce tax harassment, to enhance contract enforcement, to decriminalise business laws and simplify the processes of tax payment. These measures will considerably improve the business environment in the country.

Besides, the removal of the dividend distribution tax is genuinely commendable, as it removes the double taxation of dividends. This will enhance the rate of return on equity and has been a long-standing demand of industry.

Consumption boost

The Budget has also focused on measures that will have a positive impact on the economy. Consumption boost will be provided by lower rates of personal income tax as also the focus on rural spending. The Finance Minister has rightly stressed the importance of rural infrastructure and credit availability as some of the enablers for generating higher rural incomes. Health and education related spending has also been re-oriented to benefit the weaker sections.

Infrastructure push

For a revival in investment, the Budget has delivered strong measures to accelerate infrastructure building, including highways, railways, airports and ports. Reform to alleviate the financial stress of the power distribution sector is urgently required and has been mentioned as a focus area. To encourage investment in power generation, new investment by domestic companies have been granted the concessional tax rate of 15%.

Encouragingly, the financing of the National Infrastructure Pipeline has been spelt out. Infrastructure finance companies such as IIFCL and NIIF will be leveraging the allocations made in the Budget. This would be a sustainable way of financing infrastructure. In addition, sovereign wealth funds have been granted certain tax exemptions to encourage them to invest in infrastructure.

The Finance Minister has the critical task of making the Budget balance even after making all the allocations required. The economic slowdown in the current year has made this a particularly difficult task. Yet, it is commendable that the fiscal deficit has been reined in at 3.8% of GDP, which is a slippage of 0.5% compared to the target of 3.3%. For the coming year, the Minister has proposed a reduction in the deficit to 3.5%. This will ensure that the government’s borrowing remains in control.

Given that raising tax revenue will likely remain a constraint in the coming year, the Budget has proposed some alternate sources of revenue. These include asset monetisation through sale of highway bundles and corporatization of a major port. The listing of LIC has also been suggested in the Budget. This will provide an exciting opportunity to investors and could bring in significant funds for the government.

In the coming months, the government must take forward the measures announced in the Budget and ensure that they are implemented. For example, the disinvestment target has been set at an ambitious level of ₹2.1 lakh crore. The government must make sure that it is realised unlike in the current year when only a small percentage of the target was raised.

The Economic Survey that was released on Friday talked about job creation through development of the manufacturing sector. This would require sector-specific measures as well as an effort to improve the overall efficiency of manufacturing. To this end, the Minister has said that a National Logistics Policy will be announced. Measures to expedite the creation of the industrial corridors and parks are needed to enhance manufacturing efficiency within the country.

The emphasis given to technology and innovation is critical to ensure that India remains competitive in the emerging economic landscape. The vision of a technologically enabled India now needs to be implemented.

86,2020/02/01,Union Budget 2020-21: A budget delinked from polls,"For those looking for any angles in the Union Budget referring to the ongoing electoral cycle in Delhi, there was a bit of a kerfuffle when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the tax rates were being revised downwards for certain slabs. But once the finer details came out, that search too ended.

This was a budget that was delinked from polls, and BJP spokespersons who were to appear on TV debates were told to keep the focus on “simplification and transparency” rather than any big ticket idea that caught the political imagination.

The tax breaks present an either/or option, which weighs in a non exemption regime with a lower tax liability with the choice of going with a tax regime with exemptions and a higher rate. It is a blessing with riders and hence, again, difficult to sell politically.

The larger picture projected on the budget by the party is that it continues the thrust on infrastructure announced by Ms Sitharaman earlier, with a step towards amalgamating the “infrastructure pipeline” with a single window clearance of investment in these projects. This, it is hoped will help get projects off the ground and completed.

For the rural economy too, a 16-point action plan talks of getting the produce out from field to market through Kisan Rail, Udan and warehouses to be set up via Public-Private Partnership (PPP), but the much expected hike in the Prime Minister’s Kisan Samman Nidhi was a no-show. What was announced was an allocation of Rs 2.83 lakh crore for agriculture and allied activities, irrigation and rural development. Of this, Rs 1.60 lakh crore was for agriculture and allied activities alone (a jump from Rs 1.52 lakh crore announced in the interim budget).

Allocations to the rural development ministry also saw a marginal increase from last year, from Rs 1,19,000 crore to Rs 1,22, 000 crore, with the largest chunk (Rs 61,500 crore) reserved for the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), once referred by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “monument to the failures of the UPA government”.

Employment generation

Employment generation has been the bane of the Modi government for more than a couple of years now. But even here, there were no handouts, except a year’s extension for start-ups and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) for restructuring.

The announcement that there would be a stake sale of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the crown jewel of the Public Sector Enterprises by the government, while being a bold move will be hard to sell politically.

With no reference to any State election, what then was the big picture? According to a BJP leader, it kept to Prime Minister Modi’s core economic beliefs that there will be no bailouts for the rich, no riderless handouts, a clean-up of processes and regulations with tinkering on the margins.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/1cexjf/article30713359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-UNIONBUDGET-AP,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/union-budget-2020-21-a-budget-delinked-from-polls/article30713318.ece
87,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | A Budget that will spur long-term growth,"The expectations of the Corporate India from this Budget were very high. The Budget meets the expectations in certain areas and falls short in certain other areas. The primary need of the hour is how to revive demand. By and large the supply side was taken care of by many steps which were taken post July 5 till before the Budget. I think the Budget could have taken a few more measures for immediate revival of demand. For example, the Fiscal deficit of 3.5%, though more than 3.3 of last year, may have gone a little higher to 3.8%. This could have put a little bit more money in the hands of the government to increase expenditure and therefore revived demand.

While the overall immediate impact on demand may not be stimulated by this Budget, but what it scores heavily on is mid to long term. The kind of things that have been talked about — the three themes, Aspirational India, Economic Development for all and Caring Society — these are themes that will augur well for our country.

I personally see these themes as longer-term stimuli and a blueprint for the future to make India a global manufacturing base. The structural changes in the way things are being done may not be enough to have an impact tomorrow, but will definitely give strong impetus to the economy and so you could look at the glass as half full or half empty depending on what you want to see.

For the first time during the Union Budget presentation, I heard things like — Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet Of Things (IoT) and the engineer in me hopes that these are all well-intentioned and hopefully will be significantly supported as we move along.

I particularly liked the 16-point agenda the FM targeted under rural development. The FM spoke about doubling farmers’ income by 2022, which augurs well for the farmers. Some of the measures outlined — ranging from solar pumps for farmers to improving the agriculture– warehousing and cold storage to the water sufficiency measures for over 100 water-stressed districts — all augur well for the future.

A lot, of course, would be dependent on proficient execution by the government. This focus on the rural and farm sector, I feel, will help facilitate the smooth functioning in the sector with a rise in farm income. Addressing these issues like water conservation, improving yields etc., coupled with the ₹2.83 lakh crore budgetary allocation for agriculture, irrigation and allied activities and rural development all augur well for the future.

I do hope that the Budget does hold true on its promise for economic development for all ushering in a period of true growth and inclusion for all.

For tractors, demand will be good in February and March and April to July will be dull months. Slowly demand will pick up by September. In Auto, we will see challenging times till the festive season and we will be happy with high single digit growth.

As far as electric vehicles (EVs) are concerned, the government has done enough and now it is up to us to make EVs happen. Somehow we need to enable charging infrastructure. One thing that the government could have done is remove import duty on lithium ion cells.

Where the Budget perhaps should have done more is how to revive demand. As we have been saying all along, the biggest concern right now for the economy is how to get the demand cycle going. This is definitely is a Budget that will spur mid-long term growth.

88,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | A healthy Budget that future-proofs India’s growth story,"Union Budget 2020 can be described as one well-intended to boost the economy, promote inclusive progress and that bodes well for the new decade. In particular, the three overarching themes, to improve standard of living, boost economic development for all, and building a humane and compassionate society, will certainly make the world’s largest democracy a model nation.

It is said that there can be no progress without farmers and that is a definitive in an agrarian nation like India. In light of this reality, the Budget demonstrated the government’s passionate will to double farmers’ income, support water stressed districts, help them monetise barren lands by converting them into solar farms, Kisan trains for perishables and many such initiatives, which reaffirm commitment to nurture the soul of India.

Encouraging impetus

Likewise, the impetus on education and skill development was encouraging. The Budget allocated ₹99,300 crore for the education sector in 2021, including ₹3,000 crore for skill development. These allocations are valuable to build a task force ready to serve an ageing world, boost employment and at large, make India future-ready. In addition, the IND SAT exam for students of Asia and Africa to promote “study in India” programme would also boost India’s stature as a destination for higher education.

Budget 2020 also had several noteworthy measures for the health sector of India. The allocation of ₹69,000 crore in this budget is slightly up from last year and of this, around ₹6,400 crore would be for the AB-PMJAY (Ayushman Bharat-Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) scheme. It includes an impetus to this flagship scheme as more than 112 aspirational districts have been identified, including Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, wherein empanelled hospitals would be set up to treat the economically weaker sections of India. A well-established fact is that addition of hospitals fuels job creation, so this would also provide job opportunities to youth in these identified districts. Moreover, a viability gap funding window is going to be set up to cover hospitals, for the priority districts that do not have hospitals empanelled under Ayushman Bharat. Similarly, availability of medicines is critical to a patient’s treatment and they do add up to a considerable part of the cost of care. Hence, extending Jan Aushadhi stores to every district is a prudent measure.

Qualified doctors

There is an acute shortage of qualified medical doctors, both general practitioners and specialists in our country. To come closer to the World Health Organisation mandate of numbers of doctors to population, India needs to at least double the number of doctors. So the Budget’s proposal to attach a medical college to a district hospital in public-private partnership mode will certainly help India move towards this objective.

Despite a lot of progress made so far, almost a half million lives are lost to tuberculosis every year in India and according to estimates, there are a million more cases that remain undiagnosed. The Budget’s plan to eliminate tuberculosis from India by 2025 was pathbreaking and the timeline is also five years ahead of the global SDG (Sustainable Development Goals) target.

Averting mortality

The Budget outlay also sought to expand Mission Indradhanush, the universal immunisation programme, with five more vaccines. In addition, there was ample focus on the determinants of health, which primarily include clean drinking water, sanitation and nutrition under the aegis of the Jal Jeevan Mission, Swachh Bharat and Poshan Abhiyan, schemes that will work to avert preventable mortalities and also improve our IMR (Infant Mortality Rate) and MMR (Maternal Mortality Ratio) indices.

The health sector is among the largest service sectors in India and with greater impetus on skill development, it could address the need-gap for resources in the country and across the world. Therefore, the Budget’s announcement of reduced taxes for those who have no exemptions will certainly be beneficial for the millions of youth employed in healthcare.

89,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Taxpayer opting for new tax regime to forego deductions on PF, children’s tuition fee, insurance","Aimed at spurring consumption demand and offering some relief to taxpayers, especially from the middle class, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a new personal income tax regime with reduced rates for those earning upto ₹15 lakh.

The tax rate for those earning between ₹5 lakh to ₹7. 5 lakh has been lowered from 20% to 10%, and for incomes between ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh to 15% from 20%. Similarly, tax rates have been lowered from 30% to 20% for those earning between ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh, and to 25% for those with incomes from ₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh.

Tax payers can, however, opt for the new rates, if they give up almost all tax exemptions and deductions they enjoy under the current regime, akin to the conditional tax rate cuts announced for corporates last September.

Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said even those opting for the lower rates will retain tax benefits on payouts at the time of retirement like gratuity, employees’ PF and NPS accumulations; employers’ contributions to EPFO, the National Pension System or superannuation payments (upto ₹7.5 lakh), amounts received on VRS (upto ₹5 lakh).

But most exemptions used by salaried employees on account of leave travel allowance, house rent allowance, housing loan repayments, savings instruments like PPF and LIC, as well as the standard deduction will cease to be available.

The Finance Minister said this could result in savings of ₹78,000 for someone earning ₹15 lakh and not availing any incentives in the existing regime.

Also Read Govt intends to remove all income tax exemptions in long run: FM

Tax practitioners noted the new rates regime would only be attractive for non-salaried taxpayers or those who don’t avail any exemptions as of now. For many taxpayers who avail benefits, the difference in tax outgo may not be substantial.

Income (per annum) Proposed Tax Rate Old Tax Rate Upto ₹2.5 lakh No tax No tax ₹2.5 lakh-₹5 lakh No tax 5% ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh 10% 20% ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh 15% 20% ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh 20% 30% ₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh 25% 30% Above ₹15 lakh 30% 30%

“It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Income-Tax law without taking help from professionals,” the Minister said. However, most individuals may still need accountants’ help to determine if moving to the lower tax rates would benefit them.

The Finance Bill has also proposed three major changes to prevent tax abuse by citizens that don’t pay taxes anywhere in the world. The changes are a reduction in the number of days that an Indian citizen can be granted non-resident status for tax purposes from 182 to 120; citizens who don’t pay taxes anywhere will be deemed to be a resident of India, and the definition of ‘not ordinary resident’ has been tightened.

“Now in order to become a non-resident, one has to stay out of the country 240 days,” said Mr. Pandey. “In many cases, we have found that some people are resident of no country in the world but stay a certain number of days in different parts of the world. If any Indian citizen is not a resident of any country, then he will be deemed to be resident in India and then his worldwide income will be taxed,” he added.

It’s still not clear if this will apply to many Indian expats working in the UAE and other countries. “We will have to wait and see if this will apply to those working in the UAE as technically, they tax people but the tax rate is zero,” said Amarpal Chadha, tax partner & India mobility leader, EY.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vub1av/article29725213.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Tax-interactive,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-taxpayer-opting-for-new-tax-regime-to-forego-deductions-on-pf-childrens-tuition-fee-insurance/article30712967.ece

“In order to widen and deepen the tax net by bringing participants of e-commerce (sellers) within tax net, it is proposed to insert a new section 194-O in the Act so as to provide for a new levy of TDS at the rate of 1%,” as per 2020-21 Budget documents.

Also, consequential amendments are being proposed in section 197 (for lower TDS), in section 204 (to define person responsible for paying any sum) and in section 206AA (to provide for tax deduction at 5% in non-PAN/Aadhaar cases).

The amendment will take effect from April 1, 2020.

The document explained that e-commerce operator — an entity owning, operating or managing the digital platform — will have to deduct one per cent TDS on the gross amount of sales or service or both.

E-commerce companies were yet to respond on queries seeking inputs on the levy.

This provision will not apply in cases where the seller’s gross amount of sales during the previous year through the e-commerce operator is less than ₹5 lakh and has furnished his PAN or Aadhaar number.

The proposal, contained in the Finance Bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha on Saturday, also seeks to withdraw similar income tax exemptions that had been extended to the Chairman, Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and its Members.

In the case of the CEC and the two Election Commissioners, the Government has decided to make taxable all benefits extended to them as are applicable to a Judge of the Supreme Court under Chapter IV of the Supreme Court Judges (Conditions of Service) Act, 1958, and associated rules.

Under the 1958 Act, each Judge of the Supreme Court is entitled to an official car and 200 litres of fuel every month or the actual consumption of fuel per month, whichever is less, and a sumptuary allowance of ₹34,000 per month. Now, the CEC and the two Election Commissioners will have to pay income tax on this from the assessment year 2021-22.

92,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Meagre defence hike threatens military modernisation,"The allocation for defence in the Union budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday saw a marginal hike compared to last year which does not cater to the inflation and currency exchange fluctuations. The allocation for 2020-21 stands at ₹3.37lakh crore excluding defence pensions which stood at ₹1.34 lakh crore.

(Red denotes a fall in expenditure, while green is for an increase. The darker the red, the more the amount allocated has decreased; the darker the green, the more the amount allocated has increased)

The total allocation for defence in 2020-21 including pensions stands at ₹4.71 lakh crore compared to ₹4.31 lakh crore last year. There is a steep rise in defence pensions, 13.5%, from ₹1.18 lakh crore in revised estimates to ₹1.33 lakh crore. Excluding defence pensions, the allocation this year is ₹3.37 lakh crore which is 5.67% higher compared to the budget estimate of last year and just 1.8% higher compared to the revised estimates of 2019-20 which was ₹3.31 lakh crore.

The hike doesn't not fully cover inflation and currency fluctuations and is meagre considering the mega defence tenders recently signed and several lined up as part of military modernisation. Also, this doesn’t even cover the revenue expenditure and committed liabilities in some cases as was flagged by the services after the interim budget last year.

“National security is the top priority of this government,” Ms. Sitharaman said in her budget speech but there was no mention of the defence allocation in her over two hour long budget speech. The defence spending for 2020-21, excluding pensions, accounts for 1.5% of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

The hike is a worrysome scenario for the much needed military modernisation as India has signed several big ticket defence deals in the last few years and the current capital allocation doesn’t even cater for payments to the committed liabilities. Even last year, the services had to roll on some of their committed liabilities and they would further accumulate this year.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) got 38% of the ₹1.13 lakh crore capital component which comes to ₹43,281 crore, but in real terms, the capital allocation for the IAF has gone down from the revised estimates of 2019-20 which was ₹44,869 crore. In comparison, last year, the IAF had committed liabilities, payments for deals already signed for, of over ₹47,000 crore which was more than its entire capital allocation even then. The IAF has signed several major deals including 36 Rafale jets from France, S-400 air defence systems from Russia, Apache attack helicopters and Chinook heavy lift helicopters from the US among others.

The resource constraint is likely to delay several multi-billion dollar deals for fighter jets, submarines and helicopters being processed through the Strategic Partnership model.

Commenting on the defence allocation, Commodore C. Uday Bhaskar (Retd), Director of Society for Policy Studies, said two signals can be inferred from the budget. One emerges from the fact that the Finance Minister did not even mention defence allocation in her speech, which suggests that national security is clearly not a high priority, he told The Hindu.

“Second, the inventory modernisation and acquisition programs of the armed forces will be on hold for another year — and it is evident that despite all the earnest rhetoric, enhancing military capability is not on the radar for Modi 2.0 due to other considerations including the budget deficit. This will have an adverse bearing on the trans-border military capability of India which is in dire need of fiscal infusion, but this is now on hold,” he said.

Finance Commission

The Services and the Defence Ministry have made a representation to the Finance Commission for additional allocation to meet the shortfall. In its interim report, the Commission observed that there is merit in ensuring a predictable and stable flow of funds for defence and internal security and this will receive appropriate consideration in their final report.

The interim report said that to generate additional resources, the Defence Ministry has proposed disinvestment of defence public sector undertakings, levying of a cess, monetisation of surplus land and other assets, as well as the issuance of tax-free defence bonds and the creation of a non-lapsable fund. Finance Commission will set up an expert group to examine proposals, it added.+

The total allocation for defence in 2020-21 including pensions stands at ₹4.71 lakh crore compared to ₹4.31 lakh crore last year.

Of the ₹4.71 lakh crore, ₹3.37lakh crore is revenue and capital allocation and defence pensions is ₹1.34 lakh crore.

There is a steep rise in defence pensions year on year from ₹1.18 lakh crore from revised estimate to ₹1.33 lakh crore this year.

The allocation of ₹3.37 lakh crore is 5.67% higher compared to the budget estimate of last year which was ₹3.18lakh crore and just 1.8% higher compared to the revised estimates of 2019-20 which was ₹3.31 lakh crore.

95,2020/02/01,"Budget 2020 | Government has given up reviving economy or accelerating growth rate, says Chidambaram","Reacting to the Union Budget, Former Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said the government had given up on reviving the economy or accelerating the growth rate, and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi stated that there was no strategic idea or anything concrete in the Budget to counter the growing unemployment rate.

At a press conference at the Congress headquarters, Mr. Chidambaram said, “The government has given up on reviving the economy or accelerating the growth rate or promoting private investment or increasing efficiency or creating jobs or winning a greater share of world trade,”

When asked to rate the budget on a scale of 10, he said, “There is both 1 and 0 in 10, you can chose between the two.”

Ms Sitharaman's speech completely missed the mark, he said. “The government is in complete denial that the economy faces a grave macro economic challenge and the growth rate has declined in six successive quarters. There is nothing in the Budget that leads us to believe that growth will revive in 2020-21. The claim of 6 to 6.5. per cent growth next year is astonishing and even irresponsible.”

The Indian economy was demand constrained and investment starved and both these challenges have not been acknowledged by Ms. Sitharaman. “I think this budget is also done nothing for three job creating sectors - mining, construction and manufacturing,” Mr. Chidambaram said.

There was nothing in the budget to tackle Consumer Price Index inflation, which is currently over seven per cent and food inflation, which was over 10 per cent since subsidies on food and fertiliser had been reduced. “The government does not believe in reforms and certainly not in structural reforms, The FM has outright rejected every — and I repeat, every — reform idea contained in the Economic Survey. Did the FM read the Economic Survey? Was the Chief Economic Adviser privy to the contents of the Budget speech? I think the answer to both questions is in the negative,” he said.

Ms. Sitharaman's budget speech that was two hours and 40 minutes long had “multiple themes, segments and programmes” leaving the listener dazed and confused. “I am pretty certain that even the most loyal BJP MP or supporter cannot latch on to any idea or statement in the Budget speech and take it to the people,” he said. If the ongoing programmes had failed the people, how can throwing more (or in some cases less) money into the ongoing programmes change anything, he asked.

The income tax relief offered in the Budget were merely “crumbs” thrown at those in the lower tax bracket. The proposed disinvestment in Life Insurance corporation was highly debatable and it was wrong to assume that every public sector must go through a process of disinvestment.

He said that since conditions in external markets were not favourable and a global slowdown was predicted, tax exemptions on Sovereign Wealth Funds would have a negligble impact. He also criticised the government for abolishing Dividend Distribution Tax. “It was undoubtedly one of the most efficient taxes levied by the Government of India. There was no scope for innovation. It has been abolished as a sop for corportates and now they will have to go after the recipient of the dividend. Will they succeed in collecting all the taxes is a moot point but I'm pretty certain there will be a loss of revenue,” he added.

It was hollow: Rahul Gandhi

Mr. Gandhi told reporters, “The main issues confronting this country today are unemployment and the situation as far as the economy is concerned. I did not see any concrete idea, any strategic idea that would help our youngsters get jobs. I saw a lot of tactical stuff, redundant things, I did not see any central idea.” The Budget described the government quite well, which was of “all talking” and nothing concrete. “The government's approach is visible in this budget. It did not have anything in it. It was hollow.” The Finance Minister did not give any details on how growing unemployment rate would be tackled, he stated.

In a tweet, Mr. Gandhi said, “Our youth want jobs. Instead they got the longest budget speech in parliamentary history that said absolutely nothing of consequence. PM & FM both looked like they have absolutely no clue what to do next”.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/r0rwcn/article30712771.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHIDAMBARAMCONFERENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-government-has-given-up-reviving-economy-or-accelerating-growth-rate-says-chidambaram/article30712287.ece

The benchmark Sensex nosedived nearly 1,100 points during intra-day trades as market participants felt that the government has not taken concrete steps to revive the slowing economy.

The 30-share Sensex, which was trading around 100 points higher before the finance minister began her speech, erased all its gains and dipped in the red even as the budget proposed removal of dividend distribution tax (DDT) for companies and lower income tax regime for individuals who forego the existing exemptions.

At the fag end of the trading session, the Sensex fell below the psychological level to 40,000 to touch a low of 39,631.24, a fall of 1,092.25 points. The barometer settled the day at 39,735.53, shedding 987.96 points or 2.43%.

The broader Nifty ended the day at 11,661.85, down 300.25 points or 2.51%.

“Market expectations were high on capital market reforms which have not materialised and to that extent there could be some near term disappointment,” said Jaideep Hansraj, Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer, Kotak Securities.

While the biggest loser among the Sensex pack was ITC, which lost nearly 7%, financials witnessed across the board selling with heavyweights like HDFC, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and HDFC Bank all losing significant ground on Saturday.

Interestingly, stocks of listed insurance entities lost heavy ground as market was abuzz with talks that the new income tax regime that individuals can opt for by foregoing the existing deductions could impact the sales of insurance products that are typically taken for tax saving purposes.

While the shares of ICICI Prudential Life lost nearly 11%, SBI Life Insurance was down a little over 10%. Even HDFC Life Insurance Life ended the day 6% lower.

“Though the abolition of dividend distribution tax (DDT) looks like a positive from this budget, it still addresses only the supply side and not the demand side,” said Dharmesh Kant, Head - Retail Research, India Nivesh.

“There is little or rather nothing in the budget which can boost consumption. The markets which were already reeling under the pressure of the coronavirus attack will further sink owing to an insipid budget,” he added.

The budget recommends a five-year tax holiday on Esopss, a 10- year tax exemption for startups with under-₹100 crore turnover and also talks of a seed fund to push new businesses.

India is the third biggest startup ecosystem in the world and the government has been focused on pushing innovative startups through policy interventions for some years now.

“The finance minster has delivered a fantastic budget for startups. The measures announced on Esops, taxation and seed fund will infuse tremendous energy into the ecosystem,” Indian Angel Network chairman Saurabh Srivastava said.

He said the commitment to having no harassment will also boost the confidence of entrepreneurs.

Restructuring the taxation on Esops is a great breather along with definition of turnover for scaled startups doing good work, said Paynearby chief executive Anand Kumar Bajaj.

“The ESOPs always has been a very strong mechanism for start-ups to incentivize, attract and retain high performing talent. The government proposal would allow startups to leverage ESOPs more effectively,” trading platform Connect2India CEO Pawan Gupta commented.

Anuj Golecha, co-founder for the platform Venture Catalysts said the ecosystem has reasons to be satisfied with the budget announcements.

“A dedicated investment clearance cell for providing end-to- end facilitation and support including pre-investment advisory, information on land banks and quicker clearance of funds at the state-level will boost the entrepreneurship culture,” he said.

Currently the paperwork and the channels to engage with both pre and post investments are huge and the one-stop clearance would allow entrepreneurs more time to focus on their business, the Connect2India CEO observed.

Harsh Jain, co-founder of Groww, said the move on the Esops will encourage more startups to get incorporated, and make it easier for them to attract and retain good talent.

The budget also proposes to provide early life funding, including a seed fund to support ideation and development of early stage startups.

“The proposed seed funding support for ‘ideation and development’ of early-stage startups would encourage more people to take the entrepreneurship plunge as well as support the existing startups,” Gupta said.

Terming the startups as “engines of growth”, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the present Esop taxation leads to cash-flow problem for the employees who do not sell shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the long-term.

“To give a boost to the start-up ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest,” she said.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/1cmamr/article30711939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STARTUPS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/budget-2020-startups-hail-tax-changes-say-will-help-attract-retain-talent/article30711940.ece

The government gave a substantial hike of ₹291.42 crore to its flagship Khelo India programme for development of sports at the grassroot and youth level, which meant that most of the other heads got reduced allocation in an Olympic year.

The highest reduction was for National Sports Federations with ₹245.00 crore being allocated in the union budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, ₹55 crore less than the revised ₹300.85 for 2019-20.

As far as incentives for sportspersons are concerned, the budget has proposed to slash the amount from ₹111 crore to ₹70 crore. The budget for National Sports Development Fund also got reduced to ₹50.00 from the earlier ₹77.15 crore.

The government also reduced the allocation to Sports Authority of India (SAI) from the revised ₹615 crore to ₹500 crore. The SAI is the nodal organisation to manage nationals camps, provide infrastructure, equipment and other logistics to the country’s sportspersons.

The allocation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games-SAI stadia renovation was also slashed to ₹75 crore from ₹96 crore last year.

National Welfare Fund for Sportspersons will continue to get the same amount of ₹2 crore as earlier, while, at ₹50 crore, there was also no change in the allocation for the enhancement of sports facilities in Jammu and Kashmir.

Laxmi Bai National Institute of Physical Education will, however, get ₹55 crore, ₹5 crore more than the last budget.

104,2020/02/01,Budget 2020: Income tax slabs lowered for those who forgo exemptions,"In a proposal to simplify the personal income tax regime, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in the Union Budget 2020 speech, said the income tax rates would be “significantly reduced” for those who forgo reliefs and exemptions and the new rates would be optional.

According to the proposal, those with an income between ₹5 lakh and ₹7.5 lakh, can now pay 10% instead of the present 20%, while those with an income between ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh, will see a reduced tax rate of 15% instead of 20%.

Similarly, for income between ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh, the tax is currently 30% that is now being brought down to 20%. For those earning between ₹12.5-15 lakh will be charged 25%. Those earning above ₹15 lakh will continue to pay 30%.

Accordingly, a person earning Rs 15 lakh per anum and not availing any deductions will pay ₹1.95 lakh tax in place of ₹2.73 lakh now. Those earning upto ₹5 lakh in a year will pay no tax.

Income (per annum) Proposed Tax Rate Old Tax Rate Upto ₹2.5 lakh No tax No tax ₹2.5 lakh-₹5 lakh No tax 5% ₹5 lakh to ₹7.5 lakh 10% 20% ₹7.5 lakh to ₹10 lakh 15% 20% ₹10 lakh to ₹12.5 lakh 20% 30% ₹12.5 lakh to ₹15 lakh 25% 30% Above ₹15 lakh 30% 30%

“More than 100 exemptions of different nature are currently provided in the IT Act. I have removed around 70 of them in the new regime. We will review the rest of the exemptions in coming years,” she added.+

Opting for the lower tax rates would mean that you will have to give up on exemption such as leave travel concession, house rent allowance, standard deduction, deduction for entertainment allowance and employment/professional tax, interest under section 24 in respect of self-occupied or vacant property, any deduction under chapter VIA (like section 80C, 80CCC, 80CCD, 80D, 80DD, 80DDB, 80E, 80EE, 80EEA, 80EEB, 80G, 80GG, 80GGA, 80GGC, 80IA, 80-IAB, 80-IAC, 80-IB, 80-IBA, etc).

Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav said these vans, with a carrying capacity of 17 tonnes each for transportation of highly-perishable parcel traffic, were developed and procured through the Rail Coach Factory at Kapurthala.

“We are already working on the announcement made by the Finance Minister. With her proposal, there is a renewed impetus for us,” he said.

Pilot project

Mr. Yadav also said temperature-controlled perishable cargo centres were commissioned at Ghazipur Ghat (U.P.), New Azadpur (Adarsh Nagar, Delhi) and Raja ka Talab (U.P.) as a pilot project under the Kisan Vision Project by Container Corporation of India Limited (CONCOR) through a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiative. Another project is under construction at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra’s Nasik.

Approval has been granted to the Central Railside Warehousing Corporation to develop temperature-controlled storage facilities at Fatuha and Mancheswar. Cold storage facility has also been developed at Dadri.

“The Fresh and Healthy Enterprise Limited (FHEL) has been redeveloped as the Agriculture Logistics Centre at Rai, Sonepat. This facility is CONCOR’s 100% owned subsidiary, developed on a land measuring 16.4 acres,” Mr. Yadav said.

He added that 98 reefer (ventilated, insulated) rail containers with a carrying capacity of 12 tonnes per container were procured through CONCOR for movement of fruits and vegetables to different parts of the country.

“There are no operational issues with the running of these vans. We needed infrastructure in the form of cold storage warehouses at both the source and destination centres.

124,2020/02/01,"CAA-NRC-NPR, part of Hindutva project: N. Ram","N. Ram, Chairman of The Hindu Group Publishing Private Limited, said on Saturday that it would be a serious mistake to see the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register as a mere distraction from the current economic crisis. He said it was part of the larger Hindutva project being pushed by the BJP government.

He made the remarks at the inaugural session of the two-day Mumbai Collective, during a panel discussion, on the ‘Rising Tide in Indian Politics’, with Prof. Gopal Guru, Editor of the Economic and Political Weekly.

‘Serious mistake’

“We would be making a serious mistake if we see this as merely a diversionary tactic because this is a project that they long had in mind. This is a project of Hindutva,” Mr. Ram said. He highlighted that the citizenship issue had never been part of the debates in the Constituent Assembly and had only featured in the debates post partition, when Hindus who had come from Pakistan were labelled refugees, but Muslims who went to Pakistan and came back were called migrants and were treated with suspicion by several members of the Constituent Assembly.

Prof. Guru said the protests were producing a new kind of politics and giving a new dimension to politics. “They are actually bringing us back into the close relationship with the Constitution. That is the constitutional consciousness we are getting from these protests,” he said. Hardly anyone used to discuss the Constitution a few months ago.

The panel was chaired by Irfan Engineer of the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism. He said the incidents of communal violence had come down, but that wasn’t a good thing because structured communal violence was being perpetrated by the state.

Mr. Ram said it needed to be seen whether the current wave of protests against the CAA-NRC-NPR was truly a rising tide or a reaction. “At the end of the day, I am very optimistic about what is ahead. There is nothing for us to lose. We have to go ahead without doubts, without inhibition, while adhering to the completely peaceful nature of this mass upsurge,” he said.

He urged the audience to read debates on the Constitution, especially the last speech of B.R. Ambedkar in the Constituent Assembly, wherein he highlighted the importance of equality, liberty and fraternity and how the three could not be divorced from each other. “The relationship [among the three] goes to the heart of the present political situation, the upsurge we are talking about.”

Calling the NRC in Assam a horror story, he said that of the nearly 1.9 million people omitted from the list, around 1.2 million were Hindus; this was the real problem for the BJP. “Amit Shah, before and after he became Home Minister, went on record that this was going to be a nationwide project,” Mr Ram said. He also quoted the BJP’s manifesto to say the party would implement a pan-India NRC.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/z3q5ut/article30715540.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-N-Ram-NATION-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-nrc-npr-part-of-hindutva-project/article30715541.ece
125,2020/02/01,CAA a ‘clear violation’ of Indian Constitution: Amnesty,"The Amnesty International has told the U.S. lawmakers that the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) stands in “clear violation” of the Constitution of India and international human rights law and “legitimises discrimination” on the basis of religion.

The Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny any citizenship rights but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

Amnesty International Asia Pacific Advocacy Manager Francisco Bencosme made the remarks during a testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights and International Organizations and House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee.

The Act legitimises discrimination on the basis of religion and stands in clear violation of the Constitution of India and international human rights law, he said.

India has asserted that the legislation was enacted following the due process.

“The CAA is an internal matter of India. It has been adopted through due process and democratic means,” spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar has said, fending off criticism against it.

Defending the CAA, Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month said the law is not about taking away citizenship, it is about giving citizenship.

“We must all know that any person of any religion from any country of the world who believes in India and its Constitution can apply for Indian citizenship through due process. There’s no problem in that,” he said.

“Government is ready to talk to protestors of Shaheen Bagh but then it should be in a structured form and the Narendra Modi governmen is ready to communicate with them and clear all their doubts they have against CAA,” he wrote on Twitter.

Mr. Prasad also shared a link of a TV debate aired on India TV in which he had participated and where a question was put to him on the lack of communication from the government with the Shaheen Bagh protesters.

“If you want a government representative to talk, then there should be a structured request from Shaheen Bagh which says all the people there want to talk on the subject,” Mr Prasad replied on air. He made it clear that Shaheen Bagh was not the place to hold talks. “What if someone goes there and is mistreated,” he said.

127,2020/02/01,Nagaland Deputy CM Patton lands in soup,"Nagaland’s civil service aspirants and a students’ union have written to Governor R.N. Ravi to take action against Deputy Chief Minister Y. Patton for claiming to have manipulated interviews of the Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC).

They have also asked NPSC Chairman T.S. Angami to resign on moral grounds since “the unemployed youth of Nagaland have been studying hard to clear the competitive exam only to learn it is the Deputy CM who decides the result”.

Mr. Patton, also the BJP Legislature Party leader, denied having made the claim at a conference of the Lotha Students’ Union at Maratchu in the Wokha district on January 28. He said his speech in the Lotha tribal dialect had been misinterpreted to mean he facilitated backdoor appointment when “I only stressed NPSC could not be manipulated in a different context”.

In a letter to the Governor on behalf of the civil service aspirants, former president of Sumi (tribe) Students’ Union Vicca S. Aye said they have a verified audio of the speech in which he asked aspirants to approach him after clearing the written examinations for the NPSC.

“He said he will be able to manage the interview and help the aspirants get through,” Mr. Aye wrote, requesting the Governor to issue a statement of condemnation and penalise Mr. Patton.

The Deputy Chief Minister also rubbed the Lotha community on the wrong by allegedly referring to the people of Ralan area in the district as ‘Miya’ for not having voted for him in the Assembly election. Bordering Assam, Ralan had in 2014 seen violent clashes between the local Nagas and the Adivasis mostly employed as tea plantation workers.

“As a Lotha Naga, he [Mr. Patton] should have some self-respect and know who the Lothas are. The people of Ralan area demand an unconditional apology,” said Hayithung Kikon, chairman of the Ralan Area Lotha Hoho.

Hoho is the traditional body specific to each Naga tribe.

128,2020/02/01,Budget 2020 | Should India have taken more risk?,"Budgets are becoming more an indicator of policy orientation rather than unleashing big bang reforms. If we take that charitable view, there is lots that meets the eye. Three themes laid out by the FM on Aspirational India, Economic Development for All and Caring Society raised the expectation for the afternoon. But was there enough to pull the country out this slowdown was the question in our mind.

Farm economy occupied the centre stage for Aspirational India and rightfully so, given the degree of stress that that part of the world is going through. The 16-point agenda is possibly the most comprehensive detailing of policy objectives, that included farm market liberalisation, focus on 100 water stressed districts, solar power usage, village storage system, better marketing of horticultural produce, NBFC & Cooperative Banks getting NABARD refinance for agricultural funding are clear wins.

Wellness, the second pillar of Aspirational India, got an allocation of ₹69,000 crore with emphasis on private/public partnership of creating hospital infrastructure is clearly in the right direction but given the dismal state of health care, this is a sector that could with more focus. Continued focus on Swatchh Bharat & piped water supply with attendant budgetary support again are the right focus.

Education, the third pillar of Aspirational India, needs to deal with an India that by 2030 has the largest working population on the planet. Announcement of New Education Policy is welcome, but content needs to be seen. ECB/FDI for education is positive. Given the capital starved sector and given the opportunity of also making India an education destination in emerging markets, this step is welcome.

FM’s second theme on Economic Development for All was not inspiring. Industrial Development in terms of End-to-End Clearance Portals, Boosting Manufacturing in Electronics, 5 New Smart Cities to manufacture Networked Products were some of the mentions. Clearly more work requires to be done to move India into the global supply chain and the promise of Make in India and potential of high employment remains a distant dream.

Infrastructure development, the second pillar of the FM’s Economic Development theme also went along expected lines. Fast track clearance of road projects, public/private participation in railways, inland water development, 100 more Udaan type airports, and electrification of discom reforms are worthy mention. Very little impetus on real estate sector, which is in deep distress. Again, infrastructure, that creates huge employment and is a crying need for the country could have done with bolder initiatives.

The third pillar of FM’s Economic Development theme, the New Economy had the right sound bytes on AI/ML/fintech/policy on data centre parks/quantum technology. These were policy initiatives but without substantive investment data except Bharat Net, the fibre-to-home initiative which will cover 100,000 gram panchayats at cost of ₹6,000crore, clearly a sound investment.

Caring Society, the third theme of the FM focused on Women & Child as its first pillar. Gross enrolment of girls across all stages of schooling exceeds boys is clearly a worthwhile achievement. Six lakh anganwadi workers now upload nutritional data of 10 crore households through smart phones is supported by ₹35,000 crore allocation to nutrition-related programme is welcome. No manual cleaning of wewers and technology, legislation & funding to support is vital to get rid of this social evil. Culture and tourism again is a big employment generator did not receive the attention that it deserves and neither did climate change where other nations are doing so much more.

Governance was the second theme under Caring Society, and decriminalization of Offences under Companies Act is a laudable move we have long advocated to attract foreign investors. Debt recovery entitlement for NBFCs, privatization of IDBI Bank were some of the noteworthy mentions. MSME, the largest employer by sector was paid lip service with the Factor Regulation Act being announced that will allow NBFC to participate in the factoring market. Financial markets, specifically bond market had some interesting announcement. Enabling credit default swap through netting regulations, deepening market, participation of the Debt ETF are important but may not move the needle. Fiscal Deficit of 3.8% for FY20 is within the allowable 0.5% variation from budgeted 3.3% definitely brought comfort on fiscal discipline. But given the $5 trillion vision, more was expected here.

There was more to cheer for in Part 2 of the budget. Given the slowdown of consumption, reduction of Individual Taxes for income brackets ₹5-15Lacs resulting in ₹40,000cr revenue loss is positive for consumption. Dividend Distribution Tax abolition & lower corporate tax rates for new power generation company as well as 100% tax exemption for sovereign wealth funds in infrastructure & other notified sector along with the earlier announced dramatic reduction of corporate taxes seem to be the right moves. Indirect tax dispute redressal windows, return simplification of indirect taxes and other initiatives in indirect taxes clearly reduces cost of doing business in India and is a plus for the competitive index. However, changes in Non-Resident definition forces many HNW investors to review their India Residency status. This is a loss to the nation from a pool of investors to whom it should be looking to facilitate investments into the country.

Overall, a middle of the path budget for a government that faces strong economic headwinds domestically and internationally. Given that the macroeconomic fundamentals are sound, currency is stable, inflation manageable, commodity prices are low, could it have taken more risks to pull the country out of its growth quagmire? That question does remain.

“The new reforms announced in the Budget will work to accelerate the economy, financially empower every citizen of the country and strengthen the foundation of the economy in this decade,” Mr. Modi said in an address on television after the Budget was presented.

He said the Budget would improve employment generation across the country, a challenge his government has had to particularly face in the last couple of years.

The main focus of the Budget, said Mr. Modi, was on sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, textiles, and technology to increase employment opportunities. Under the Blue Economy initiative, the youth would also be provided with new opportunities in fields such as fish processing and marketing, he added.

Increasing employment

“A 16-point action plan has been put in place to achieve the target of doubling farmers’ incomes by 2022 and increase employment in rural areas,” he said.

The investments in the rural areas include the launch of a Kisan Rail scheme for a rail network that will aid in bridging the farm-to-market distance.

He specially pointed out that his government “trusted” the Indian citizen, and that there would be “no need to audit firms with a turnover of up to ₹5 crore. No certification from chartered accountants would be needed.” The limit for this was ₹1 crore earlier. He also mentioned the tax payer charter, announced by the Finance Minister in the Budget, a statement of a tax payers rights and duties. Only three other countries globally have such a charter.

“Removing the dividend distribution tax will give companies ₹25,000 crore, which will help them to invest further,” the Prime Minister said.

“The national logistics policy will benefit trade, business, and employment. The target to build 100 airports in India will embolden the will of the common Indian.

Mr. Kamra, soon after sending the legal notice through his lawyer, tweeted, “Lawmen & White have taken this fight to court for me as a special case. To all artistes out there don’t fear. There are enough good people in society to always support the constitution.”

The notice calls the ban “illegal, high handed and arbitrary” and against “the principles of natural justice”.

The move comes after the commander of the flight on which Mr. Kamra heckled journalist Arnab Goswami told the airline management that he did not think that the incident qualified as unruly behaviour as defined under the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) rules.

137,2020/02/01,Coronavirus | Another Air India flight departs from Delhi to evacuate Indians from Wuhan,"Air India’s jumbo B747 aircraft reached Delhi on February 1 morning after evacuating 324 Indians from China’s coronavirus-hit Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus outbreak, officials said. The plane, carrying 211 students, 110 working professionals and three minors, reached Delhi around 7.30 am, they said.

Another flight of the airline departed for the Chinese city from Delhi at 1.37 p.m., the officials said. Five doctors from the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital who were onboard the first flight are also in the second flight, the Air India spokesperson said.

The first flight departed from Delhi airport at 1.17 p.m. on January 31 to evacuate Indian nationals from China.

Hours after the arrival of the flight from the Chinese city in Delhi, the Air India spokesperson said, “Another flight will depart to Wuhan from Delhi... with a different set of crew, same doctors’ team with other aircraft. The rescue team is again headed by Captain Amitabh Singh, Director Operation, Air India.”

Before departure , Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani had said, “No service will take place in the plane. Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. As there will be no service, there will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers).”

“Masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. For our crew, we have also arranged a complete protective gear,” he had added.

Air India said another special flight to evacuate Indians from in China would depart from the Delhi airport on Saturday afternoon, hours after the first flight with 324 passengers landed in the Indian capital .

The first flight — which evacuated 324 passengers from Wuhan — had a team of five doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, one paramedical staff, five cockpit crew members, and 15 cabin crew members.

The 324 passengers comprised 211 students, 110 working professionals and three minors, the Air India spokesperson said.

138,2020/02/01,Coronavirus outbreak: Air India flight evacuating 324 Indians from China’s Wuhan lands in Delhi,"The first Air India flight evacuating 324 Indian nationals from coronavirus-hit Wuhan, China landed in Delhi on February 1. The plane reached Delhi around 7.30 a.m.

The Health Ministry said that 220 Indian incoming citizens from Wuhan, China are in the Army facility at Manesar and 104 are in ITBP facility at Chawla Camp.

Even though only asymptomatic Indian have been flown back, they will be housed in the quarantine facility in Haryana’s Manesar set up by the Indian Army.

Indian embassy, Beijing noted: “We look forward to operating another flight to evacuate remaining Indian nationals, who have consented to leave Hubei Province for the time being.”

The second flight will depart to Wuhan from Delhi at 12.50 p.m. on February 1 with a different set of crew and the same team of doctors in other aircraft. The rescue team is again headed by Capt. Amitabh Singh, Director Operation, said an Air India spokesperson.

“The incoming Indian passengers will be quarantined for 14 days at the two Quarantine Centres set-up at Manesar (managed by Armed Forces Medical Services) and Chawla Camp (managed by Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP)). All proposed male passengers (approx. 280) are proposed to be sent to Manesar Camp and families/females (approx. 90) can be housed in the ITBP camp,” the health ministry had said.

The flight had departed from Delhi airport at 1.17 p.m. on Friday to evacuate Indian nationals from China, where more than 200 people — none of them Indian — have died due to novel coronavirus.

On Friday evening, the Air India spokesperson had stated that another special flight may take off from Delhi airport on Saturday to evacuate Indians from Wuhan.

The death toll from the novel coronavirus outbreak in China has risen to 259 with total confirmed cases surging to 11,791 amid stepped up efforts by a number of countries to evacuate their nationals from Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, officials said on Saturday.

140,2020/02/01,SC to examine appeal against High Court order in RTI case,"The Supreme Court on Friday decided to examine an appeal filed by Magsaysay award winner and Indian Forest Service officer Sanjiv Chaturvedi against a Delhi High Court order agreeing with the Prime Minister’s Office that providing information under the Right to Information Act on corruption complaints against Central Ministers and in-flow of black money since 2014 will “disproportionately divert” public resources and impede investigations.

A Bench led by Justices L. Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta issued notice to the Central Public Information Officer, Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), on a special leave petition filed by Mr. Chaturvedi, represented by advocates Prashant Bhushan and Rohit Singh, against the High Court order of September 9, 2019.

The series of events began in August 2017. Mr. Chaturvedi applied under the Right to Information (RTI) Act to the PMO for corruption complaints and action taken against Central Ministers from June 2014 to August 5, 2017. The bureaucrat also sought information on black money deposits since June 2014. His efforts were bolstered when the Central Information Commission (CIC) ordered the PMO to provide him with the information in 15 days.

Mr. Chaturvedi said the PMO refused to disclose the details despite the “binding decision” of the CIC. Instead, it invoked Section 7(9) of the RTI Act regarding information about corruption charges against Ministers. This provision exempts a public authority from disclosing information if it entailed diverting resources or was “detrimental to the safety and preservation of the record.”

As for details of the black money, the PMO took refuge under Section 8(1)(h) of the RTI Act which excludes disclosures that may “impede the process of investigation or apprehension or prosecution of offenders.”

The High Court refused to entertain Mr. Chaturvedi’s appeal, compelling him to turn to the apex court.

“The respondent (PMO) was totally silent on the quantum of black money brought from abroad,” Mr. Chaturvedi argued in the Supreme Court. He said the government’s conduct struck at the “very root of the democratic rights of a citizen to know about transactions/businesses being carried out in the government.”

Its non-disclosure of corruption complaints and details of black money, he said, violated the election promises and also went against “very basic principles regarding the functioning of a democracy.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-examine-appeal-against-high-court-order-in-rti-case/article30708318.ece
141,2020/02/01,India-Africa defence ties in focus at Defexpo: Defence Secretary,"An India-Africa defence conclave focussed on the increasing defence cooperation with African countries will be a key part of the Defexpo next week, Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar said on Friday. In the backdrop of the outbreak of Coronavirus in China, he said necessary precautions had been taken to screen people coming from affected countries.

“Defence is increasingly becoming an important part of our relationship. The India-Africa defence conclave will be held on February 6. Over 24 Defence Ministers have indicated willingness to participate and 14 Ministers have confirmed participation so far,” Mr. Kumar said, briefing the media on the 11th Defexpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9.

More than 60 countries are expected to participate, with 40 Ministers having confirmed their participation apart from Service Chiefs and senior officials, he said, adding that the Chinese delegation had also confirmed its participation.

More than 1,000 companies have registered for participation in the Defexpo, a number that has risen substantially from the 702 companies that were a part of Defexpo 2018 in Chennai. So far, 165 foreign companies have registered. The exhibition area had almost doubled from 27,000 square metres in 2018, to 53,000 square metres this year, Mr. Kumar said.

The expo would be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 5 and an event has been scheduled for February 7. when several technology transfer agreements and Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) are expected to be signed, Mr. Kumar said.

142,2020/02/01,PM seeks feedback on J&K from Ministers,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sought feedback from the 37 Union Ministers who visited Jammu and Kashmir as part of an outreach initiative from January 18-23. The Ministers have been asked to fill a form comprising six questions on whether the development initiatives of the Centre had percolated downwards and benefited the people. A senior government official said there were strict instructions from the Prime Minister to not give any political speeches in J&K and instead focus on the work done post-August 5.

J&K was placed under severe restrictions since August 5, 2019 when Union Home Minister Amit Shah moved two Bills in the Rajya Sabha to revoke the special status of J&K under Article 370 and downgrade and bifurcate the State into Union Territories.

So far, 14 ministers have submitted their replies. Most ministers visited Jammu region as Kashmir Valley was covered in snow. A senior government official said that Minister of State for Home G.

143,2020/02/01,SC decides to examine amendments to RTI which ‘empowers’ government,"The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to examine a petition filed by parliamentarian Jairam Ramesh challenging the amendments made to the Right to Information Act in 2019 which gives the government the power to decide the tenure, salaries and service terms of the Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners according to its “whims and fancies”.

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud issued formal notice to the government on the petition filed by Mr. Ramesh, through advocate Sunil Fernandes. The petition contended that the RTI Amendment Act of 2019 and its Rules cripple the objectivity and independence of the Central Information Commission (CIC), the top adjudicatory body under the Act, by bringing it under the yoke of the government.

The very purpose of the Act, which is “a salutary piece of legislation aimed at promoting transparency in public administration and empowering the common citizen”, is denuded when the salaries and tenure of the Information Commissioners depend on the sheer pleasure of the government. The government and its various agencies are parties in every case filed before the CIC.

“The decision of the Central government is binding upon the Information Commissioners. This allows unbridled and uncanalised discretionary power to the Central government that jeopardises the independence of Information Commissioners. Given that post-retirement benefits, pensions and allowances are not explicitly in these rules, the Central government is granted absolute power to change these from time to time,” the petition said.

The Amendment Act received the President’s assent on August 1, 2019. Mr. Ramesh has challenged the various amendments, including the ones which change the earlier fixed tenure of five years for Central and States’ Information Commissioners to “a tenure to be prescribed by the Central Government.”

Similarly, the petition has challenged Section 3(c) of the Amendment Act by which the Centre has “absolute powers” to prescribe the salaries, allowances and terms and conditions of the State Information Commissioners. Their salaries were previously fixed on par with that of Election Commissioners and State Chief Secretaries.

“The ostensible reason for such amendments is ‘rationalising’ the service conditions,” the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-decides-to-examine-amendments-to-rti-which-empowers-government/article30708797.ece
144,2020/02/01,"CAA fulfils wish of Gandhiji, President tells Parliament","President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday kick-started the Budget session of Parliament with an address to both Houses. He lauded the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that, he said, fulfilled the wish of Mahatma Gandhi who had said that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan who didn’t want to stay there could come to India.

In an hour-long address, he spoke at length on the importance of the Constitution, adding that “in a democracy, nothing is more sacred than the mandate of the people. The people of the country have given this mandate to my government for the making of New India.”

He said India had always believed in the principle of equal respect for all faiths, but at the time of partition in 1947, “this very belief of India and of its people came under the most severe attack”.

In the environment prevailing in the aftermath of Partition, Mahatma Gandhi had said, “Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India. It is the duty of the government of India to ensure a normal life for them”.

‘Procedure unchanged’

“It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both Houses have fulfilled this wish by enacting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act,” Mr. Kovind said.

He clarified that “the procedures which have existed for people from all faiths of the world who believe in India and who wish to obtain Indian citizenship remain unchanged. A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India.” He made a specific mention to the incidents of anti-Sikh violence at Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and said it was the duty of “all of us” to bring such atrocities to the attention of the global community.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/4iq6vd/article30708752.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THRDKOVIND1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-fulfils-wish-of-gandhiji-president-tells-parliament/article30708753.ece
145,2020/02/01,Election Commission joins plea to disclose criminal cases against candidates,"The Election Commission of India on Friday filed a proposal jointly with petitioner-advocate A.K. Upadhyay for making election candidates as well as political parties fielding them, equally liable for disclosing their criminal antecedents.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton Nariman reserved orders on a contempt petition filed by Mr. Upadhyay against authorities and parties for not complying fully with a Constitution Bench judgment in 2018, which had directed political parties to publish online the pending criminal cases of their election candidates.

The joint proposal consists of making political parties liable to publish the criminal antecedents of their candidates — along with detailed reasons why they could not field better candidates — on social media, in newspapers and electronic media.

The parties have to also publish the declaration about their candidates on their Twitter handles and Facebook pages. This has to be done 48 hours prior to the scrutiny of the nominations. A similar responsibility rests on the candidates too.

The proposal also contains the draft of the Criminal Antecedents of Candidates (Reporting and Publication) Order of 2020 to formalise the liabilities on the parties and the candidates.

Justice Nariman, however, orally disagreed with a suggestion to make the law punitive in nature. The Bench said a penal factor may be misused by political parties against their rivals to frame serious charges like sedition, etc.

Appearing before the Bench, senior advocate Vikas Singh, for the Commission, said 46% of Members of Parliament have criminal records. The Supreme Court’s long string of judgments against criminalisation of politics has hardly scratched the surface of the deep rot.

The Supreme Court had in 2018 suggested that Parliament should frame a law that makes it obligatory for political parties to remove leaders charged with “heinous and grievous” crimes like rape, murder and kidnapping, only to a name a few, and refuse election ticket to offenders in both parliamentary and Assembly polls.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/lvpp26/article30706973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-indiaasjdhsakldasd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/election-commission-joins-plea-to-disclose-criminal-cases-against-candidates/article30706909.ece
146,2020/02/01,"Congress MP writes letter to Lok Sabha Speaker, seeks disqualification of Anurag Thakur","Congress leader and Lok Sabha member from Thrissur T.N. Prathapan on Friday wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, seeking the disqualification of Union Minister Anurag Thakur for his controversial comments.

“As a Member of Parliament Shri Anurag Thakur has violated the oath in Parliament by inciting violence and speeches of raising war in society. More than a member in Parliament he is also having ministerial duty in the union government. It is supposed to be doubly his responsibility towards society in ensuring harmony, peace, law and order,” the MP said in his letter.

“By the action of the Election Commission it is clear that Shri Anurag Thakur violated the model code of conduct in elections,” he added.

Earlier in the week, Mr. Thakur, the junior minister for Finance, had been pulled up by the Election Commission for making an incendiary statement at an election rally in Delhi.

The Congress MP argued that Thursday’s incident where a young man shot at a student of Jamia Milia Islamia University protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a result of BJP leaders painting anti-CAA protesters as anti-nationals.

147,2020/02/01,Foreign Secretary unveils major MEA revamp,"The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has undertaken a major overhaul of departments and reporting structure that will effectively empower seven different Additional Secretaries and re-organise their tasks along themes like culture, trade and development, and consolidated geographical divisions for better coordination.

According to three orders issued on Thursday by the new Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla less than a day into his tenure, the silos that will be managed by the Additional Secretaries will range from cultural power, to be managed by Dinesh Patnaik, economic and trade coordination managed by P. Harish, all international organisations and summits including UN, G-20, BRICS etc. by Vikram Doraiswami, and all development partnerships by Akhilesh Mishra. All of Europe has been merged under Suresh Reddy, all of Africa and West Asia under Nagma Mallick and all of the Indian Ocean and Indo-Pacific region under Neena Malhotra.

The restructuring was done in consultation with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, who as a former foreign secretary (2015-2018) managed the Ministry himself, and authored the plans, sources said.

Burdened by routine

At a meeting to discuss the changes, Mr. Jaishankar reportedly spoke to Foreign Service officers of his belief that secretary-level officials are “overburdened and overworked” with day-to-day duties, and lack much-needed time to strategise. In the new structure, additional secretaries will be empowered to look at more long-term solutions rather than only “firefighting”, and will travel and give political direction to their assigned portfolios.

At the secretary level there are now four officers apart from the Foreign Secretary, with Sanjay Bhattacharya, who returned from his tenure as Ambassador to Turkey to take over the Secretary, (Consular, Passport, Visa and Overseas Indian Affairs) Division, and will also oversee officials on the Gulf and West Asia/North Africa (WANA) divisions.

The additional charge indicates the importance of the Indian diaspora in the Gulf and WANA regions where about eight million Indian expatriates live, about a quarter of the world total, that account for more than 60% of the inbound remittances.

Another change is the decision to move the “External Publicity” (XP) the media and public relations division to work under Secretary (West) Vikas Swarup, who has experience in the workings of the division, as he was spokesperson in the past.

Leveraging soft power

As the new Director General for the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR), Dinesh Patnaik will consolidate the government’s push to promote its cultural, heritage, history, tourism objectives and showcase the diaspora, with the ICCR being rebranded as the government’s “soft power” vehicle.

Mr. Shringla also reshuffled a number of joint secretary level postings on Thursday, including appointing Anupam Ray, who has returned from the U.S. — where he was Consul-General in Houston and organised the “Howdy, Modi” event — to head Public Policy and Research, which also entails planning the MEA’s flagship Raisina Dialogue conference in January.

One of Mr. Shringla’s first big tasks after returning from Washington, where he was Ambassador, will be planning the 3-city, 3-day visit of U.S. President Donald Trump expected on February 24-26. He will be assisted by his replacement Taranjit Singh Sandhu who is moving from Colombo shortly, in order to work on the visit.

New appointments to key capitals, including Singapore, Paris, Kathmandu, and Ottawa, have also been made, and decisions over the next envoys to London, and the two United Nations postings, Permanent Mission (PMI) in New York and Geneva will be due later this year.

In other changes, 1999 batch Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer Rudra Gaurav Shresth was appointed Officer on Special Duty (OSD) in the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Friday. Mr. Shresth is currently Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM) in Thimpu, Bhutan. Earlier, he served as India’s High Commissioner in Mozambique and in the policy planning and research division in the MEA.

In the PMO, he will replace Joint Secretary Gopal Baglay, who is moving to Colombo in Sri Lanka as India’s High Commissioner.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1gull8/article30705993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-S,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/foreign-secretary-unveils-major-mea-revamp/article30705994.ece
148,2020/02/01,"There’s more space for intervention on monetary front than fiscal front, says Sanjeev Sanyal","While the central bank has struck a cautious note on further interest rate cuts given a spike in inflation over the last few months, Principal Economic Adviser in the Finance Ministry Sanjeev Sanyal believes there is more room for monetary policy actions to spur growth.

You are optimistic of growth rebounding to 6% to 6.5% from the 5% estimated for this year. Could you elaborate on the reasons for the hopes of an uptick?

We have actually been quite conservative — 6% to 6.5% growth is fairly okay given that many of the short-term indicators have stabilised already. They are not strong but they are no longer deteriorating for most parts — be it the PMI or other indicators. So that is definitely going to be the case...

But I think the focus of this Economic Survey is really on making a case for wealth creation. As the Prime Minister has also said, if we cannot create wealth, you cannot redistribute it. So we need to reconsider our default socialist thing towards redistribution as it seems to be imbibed inside our intellectual frameworks. What we have tried to do is make the case for markets, privatisation and removing interventions where they are needed, and also interestingly, the need for us to take trust systems more seriously. So being pro-business is very different from being pro-crony.

This is what we have tried to show. There is the Essential Commodities Act that may have made sense in 1950s when we had shortages and so on. But today it doesn’t as we produce enough food but the problem is of storage. If you are going to call people who store and transport food ‘hoarders,’ then why should they invest in it? So we need to rethink this whole approach to economics.

Secondly, we have also shown how value is created by privatisation. We have looked at the wall of regulation that Indian businesses face. For restaurants in Singapore, you need four major permits. In Delhi, you need 26 permits and each of those requires many documents — a Delhi Police permit needs 45 documents, while getting a gun requires 19. And then some of the other rules are ridiculous like music permit, bike delivery permit and so on that we have mapped out.

The other thing we did, which I don’t think that any other Survey has done, is to simply follow the logistical steps Indian imports and exports take. What happens when an apparel consignment leaves Delhi and what are the steps that it goes through, how much time it takes till it reaches the final warehouse. We found that it takes five days to reach Nhava Sheva (port) which is ridiculous, where it spends 14 days going through customs and other processes, then it takes 22 days to get to the U.S. and on the other end, it takes three days. So the entire process is taking 41 days of which 19 days are spent on our own side. We did this also with carpet exports through an inland port — again, 40 days are taken of which 13 days are spent in India. When we reversed this whole thing, we found that a carpet made in Milan gets on to the ship within a day, and after it lands here, it takes eight days to exit the port including two days of waiting to berth at the port. Now, first of all, it is completely absurd that we take so long compared to other countries. But the other aspect is that our own imports are more efficient than exports. So, if you want to be a serious merchandise exporter, you cannot be behaving like this. We are making the case to do process mapping. We know many of these problems are there, but how serious are they? Interestingly, at our airports, we are able to solve the same thing. In fact, at Bangalore airport, it takes ten hours to move goods out. If you are a registered operator, you can do it in six hours, which is the world’s best. So we are ourselves able to some of the world’s best in one place, but are disastrous in other places. It is a clear case of not paying attention, tracking this thing and monitoring the pipeline.

You have talked of public sector banks coming together to pool data and use analytic tools for identifying likely defaulters.

We generate a lot of data as a country, this is not just about banks. We have enormous amount of data and then we don’t do anything with it. There’s talk of using Artificial Intelligence and the GST guys use it a bit, but by and large, we can dramatically improve the targeting of all that we are trying to do, with AI that is widely being used worldwide. We claim to have expertise in it and in fact, for other countries, we are doing it in Bengaluru. We don’t seem to apply it in our own country... It can be used for fraud detection, working out credit quality, where capital is deployed well, where are the returns coming from. It doesn’t have to be used for negative things alone. You can even track which guy is better over the course of a career on picking winners. Private sector banks are already much more efficient at assessing risks. This is a generic point and not restricted to public sector banks.

There has been some mention of counter-cyclical fiscal measures that can revive growth... What could they be?

I have always said the larger space is still on the monetary side. But there are fiscal things that may be done but I am not in a position to disclose them today.

You feel there is space on the monetary side despite the high inflation?

Yes, I do. It’s food inflation (that is rising). The underlying inflation is very well-behaved and there is plenty of space on the monetary side. We have also mooted an important reform called bilateral netting. Let’s assume you and I are banks — I have ₹100 exposure to you and you have ₹90 exposure to me. In the current environment, both of us have to keep ₹190 capital aside to cover this. But the risk in the system is only ₹10 — which is my net position vis-a-vis you. So actually, we should only be keeping ₹10 capital aside.

Also Read Economic Survey 2019-20: High fees push poor out of education system

Worldwide, bilateral netting is accepted, but we don’t allow this. We have set these capital requirements and too much capital is getting stuck that we can release immediately.

Secondly, without such a system, you cannot do much in any kind of derivative instruments... For example, the Credit Default Swaps (CDS) market doesn’t exist in India because we don’t have bilateral netting. If you don’t have a CDS market, you cannot have a corporate bond market. This is a very important reform that we need to do that needs a law at some point. Then the RBI can frame the rules.

GST collections have shown 4% growth and Survey says it has stabilised. But there’s a need for rationalisation…

Eventually, there’s no question that we have to rationalise GST and simplify it. The question is do we do it right now when the system is stabilising. Making too many changes also causes people to crib. That is a judgement that the GST Council will have to take.

How do you converge ‘Assemble in India’ with Make in India?

They are basically the same idea. We have to be competitive… People who manufacture in India manufacture for the world as well. Partly, regulatory and logistical changes are needed — but really, we need a mindset change. Very often in India, people say: ‘Oh, certain product is made, and only a small amount of value addition is made here.’ So what? We have to be willing to get into those parts of the system where the value chain may not be large but there are enormous volumes. China’s growth is entirely due to this.

When the first few Maruti 800s came, they were largely imported from Japan. Now we are a global car exporter. There is no reason for us to be snooty that we haven’t got a great amount of the value. You have to be a part of the chain in the first place; then we can talk of how much value you create.

You have talked about wealth creation and the role of trust systems, be it in institutions or trust in government-industry relations. Is there something that can be done to fortify these ties that have frayed a bit?

Of course, when we had a system of a certain kind, and we changed it to another system, the transition will cause disruption. We have seen those disruptions, but I think now we are coming to the point where people have by and large, accepted that are rules such as banks being heavily supervised and regulated than in the past. So, I think the transition to a new way of doing business is happening. There is no question that creditor rights today are vastly different from what they were five years ago.

You have included some studies on crony capitalism leading to undue gains for certain stocks involved in the 2G scam. What is the resonance of that today, since we have moved on from such crony capitalism as you suggest?

The Survey has talked of built-up demand pressure… In which sectors do you see this?

For example, our inventory pipeline is completely bare now. We have had inventory down for almost two years. If demand begins to come back, we will see a significant kick from inventory build-up. Of course, that requires you to be able to back it with working capital from the banking system.

That is why we always keep coming back to the fact that our banking and financial system, having gone through a lot of cleaning up, now needs to go into expansion mode. And we have spent a lot of time examining the transmission issues in the Survey.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/c3ngdx/article30705408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01SANJEEVSANYAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/theres-more-space-for-intervention-on-monetary-front-than-fiscal-front-says-sanjeet-sanyal/article30705409.ece

151,2020/02/01,"Vizag is destined to be Executive Capital, says Thammineni","The city is destined to be the Executive capital as it has all the trappings of becoming a top destination in the country, Legislative Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam has said.

Mr. Seetharam was speaking as chief guest at the Foundation Day celebrations of Dr. Lankapalli Bullayya College here on Saturday.

Terming the decision taken by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on decentralisation as courageous, Mr. Seetharam said that centralised development by successive governments in and around Hyderabad had been proved wrong.

“Though Hyderabad was not centrally located, the latter was chosen as capital of the combined State. We put all our wealth and intellectual ability in building Hyderabad. Even the agitation for separate Telangana was due to centralised development, as the remaining parts of the State was underdeveloped,” the Speaker observed.

‘Not against Amaravati’

The government was not against Amaravati, and it would continue to be the Legislative capital. “We will be having all the Assembly sessions there,” he added.

“Vizag as Executive capital will not only benefit the city and its surrounding districts but also the neighbouring States such as Chhattisgarh and Odisha,” he said, and called upon the students and faculty members of the college to support the decision wholeheartedly.

English medium

Justifying the government’s decision to make English the medium of instruction in all the State-run schools, Mr. Seetharam said, “Because of our strength in English, mathematics and sciences, the country is enjoying the demographic dividend. We cannot allow students from the Telugu medium to be left out in the race, and hence English medium is the need of the hour.”

He appreciated the way the college, which was started in 1973, progressed over the years.

On the occasion of the Foundation Day, Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao (VMRDA Chairman) and Dharmana Krishnadas (R&B Minister) received an award for distinguished alumnus in public service.

Instead of according undue priority to the “ill-advised” plan to have three capitals and resorting to vengeful politics, Chief Minister Y.S.

The immense contribution of LIC to the five-year plans, investments in social sector to the tune of more than 80% of its total investment, for the last 68 years will receive a great setback with the move, according to Shreekanta Mishra, general secretary of AIIEA.

“We call upon the Government of India to drop the move to list LIC in stock market and strengthen LIC in the public sector in the interest of the economy and 40 crore policyholders.”

Mr. Mishra said, “The move is obviously against the national interests. The LIC today is growing at a rate which is much more than the growth of GDP.

The college, in collaboration with Google Inc, is organising the event and this is the first time that the meetup is being held in India. The inaugural was attended by Chairman of the VIVA-VVIT institutions Vasireddy Vidya Sagar, Chairman of APNRT Venkat Medapati and S. Ghanashyam, the India Programme Manager for the UIF programme.

UIF Regional Meetups are designed and hosted by Fellows at their schools and offer a unique opportunity to gather and learn in person with other Fellows and faculty, form new collaborations, and discover a new campus ecosystem.

Referring to the theme “Global Partnership for Sustainable Development”, Mr. Medapati said the UIFs must make use of this opportunity and share their knowledge back home in their respective schools.

Mr. Sagar said 16 students of the VVIT had been selected as UIFs and they had been significantly contributing to the society around them by making use of their knowledge and skills acquired during the fellowship.

172,2020/02/01,"‘Oilseeds, pulses need to be incentivised’","“By exporting paddy and wheat, we are indirectly exporting water,” said Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) secretary-general Bojja Dasaradha Rami Reddy. There is an immediate for the government to make sure that farmers take up cultivation of oilseeds and pulses so that water is evenly distributed across the country.

The CIFA gave its recommendations to the Central government ahead of the Union Budget. The association argues that credit must be made available for tenant farmers. “A mechanism must be developed so that tenant farmers get credit,” Mr. Reddy told The Hindu.

He said there is an excess production of wheat and rice in the country as the mechanism for procurement and import-export mechanisms are functioning well. However, he argues that the mechanisms are not functioning well for pulses and oilseeds, which makes farmers turn to water-intensive paddy or wheat.

“If pulses and oilseeds are procured like paddy and wheat; and if import-export issues are resolved, the farmers will naturally switch to pulses and oilseeds which are less water-intensive,” the secretary-general added.

There is an immediate need to increase the minimum support price for oilseeds and pulses to incentivise farmers.

“About 60% of agriculture land in the country is rain-fed. We need to conserve water, and make sure that water is reaching drought-hit areas,” he added.

Irrigation projects

Responding to a query about the lack of irrigation projects in the country, Mr. Reddy said that the government must create a new fund to construct irrigation projects in backward areas.

“This is a long-term process, and the government needs to take this up as a policy matter to make sure that water reaches backward regions,” he added.

The CIFA argues that if the government properly incentivises low water-consuming produce, the excess water could then be transferred to drought-hit regions for both irrigation and drinking purposes.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vm2msy/article30706534.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-VJ-BOJJA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/oilseeds-pulses-need-to-be-incentivised/article30706535.ece
173,2020/02/01,"Good intent, but what matters is execution: Business heads","Business leaders in the city called the budget proposals a positive move and an attempt aimed at boosting the economy. But the important question that still remains is: how many of these project proposals and investments will actually become ground realities?

Vishal Bali, Executive Chairman, Asia Healthcare Holdings, said: “The budget attempts to strike a balance on various fronts. All steps in the right direction. But what needs to be seen is the implementation and execution of these changes.”

Localisation of the medical technology industry needed a lot more impetus and reduction in input cost rather than increasing taxes on imported technology. “All increases in duties/taxes ultimately makes technology expensive which in turn increases cost of healthcare to patients,” said Mr. Bali.

Somesh Mittal, MD & CEO, Vikram Hospital, said: “We are happy that the government has announced ₹69,000 crore for the healthcare sector of which PM Jan Arogya Yojana will get ₹6,400 crore. This will go a long way towards ensuring better healthcare.”

However, the additional 5% tax on imported medical devices, to fund healthcare infrastructure in tier 2-3 cities and provide protection to indigenous manufacturers, would increase cost to the consumers in the short run, added Mr. Bali.

“Multiple announcements, including reducing the tax burden on employees, setting up of entrepreneurship cells and supporting seed fund investment for early-stage startups - all only reinforces what young India has delivered through startups, over the years,” reacted city entrepreneur, Musthafa P.C., co-founder and CEO, iD Fresh Food.

174,2020/02/01,Suburban rail project finds mention in budget yet again,"The much delayed 148-km-long suburban rail project for Bengaluru once again found a mention in the Union Budget that was unveiled on Saturday.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that the Union government would provide 20% of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of the project cost, which is estimated at ₹18,600 crore. Fares will be along the lines of the metro.

However, citizens who have been fighting for a robust suburban rail network were unimpressed. “There is nothing new in the budget promise. The announcement is just a repetition. The project has been cleared by the Extended Railway Board (ERB) and final clearance is pending before the Union Cabinet. We demand that the Centre clear the project and allocate the required funds so that it gets implemented,” said transport expert Sanjeev Dyamannavar of the advocacy group Praja.

In the 2018-19 Union budget, the Union government announced a suburban rail network of approximately 160 km at an estimated cost of ₹17,000 crore to cater to the growth of the city. However, in the ‘Pink Book’, brought out by the Railways on Work, Machinery and Rolling Stock Programme of Railways for 2018-19, only ₹1 crore had been allocated.

In the following 2019-20 financial year, ₹10 crore was allocated for the project. Meanwhile, based on the direction of the Centre, some changes were made in the detailed project report. These included dropping the number of stations, avoiding operations in areas already serviced by Namma Metro, and others. The ERB had given its clearance in November 2019.

Srinivas Alavilli of Citizens for Bengaluru also expressed his frustration over the lack of movement in the project. “While presenting the budget in 2018, Arun Jaitley too made an announcement about the suburban rail network. For decades, only assurances have been made but no progress has been achieved.”

Various rail user groups in the city have been campaigning for a robust suburban rail network by petitioning elected representatives from the city and carrying online campaigns. When Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently visited the State, hundreds of people took to social media asking for an early clearance for the project that has remained on paper for over three decades.

Amit Garg, who heads Karnataka Rail Infrastructure Development Enterprises (K-RIDE), a special purpose vehicle for the project, said: “It’s a positive development. What has been proposed by the K-RIDE has been mentioned in the budget. The suburban rail will have a network of 148 km with 57 stations. To implement the project, we will approach financial agencies such as JICA and ADB to raise the required funds.” In the city, BMRCL is also borrowing loans from international agencies for Namma Metro.

Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi told The Hindu that the project will go before the Cabinet for approval.

“Both the Centre and State will contribute 20% each and the remaining 60% will be raised from other sources. More information on the project will be shared on Sunday,” he said.

Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said: “This could be one positive feature in the budget for the State but it all depends on how it is achieved.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qzsw6o/article30716273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGSUBURBAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/suburban-rail-project-finds-mention-in-budget-yet-again/article30716274.ece
175,2020/02/01,Malpe Beach Utsav gets off to a colourful start,"The two-day Malpe Beach Utsav got off to a colourful start with cultural troupes performing on the beach on Saturday.

Inaugurating the beach festival, organised by the district administration, Malpe Development Committee, and the Department of Tourism, K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said that other beaches in the district would be developed on the lines of Malpe beach to attract tourists from other countries.

He said Malpe beach would be developed up to the sea walkway area. There are plans to develop Kadike beach and Bengre beach, and more importance will be given to providing cleanliness and developing infrastructure at Malpe beach, the MLA said.

Three high-mast lamps are to be installed on the nearby Padukere beach. Homestays will be built near Padukere to attract tourists. This will also generate employment for locals, he said, adding that the opinion of local fishermen would be taken on the plans to construct a marina at Padukere.

Deputy Commissioner G. Jagadeesha said that a vision document was being prepared to give a new dimension to tourism in the district. A survey taken up in this regard is to be completed soon. Works related to Blue Flag regulations would be completed at Padubidri beach by the end of March, he said.

Blue Flag certification was expected this year for Padubidri beach. The other beaches will be built on Blue Flag norms. An amount of ₹5 crore each has been released for the development of Marvanthe and Someshwara beaches in the district, he said.

The district administration had urged B.Y. Raghavendra, MP, to get ₹50 crore allocated in the budget so that Someshwara beach could be developed on the lines of Murudeshwar beach. A new look will be given to the pilgrim centre of Kollur by launching a ‘Swachh Kollur’ scheme, Mr. Jagadeesha said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tbsu6h/article30716148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGUDUPIBEACHUTSAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/malpe-beach-utsav-gets-off-to-a-colourful-start/article30716149.ece
176,2020/02/01,Union Budget 2020-21 received mixed response in Udupi,"The Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman received a mixed response in Udupi on Saturday.

Srikrishna Rao Kodancha, president of Udupi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told The Hindu that it was a good budget in the present circumstances, one that would lead to GDP growth and stimulate employment. He said rural development and infrastructure had been given importance in the budget, and simplification of the personal income tax regime was a welcome move. Startups will benefit from this budget, he said.

Satyanarayana Udupa Japti, general secretary of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangha, said the budget would help in the development of the agriculture sector. It aims to provide 20 lakh farmers with standalone solar pumps. It has laid emphasis on cold storage and marketing, he said.

Vishwanathan Iyer, associate dean (academics), T.A. Pai Management Institute, said that overall it was a bold pro-middle class, pro-corporate and forward-looking budget. The big message is that wealth creators shall be respected, he said.

Simplified GST norms, revisiting Rule of Origin requirements, and tightening regulations relating to dumping of goods will benefit the MSME sector, he said. Ms. Sitharaman has not allowed fiscal deficit to spiral out of control, and this should definitely boost the business sentiment, he said.

K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA and BJP leader, said the budget was in favour of farmers, workers and the poor. It has allocated ₹15,000 crore towards the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Credit Card scheme.

It provides ₹3.6 lakh crore for the Jal Jeevan Mission, which places emphasis on augmenting local water resources, recharging existing sources, and promoting water harvesting. It has proposed raising fish production to 200 lakh tonnes by 2022-23, he said.

However, Bhaskar Rao Kidiyoor, spokesperson of the district unit of Congress, called it an “anti-people” budget. He said there was no explanation for how farmers’ income would be doubled. “There is nothing in it on employment generation. Except for some relief for income taxpayers, it has nothing to propel industrial growth,” he said.

Yogish V. Shetty, president of district unit of JD(S), said the budget was nothing more than window dressing at a time when the country’s economy was collapsing.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/union-budget-2020-21-received-mixed-response-in-udupi/article30716131.ece
177,2020/02/01,Kumaraswamy terms it statistical jugglery,"JD(S) leader and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Saturday termed the Union Budget as the “most disappointing” and said there was no vision in it for accelerating economic growth.

He said the budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was a “statistical jugglery” and many of the announced projects in the past were not implemented. “There is no information about how many old promises were fulfilled in the last five years by the BJP-led government,” Mr. Kumaraswamy said.

Mr. Kumaraswamy likened the proposal of agricultural land leasing with the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act and said that it would be as inimical to the country’s future. The budgetary allocation for education had been cut by around ₹30,000 crore compared with the previous one, the JD(S) leader said.

Arguing that many schemes lacked clarity, he said of Kisan Udan scheme, “The scheme says the government will coordinate with the Civil Aviation Department, but what will they do really? Make farmers fly in the sky instead of walking on the roads?”

The former Chief Minister was also critical of there being no mention of measures for employment generation in the budget.

178,2020/02/01,"‘It’s a pro-people, pro-farmer budget’","Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa has described the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman as “pro-people, pro-farmer, and pro-poor”.

“Priority has been given to farmers, poor, and rural areas. The programmes announced for the farming sector complement the Prime Minister’s vision to double the income of farmers. Providing ₹2,83,000 crore to the agriculture sector was a major deviation from the routine budgetary allocations,” Mr. Yediyurappa said in a press statement.

The Chief Minister said Kisan Rail and Kisan Udan would facilitate speedy transportation and export of perishable agricultural products and this, in turn, would boost farmers’ income. Water conservation measures in 100 water-stressed districts, which form one-fifth of the country’s area, would help farmers in parched districts where underground water had almost exhausted, he said.

Encouraging production of solar energy and PM-KUSUM , the scheme of energising pump sets through solar energy, would help more than 20 lakh farmers. Implementation of scheme to provide training in “desi skills” would boost the small and cottage industries under MSME scheme.

Allowing foreign direct investment in the education sector would boost academic activities in fund-starved universities all over the country. “This is a good step to improve quality of education in the country.” He thanked the Centre for giving approval for suburban rail system for Bengaluru where the Centre and State would share 40% equity and 60% from external assistance.

Mr. Yediyurappa said, “Reduction in individual tax and corporate tax and simplification of tax system is a great relief.”

BJP’s Karnataka unit, on its Twitter handle, highlighted the new tax slabs proposed by the budget and described it as a “big relief to tax-paying individuals”.

Farmers’ income

Union Minister D.V. Sadananda Gowda, in a release, hailed the focus on doubling farmers’ income by 2022 and described it as one that aims to “uplift all communities and revolutionise the employment scenario”.

179,2020/02/01,Budget does nothing to pep up economy: Siddaramaiah,"Describing the Union Budget as disappointing with little scope for restoring the country’s falling economy, Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Saturday said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had “failed to meet the expectations of people” and termed her second budget as “uninspiring”.

The expectations on this particular budget were very high, with the country in the grip of serious economic crisis and major industry sectors facing recession, but the budget had done little for dealing with the current crisis, he said.

Mr. Siddaramaiah told reporters here, “I have doubts on whether the Indian economy would be doubled to $5 trillion by 2022 as said by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, taking into consideration the country’s present economic situation.”

When Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister, the GDP growth was at 8%. Now, the growth rate has plunged to 4.5% and the government hopes to push the growth to 6%, he said. “I do not see the targeted growth would be realised following the downturn.”

The government’s decision to sell its stake in the LIC in the form of IPO shows how depressing the economic situation is, he said.

Arguing that farmers’ income cannot be doubled by 2022 with the steps taken by the Centre, the senior Congress leader said the growth could be achieved if the agriculture sector got an allocation of at least 10% of the budget. With 2.5% allocation, farmers had nothing to rejoice, he observed.

Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged that agricultural land leasing, marketing, and contract farming proposed in the budget would result in privatisation of agriculture, benefiting corporate bodies. “We had sought waiver of farmers’ loans in nationalised banks which was not considered by the Centre,” he said.

In a statement, veteran Congress leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge said the budget was a “long speech with no concrete proposals” to accelerate the growth and provide jobs. The Modi government’s promise to generate two crore jobs per year or of doubling farmers’ income had remained on paper, Mr. Kharge said.

180,2020/02/01,"Union budget honest and bold, says FKCCI","The Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) has welcomed the Union Budget for the initiatives that will increase employment, economic growth, and change the direction of growth.

Terming the budget honest and “bold”, the FKCCI has said that the budget is aimed at reviving the economy “in these difficult and challenging times.”

C.R. Janardhana, president, FKCCI, in a press release, has lauded the ambition the Union government to double milk production to 108 million tonnes by 2025.

While welcoming the announcement of five new Smart Cities, it has urged the government to complete Smart City projects, which have already been announced.

“The tax changes of tax rates and abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax will settle the long outstanding demand. Concessions to startups and for the affordable housing sector will boost the respective sectors,” the release said.

Welcoming the allocation for Bengaluru’s suburban railway, the FKCCI has said that it was the need of the hour and would de-congest the city roads. “The announcement of expressway between Chennai and Bengaluru will reduce travel time for passengers and also help goods movement to almost 60%. This will help industries who are importers or exporters from Bengaluru and surroundings using the Chennai port facilities,” the release stated.

Implementation is key: KASSIA

The Karnataka Small Scale Industries Association (KASSIA) has welcomed the Union Budget 2020, while cautioning that everything hinges on the implementation as budget measures need to be effectively followed and executed in a federal set up.

R. Raju, president, KASSIA, welcomed proposals such as simplifying GST filing of returns and the measures to help rural economy by directing investments to agriculture and related areas.

However, on a cautionary note, the KASSIA said: “One gets an uncomfortable feeling that the budget has tried to address a number of issues and may have unwittingly missed the wood for the trees. The problems facing the Indian economy now require measures to put back on track growth in investment and consumption, which seem to be missing. We believe this is the central issue for the economy to help employment and income.”

KASSIA has also said that the general measures proposed to revive the economy, such as creation of the investment clearance cell, higher insurance cover for exports, reversion of duties and taxes on export products along with the special focus on electronic and semi conductor equipment manufacturing value chains, would provide the necessary stimulus needed to revive the economic growth in the country.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/grwpgc/article30715791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BGFKCCI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/union-budget-honest-and-bold-says-fkcci/article30715793.ece

The award carries a purse of ₹1 lakh, a citation, and a memento and was presented to him by the former chairman of the Karnataka Sahitya Academy Guruling Kapse, in the presence of the former Vice-Chancellor of Indira Gandhi National Tribal University Tejaswi Kattimani.

Mr. Bhyrappa said that earlier writers chose to write to express their views and were reluctant to speak on their works.

However after the emergence of ‘Navya Kavya’, the writers started speaking about their works leading to self appreciation and consequent arguments and one-sided criticism.

Referring to an incident, which happened during a symposium chaired by poet laureate D.R. Bendre in Dakshina Kannada, Mr. Bhyrappa said that the remarks by Mr. Bendre about his works boosted his confidence in going ahead with his writing.

He said Mr. Bendre was not only a poet but also a philosopher and guide.

“He [Mr. Bendre] could produce scholarly works because he travelled extensively in search of subjects and made efforts to understand the pulse of the people,” he said.

182,2020/02/01,Farmers end indefinite hunger strike,"The indefinite hunger strike by the farmers to press for their various demands was withdrawn on Saturday, the fourth day, following specific assurances by the district administration.

Led by Veeresh Sobaradmath Swami of the Raitha Sena, Karnataka, the farmers had begun the indefinite dharna on Monday.

However, they converted it into a indefinite hunger strike on Wednesday after the State government failed to respond positively to their demands.

The agitation had become a matter of concern for the district administration after the condition of two of the farmers had deteriorated on on Friday and their attempts to get them to hospital had failed.

On Saturday, Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Deepa Cholan held another round of discussion with the farmers and convinced them to withdraw the fast. After convincing them to withdraw the agitation, she offered them tender coconuts to end their fast and promised them that the district administration would always stand with the farmers.

Ms. Cholan told presspersons at the protest site that already a groundnut procurement centre had been set up on Saturday and the farmers’ registration had begun.

The government had promised to set up another procurement centre for bengal gram soon, she said.

On the farmers’ other demands pertaining to announcement of MSP for nine other crops, she said their demands had been conveyed to the government and there had been a positive response.

Veeresh Sobaradmath Swami told presspersons that they wanted to meet the Vice President seeking early gazette notification on Mahadayi verdict and accordingly sought time.

Clarifying that they had withdrawn the protest following specific assurances by the administration, he said they would be forced to intensify the agitation if there was any lethargy in meeting their demands.

183,2020/02/01,Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS inauguration today,"The Hubballi-Dharwad Bus Rapid Corridor System (HD-BRTS) will be formally inaugurated by Vice President M. Venkaiah Naidu on Sunday. It has been on a trial run for the last one year.

The dedicated bus corridor, which is already ferrying close to 1 lakh commuters daily, was conceptualised and sanctioned in 2012.

The formal inauguration will take place at 3 p.m. in the presence of Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Union Minister Pralhad Joshi and Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, and other dignitaries.

While the World Bank has released 33% [₹324.32 crore] of the total project cost of ₹970.87 crore, the remaining was funded by the State government.

At present 100 air-conditioned ‘Chigari’ buses are plying on the BRTS and the procurement of an additional 55 electric buses is under way.

The project was delayed owing to various reasons including land acquisition and road widening issues.

Amid complaints about improper execution, the bus service has received a good response and recently smart card facility for the commuters was launched.

Meanwhile, an organisation from Hubballi has urged Mr. Naidu not to inaugurate the project as it was ‘incomplete’.

President of Samata Sena, Gurunath Ullikashi, has submitted a memorandum to the Office of the Vice President in this regard.

He said already mails have been sent to officials of the secretariat of the Vice President.

According to Mr. Ullikashi, inaugurating an ‘incomplete’ work would bring disrespect to the Office of the Vice President and alleged that the inauguration of the project was being held owing to pressure by Union Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Pralhad Joshi and Large and Medium Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar, and Arvind Bellad, MLA.

He has said that the incomplete Navalur Bridge was a proof of the lack of proper planning in the execution of the project.

He has also alleged that the traffic signalling system on the bus corridor was unscientific and several problems were being faced by the residents of Hubballi –Dharwad.

Mr. Ullikashi has said that the Office of the Vice President was being kept in the dark about the ‘incomplete’ works and the members of Samata Sena would also try to submit a memorandum to Mr. Naidu during his visit to Hubballi.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Prabhulinga Mahagaonkar, Ravindra Shabadi, R.G. Shetagar, Somanna Nadakatti, and Basavaraj Morbad gave 15-days time to the police to nab the culprits.

“Right-wing extremism has already claimed the lives of great scholars, journalists, intellectuals and activists such as M.M. Kalburgi, Gauri Lankesh, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar. We cannot take risks any more. It appears that the same forces are behind the unanimous letter to Nijagunananda Swamy threatening to kill many social activists, seers, intellectuals, actors and journalists who are critical about right-wing ideology. We also condemn the police inaction as no case has been filed and none has been arrested. If the police fail to nab them within 15 days, we will plan for State-wide agitations,” Mr. Shabadi said. Defending the seer, who is an outspoken critic of right-wing ideology of Hindutva in his public addresses, Mr. Shabadi said that the seer was doing the same thing that Basavanna and other Sharanas (reformers) of the 12th century had done.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jskqpe/article30709323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGLINGAYAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lingayat-leaders-condemn-threat-to-seer/article30709324.ece

The team from the Department of Health and Family Welfare is in addition to the regular airport health team. The department’s health clinic is expected to function from Saturday.

“Posters, pamphlets and literature on the disease are being printed and may be ready by Saturday. With these material, our health team will be deployed at the airport most likely from Saturday itself. Though it is not an international airport, the team will be deployed as per the guidelines for examining passengers with symptoms,” said Chidambar, District Vector Borne Diseases Control Officer.

He told The Hindu that a team would also be deployed at the railway station. Surveillance of passengers had to be done to check the spread of the disease.

186,2020/02/01,Health Department may screen people returning from China,"Even as health authorities in Mysuru gear up for a major awareness campaign on the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) scare, efforts are being made to get in touch with those who return from China following a holiday or a business trip as a preventive measure.

The authorities may bank on travel and tour operators here for information on those who had gone to China and returned to the city or place in the district either in December or January. The move comes close on the heels of the University of Mysore asking Chinese students who study on campus and are currently on vacation in China, not to return to the city amid a global concern over the coronavirus outbreak.

“The people who returned from China will be subjected to a usual medical examination as a precautionary measure since the outbreak emerged from China. If such persons have symptoms like cold, cough, throat infection, pain and other flu-like symptoms, they need to undergo the screening and symptomatic treatment,” sources in the Health Department said on Friday.

Deputy Commissioner Abhiram G. Sankar on Friday collected details from senior health officials on the steps taken by the department in the wake of the virus scare.

Meanwhile, the department has asked private hospitals to set aside a bed in their ICUs for the isolation of suspected patients. This is in addition to the quarantine ward with five beds. The hospitals had also been asked to screen the patients as per the guidelines issued by the Health Ministry and inform the department. A ward was ready at K.R. Hospital, that is attached to the Mysore Medical College and Research Institute.

Kiosks will be set up at major tourist destinations such as the Mysuru palace and zoo and health workers posted there will educate the public on the disease besides distributing the information on dos and don’ts. Medical officers and the staff were also being briefed about the outbreak to educate the community at their levels in their respective areas.

The National Institute of Virology in Pune is the authorised laboratory to test for 2019-nCoV and samples collected from the patients, if any, are sent here for tests. “The samples had to be sent through the department and the lab results may take four to five days,” the sources add.

“Those with flu-like symptoms were supposed to take symptomatic treatment to ensure their condition doesn’t worsen. The patients need to tell doctors if they have travelled abroad. There is no need to panic since necessary screening measures are in place,” a senior health official said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x0b689/article30706880.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGMYSURUNCOV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/health-department-may-screen-people-returning-from-china/article30706882.ece
187,2020/02/01,Journey time of some trains from Mysuru to Arsikere to be reduced from today,"The journey time of some trains from Mysuru to Arsikere will be reduced from February 1, 2020. Their timings have also been revised.

A release said the Mysuru Division of the South Western Railway will speed up the running time of some trains on the Mysuru-Arsikere section to reduce the time from a minimum of 15 minutes to a maximum of 35 minutes.

Scientific time-tabling and optimal utilisation of physical infrastructure at terminal stations at Arsikere helped. This is expected to benefit a cross-section of rail users.

Train No. 56267 Mysuru-Arsikere passenger has been speeded up by 35 minutes. It will depart from Arsikere at 5.40 a.m. instead of 5 a.m. and reach Mysuru at 9.30 a.m.

Train No. 56268 Mysuru – Arsikere passenger has been speeded up by 15 minutes between Hassan and Arsikere with revised timing. However there will be no change in timings between Mysuru to Hassan. The train will depart from Mysuru at 6.20 p.m. and reach Arsikere at 10.25 p.m. instead of 10.40 p.m.

188,2020/02/01,Banking services paralysed in Mysuru region,"Banking services were paralysed in Mysuru region as the two-day strike called by various bank unions, began on Friday. This is part of a nationwide strike called by the United Forum of Bank Unions to protest the delay in wage revision settlement for bank employees and officers due from November 2017 and five-day work week, among others.

H. Balakrishna, Convener, UFBU, Mysuru, said the wages and service conditions of bank employees and officers are governed by collective bargaining and bilateral agreements and are revised once in 5 years. The last settlement covered the period from November 2012 to October 2017 and hence a revised settlement with effect from November 2017, was pending.

Justifying their demand for a pay hike, the UFBU said the prices and cost of living had increased while the work load had increased enormously. Though a representation was made by the bank unions to the Indian Bank Association, it offered only a 2% hike against a demand for a 20% hike.

The UFBU which comprises nine bank unions, has chalked out an agitation programme apart from two-day strike on January 31 and February 1. It has also called for a three-day strike on March 11, 12 and 13 and an indefinite strike from April 1 2020.

The other demands include five-day banking, merger of special allowances with basic pay, updation of pension, improvement in family pension, exemption from income tax on retrial benefits without ceiling, defined working hours for officers, equal wage for equal work for contract employees and business correspondents, etc.

Though daily withdrawals were not affected as ATMs were replenished with cash ahead of the strike, it is expected to run out by Saturday or Sunday. However, private banks have not participated in the strike.

Earlier in the day, about 1,500 bank employees assembled in front of the State Bank of India zonal office near T.K. Layout and took out a procession raising slogans in support of their demands. The agitating employees will assemble in front of the Regional Office of the Corporation Bank next to hotel Southern Star and take out a procession at 10 a.m. on Saturday.

Strike criticised

However, the business establishments and those in trade have flayed the frequent strikes being resorted to by the bank employees. Sudhakar S. Shetty, former President of the Federation of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FKCCI) has written to the Reserve Bank of India Governor highlighting the debilitating impact of such frequent strikes being resorted to by the bank employees.

He said it cripples small and medium size businesses and effects the economy which was already reeling under duress. Hence he has appealed to the RBI and the government to bring the banking sector under the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), 1968, so as to avoid such strikes in future.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lvkz0b/article30706853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGMYSURUBANKSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/banking-services-paralysed-in-mysuru-region/article30706854.ece
189,2020/02/01,S.L. Bhyrappa speaks of laying down the pen,"Writer S.L. Bhyrappa referred to laying down his pen on Friday, saying that he was not getting any fresh ideas to give it work.

At an interactive programme organised by the Da. Ra. Bendre National Memorial Trust here on Friday, he said that all signs indicate that the time had come for him to lay down his pen. “I am not sure Kannada literature can expect any more books from me,” he said.

At the programme, organised to mark the birth anniversary of the poet laureate Da. Ra. Bendre, Mr. Bhyrappa said that after Uttarakanda, he had not written anything. Age might be a factor in the lack of fresh ideas, he said. Referring to writers taking a stand on social movements, he said it was not good for society. “If literature is produced favouring a movement, there are more chances that people will follow the book and media houses will give it wide publicity. If a writer takes a stand against the movement, everyone will pounce on him. A writer should keep abreast of the developments, but should not try to appease someone,” he said.

On the subject of medium of instruction in schools, Mr. Bhyrappa said that he had tried to impress upon the Prime Minister the need to have the mother tongue as the medium of instruction till class 4. “Later, English can be taught. Children can grasp more if taught in their mother tongue. Later, they develop the ability to learn a new language. Teaching subjects in dual languages will also be effective,” he said.

Referring to the Supreme Court order on leaving the decision on medium of instruction to parents, he said that in such a situation only a new Bill in Parliament could help save State languages.

He also claimed that the Prime Minister had “responded positively” to his request, but there was a likelihood of Opposition parties opposing any such Bill. However, he expressed hope that the government would take a concrete step after thorough discussions on the issue.

Taking exception to Brahmins being targeted for creating the caste system in the country, he said that castes in India originated based on occupation and were not created by anyone.

190,2020/02/01,Upgrading colleges coming under Mangalore University will get priority: Vice-Chancellor,"P.S. Yadapadithaya, Vice-Chancellor of Mangalore University, said on Friday that he had the responsibility of upgrading government colleges coming under the jurisdiction of the university.

He was speaking after inaugurating a national conference on ‘Contemporary issues in Commerce and Management’ organised by the Dr. G. Shankar Government Women’s First Grade College and Post-Graduate Study Centre.

Prof. Yadapadithaya said it was not enough for students to pass in their academic subjects; they required practical experience as well. A skill development centre will soon be started at the university, he said.

Students also require counselling, he said, and hence all colleges have been directed to appointed counsellors. Means are as important as ends when it comes to success in life. It is essential to give importance to the environment and people should live in harmony with it, he said. He also said it was heartening that the Dr. G. Shankar Govt Women’s College and PG Centre was organising a national conference for the first time, as it showed the progress being made by the college. Owing to the support given by local philanthropists, this institution has been able to make strides, Prof. Yadapadithaya said.

G. Shankar, patron of the college, said 70% of the students in the college and PG centre were poor and belonged to backward classes. Hence, Mangalore University should give priority to it and its students, he said.

The Padma Vibhushan award, two metal badges issued by the University of Mysore that were displayed at the museum, and ₹1,000 cash were stolen on November 23, 2015. Rashtrakavi Kuvempu Pratishthana, that manages the museum, subsequently lodged a complaint with the Tirthahalli police.

Based on footage of the burglary captured on surveillance cameras installed at the museum, the police had arrested three people — Revanasiddappa, Anjanappa and Prakash. While Revanasiddappa stole valuables from the museum, Anjanappa, who was serving as a guard there, helped him execute the crime. Prakash was accused of purchasing the stolen property.

Revanasiddappa, the first accused, died during the trial. After the hearing, the court held Anjanappa and Prakash guilty and awarded them two years imprisonment.

192,2020/02/01,DG&IGP Praveen Sood wants to harness technology in policing,"Citizen-centric policing and leveraging technology for it will be the focus of Praveen Sood, the State’s new Director-General and Inspector-General of Police. Addressing senior police officers soon after taking charge from Neelamani N. Raju, who retired from the post on Friday, Mr. Sood said he looked forward to heading the one lakh-strong police force, besides serving the 6.5 crore citizens of the State.

“It is a big responsibility and Ms. Raju handled it well, in good and bad times alike. I will continue to do that... not alone, but with the support of each one on the police force,” he said.

He added that as DG & IGP, it was his responsibility to look after not just the public, but also the police personnel. “Unless we take care of our police personnel, they will not be able to take care of the public,” he said.

Mr. Sood also said that the police force could not be increased endlessly, and that technology was the answer to making policing better and more efficient. “We have already introduced technology in many cases and that needs to be upgraded. We will also take the pilots that have been successful in different cities in the State, including Bengaluru, Mysuru and Hubballi-Dharwad, and scale them up to the State level,” he said. “An action plan will be drawn up after consultation with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai and senior police officers.”

When asked about terrorist activities, he said there would be no tolerance of terrorism and strict action would be taken against those indulging in it.

193,2020/02/01,‘Sugar beet a better alternative to sugarcane for farmers’,"The Union government will promote the cultivation of sugar beet, instead of sugarcane, to increase farmers’ income by reducing the cost of cultivation and increasing yield.

This will also achieve other objectives such as economic use of water, extending crushing season of sugar factories, and providing fodder for cattle and compostable biomass to farmers, say scientists of S. Nijalingappa Sugar Institute in Belagavi — the agency chosen for research and extension of the project in the State.

“The crop is already being widely cultivated in parts of Punjab. We want farmers in Karnataka to adopt it,” said R.B. Khandagave, director of the institute.

According to him, the crop takes only five months to grow, compared to the one year that sugarcane takes before it can be harvested. Sugar beet also needs relatively less water. It produces foliage that can be used as fodder for cattle and can be used for composting after harvesting. The farmers will benefit from its cultivation as the cost of cultivation is lower than that of sugarcane, and the sugar yield 1-2% more, he said. Sugar beet can be grown in less nutritious soils with minimum input.

“Usually, sugar factories crush cane only six or seven months a year. The rest of the year, they need to pay salary to their permanent employees who are without work. This time can be used to make sugar from sugar beet pulp. We will help farmers with the varieties and cultivation practices,” said Ashok Dalwai, CEO of the National Rainfed Area Authority, who is coordinating the project. Sugar factories have to make minor changes to their machinery to produce sugar from beet. The government will help them get the necessary technical know-how, he said.

He also said that the government would start an extension programme to popularise the crop. “We will organise field visits and interactions for farmers with scientists to clear their doubts,” he said. The authority has tied up with the Nijalingappa Sugar Institute in Karnataka and the Vasantdada Sugar institute in Maharashtra to popularise the crop and develop different strains of it.

An interaction with trainers, officers and farmers was held at the sugar institute in Belagavi on Thursday.

194,2020/02/01,A.H. Vishwanath to write book on fall of coalition government in Karnataka,"Former Minister A.H. Vishwanath, who lost the byelection to the Legislative Assembly from Hunsur on BJP ticket, said on Friday that he would soon come out with a book detailing the collapse of the Congress-JD(S) coalition regime and the installation of the BJP government in the State.

Mr. Vishwanath’s plan to chronicle the circumstances under which the regime change took place comes at a time when speculation is rife about his possible exclusion from the expanded Cabinet because of the byelection loss.

Speaking to a TV channel at his native place in K.R. Nagar, Mr. Vishwanath described the collapse of the coalition government and the installation of the BJP government as a historic moment in Karnataka politics. “For the first time, such a large number of MLAs came out [against the regime],” he said.

Mr. Vishwanath, who is regarded as one of the architects of the collapse of the H.D. Kumaraswamy government, said the book would reveal not only the reasons and circumstances behind the fall of the government, but also the events leading up to the the the BJP taking over.

He described the coalition government’s functioning as a “family property” and coalition politics as “demonic”. He said the “directionless, unconstitutional and anti-people” coalition government was removed by 17 coalition MLAs withdrawing their support.

Mr. Vishwanath, who has already penned books including the Halli Hakki Hadu and Matha Santhe, also said he expects Chief Minister B.S.

196,2020/02/01,5 killed in accident near Kuravilangadu,"Five members of a family, including three women, were killed when the car in which they were travelling rammed a wood-laden truck at Kalikavu, near Kuravilangadu, in the early hours of Saturday.

The deceased were identified as 68-year-old Thampi, a native of Thiruvathukkal in Kottayam; his 65-year-old wife Valsala; their daughter in-law Prabha, 45; Prabha’s son Arjun, alias Ambadi, 19; and her mother Usha Thomas, 58.

Preliminary investigations suggested that Ambadi, who had been driving the car, might have dozed off. The car, which veered into the opposite track while negotiating a curve, was completely damaged in the impact of the collision.

The Fire and Rescue Services unit from Kaduthuruthi, with the help of the police and local residents, cut open the damaged vehicle to take out the passengers.

197,2020/02/01,Food subsidy cut in budget draws flak,"The Union Budget proposal to cut food subsidy will hit a State like Kerala particularly hard, Minister for Civil Supplies P. Thilothaman has said.

The State has been receiving lower than its deserving share of subsidised grain, the Minister said on Saturday. Though Kerala deserves to get subsidised foodgrain for more than 60% of its population, the State gets these subsidised supplies only for about 46% of the population.

Former Union Minister for Consumer Affairs and architect of the 2013 Food Security Act K.V. Thomas said cutting food subsidy would eat into the right of the people for food security, which the Act was meant to ensure. The Act made it a right of the poor to get subsidised foodgrain and about 60% of Kerala had been covered under the Act, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/food-subsidy-cut-in-budget-draws-flak/article30716129.ece
198,2020/02/01,Budget has ignored Kerala: Pinarayi,"Expressing deep concern over the steep fall in the State’s share of Central taxes in the Union Budget, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had turned a blind eye to Kerala’s demands.

In a press note issued here on Saturday, he said the budget had nothing in it to strengthen the economy or address social security and development, instead it would aggravate inflation and unemployment. At a time when the country needed balanced development, the Centre had chosen to tread the opposite direction.

Mr. Vijayan said the budget proposal to impose 22% tax and surcharge on cooperative societies would have a debilitating impact on the cooperative sector in general and financial institutions in particular.

He said the Centre had completely ignored Kerala’s appeal for financial assistance to overcome two successive floods and deprived the State of its legitimate share of taxes.

The Chief Minister added that the Central government had chosen to brush aside the State’s memorandum seeking assistance for major projects like the semi-high-speed rail corridor, Sabari rail line, All India Institute of Medical Science, hike in rubber subsidy, raising of the ceiling on borrowing and rehabilitation of returning expatriates.

“The budget proposals to extend more tax sops for the corporate sector, the absence of projects to improve agricultural production, the move to sell off the government holding in the LIC and persist with globalisation policies despite setbacks are a pointer to the BJP government’s intentions,” he said.

Political vendetta

Left Democratic Front (LDF) convener A.Vijayaraghavan said that by sidelining Kerala in the budget, the Centre had declared war on the State.

199,2020/02/01,Stir to go on until CAA is repealed: Azad,"No citizen of the country will be allowed to be sent to detention camps in the name of citizenship, Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad has said.

He was addressing a march of citizens to Raj Bhavan organised by the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) here on Saturday. He said the peaceful struggle against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) would continue until these black laws are repealed.

“The beauty of this land is its unity despite its diverse languages and religions. I don’t understand the language of Kerala, but be it Uttarakhand or Himachal or some other place in a corner of the country, our demand is the same, that we want freedom from such black laws. In a democratic country like ours, only what the public wish should be allowed to happen. However, if someone has a mistaken view that the country should be run according to the whims of those at the RSS’s Nagpur headquarters, let that stand corrected. As long as Ambedkar’s Constitution exists, they will not be able to anything,” said Mr.Azad.

Call to remain vigilant

He exhorted the protesters to remain vigilant as the BJP government will do everything to break the protest.

“The people of this country appointed a ‘chowkidar’ (gatekeeper) to guard us. Now, that ‘chowkidar’ is asking the owners to produce proof of their citizenship. But the one good thing this government has done is that the people have all awoken due to their actions.

Now, the government is clearly scared. They will now make attempts to break our struggle. We should remain vigilant, as peaceful struggle is our biggest strength,” he said.

Mr. Azad began the speech by reading out the preamble of the Indian Constitution to the crowd.

SDPI president M.K. Faizi said that Union Home Minister Amit Shah who boasted that he would never go back from implementing the CAA would have to eventually bow down to strong protests.

201,2020/02/01,Governor approves KTU’s decision on second revaluation,"Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who conducted a hearing on Saturday to assess the contentious decision of the A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technological University to conduct a second revaluation for a former student, found a middle ground in the issue by approving the university’s decision, even while criticising the manner it had adopted.

Mr. Khan, who convened a two-hour-long hearing at Raj Bhavan in his capacity as the Chancellor of the university, observed that Vice Chancellor M.S. Rajasree was well within her statutory powers to adopt ‘emergency’ decisions for genuine cases, provided they were approved by statutory authorities such as the Board of Governors.

Such matters would have to be referred to the Chancellor if there was a difference of opinion among such panels, he said, according to sources privy to the discussions.

The hearing was called on the basis of a complaint submitted by the Save University Campaign committee which had accused the university of violating norms by acting at the behest of Higher Education Minister K.T. Jaleel. While convening an adalat, the Minister had allegedly ordered the university officials to revalue for the second time an answer script of a former BTech student, despite the Controller of Examinations turning down the student’s request earlier.

‘Meritorious case’

While endorsing the university’s move in view of the ‘meritorious case,’ the Governor found fault with its ‘inability to preserve the autonomy of the institution.’

He also reiterated his disapproval of the practice of adalats being organised by either the Minister or the government in matters relating to universities.

Directing the Vice Chancellor to ensure that ‘her house is in order,’ Mr. Khan called for caution against external interference at odds with the autonomy of universities.

The higher education sector did not function in a manner it ideally should, the Governor said, adding that the governments must play no role in the functioning of such institutions.

Besides the Vice Chancellor and the former student, the KTU Registrar, Deans, Syndicate members, Save University Campaign committee chairman R.S. Sasikumar, secretary M. Shajar Khan and lawyers representing either parties participated in the hearing.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-approves-ktus-decision-on-second-revaluation/article30716061.ece
202,2020/02/01,KAU celebrates foundation day,"The Kerala Agricultural University celebrated its 49th foundation day at the KAU Central Auditorium, Main Campus, Vellanikkara, on Saturday.

Inaugurating the function, Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar exhorted agriculture scientists and officials to dedicate themselves to the cause of farmers. He honoured the employees who had served KAU for more than 30 years.

He distributed awards for the best teacher (Jayasree Krishnankutty, Communication Centre, Mannuthy), best researcher (K.L. Karthikeyan, RARS, Pattambi), best extension scientist (Berin Pathrose), best research station (RARS, Pattambi), and best college (College of Agriculture, Vellayani).

Chief Whip K. Rajan presided over the programme. He too reminded the responsibility of all to remain relevant to farmers in these challenging times.

203,2020/02/01,Industry hails ‘forward-looking’ budget,"Captains of industry have welcomed the Union Budget 2020-21 as forward-looking and one aimed at the youth.

Chairman of Eastern Group of companies Navas Meeran, speaking at a session organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, Kerala chapter, here on Saturday said the budget addressed an aspirational India, wanting to build the quality of life in the country. “There are many positive takeaways,” he said.

Sterling Group chairman Shivadas B. Menon said the budget had laid the path for increasing farmer income as well as in building infrastructure to boost income from agriculture. In the food processing industry, the budget had focussed on properly utilising a massive quantity that was now wasted due to lack of processing and storage facilities, he said.

The budget had given due place to small and micro industrial units, said Laghu Udyog Bharati general secretary S. Venkiteswaran in a statement. Implementing invoice financing would help micro and small units, he said, while praising the proposal to exempt units with a turnover of up to ₹5 crore from auditing.

Tourism policy

Jose Dominic, co-founder of CGH Earth Group of hospitality industry units, said the government had realised the importance of building museums and making heritage an instrument for developing the tourism industry.

Azad Moopen, chairman and managing director of Aster DM Healthcare, said the budget had managed to create growth opportunities. The proposals for viability gap funding for hospitals in tier 2 and 3 cities for meeting the requirement for Ayushman Bharat and PPP model hospitals in districts would increase accessibility of people in smaller places to health care. But the allocation for the sector was just 1% of the GDP, which was grossly inadequate.

Tax breaks

Vivek Krishna Govind, tax practitioner, said there were many tax breaks in the budget that augured well for the future. Debate on the tax cuts would continue. However, abolition of double taxation in dividend distribution was a positive step. There was also a tax break for cooperatives on a par with the corporates, he said.

V.P. Nandakumar, MD of Manappuram Finance, said the decision to remove dividend distribution tax was much needed. The practice had resulted in “triple taxation of corporate earnings,” he said. The shift to a simplified scheme of personal income tax was a welcome move as it removed distortionary influences in the individual’s savings choices, he added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/industry-hails-forward-looking-budget/article30716044.ece

206,2020/02/01,nCoV: condition of patient satisfactory,"The condition of a medical student admitted to the isolation ward of the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thrissur, after she tested positive for coronavirus is satisfactory, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja has said.

Fresh samples of her body fluid were sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, on Saturday.

As of Saturday, 1,793 people are in the State’s surveillance list, of which 71 with mild flu-like symptoms are being kept in isolation wards in various hospitals.

Till date 39 samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, for testing, out of which 23 have turned out to be negative. The remaining results are awaited. Health officials said 58 people who might have come in contact with the confirmed infection in the State, including those who travelled with her, had been traced and put under surveillance.

The officials said those in hospitals would be discharged only when they totally recovered from all suspected symptoms. Their fluid samples were being collected on alternate days and they would be discharged after two consecutive negative results.

Meanwhile, the police have registered a case against one more person on the charge of spreading fake news about people under surveillance.

The outpatient wings of the Thrissur MCH, which usually witness heavy rush, were almost empty on Saturday. Though health officials have tried to allay their concerns, people are avoiding visits to the hospital unless there is an emergency.

Increased surveillance

Special Correspondent writes from Thiruvananthapuram: The Health Department has intensified its disease surveillance activities and expanded the isolation and treatment facilities for nCoV infection in all districts.

The surveillance mechanism has been strengthened by involving local bodies and the community, so that people with a recent travel history to China are encouraged to self-report to health authorities and put themselves under home quarantine.

The tourism industry has been put on alert about tourist arrivals from China and to ensure that these persons are reported to the authorities.

An official bulletin said all persons under isolation in various hospitals were also remaining stable.

A 24x7 control room has been set up in the State and all district headquarters. It also said the facilities for nCoV testing would be made available at the NIV’s Alappuzha unit from Sunday.

Arrangements for the isolation and treatment of nCoV had been made at Thiruvananthapuram Government Medical College Hospital.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/p325p/article30716109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv02coronass,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncov-condition-of-patient-satisfactory/article30715999.ece
207,2020/02/01,Centre wants to wage war against State: Isaac,"The Union Budget for 2020-21 is a big setback for Kerala and the intention of the Centre is to wage war against the State, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said.

“The State has been neglected and the Union Budget is disappointing. The share of Central tax that was ₹17,872 crore in 2019-20 has been reduced to ₹15,236 crore as Kerala’s share has been reduced from 2.5% to 1.9% based on the 15th Finance Commission report. We were expecting a share of ₹20,000 crore,” Dr. Isaac said at a press conference here on Saturday.

Dr. Isaac, who is preparing the State Budget to be presented on February 7, said mobilising additional resources would be a big challenge for him. Pointing out that the State was yet to access the commission report cited in the Union Budget, Dr. Isaac said the only hope was on revenue deficit grant.

The commission had also reduced the share of States in the divisible pool of Central taxes by one percentage point to 41% in view of the change in status of Jammu and Kashmir to two Union Territories. While the Centre’s deficit had been pegged at 5%, it had not bothered to increase the deficit of the States even by 0.5%. “The intention is to prevent taking loans from the consolidated fund.”

Demands ignored

The demands raised by the State like rubber subsidy, increase in pension of senior citizens, takeover of public sector undertakings, and new projects had been ignored. The Union Minister had not learnt from last year’s budget and the 2020-21 budget was silent on the economic slowdown.

“The budget has stated that economic growth will be reduced to 4.9% in the current year. But, Ms. Nirmala Seetharaman has concealed the economic slowdown that will lead to it,” he said.

Instead of collecting ₹7.6 lakh core as corporate tax, only ₹6.1 lakh crore had been collected. Corporates were getting huge tax concessions but investment had not gone up. Dr. Isaac said the policy of the Centre was to sell PSUs to these corporates. Income tax had been made complex with exemptions instead of simplifying it.

The Union Finance Minister had not heeded to the unanimous request of State Finance Ministers to increase the purchasing power of the people.

The outlay for the employment guarantee scheme and women empowerment had been reduced. Outlay for health and education missions and rural development had not gone up. The outlay for anganwadis had gone up only by 3%.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centre-wants-to-wage-war-against-state-isaac/article30715986.ece

210,2020/02/01,A world of opportunity awaits farmers online,"If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the Palliakkal Primary Cooperative Bank has an entire State queuing up to pay it compliments.

Over the past 20 years, the bank has backed small and marginal farmers to the hilt, providing them the A to Z of farming and built a legacy that will now be leveraged by the State, which wants to build a platform that will partly imitate online service aggregators to bring together farmers, landowners, consumers, bankers, technology providers and more.

“It will be an ever-expanding platform, growing as it addresses new needs,” said an official familiar with the development and referring to the recent launch of a mobile application that brings together organic food producers in the State and consumers. It will be possible now for consumers anywhere in the world to access organic produce from the State.

The development of the online platform and related applications are being carried out under the aegis of the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council. There is a big demand for organic produce from Palliakkal farmers, said president of the cooperative bank M.S. Vijayachandran. Reaching out to customers has been a difficult task. He is confident that an effective distribution network can be developed to match the growing demand.

211,2020/02/01,‘Eat Right School Kerala’ begins,"Nearly 300 students from five city schools signed up to become ambassadors of the Eat Right School Kerala 2020 campaign here on Friday.

Implemented by the Food Safety Department as part of the Aardram mission in the district, Eat Right School Kerala aims at creating healthy food habits among children, helping them identify food with adulterants, and reduce junk food intake so as to grow into a healthy generation.

Eat Right School is a campaign of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to get children to eat food that is safe and right (Safe and Nutritious Food at School). The aim is to engage with children and include them in conversations about healthy eating, especially in the wake of a high burden of lifestyle diseases.

The FSSAI recently released draft regulations on safe food and healthy diet for students.

Food Safety officials said Eat Right School was also connected with other initiatives such as setting hygiene parameters for street vendors such as training and certification. The students ambassadors should make others students aware of the importance of eating safe and right, they said.

As part of the launch of Eat Right School Kerala, yoga, a session on mental health, and walkathon from Kanakakkunnu to Chandrasekharan Nair Stadium’s Bhagyamala auditorium were organised for students.

213,2020/02/01,Crisis along the coast: Dust of Maradu demolitions yet to settle in Kerala,"Squatting on the floor of his one-room hut in Nayarambalam, a coastal village in Kochi, Arayakulam Raju rummages through the documents that he has fished out of a steel cabinet. An old pedestal fan, the only luxury he owns, whirrs laboriously as he searches for something. The roof of his rickety house is covered with asbestos sheets. The walls are lined with wooden planks. Household utensils are strewn all over a small extension of the room, which doubles up as the kitchen.

A decade ago, the fisherman had bought a three-cent holding on the banks of the Punchayil Canal, which is today a near-stagnant waste ground with overgrown weeds and garbage. Raju pulls out a copy of a building plan. “Though submitted for approval two years ago, it was not considered. The officials say I have to construct the building at least 10 metres away from the canal considering the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notifications, and submit a fresh plan accordingly. After setting off the mandatory space, only a narrow strip of land will be left,” he says. Though Raju’s application for financial aid under Mission LIFE, a housing scheme of the State government, was cleared, construction could not begin for want of an approved building plan.

A list of violators

As Raju’s wait for a home continues, Kerala is grappling with over 26,000 reported instances of CRZ violations in the State. Billionaire industrialists, hoteliers and riverside resort owners are on the list of violators. The magnitude of the violations and possible legal actions are likely to snowball into a socio-economic and legal crisis in the coastal State, which is yet to recover from the shock of the recent demolition of four skyscrapers constructed at Maradu in Kochi in violation of the CRZ rules, following an order from the Supreme Court. Four illegal apartments, which came up on the banks of the Vembanad Lake, a Ramsar site, were pulled down in two days after evicting its residents.

But things did not end there. On January 10, on the eve of the demolition of two apartment complexes, the Supreme Court struck another blow for CRZ rules by ordering the demolition of Kapico Resorts, 54 seven-star villas built on an island in Vembanad Lake. The nearly ₹600 crore resorts came up by illegally reclaiming Nediyathuruthu, an island in the lake, which has been classified as a Critically Vulnerable Coastal Area.

The ecological significance of the Vembanad Lake system has been reiterated by the CRZ notifications time and again. The 2019 notification too listed Vembanad as a Critically Vulnerable Coastal Area and clubbed it along with the Sundarbans of West Bengal and the Gulf of Khambhat and the Gulf of Kutch of Gujarat. Section 3.1 of the CRZ rules states that critically vulnerable coastal areas should be managed with the involvement of coastal communities, including fisherfolk who depend on coastal resources for their sustainable livelihood.

The present list of violations was drawn up after an affidavit was submitted by the Kerala Chief Secretary in the Supreme Court during the Maradu case hearing. The court was assured that all such violations would be identified, and the officials and builders who facilitated them taken to task. Incidentally, this is the first time there is judicial scrutiny by the apex court of CRZ violations in the State.

Going by the rulebook, Kaduvankasseri Ajeesh, a traditional fisherman, who has set up a 900 sq ft home on a small holding near Puthen Kadappuram in Vypeen, a coastal village in Kochi, is also a violator. The local body has refused to assign a door number to the house which he constructed using financial aid from Matsyafed, a fishermen’s cooperative. The reason? He had not obtained prior CRZ clearance for constructing the house on the holding, which is surrounded on three sides by Pokkali fields, an ecologically important area where paddy farming and fish culture are carried out in turns. A canal flows hardly 20 metres away from his house. There is no direct road access to the holding. A narrow and slushy path that meanders through a thicket of overgrown weeds and mangrove vegetation for about 500 metres leads to the place. “My house was denied the door number as I had constructed it before obtaining CRZ clearance,” says Ajeesh. “We don’t have any other place to go to. Half the holding has been assigned to my brother Aneesh, who is also finding it difficult to construct a house. The hitches caused in the name of CRZ clearance are preventing him from fulfilling his dream of having a house,” says Ajeesh.

Categories under CRZ

Since the notification issued on February 19, 1991, the development paradigm of coastal areas has been defined by CRZ norms. The CRZ rules were notified by invoking Section 3 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The notifications were issued “to conserve and protect the unique environment of coastal stretches and marine areas, [the] livelihood security of fisher communities and other local communities, and to promote sustainable development” by taking into account the dangers of natural hazards and sea-level rise due to global warming. The notification “declared the coastal stretches of the country and the water area up to its territorial water limit, excluding the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep and the marine areas surrounding these islands, as Coastal Regulation Zone.”

The CRZ-1 areas are the most environmentally critical. They are further classified as CRZ-1(A) and CRZ-I(B). CRZ-1(A) covers mangroves, corals and coral reefs, sand dunes, biologically active mudflats, inter-tidal zones, and nesting grounds of turtles and birds. It also includes national parks, marine parks, sanctuaries, reserve forests, wildlife habitats and other protected areas, biosphere reserves, salt marshes, sea grass beds and areas or structures of archaeological importance and heritage sites.

Also Read Lessons from Maradu

The CRZ-1(B) category includes the intertidal zone, the area between the Low Tide Line and the High Tide Line. The High Tide Line is defined as the line on the land up to which the highest water line reaches during the spring tide. The line is demarcated by the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management.

The notification also prescribes restrictions and regulations for construction and development activities in each zone. There are permissible and non-permissible activities in each zone. Prior clearance from the State Coastal Zone Management Authority is to be obtained before initiating any development activity. The third notification, the latest, was issued on January 18, 2019.

A no objection certificate from the State Coastal Zone Management Authority is a prerequisite for a coastal local body for approving a building plan in the CRZ area, explains a senior functionary of the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA). Maradu demolitions and the Supreme Court order in the Kapico case, he says, are defining moments in the State’s environmental history, where the long arm of law caught up with the violators, though a decade later.

Also Read After Maradu, CRZ violation by Kapico Kerala Resorts in Vembanad Lake to come up in Supreme Court

The dust may have settled on the Maradu demolitions, but processing the nearly 26,000 cases of suspected CRZ violations will be a backbreaking exercise for the Environment Department. Special teams may have to be formed for scrutinising the list, which was compiled by the district committees formed in the 10 coastal districts.

With local body elections due in the State in another eight months and Assembly elections next year, both the ruling front and the opposition are likely to tread a careful path on this sensitive issue. With the list of violations to be submitted before the Supreme Court, the State will have a lot of explaining to do. Tough questions are likely to come up in the courtrooms in the coming days.

Lack of experts?

At the same time, there is criticism over the manner in which the list of violations was drawn up. Though committees were constituted to identify the violations, they didn’t have any experts familiar with the CRZ rules, says K.V. Thomas, former head of the Coastal Process Group of the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapuram. Thousands of cases of illegal reclamation of coastal wetlands might have escaped the attention of the committee members as the focus was on the buildings that came up in the CRZ areas. The absence of experts would have helped major violators escape scrutiny, he says.

Also Read Vembanad route to track CRZ violations in Kerala

As the CRZ notifications have classified the coastal areas into different zones based on their ecological significance, the violations should also be classified based on the zones where they have been identified. There should not be any compromise on the violations reported in Zone 1, says Thomas.

The violations which are listed as prohibited activities in the CRZ notifications should be treated separately, he says. The list should be critically evaluated by expert teams comprising representatives of the Coastal Zone Management Authority, the Chief Town Planner, and various stakeholders. Also, the draft list should be put up for a social audit, Thomas suggests. Charles George, the State president of Kerala Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedi, who has been in the forefront of many a battle against the CRZ violations, says the list was drawn up mostly by revenue officials. The team was handicapped by the absence of CRZ experts, he says.

Ecosystem people

Trade unions of fishermen and ecologists are now demanding that the traditional coastal dwellers and fishermen be treated as ecosystem people and be allowed to construct houses and other social and livelihood facilities on the shores and waterfront areas. Earlier, a committee constituted by the KCZMA had recommended that fishermen and coastal communities be permitted to construct homes on the banks of filtration ponds as their lives and livelihood options are inextricably linked to the ecosystem. Such an approach should be adopted in case of CRZ rules for fishermen too, suggests Thomas.

While scrutinising the violations, says Charles George, a distinction should be made between violations by powerful business groups and resorts and those by traditional fishermen. Relaxations should be provided exclusively to ecosystem people. The laws governing the coastal ecosystems need to consider the population density of the coastal areas and the livelihood options of the traditional communities, he says. A people’s commission on CRZ violations has started collecting complaints from the general public. It will collect complaints from all the coastal districts, compile them and submit them to the authorities, he says.

Considering the gravity of the situation and the socio-political and economic turmoil the actions against the CRZ violations can trigger, officials are taking a guarded approach. They are waiting for the State government to take a call. “We will have to discuss the issue with the State government before proceeding with the list of violators. This is an issue which will have far-reaching consequences,” says a senior functionary of the government.

Geographically, Kerala is sandwiched between the hill ranges of the Western Ghats and the sea, says the official. There are many environment laws that cover both the mountain chain and the coastline, placing curbs on the areas available for development. Regarding CRZ violations, the law makes no distinction between small-scale violations and larger ones by commercial groups. The question before the government is regarding the approach to these violations, says the official. The CPI(M), the leading partner in the LDF government in the State, is yet to take a call on the sensitive issue. The party has not discussed the issue, says P. Rajeev, the CPI(M) State Secretariat member and a former Member of Parliament.

Concerns of further harm

Meanwhile, the demolition drive has not gone down well with a section of ecologists who fear that razing the structures would further harm the ecology of the region. Coastal ecosystem experts feel that the focus should be on reinstating the ecological rights of the ‘ecosystem people’ and on eco-restoration of the affected areas. While the violations in Zone 1 should be sternly dealt with, the government should take over the buildings that have come up in other zones and adopt a liberal approach to the cases of ecosystem people, suggests Thomas.

V.S. Vijayan, former chairman of the Kerala State Biodiversity Board, says demolitions will be a colossal blunder as they will take a toll on the ecology. The people who will be forced out of the illegal buildings may again construct houses and villas, leading to increased demand for granite and other construction materials. This will lead to further destruction of the Western Ghats, which is already facing serious environmental challenges. Before pushing for demolition, the authorities should take stock of the ecological footprint of such acts, he says.

The houses that have been built in violation of the rules should be given to the ecosystem people and the homeless. The officials who aided such constructions should be awarded exemplary punishment and those who built the homes and structures should be allowed to construct only eco-friendly homes without taxing the environment, Vijayan suggests. At the same time, those at the Authority question the logic behind these arguments as no law empowers the State to take over such buildings. The State can act only in accordance with the provisions of the law, says the official.

P.B. Sahasranaman, a lawyer specialising in environmental law, says the Central government is bound to check how the violations have taken place and decide on remedial measures. Only the Central government can decide whether to demolish the structures or adopt remedial actions as prescribed in the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, he says. A hurried preparation of the Coastal Zone Management Plan, the vision document spelling out the development paradigm in coastal stretches, will lead to improper implementation of the CRZ notifications, and will be blamed for the present fiasco, he says.

Baby John, a former member of the KCZMA, feels that violations by industry majors, hoteliers and resorts and those by the fishermen should not be treated alike. While dealing with the violations committed by fishermen, a humanitarian approach should be adopted. They should be provided adequate compensation and rehabilitation, he says. Though the Authority had earlier identified 65 cases of major CRZ violations by resorts, business houses and others, no action was initiated on these cases. The crackdown should focus on the major violations that were identified earlier, he says. Most of the nearly 12 lakh fishermen of Kerala, including the marine and inland fishermen, reside near the waterbodies and they cannot be thrown out of their dwellings citing the CRZ violations, he argues. Even after the KCZMA decided to act against several instances of CRZ violations, no action was initiated at the ground. The violations continue due to the unholy nexus between politicians and civic officials. This nexus should be broken and the erring officials and politicians taken to task, he says.

The scrutiny on the CRZ violations could trigger widespread protests and resistance in the state. How the coastal State will tide over the impending crisis remains to be seen.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/ir3ny4/article30705896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Kapico-Resorts,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/crisis-along-the-coast-dust-of-maradu-demolitions-yet-to-settle-in-kerala/article30705900.ece
214,2020/02/01,Wield the right words,"For last year’s words belong to last year’s language.

And next year’s words await voice.

— T.S. Eliot

A beginning is a time when I tend to ruminate on ways to improve the experience of living; to better live the days that are ahead, or simply do the mundane differently. The first month of 2020, this habit made me ponder on the noise that typified the end of the last decade — the incessant volume of inventive, audacious and dissonant lexicon that has crept into common usage. Words carry immeasurable power over us — the power to harm, heal, captivate and disarm. For me, words have the power of therapy, connection and collective outreach, often in a subliminal way.

With words potentially as a source of strength, we must consider how a war chest of efficient words can act as a potion to quell chaos and dissonance — simple words made of sincerity and brevity. Because, it is true that ‘the words you speak become the house you live in’.

We speak and hear differently. In between the cracks of our differences are recurring feelings, familiar emotions and reflexes that are bridged with words that can potentially blur the differences, deepen our arguments and engender honest participation. To respond at a level of harmony, we will need to conclusively switch from lazy words to words that are mindful, that require the rigour of choosing. The first step here is to overhaul our daily speech. For instance, some lazy, insincere, convenient expressions that abound —‘I will try’, ‘this is nice’ or ‘let’s catch up soon’— spoken to substitute the straightforward ‘no’.

Need for rigour words

As we speak mindfully, the words we choose induce response and reflection, make us pause, uplift and connect us and foster sincere relationships. I share a partial list of my own rigour words:

Action-words:

Thrive (not win), strive (not try), nourish, accept, contemplate, consider, pause, say ‘no’

Guiding words:

I intend to, I listen, I matter, I feel, I will create, I belong, I feel connected to, I think, I wonder (instead of I know), I am thankful.

Nouns:

Love, balance, intention, grace, gratefulness, generosity, magnificence, Carpe Diem.

And while you enlist your words of intent, select the ones that bring you closest to you, those that in a moment of disarray guide you to reason, calm and connect. In this process, you will also look in vain for words that elude the imperfect gap in emotions that no word can replace. The trick is not to forget the gap; the gaps are merely placeholders until words appear in an inspired moment. Just make sure to tune-in.

Because, simply put, we need words of belonging that move us towards each other, not from each other; ways of being human that open up the possibilities of experiencing together; ways of navigating our differences that deepen our curiosity, our friendship, our capacity to disagree and the arguments of living on this planet. This is what we need. This is the work each of us needs to do for an extraordinary experience of life.

215,2020/02/01,Even experts have doubts,"Most people respect the assurance that a confident leader exudes. But like all good things, confidence also has to be measured. While too little is indicative of insecurity, an overdose can also spell trouble, especially for leaders. In an article in Scientific American Mind, management consultant Khatera Sahibzada, gives us pointers to avoid getting sucked in by the persuasive pull of overconfident people.

Be aware that we often conflate confidence with competence. Haven’t we all felt safer in the hands of a doctor who comes up with a pat diagnosis instead of dithering over several possibilities? Don’t we prefer professors who answer our questions instead of those who hem and haw saying they need to think about them? According to psychologist Maria Konnikova, this is because humans prefer certainty over ambiguity. To avoid a sense of unease, we may buy into the definitive assertions of confident people. However, confidence is not a proxy for accuracy. Instead, if we learn to tolerate ambivalence, we are more open to other possibilities and thus less likely to fall under the spell of overconfidence.

We also need to identify and appreciate what Sahibzada calls “intellectual humility.” While expertise in any domain is always welcome, remember that even experts too have their doubts and limits. Those with hubris are unlikely to reveal their vulnerabilities as they do not want their reputation tainted. Besides, as noted Nobel laureate, Daniel Kahneman, says experts,

including doctors, “who acknowledge the full extent of their ignorance” don’t necessarily impress their clients.

Gather the facts

Another telltale sign of overconfidence is when people fail to pay heed to their subordinates, even if their juniors are more knowledgeable in certain areas. Leaders, who seldom take advice from others, can be blinded by their egos and may fail to avert avoidable crises. Be it a CFO or a senior surgeon, watch out for those who dismiss the concerns of a junior offhandedly.

You also need to be skeptical of bold claims that overconfident people make. Ask for data that backs up their assertions. If they avoid giving you concrete evidence or fail to specify sources to support their stance, your antennae should be raised. When someone, especially in a position of power, is unwilling to field questions, then you are possibly smelling a rat.

In an article in Harvard Business Review, Elizabeth Tenney, Nathan Meikle and David Hunsaker, observe that overconfidence is expressed through two channels. When people make assertions like, “I am 99% certain,” their claims can usually be tested against “actual performance and outcomes.” Hence, we are more likely to spot instances of overconfidence. A more subtle, but nevertheless, forceful manner in which overconfidence is communicated is using non-verbal cues such as tone of voice and gestures. When confidence is signalled non-verbally, we may be swayed without necessarily being aware. Thus, the authors coax us to watch out for behaviours like “standing tall, speaking loudly, and dominating conversation.” If you feel a person is exhibiting overconfidence, you can ask questions or gather data to verify their claims.

216,2020/02/01,Skill enhancement matters,"Online employment-oriented service providers have been failing at bridging various gaps at both the employers’ and the applicants’ level. A number of problems including unreliable endorsements of skills, failure to connect the right profiles to the organisations, and spamming, have made such applications appear unwelcoming. However, Youth4work, an online application for students and professionals, has navigated its path by emphasising on enhancing skills and building a good profile.

Profile building

The application is useful for college-goers, and has tie-ups with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and University Grants Commission (UGC). An eminent mastermind with a decade’s experience in the field, Rachit Jain, Founder, and CEO of Youth4work sheds more light.

Why is skill enhancement given emphasis?

Every year, a majority of the workforce released into the job market is mediocre and unskilled. Since these underachievers are not properly equipped to survive in an already diminishing job market, they face trouble finding the right jobs, and end up contributing to the worsening unemployment rate. Thus, the requirement has always been for skills.

How does Youth4work cater better to users’ needs?

We prepare the youth to identify and make the right career decisions for themselves. We have mock tests, practice and skill-based tests for all kinds of jobs, and our online portal measures the potential of each aspirant individually and suggests where improvements can be made. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) model on which the website works allows us to evaluate user performances in the most optimal manner and this, in turn, helps us to cater to them even better.

What are the practice tests that are available?

There are more than 5,000 online ‘ytests’ (mock tests for practice) and more than 800 prep tests (preparation tests for the purpose of clearing competitive government/private exams such as SSC, CAT, and so on). Each test is unique and the AI algorithms decide how hard or easy the next question in the test should be.

How are the tests conducted?

Once the test starts, all other screens become inaccessible, other than the test screen itself; so, one cannot take Google’s help. Each question of the online mock test has a time limit attached to it depending upon the difficulty level. It is so to bring efficiency in answering.

How long does the process of connecting youngsters to an organisation take?

It happens within hours, depending upon what sort of opportunities are being sought by the youth. Scores are calculated immediately after the test ends and ‘yrank’ is generated based on the individual’s performance. More than 33,000 recruiters refer to the rank board.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/education/8ikgsj/article30709982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20EPBSYouth4work-1-fin,https://www.thehindu.com/education/skill-enhancement-matters/article30709984.ece
217,2020/02/01,Making universities more universal,"The challenges posed by globalisation and revolution in information technology worldwide are impacting everyone, and higher educational institutions are no exception. The very talk of challenges faced by universities, especially in India, is a positive sign as it makes academics and administrators look at ways to re-invent the scheme of things in classrooms and beyond.

In the current era of rapidly-changing knowledge, it is undoubtedly important to keep pace with the goings-on, but institutions are finding it difficult, for different reasons. ‘New knowledge’ requires research, an area that universities are not properly equipped, either by way of faculty or proper infrastructure. This is critical as fruits of research will have to be delivered to students and the masses in a timely manner.

Financing

Finance is an area that has always been a challenge and especially so for a developing country like India and educational institutions in the country face this situation more as subsidised education comes with a price. Although self-financing institutions are trying to do their best, they also ultimately depend on the government for support. There is the element of government funding that comes with checks and controls but the quantum of funding to private institutions is negligible as much of the funds are diverted to central institutions and a few hand-picked institutes. There is a limit to the deep pockets of private institutions as they have to constantly pump money into infrastructure so as to stay relevant in the market. The negligible industrial involvement or investment, as well as the fact that India does not yet have a big legacy to speak of by way of support from alumni, adds to this.

Faculty

Perhaps, the biggest challenge to universities is that of recruitment and retention of faculty as a large number of young graduates, including those with postgraduate and doctoral degrees, avoid teaching as a profession. What then happens is that the available pool of teachers is not geared to perform routine tasks with the needed finesse. In effect, a large fraction of the fraternity is teachers by chance, not by choice. Administrators of higher educational institutions are looking for ways to deal with this issue; only then, universities can thrive academically and intellectually.

Inter-disciplinary

There is no doubt that we live in a highly competitive world where investments in new developments are high and hence comes the need to focus on multi-disciplinary and inter-disciplinary approaches to seek answers for local problems and requirements. New knowledge is developed more easily in overlapping legions of different disciplines as opposed to a uni-dimensional or a traditional way of looking at problems. Institutions of higher learning will have to come to terms with courses cutting across disciplines, not just from the perspective of job marketability but in the widening of intellectual horizons.

Governance

Many a times, there is a complaint that universities are not given enough autonomy to do the job they are supposed to. To be fair, autonomy or the framework for governance is adequate, only that institutional leadership has not used it effectively or purposefully. An argument can be made that there has been less adequate grooming for senior-level administrators, many of whom think that they can get to the top by relying only on academic credentials.

Ranking

One other obsession we seem to have developed in recent times is about international rankings. Every time we do not figure high in such a list, questions are raised about our standards even for top Indian institutions. It is well-known that these institutions, at least at the undergraduate level, are producing competitive graduates who are highly sought after internationally, both for jobs and higher education. Therefore, such a self-defeating approach towards ranking should be avoided, and we should focus more on enhancing quality and ratings rather than rankings.

Regulations

Regulations are required, but in many instances, they are complicated by various agencies and councils. Some of the external regulations are good, but in an overall context they seem to erode the effectiveness of a university’s culture — some councils and accrediting agencies demand several facilities such as separate land, faculty, library, infrastructure, and hostel, just to mention a few. All this fuss in the name of signing off on requirements for approvals to operate eventually end up making universities less universal.

218,2020/02/01,"Meet prosthetic artist Zuby Johal, the creator of zombies in 'Ghost Stories' and Hastar in 'Tumbbad'","Of all the things in Zuby Johal’s basement, the most conspicuous are the many body parts: two grotesque heads, four hands of varying colours and sizes, and several stray fingers. They evoke not repulsion or fear but awe. For, the details in them, including the wrinkles on knuckles and the frowns on the brows, advertises Zuby’s labour in making them. But she points out they are discarded or incomplete works. It’s perhaps why the craftsmanship was apparent — a good prosthetic artist’s creation obscures the effort that went into it. Like a skilled magician’s trick, it fools you into believing that it’s real. And, Zuby’s works can achieve this level of verisimilitude. The censor board, for instance, refused to believe, until she wrote to them, that the cat in Finding Fanny was prosthetics. You could say the same about her other works, too, which include the Gangs of Wasseypur films, Uyare, Tumbbad, and Ghost Stories (in which she employed foam latex, which is hardly used in India).

Zuby, who runs Dirty Hands Studio with her partner Rajiv Subba (both post graduates in ceramic and glass design from National Institute of Design) talks about her work.

Prosthetics are used in films of all genres these days. It is not just used for making a young person look old. All the cuts, wounds, scars, pregnant bellies, you see are prosthetics.

Excerpts:-

Can you talk about the process of creating the makeup?

Most of the time, it’s a collaborative effort. After reading the script, we research. For example, in [Dibakar Banerjee’s segment of] Ghost Stories, we researched on evolution because we were making a creature which was half-human, half-animal. Then, a lot of back and forth happens with the director. With Photoshop, we make a few illustrations of the final look. It makes both our lives easier — the director knows exactly what he's getting and I know what I'm making.

Once we finalise the look, then we go ahead with the sculpting stage. If I need to put the prosthetics on you, then I might require a live mould of your face and convert that into fibre. Then, I sculpt on the fibre face. After this, we start adding the textures according to the character’s age and if it has any cuts or wounds. For example, we mixed six shades of dyed natural hair in Ghost Stories to get the look we wanted for the creature.

Prosthetic makeup is apparent when there's an extraordinary character like a zombie (in Ghost Stories) or a 300-year-old oracle (Raabta). But you have worked in movies like Gangs of Wasseypur and Uyare, too, which are more rooted in reality. How often is prosthetic makeup used in films these days?

Not so much until 2008. But ever since, I would say, there has been an 80% increase. Prosthetics are used in films of all genres these days. It is not just used for making a young person look old. All the cuts, wounds, scars, pregnant bellies, you see are prosthetics.

You have worked in a low-budget film like Tumbbad and a big one like Fan. What are the differences between the two?

In Fan, we had to create a mannequin of Shah Rukh Khan for the Madame Tussauds scene. But the museum didn’t allow a mannequin from outside to be installed there. So, it wasn’t used. And, Tumbbad was an enriching experience. There were a lot of firsts for us. We hadn’t made bodysuits before that. So, we learnt through trial and error. In fact, while working for Ghost Stories, I messaged Mitesh Shah (the screenwriter of Tumbbad) that we could have done certain things differently. With the experience we have now, we could have given a much better output. But I learn from my failures.

Well, the budget does make a difference. In big budget movies, you get a lot more time to work on the details because you can hire more specialists. But it isn’t only about the money. It’s about what the director wants as well. So, the idea is important.

You haven’t worked on a biopic yet. But will it be more difficult to work on a character in the real world?

No, biopics will actually be very easy because you already know what the person looks like. All you need to do is to recreate that person’s mould. We made a mannequin of Gandhiji which moves the chakra (using animatronics) at the Gandhi Teerth in Jalgaon, Maharashtra.

There was a time when directors would outsource prosthetic makeup from abroad. Now, including you, there are several specialists who has worked in many films. What has changed now?

It has to do with the change in the kind of movies that came out. [During the late 2000s], we saw directors like Anurag Kashyap making content-driven movies. Until then, it was just the star vehicles, love stories, comedies. But through movies like Gangs of Wasseypur, new opportunities emerged. There was this new wave of directors and different movies. Things like wounds and cuts had to look natural. And, with more emphasis on animal rights these days, we have to recreate an entire animal. But I see more talented prosthetics artists coming into the industry. They should be given a chance. We don’t need to outsource our work anymore.

What are you working on right now?

Love Aaj Kal 2 [directed by Imitial Ali] is set for release. Other than that, we are working on AK vs AK (by Vikramaditya Motwane). There’s also a Yash Raj Films project and a couple of things that we are doing for Amazon Prime and Netflix. But, after Uyare, I like to work on more South Indian movies. It’s one of the reasons I chose to remain in Bangalore despite doing a lot of Bollywood films.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bfiwj5/article30712807.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGM-ZUBYJOHAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/meet-prosthetic-artist-zuby-johal-the-creator-of-zombies-in-ghost-stories-and-hastar-in-tumbbad/article30712814.ece

220,2020/02/01,‘Meendum Oru Mariyathai’ is a tribute to ‘Mudhal Mariyathai’: Bharathiraja,"There seems to be some issue with the projection at Bharathi Raja International Institute of Cinema (BRIIC) when the projectionist plays the video songs of Meendum Oru Mariyathai, to select journalists. Amongst us sits a man who has been a witness to several transformations in cinema — from cinemascope to digital filmmaking. Bharathiraja is a silent spectator at the screening and makes a snarky remark: “Hmm... digital,” he says with a groan, as if to imply: “Is this what you call digital?”

A poetic touch

Bharathiraja says that he is willing to admit what most people wouldn’t when they cross a certain age. “You tend to discover new feelings when you hit your 50s or 60s,” he says, about wanting to explore subjects that are often brushed under the carpet in society. Meendum Oru Mariyathai is one such exploration between an older man and a young woman. But he corrects me when I ask if it is a ‘love story’ — “How you see and define love is all that matters,” he says.

The title, in fact, is a homage to his own Mudhal Mariyathai starring Sivaji Ganesan and Radha, wherein he dealt with a similar theme. Mudhal Mariyathai worked with a larger section of society because of the fine line between love and lust. “That movie was about the voyage of a man from house to home,” he says, “When the opposite sex registers your presence, that itself does something to you. It’s not outward sexual feelings. It’s divine.”

Bharathiraja in a scene from ‘Meendum Oru Mariyathai’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

Meendum Oru Mariyathai, in his own words, is about two characters who are longing for love. “Old Man [the character he plays] meets Venba [the girl] abroad. She’s attracted to him. But he asks a simple question: ‘I’m nearer sunset and you are closer to sunrise... why do you want to come here?’”

It was lyricist Madhan Karky’s idea to name the character Venba because, “she’s like a poem”. “They exchange feelings but you don’t know whether it is love, lust or affection,” adds Bharathiraja. Has he left their relationship open-ended without spelling out things for the audience? “I wrote a different ending before, but I had to change it. Even though people claim to be progressive, they won’t accept changes in society.”

Consumed by art

Nothing has changed in terms of his craft, despite having worked in the industry for over four decades. He has once again donned the director’s hat with OM (Old Man), now rechristened Meendum Oru Mariyathai, slated to release on February 21.

“It was a thrill back in those days when we would say cut. Nobody had any idea about the quality of the output and we waited at least 15 days for it to get processed,” says Bharathiraja, on the filmmaking process back in the ’80s, “It was equally thrilling to watch actors’ performance on screen — like when we go for a close-up or the sheer joy of watching movies in colour.”

But he clarifies that he is not against digital filmmaking, for it made his job easier. “Apart from the technical aspect, everything has remained the same. Nowadays, it’s easy to correct performances by looking at the monitor.”

Bharathiraja seems to poke fun at himself by calling himself “old man”, in the trailer for Meendum Oru Mariyathai. Why is it that most senior filmmakers — who started out in the ’80s — tend to slow down after having a successful run?

“Who? Me? I’ve already started writing my next movie,” he laughs, adding, “Even at this age, I wish to make a breezy, warm love story. At the end of the day, it’s love that triumphs.”

He does not regret choosing cinema above all. But there is a lingering sadness, almost making him guilty of his actions. “I am a failure in my family. I loved cinema more than my wife and children. To put it simply, I did injustice to my family by doing justice to art,” he concludes.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xt18b7/article30712011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MG0131-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/in-the-mood-for-love/article30712012.ece

Prachi, a former Miss India and Mahat have been a couple for a long time, and got engaged last year. Mahat rose to fame after taking part in the Tamil version of Bigg Boss that also included fellow contestants like Yashika Aannand (with whom he’s currently acting in a film) and Aishwarya Dutta.

We have been through it all- learnt from the bad days and celebrated the good ones. And most importantly, only grown to understand each other better with every bit of it. To think that we are just a day away from being married, I feel lucky and blessed to have come a long way. I’ve enjoyed every day with you Prachi.

222,2020/02/01,"Kangana Ranaut: 'Jayalalithaa longed for a family, for a child; I share similarities with her'","Kangana Ranaut seldom breaks character. It does not matter if she does or does not have a camera trained on her.

We find an ornate Kangana, who was recently conferred with Padma Shri by the Government of India, sitting by herself on a plastic chair on the set of her upcoming trilingual, Thalaivi.

The crew has taken a brief break to re-organise camera positions in time for the next shot. Kangana, with an assistant for company, opts not to walk back to her vanity van, like most artistes, and instead stays put. She is consumed in a world of her own; her hands gliding around in symmetrical rhythm as she traces back the steps she had just learnt from the dance choreographer Gayathri Raguram.

It is unusual to find the Bollywood star in Chennai, but Thalaivi documents the life and times of the late Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa — chronicling her transition from a movie star into a politician. So, Kangana has no better place to be in than Chennai as she hopes to bring the political icon back to life on screen.

On this day, though, the crew are filming a dance performance, the kind which requires the not-a-natural-at-dancing Kangana to step out of her comfort zone, but she appears well prepared.

“I’ve researched a lot [to play Jayalalithaa],” says the actor with a smile, as she sits down for this mid-take conversation.

A few months ago, Kangana underwent training in classical dance to help her prepare for this very moment.

It is one of those instances when an actor goes all out to fine-tune their craft, even if it is for something that will barely take up a couple of minutes of the film’s run time. It is perhaps why Vijay, when asked about her, tells us that Kangana is “a director’s actor”.

“I think, on the set, the director is my best friend. I don’t feel like I have to be driven around like cattle. Most actors, they need to be brought out of the [vanity] van, but I’m not that. I make myself available at the director’s disposal, and that is why I look like a completely involved person,” she remarks.

Her involvement as it pertains to Thalaivi goes beyond that. She has considerably brushed up on her knowledge of Jayalalithaa.

“When she was humiliated in the State Assembly, and she said that she would come back as a Chief Minister... I think that was an extremely powerful moment in her life. Until then, she was under MGR’s shadow, and she never revealed her own political aspirations. But that was a very decisive moment because for her as a woman, in a man’s world, to be beaten up and humiliated... anybody would have lost their confidence. For her to show the kind of strength of character under those circumstances... it is very powerful,” she adds.

Drawing parallels

When the offer to play Jayalalithaa arose, Kangana says she felt that “it was intimidating”.

“She (Jayalalithaa) was a different kind of actor. She was not like me. She was a more a glamorous star... somebody like an Aishwarya Rai in Bollywood. It was a very big challenge to fit into those shoes because I’m not known as a glamorous star,” she says.

There is one common thread, though.

“I do feel that there are similarities. She was a very reluctant actor. It is the same with me. I never wanted to be an actor, and that is why we became very unusual actors. I think she always felt that she was worth much more than just being a glam doll [in films], and she became a politician. Like how I became a filmmaker because I felt that being an actress was very limiting for me. So, I think there are parallels,” she notes.

There is one aspect, she thinks, which goes beyond being just a parallel in their lives.

“I think, like every woman, she (Jayalalithaa) longed for a family, and she longed for a child. I think there was a time in my life also when I longed for a family. I think some of the married people took advantage of that... especially married actors... I will not reveal whom. There are scenes [in this film] with an actor who is married, and who promises marriage and then goes back on his word. She has to face a lot of public humiliation. I think this is what happens to a lot of the young actresses. It is not something that only we share,” she says.

The right opportunity

However, when the first look of the film was revealed, it did lead to apprehensions if the younger Kangana would be able to pull off the older Jayalalithaa in the film.

Kangana clarifies: “They (production) assured me that the film ends when she becomes the Chief Minister for the first time. I think she was around 40 (Jayalalithaa was 43 in 1991, when her first tenure began), and I’m 32. So that is somewhere closer. But I did weigh [the pros and cons]. I decided that it is an opportunity and, if done well, it can be something very exciting,” she adds.

Thalaivi marks her return to Tamil cinema after a gap of 12 years, after working Dhaam Dhoom (2008) with Jayam Ravi.

Will she be open to more Tamil films? “Even now, I want to do the kind of scripts I do in Bollywood in Tamil. But I don’t want to play second fiddle to heroes. It is very prevalent in the South, and even in Mumbai,” she says, adding “I don’t do that even if they are big Khans or Kapoors. I don’t do that. If I do another Tamil film, it has to be an exciting character.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/234jgn/article30711813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPKangana-Ranaut-2-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i-share-similarities-with-jayalalithaa-kangana-ranaut/article30711820.ece
223,2020/02/01,"‘Parasite’ movie review: A dazzling satire on the class divide, engulfed in beguiling charm","From the first image of socks on a clothesline to a similar closing shot, Parasite is all about life coming full circle, in unforeseen ways, for the hard-up Kim family. In between, a lot happens: seemingly, a movement towards progress and amelioration but more a slide for the worse. Bong Joon-ho’s much-celebrated film on the Kim family’s infiltration into the wealthy Park household, hits like a bolt out of the blue, whether it’s your first viewing or the tenth. You may know of and can anticipate each step of the way — every new turn and major twist of the plot. Yet that heart-in-the-mouth feeling doesn’t go away.

In fact, the more you see it, the more you are left in awe of Bong’s fluidity, in moving gradually but determinedly from a harmless, light-hearted and cheerful tone to an irredeemably nihilistic and horrific one. It’s such contrasts at every level, that can be subjects of in-depth research in their own right and lend the film a rare unpredictability. There’s the empathy and warmth you feel for a family of desperate con artistes and opportunistic wrong-doers as against the well meaning, seemingly nice, rather gullible and naive rich who don’t stir anything in your heart. Perhaps because, as the film tells you, they have no creases to them, money has ironed out the interesting imperfections. And then there is their incipient intolerance that shows up all of a sudden in all its ugliness — in the aversion for a certain kind of smell of the downtrodden and the dislike for cheap underwear. There’s more cruelty, perhaps, in the way they humiliate the poor, than the poor wreaking vengeance on them.

Parasite Director: Bong Joon-ho

Starring: Song Kang-ho, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam

Storyline: Posing as qualified professionals, members of the poor Kim family infiltrate the wealthy Park household

Run time: 2 hours 12 minutes

The vertical architecture, landscape and geography tells its own tale. The flight of stairs that separates the classes of the town from its masses, leading down from the row of fancy villas to the low life in semi-basements with their stink bugs and fumigation, bad Wi-Fi signal and passersby who urinate and puke. Or the bunkers, below the basement of rich homes where the poor lie like ghosts deprived of their rightful share of sunshine. Even while bringing the classes together momentarily in seeming consonance, Parasite reiterates the reality of the eventual conflict. A film that makes us aware of whatever privileges we may have and also acutely conscious of the class divides, that the inequities are not so easy to wish away. Far from hiding, the film’s beguiling charm stokes the deeply dystopian vision of its maker. In Bong’s world, despite tokens like a cell phone or pizza dinners, social mobility doesn’t quite exist. Poor is poor and rich is rich, and never the twain shall meet.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/whbih3/article30711151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OSCARNOMINATIONSBESTPICTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/parasite-movie-review-a-dazzling-satire-on-the-class-divide-engulfed-in-beguiling-charm/article30711152.ece
224,2020/02/01,‘Bad Boys For Life’ cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert : Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are experts in comedy and action,"When Will Smith and Martin Lawrence team up, the ‘Bad Boys’ anthem reverberates in our minds. And since Bad Boys II (2003), the world waited for the possibility of a third to round up a trilogy. It took Sony Pictures 17 years to release the third film, Bad Boys For Life, running in a theatre near you.

While Jerry Bruckheimer reprises his production duties, the sequel had a breed of new energies from supporting cast to main crew. Given Bad Boys For Life had Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi directing, they entrusted the film’s cinematography to their long-time collaborator, Robrecht Heyvaert. That said, Robrecht’s break into mainstream Hollywood lived up to the ‘go big or go home’ adage.

Robrecht’s name is no stranger to experimental cinematography, thanks to his work on the 2017 French action-thriller and gore fest Revenge and 2019 war-drama Torpedo.

The Belgian DoP tells MetroPlus over email on his approach to the action-fest.

Excerpts:

Can you describe the conversations leading up to you being roped into working on Bad Boys For Life?

Before Bad Boys For Life, Bilall Fallah, Adil El Arbi and me had already collaborated on three feature films. Since we’re close colleagues and friends I was probably one of the first to know about their involvement on Bad Boys For Life. It goes without saying I was grateful when they offered me the position of DoP on this dream project.

This must have been about a year before the production got started. Around the same time we were shooting a music video in LA and I was invited by the legendary Jerry Bruckheimer to talk about the project. Given he is such an icon and that I am new to this game, it felt quite intimidating. I remember feeling small sitting in the lobby of his office underneath a gigantic Pirates of the Caribbean ship and a Top Gun jet engine. During the meeting, my uncertainty quickly disappeared, Bruckheimer made me feel very welcome and trusted. I felt blessed.

How did the exchange of ideas between you and directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi go? Does working with two directors enhance the process?

Adil and Bilall have some unique ways of creating and communicating. They often sing or beat-box the melody or beat they have in mind. I’m not always sure how to interpret it but I do my best to translate it to camera movement and light.

I really enjoy working with them and I think we’re a good creative trio. We joke about being the ‘Trio Ternura’ like in the 2002 Brazilian crime-drama Cidade De Deus, a film we all love and are inspired by.

The Bad Boys films are really special to a lot of audiences, and yet there are new energies behind the film. When you came on board, how did this team deliberate still retain the look and feel of the previous Bad Boys projects while refreshing it?

The creative team set out to continue the visual vocabulary used in the first two films. We totally embraced the lens choices, the lighting style and the camera movement. The directors brought an additional use of colour in design and light, and their feeling for rhythm and pace. Longer takes are interchanged with fast-cut editing sequences.

Did you have any early visions for the cinematography before production?

Very early in the process we knew we wanted to create our version of high-style action movies and the aesthetics one would expect from such a picture and mix it with rougher camera work. Choreographed crane-moves and hand-held camera work should go hand in hand.

What was the collaborative environment for such a physical film on-set like, with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence? Seeing as they're the constants in these projects, did they have a lot to bring to the table, creatively and technically?

One of the goals for this film was to have the action and the comedy go hand in hand. We didn’t want some scenes to look or feel like comedy and others like an action film. It should be a perfect blend in style and tone. This was only possible since Will and Martin are experts in all aspects of movie-making. They’re experts in lyrical, visual and physical comedy as well as action. It’s a joy to work with them and I’m convinced this joy can be felt by the audience.

Action is such an important element across all Bad Boys films. How satisfying was it working with such a large-scale stunt department for the film?

Ever since the first VHS player entered my parents’ house, I’ve watched all the making-of films I could get my hands on. I always wanted to know how the impossible was brought to the screen. So you could say I had a fair amount of special effect theory but I was lacking experience in the field.

I hadn’t worked with such a giant stunt team before but was more than happy to have the opportunity. I had a great time to be part of the choreography between SFX, stunts, acting and cinematography.

As a cinematographer, what is it like when you see the final result in a single form on the screen?

On set, I see the images for the first time. During shooting, you re-watch most shots a couple of times. During post production and colour correction I see all the shots dozens of times. So by the end the process I’ve seen every frame at least 50 times. It is only once that is all done that I can sit back and watch all these separate shots as a whole, a feature film. If you add music — and preferably an audience — to that, it feels great.

Revenge was also an intensely physical film. What about the desert environment affected your approach?

Shooting in a natural arena like a desert is a great experience for a cinematographer but it comes with certain challenges. You can make it look gracious, powerful, peaceful or hostile. Nature gives you all that. It also gives you hard sun, sandstorms, pointy rocks, unpredictable clouds and a wide range of insects and reptiles.

Working on Revenge learned us to roll with the punches and while trying to prepare and control everything you can’t beat the environment. You better make sure you’ve got the scene before the sun sets or a sandstorm kicks in.

Fun fact: sand is incredibly absorbent so if you want to create a puddle of blood in the desert you better take a couple of buckets. Also, fake blood contains a lot of gelatine, so it gets incredibly slippery if you’re running around on a floor covered with it. If you fall and hurt yourself you won’t be able to see the difference between your own blood and the fake!

225,2020/02/01,‘Pain and Glory’ review: Pedro Almodóvar’s delectable penchant for melodrama,"Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory can only be written and directed by someone who has lived most of his life, with the days of youth behind him. It’s a film that can easily look calculated, unless it comes from an intimate and personal space, if not entirely autobiographical. Almodóvar’s latest has that irreplicable nostalgia of loss, longing and regret, that comes only from having lived those emotions you are depicting. Yet, the clean and neatly structured narrative of Pain and Glory often yanks you out of the mood Almodóvar sets out to create, as if reminding you that cinema is unable to match up to the mess and melancholy of real life. Perhaps for the better.

‘Write what you know’ is often a piece of contentious advice given to aspiring writers. On one side is authenticity, and on the other is self-indulgence. Almodóvar demonstrates how the two can co-exist in a symbiotic fashion, and create something universal, even within self-reflection. Like with us all, it begins with our childhood, and then a lifetime of fantasising about an alternate life: a past and present that could have been. Pain and Glory traces three aspects of the life of Salvador Mallo (Antonio Banderas), a fictionalised celebrated Spanish filmmaker: his humble roots, his lost love and cinema. With some drug addiction thrown in, the film demonstrates how the three are intimately linked, where Salvador’s art is closely linked with life.

Pain and Glory Director: Pedro Almodóvar

Cast: Antonio Banderas, Asier Etxeandia, Penélope Cruz, Julieta Serrano and Leonardo Sbaraglia

Story line: A famous Spanish filmmaker reflects on his life in an attempt to reignite his art

Throughout the film, Almodóvar’s love for cinema is palpable, not just in narrative but in his penchant for melodrama. In Pain and Glory, the veteran filmmaker goes all out with orchestra music and striking colours to bring out the extravaganza in ordinary moments of melancholy and memory. Through melodrama, Almodóvar embellishes loss and regret with glossy textures. The whites, reds and greens are exaggerated even in moments of melancholy, creating a paradoxical atmosphere and a clash between visuals and emotions, which is quite affecting.

Even in its ordinariness, Almodóvar plays with the audio-visual strengths of cinema. That’s not to say that the film isn’t verbose. There’s a lot of exposition, sometimes making you wonder if the film is an adaptation of a novel. But the little moments remind you that it’s more cinema than literature, like when Banderas closes his eyes, cordoning off the audience from his thoughts. The actor’s body language — whether it is a defeated posture or the back rub when he hugs his lost love — provides the intensity that this film demands. He plays a filmmaker who has to make peace with his past and present, in order to reignite his art. Through him, Almodóvar makes you wonder if pain is a prerequisite for good art, an oft-romanicised idea across cinema and literature. But Almodóvar also provides levity, strangely hyper-real imagery and a thought-provoking last shot, which instantly reminds you that cinema is only a representation and not the life itself.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vkcwo7/article30710299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/pain,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pain-and-glory-review-pedro-almodvars-delectable-penchant-for-melodrama/article30710300.ece
226,2020/02/01,Filmmaker Mysskin talks about his latest movie 'Psycho',"Dark, raw, eccentric are some of the adjectives thrown at Mysskin to describe his brand of cinema. Dig deeper and you will realise that he is an unexpectedly humane filmmaker, who treats characters with tenderness, even if they have cruel intentions.

Mysskin is not a provocateur, but a disrupter. He likes to ‘disrupt’ the collective consciousness of the public through his craft. His movies define their own logic, and he writes his own rules when it comes to questions of morality and ethics.

Perhaps the best definition of Mysskin’s world comes from the filmmaker: “I was dreaming on a piece of white paper with the help of a pencil,” he says with a warm smile, at his Alwarpet office.

He is a changed man. He has mellowed, both as a filmmaker and person. But what hasn’t changed are his little idiosyncrasies, influenced by philosophy — something he quickly admits, “I know I’m meandering with my answers, but I hope you get the essence of it,” settling down to dissect (no pun intended) Psycho. Excerpts from an interview:

Your movies explore the deeper, darker side of the human psyche with one common motif: guilt — be it Onaayum Aattukuttiyum (OA), Nandalala or Psycho . Why is it a recurrent theme in the larger framework of your oeuvre?

No human is without flaws and we are designed to commit mistakes and crimes.

I believe God [not to be taken in a literal sense, but symbolical] created us to be part of a play. What sort of play, you ask. To go through a cycle wherein (s)he does things they might not be proud of — some of the actions will come back to haunt them. When (s)he is cycled through life experiences, they look back at themselves and their slip-ups. Which is why guilt is not sorcery, but illumination. Guilt is not something to be guilty about (laughs). That’s what I have been trying to address in movies.

In my life, I have committed a lot of mistakes. When you begin to question what is right and wrong, we invariably think about ourselves being morally upright.

Maybe I am not objective enough to look at my own movies from a vantage point. Once I’m done with a movie, I take it out of my system and move on. It could also be because I’m influenced by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. What they have been insisting in their books is: forgiveness is divine.

So, it’s safe to say that Psycho is the guilt of a psychopath? Probably for the first time in Indian cinema, we get to examine what a serial killer goes through internally, with such bone-chilling details.

Psycho is not a whodunit, but why done it (laughs).

I wanted to delve deeper into the inner emotional state of a serial killer. I could’ve scratched the surface, showing what happens outwardly thereby giving him a cause. But you need to understand the significance of the first shot.

It opens with the point of view of the killer, the protagonist as well as the audience. So, I made the audience travel with him. I could have taken a sublime route, but Psycho is direct in its approach. That’s why people are arguing and debating. Indirectly, I made audiences stand in his shoes by pulling off the biggest trick or lie.

Which was?

Giving the serial killer a character arc.

Any movie is about the hero’s journey. Take Thevar Magan for instance. You could see Sakthi completing his arc when he becomes a Buddha, when he’s taken to prison in the end. Psychopaths don’t have a character arc, says John Douglas in his book Mindhunter. They cannot be changed or reformed. Their trauma is so bad that there’s no sympathy or empathy left in them.

What if somebody walks into his life, pouring unconditional love and value that he becomes a changed man? I wanted to give an arc for a psychopath. I have taken a leaf out of the Angulimala fable. But in Psycho, Dagini (Aditi Rao Hydari) is the real Buddha and not Gautham. In fact, Dagini is a deity in Tibetian Buddhism.

Do you think the audience will get these Buddhist subtexts?

See, it’s not the artist’s job to convey what (s)he’s trying to convey. Appreciating art is also a learning process that requires constant effort.

The theatre is a place where you develop localised-intelligence. It’s a place where all your thoughts and bodily movements are contained to figure out what’s happening on screen. If the audience is aligned with the first 10 shots of the movie and if the filmmaker has properly aligned his shots, then there forms a localised-intelligence — the reason why I consider the theatre a place for spiritual awakening. On the other hand, why do they have to understand a movie in the first place? If they don’t get it, let them struggle.

Reviews have been divided for Psycho and some people have been sticking to their guns...

Either they’re hating it or loving it. There’s no middle ground. This is the second time this has happened to me after Pisaasu.

People who call it a “bad” movie are more pure-hearted in my opinion. For them, the movie somewhere has disrupted their social consciousness, making them feel uncomfortable. Or, they completely understood the movie (laughs). I’m puzzled by the response, but it also gives me a high.

The polarised response stems from the fact that we have been conditioned to tales where the hero vanquishes the villain, to restore light in the world. Ram has to kill Ravana, right?

Even in Ramayana, Ram says, “Indru poi naalai vaa.” Isn’t that one of the greatest lessons on forgiveness?

Why should such a monster be forgiven is a question that I keep hearing from people. In fact, I presented the audience’s point of view in my movie itself.

But they haven’t seen what Dagini saw in that hellhole. She becomes a witness to his soul gradually reducing. What remains at the end is a child in him. The violence, I believe, was a big shock for the audience.

Aren’t your movies a reflection of society, with the strong presence of sex workers, transgenders and people with disabilities?

I grew up with a lot of restrictions imposed on me. But when I started reading literature, the taboos I grew up with seemed fake. Had I listened to my mother, I wouldn’t have made Pisaasu. What I realised with my little understanding is...those who are oppressed are the ones to be celebrated. It’s a simple philosophy I practise.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6vs6a5/article30710269.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPpsycho99jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/filmmaker-mysskin-talks-about-his-latest-movie-psycho/article30710271.ece
227,2020/02/01,"Film body for restoration of ancestral houses of Ray, Ghatak, Sen","The Federation of Film Societies of India (FFSI), in its central executive committee meeting held on Thursday in Kolkata, decided to initiate an international campaign for restoration of the ancestral houses of legendary filmmakers Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Mrinal Sen in Bangladesh. FFSI has decided to bring the issue to the notice of the Ministry of Culture, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

According to FFSI, Ray’s ancestral house, at Mashua, Katiadi, Kishoreganj, about 115 kilometre north-east from Dhaka, is now in a dilapidated condition. Film activists of Dhaka have appealed to the government through the district administration for its immediate renovation and preservation. However, no action has as yet been taken.

Ghatak’s ancestral house at Rajshahi is about 245 km north-west from Dhaka. Ghatak spent his childhood and young age there, studied at Rajshahi College and had a deep bond with the river Padma that flows by. Ghatak’s family had to leave East Pakistan, and this house, in 1948. The property was leased out in 1987-88 by the government to a private homoeopathic college. Most of the old structures were demolished to make way for a new building. Recently another one of the old rooms was knocked down to build a bicycle stand.

The film and cultural community of Rajshahi and Dhaka protested against this and human chains were formed in the two cities and also in Toronto in the last week of December in which many important filmmakers, film scholars, college and university teachers, students, and activists participated. Eminent film personalities of Bangladesh like Tanvir Mokammel, Morshedul Islam, Nasiruddin Yusuf Bacchu, Shameem Akhtar, among others, signed a petition to the government to save the three homes.

Sen’s ancestral house in Jhiltuli, Faridpur is about 130 km west from Dhaka. The house now belongs to a private owner. Many parts of the property have been demolished to build new structures. The original house, however, is still there and could be renovated and preserved.

FFSI is the apex body of the film societies network of India and was founded in 1959 under the stewardship of Ray himself, who also happened to be the president of the first executive committee of the FFSI.

FFSI is currently a member of the International Federation of Film Society (IFFS) that has its central office in Paris. Premendra Mazumder, vice president, FFSI, and the Asia Pacific secretary of the IFFS has been entrusted with the responsibility of taking up the issue at the international forum of IFFS.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ibczbp/article30707347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BM-Ghataks-house,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/film-body-for-restoration-of-ancestral-houses-of-ray-ghatak-sen/article30707351.ece

Tamil Nadu has the highest number of students qualifying in the test, among all States. The National Board of Examinations released the results for PG NEET late on Thursday.

Of the 18,854 candidates who appeared, as many as 11,681 have qualified.

The top score this year is 1013 marks out of 1200. This year a total of 1,60,888 candidates appeared of which 89,549 have qualified across the country. The minimum eligible criteria under general category (50th percentile) is 366 marks. For SC/ST/OBC (including persons with disability) (40th percentile) the cut off scoreis 319 marks.

PG NEET marks will be used to pick students for the All India Quota seats surrendered by the states, Armed Forces Medical Services colleges, deemed universities, private medical colleges, besides post–MBBS DNB seats.

With more doctors qualifying this time the competition is set to be tougher. Candidates are concerned about the ‘benefits’ service doctors would be eligible for.

231,2020/02/01,Government announces ‘Direct CTO Scheme’ for green industries,"Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has announced a new initiative, the ‘Direct CTO Scheme’ for green industries, to relax the process for pre-establishment clearances for green category industries.

Under the new scheme, the green industries only need to apply for consent to establish, and don’t have to wait till obtaining final approvals to commence construction work.

“This will benefit over 63 types of green industries,” Chief Minister Palaniswami said while addressing industry captains at the 125th year celebrations of the Confederation of Indian Industry held in Chennai on Thursday.

He announced an initiative for land use re-classification in non-plan areas. “Land use re-classification for non-plan areas will be given deemed approval, if the applications in full shape, cross the timeline,” he said. Earlier, approvals used to take six months to two years. Now it would take 50 days.

Mr. Palaniswami praised the CII’s role during the Global Investors Meet that was held in 2015 and 2019.

Governor Banwarilal Purohit, said, “I am extremely delighted to note that the Southern States have consistently scored high in the country on key economic and social indicators with the help of the government’s policy initiatives.”

The Southern States contribute about 30% to India’s GDP. Tamil Nadu ranks first among the States in terms of a number of factories and industrial workers.

The Governor requested industrialists to take initiatives and have more MoUs with government universities in Tamil Nadu. “You need skilled and well-trained people and if the universities modify their curriculum accordingly, the effort will enhance the employability of students and accelerate industry growth,” he said.

Shobana Kamineni, past president, CII, and executive vice-chairperson of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Ltd, spoke about gender inequalities and said that it was time for the industry and government to act now. “Indian economy could get 27% richer if we could bridge those inequalities,” she said.

CII’s journey

The CII’s journey began in 1895 when five engineering firms, all members of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, joined hands to form the Engineering and Iron Trades Association (EITA). Till 1942, IEA was the only all-India association of engineering industries and represented mainly big engineering companies, particularly the British firms. This led to a situation where the interests of the Indian firms (mainly medium and small scale) were not adequately represented. Thus, the Engineering Association of India (EAI) was established in 1942 as an affiliate of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. EAI represented small and medium engineering firms mostly owned and promoted by Indians.

In 1912, there was a change in name from EITA to IEA. In April 1974, the two associations — IEA and EAI — merged to form the Association of Indian Engineering Industry (AIEI). In 1991, industrial licensing was abolished and economic reforms on a wide scale started taking shape. With effect from January 1, 1992, in keeping with the government's decision to opt for the liberalisation of the Indian economy, the name of CEI was changed to the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/government-announces-direct-cto-scheme-for-green-industries/article30708833.ece
232,2020/02/01,T.M. Krishna did not tell us about the scope of his book: Palghat Mani Iyer’s family,"As vocalist T.M. Krishna’s book, Sebastian and Sons, on Dalit Christian mridangam makers, is to be released on Sunday, the family of mridangam maestro Palghat T.S. Mani Iyer said they felt that the author had ‘deceived’ them by not revealing the scope of the book.

“While gathering information about Mani Iyer and his relationship with the mridangam makers, their family and his approach towards maintenance of the instrument, he did not tell us that the book was about caste, religion, and politics. We actually feel cheated and deceived,” vocalist Palghat R. Ramprasad, grandson of Mani Iyer, said.

Mr. Ramprasad said his father T.R. Rajaram and uncle T.R Rajamani had absolute faith in Mr. Krishna.

Book excerpt | Keeping the cow and brahmin apart | Inside the world of mridangam makers

“It was on the basis of trust that we divulged the details. The information presented in the book is not something people do not know already. For the sake of authenticity, he approached my father and uncle, and in good faith they shared the details because they believed the book was about mridangam makers.”

He said the family believed that the research was purely academic in nature, because he told them about his visit to slaughter houses, and discussions with those who deal with skin. “But he did not tell us the tone of the book was caste-based. None of our family members is ready to be involved in this controversial issue,” he added.

“From whatever we read, we realised that our trust is breached.” There were a number of positive incidents that should have been highlighted. For instance, Mani Iyer presented the family of Fernandes with a golden cross one Christmas; and even bore his medical expenses when he fell seriously ill, Mr. Ramprasad said.

Cows were primarily slaughtered for meat. The skin was just a by-product, used to make mridangams also, he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/dvx655/article30707508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THMANIIYER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tm-krishna-did-not-tell-us-about-the-scope-of-his-book-palghat-mani-iyers-family/article30707509.ece

234,2020/02/01,Six get jail for planting bomb near Chidambaram’s residence,"A special court in Poonamallee for exclusive trial of bomb blast cases here has convicted six activists of a Tamil extremist group to five years’ imprisonment for planting pipe bomb near former Union Minister P. Chidambaram’s house in Nachiyarpuram, Sivagangai district in 2014.

On February, 25, 2014, the accused, who are members of Tamilnadu Liberation Army (TNLA), left some pamphlets at the backside compound wall of Mr. Chidambaram’s residence. The pamphlets had incriminating content against the Central government such as its perceived anti-people policies relating to the entry of retail majors into the country and other issues.

The main accused Thiruselvam, who was arrested by Inspector of Othakkadai on March 10, voluntarily confessed that he and his brother Kalailingam had put a pipe bomb and pamphlets near Mr. Chidambaram’s house. On receiving the information, police searched and found the place of explosion. The compound wall was damaged, stone bars got cracked. Police also seized fragments of a pipe bomb.

235,2020/02/01,Crime Branch searches premises of Senthil Balaji,"Officers of the Central Crime Branch, Chennai City Police, on Friday conducted simultaneous searches at the houses and other premises belonging to DMK Aravakurichi MLA and former Transport Minister V. Senthil Balaji and his associates in Chennai, Karur, Tiruvannamalai and Kumbakonam in connection with an alleged job scam.

A senior police officer said 14 teams conducted the searches as part of investigation into a major job scam in transport corporations when he was Transport Minister in the AIADMK government when Jayalalithaa was Chief Minister. The searches were conducted at 17 locations — nine places in Chennai, five in Karur, two in Tiruvannamalai and one in Kumbakonam — after obtaining warrants for search from jurisdictional courts.

An officer said the police seized documents of properties which were bought when the alleged offence took place. Receipts of gold jewellery, documents of four-wheelers, biodata of job aspirants and interview cards, details about crores of rupees allegedly received from job aspirants and list of names of candidates who paid the money, bank passbooks, cheques and locker keys were confiscated, the police claimed.

Last November, the Madras High Court had directed the CCB to conduct the probe afresh in the job racket. Based on this, special teams under Assistant Commissioner of Police (Job Racket) began investigations.

A team led by a senior officer reached Mr. Balaji’s flat on Thiruvengadam Street in Mandaveli. Since no one was available at the time, the officers called him over phone.

“As no one turned up for the search, we had no other option but to seal the house to ensure that evidence is not tampered. The key was handed over to a court,” an officer said. The charge against Mr. Balaji was that when he was Transport Minister (dropped in July 2015), money was allegedly obtained from aspirants through his associates for appointment as drivers, conductors and technicians in State transport corporations. Mr. Balaji was among the 18 disqualified AIADMK MLAs who had thrown their lot with rebel leader T.T.V. Dhinakaran. He joined the DMK and got elected in the bypoll last year.

In Karur, the police used force to evict a group of DMK members from the entrance of a business establishment at Ramakrishnapuram owned by Mr. Balaji to facilitate checks by the CCB team.

By the time the Chennai police team had reached Ramakrishnapuram after completing a checking operation at the residence of Mr. Balaji at Rameswarapatti, the party members, mostly women, had assembled in large numbers and blocked the entrance of the business establishment.

Seeks bail

Mr. Balaji and his brother V. Ashok Kumar rushed to the Madras High Court on Friday seeking anticipatory bail. The duo apprehended arrest by the Central Crime Branch police. Pointing out that the High Court had recently ordered further investigation in the case, in which the police had already laid its charge sheet against other individuals, the petitioners said the investigators had suddenly conducted raids.

236,2020/02/01,Coronavirus: Tamil Nadu to step up surveillance along Kerala border,"Tamil Nadu is stepping up its surveillance of coronavirus along the Kerala border. Public health teams will be screening persons coming from Kerala at various checkposts in five districts after the neighbouring State confirmed the first case of coronavirus on Thursday.

“There is no case of coronavirus in Tamil Nadu so far. But we are worried that Kerala has a confirmed case. We are prepared and alert, and have tightened our surveillance along the inter-State border. The Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine has given instructions to take up screening along the borders, and this will start from Saturday,” Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.

Health Secretary Beela Rajesh said the department had upscaled surveillance, and public health teams would conduct screening at various check posts in five districts that share border with Kerala — Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Kanyakumari, Tirupur and Tirunelveli.

Two in hospital

The Minister said two persons, who had returned from China, were admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) and Government Tiruvannamalai Medical College Hospital for observation. But they have no symptoms of coronavirus, he added.

“As of now, we have advised 242 travellers from China to be under home quarantine,” he added.

One of the persons admitted, a 40-year-old woman from Selaiyur, returned from Dongguan in south China. She had approached the outpatient department of the Government Hospital, Chromepet, with complaints of muscle pain and fever, RGGGH authorities said.

“She had returned from China last night, and approached the GH this morning. From there, she was brought to the RGGGH and admitted to the isolation ward. An expert team of doctors examined her and found no symptoms of coronavirus. We have admitted her for observation alone. There is no need to lift samples for testing,” R. Jayanthi, dean of RGGGH, told reporters.

Supportive care

She added supportive care would be given for n-CoV.

237,2020/02/01,Madras High Court takes exception to ‘padayatra’ by ex-judges,"The Madras High Court on Friday took strong exception to the participation of three retired judges of the court in an “unauthorised” Peace and Unity Padayatra, titled ‘Gandhi Forever’, taken out by a section of lawyers both inside and around the court campus to commemorate the Martyrs’ Day on Thursday.

Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad referred the issue to the Security Committee comprising Justices N. Kirubakaran, K. Ravichandrabaabu and P.N. Prakash so that it could deliberate upon it and give concrete suggestions on strengthening security on the campus.

During the hearing of a 2015 suo motu PIL petition related to extending CISF cover for the High Court campus, the Chief Justice told Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan and Advocate General Vijay Narayan about Thursday’s “protest”.

The CJ said that “a very unfortunate incident” had been reported by a Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of security on the High Court campus, which houses several trial courts too apart from the main High Court buildings guarded by the CISF, to the Registrar General.

The letter read: “A group of advocates including senior counsel R. Vaigai... and retired High Court judges D. Hariparanthaman, K. Kannan and G.M. Akbar Ali assembled near Aavin parlour (inside the court campus), walked in procession to North Gate via Kuralagam, reached Esplanade Gate, entered inside and finished at Dr. Ambedkar statue.

“They were stopped and advised for their unauthorised activities but they refused to hear the police officers who were on duty. The report of the Inspector of Police, High Court Security, is enclosed for perusal. A video compact disc and photos (also in a CD) are also enclosed with this letter.”

After extracting the contents of the letter in their interim order on the suo motu PIL petition, the Bench led by the Chief Justice said: “Having noticed the said incident reported, what is of more concern is that the incident involves and names three former High Court judges having entered the premises and joined the protest that was going on.

“The gravity of the said incident, therefore, puts on guard the entire judicial system, as this may have a large impact on the future security measures that may be required to be undertaken by the High Court. The incident, therefore, requires an immediate concern to be taken up on the administrative side.

“We, therefore, request the Security Committee of the High Court to take up the matter urgently along with its suggestions and report the matter back for taking appropriate action on the judicial side or otherwise by the next date fixed.”

The Bench also requested the Security Committee to hold discussions with the CISF as well as the State police and come up with concrete suggestions on improving coordination between both the forces and ensuring a uniform security arrangement in the buildings and premises guarded by both of them within the High Court campus.

The committee was further asked to deliberate on the possibility of making the CISF cover for the High Court campus a permanent feature so that there was some certainty over the continuance of the central force and it could deploy its personnel permanently without having to wait for extension, through judicial orders, every now and then.

After finding that on October 21 last, a Bench comprising the then Acting Chief Justice Vineet Kothari and Justice C. Saravanan had ordered for continuance of CISF cover for the High Court until further orders, the Bench led by the Chief Justice adjourned further hearing on the suo motu PIL petition to March 2.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/o6yevt/article30644964.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MADRASHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-takes-exception-to-padayatra-by-ex-judges/article30707070.ece
238,2020/02/01,Krishnasamy to hold rallies backing CAA,"K. Krishnasamy, founder of Puthiya Tamilagam, an ally of the BJP, plans to organise pro-CAA/NRC meetings in 100 places in Tamil Nadu and a few in New Delhi from February 15. The first meeting will be in Tiruchi.

“The CAA is a necessity where illegal immigration in the East and West has become a cause of concern — quantitative change in population will lead to qualitative change. Only illegal immigrants living in India need to worry about CAA. The Indian Muslims have nothing to worry, The BJP leaders have failed to explain to the people about the history and genesis of the issue. NRC should have been done as soon as India got independence from the British,” he said on Friday.

Asked if it was fair to deny citizenship to persecuted Muslims of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, Dr. Krishnasamy told The Hindu, “This is not a law that gives citizenship to new people who have come to India illegally after December 31, 2014.” He claimed to have been supporting citizenship for persecuted minorities of Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The Sri Lankan Tamils are not ‘illegal immigrants’ or those who have come here for livelihood. “It is a temporary arrangement – they are not seeking Indian citizenship. It doesn’t apply to them,” he said.

He was not in favour of granting citizenship to Rohingya Muslims, who are also facing violence and discrimination from Buddhists majority in Myanmar. “Why should they be given citizenship? They don’t have any roots in India unlike Christians, Jains and Buddhists from Pakistan and Bangladesh,” he contended.

According to him, the National Population of Register is a necessary, even if painful, exercise but the bureaucracy should take care while vetting documents.

“It is a fact that getting a ration card or a community certificate is a problem in India. Corruption is everywhere. The Central government has a responsibility to resolve this. The Muslims in India who have lived here for so long in India will have enough and more documents to prove that they are Indians and have lived here for long. Centre has already allayed people’s fear that there is no need for their parent’s birth certificate,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/krishnasamy-to-hold-rallies-backing-caa/article30707066.ece

241,2020/02/01,Economic Survey draws from wealth of ideas in Tirukkural,"The Economic Survey has found an ally in Tirukkural, regarded as a repository of philosophical wealth, to justify the emphasis on wealth creation.

In two chapters of the Volume I of the survey, five verses of the classic work, authored by Tamil saint-poet Tiruvalluvar, have been quoted. Kautilya’s Arthasastra too has been used. Those who drafted the survey had pointed out how Tirukkural advocated wealth creation through “ethical means.”

The broad message of the survey is that the country had a “rich tradition” of emphasising the creation of material wealth.

M. Rajendran, former Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil University, doubts the appropriateness of relying on Tirukkural to address contemporary issues concerning acquisition of assets.

“When Tiruvalluvar had lived, the concept of property possession and rights, as understood now, was not there,” he says, wondering whether the section Porutpaal, from which many verses had been quoted, should, fundamentally, be understood as one that dealt with material wealth, given the historical context of the time in which the saint-poet was said to have lived. But N.R. Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, feels the appropriateness of Tiruvalluvar can be drawn, not from literal meaning of the text, but from the essence of the verses.

In President’s address

In addition to the Economic Survey, Tirukkural was quoted by President Ram Nath Kovind in his customary address to the joint sitting of two Houses of Parliament earlier in the day.

Special wards are being readied to treat the patients in case anyone reaches them with fever and other symptoms of the virus attack.

Though three people — two from Vellore and one from Tiruvannamalai district — have returned from China recently, there has not been a case of coronavirus in the district, officials from Public Health department confirmed.

They have been tested at the hospital and there seems to be no alarming sign, said a medical official from DPH in Vellore.

244,2020/02/01,Grievances meetings held in Vellore,"Farmers attending a grievances meeting on Friday at the Vellore Collectorate, said that issues were not addressed despite the district being trifurcated more than two months ago.

They said that the delay in disbursal of welfare funds and carrying out water management works are a problem among the farmers who depended solely on agriculture. Farming community are left in the dark due to red-tapism and lack of personnel at the government offices, they said.

They have sought to know from the district administration, the status of the ban on illegal sand mining on Palar river basin and also sought clarification on construction of a check dam in Vettuvanam where the rivers Palar and Agaram conglomerate.

If this check dam is constructed excess water could be harvested and diverted to Mordhana dam to catre to the needs of villagers there, farmers association members said.

Another farmer pointed out that removal of encroachments in Sadhuperi was put on hold. Earlier, it was said ‘Model Code of Conduct’, now what prevents them from executing it? They asked.

Without removal of encroachments on surplus channel and inlet channels, the works carried out under ‘kudimaramathu’ and ‘Jal Shakti Abhiyan’ would be futile exercise, a farmer from Anaikattu said.

When there is no water in other lakes, Pernambut Periya Eri is full of sewage which proves the apathy of the officials in the district, he said.

Some said the farmers were not paid their dues for the damages caused to coconut trees. A farmer suggested that if they are credited with the amount in bank accounts for purchasing drip irrigation equipments, it would benefit them.

245,2020/02/01,State a top destination for tourists,"Tamil Nadu is one among the top three States in attracting domestic and foreign tourists, according to the Economic Survey 2019-20.

Tabled in Parliament on Friday, the Survey, quoting the 2018 figures, mentioned Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra as the other two which were in the top league.

The three States along with Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh accounted for nearly 65% of the total domestic tourists while they together with Delhi and Rajasthan recorded around 67% of the total foreign tourist visits.

E-tourist visa

In September 2014, the country introduced e-tourist visa for visitors from 46 countries, the arrangement of which was available for only 12 countries. Two years later, it liberalised the visa regime in 2016 and renamed it as e-visa scheme with five sub-categories — e-tourist visa, e-business visa, e-medical visa, e-conference visa and e-medical attendant visa.

The scheme is now available for 169 countries with valid entry through 28 designated airports and five designated seaports. With this, foreign tourist arrivals to India on e-visas went up from 4.45 lakh in 2015 to 23.69 lakh in 2018.

They stood at 21.75 lakh in January-October 2019, nearly 21% of the year-on-year growth from the previous year.

Employment share

The Economic Survey pointed out that the share of tourism employment in the State’s overall employment during the year 2015-16 was 6.36% for direct employment and 15.97% for direct and indirect.

246,2020/02/01,Strike disrupts operations at State-run banks across Vellore districts,"Banking services across four districts, especially in State-owned banks, were affected on Friday as several bank employees’ unions began their two-day strike. The unions announced that they will go on strike on January 31 and February 1.

In Vellore, the agitating bank officials and staff staged a protest in front of Canara Bank on Anna Salai while most of the banks wore a deserted look due to the strike.

Similar protests were organised in Tirupattur, where bank staff shouted slogans against the Indian Banks’ Association for not finding a solution to their persisting issues. The protesters said that they had no other option but to go on a strike to draw the attention of the Union Government.

The demands from the bank unions include, 20% pay hike on payslip components, 5-day work week, scrapping of the new pension scheme and merger of special allowance with basic pay.

The employees have been waiting for a pay hike since November 2017. This strike call by staff corresponds with the Union Budget FY2020-21.

In Vellore, Tirupattur and Ranipet, over 4,000 employees from 400 bank branches participated in the strike, which halted business transactions. The three districts, which consists of a considerable number of businessmen and small traders, felt the heat as they could not make any cash transactions.

S. Abdul of Pernambut said he wanted to disburse salary to his workers, which he could not postpone. “Though the banks had announced the information of the strike through sms, it has created a major dent on our day-to-day transactions. Once they open on Monday, I have to depute exclusively a person to make all arrears of transactions on the date,” he said.

Several small traders still make transactions in cash and they need banking services on a daily basis to deposit and withdraw at their will. A few traders issue open cheques to their customers/clients for their transactions with them. These transactions come to a standstill due to the continuous strike by bankmen, traders said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hzgfri/article30707011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TH-BANKSTRIKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/strike-disrupts-operations-at-state-run-banks-across-vellore-districts/article30707012.ece

In a statement, the TNPSC cited social media posts and media reports over alleged malpractice in the Group 2A exams and a committee examined the issue and suspected irregularities. Hence, the TNPSC has handed over relevant documents to the CB-CID.

The TNPSC clarified that the experience certificate verification for the exams to recruit Motor Vehicle Inspectors was to be conducted again not because of any irregularity on its part.

The High Court had ordered proper verification of experience certificate of candidates by the Transport Department, the commission pointed out. The TNPSC said it only invited candidates on the basis of details provided by Transport Department for experience certificate. The High Court had pointed out irregularity in experience certificate.

‘No malpractice’

As for Combined Engineering Services Examinations conducted recently, in which malpractices were alleged by social media posts, the TNPSC clarified that candidates with agricultural engineering qualifications were preferred as per the notification. Hence, there was no malpractice in the exams, it stated.

Since there were social media posts alleging malpractices in Group-I exams too, the TNPSC examined the issue and found that there had not been any foul play. The TNPSC stated that several coaching centres published the details of successful candidates as if the candidates had trained with these centres.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-group-2a-exam-under-scanner/article30707000.ece
248,2020/02/01,"Ignore enticements, Stalin tells partymen","Cautioning his party’s newly-elected representatives of local bodies against “getting lured by enticements dangled by the ruling dispensation to indulge in corruption”, DMK president M.K. Stalin on Friday invoked the names of late leaders M. Karunanidhi and C.N. Annadurai to administer an oath extracting their resolve to render public services with an upright outlook.

Mr. Stalin asked them to keep vigil to ensure there was no graft in (floating and awarding of) tenders.

“The AIADMK is keen on causing disrepute to the DMK. Your single-point focus must be to earn the goodwill of people and bring back DMK to power in the 2021 Assembly elections,” he told a gathering of a little over 6,500 representatives of village panchayats, panchayat unions, and district panchayats. “Now that history has been created through the party’s brilliant performance in the local body elections despite being in the Opposition, persevere with the impediments that could be caused by the ruling party until 2021 Assembly elections whereafter the DMK government will fulfil your requirements,” he said.

Role model

Referring to “development works” undertaken during his stint as Mayor for two terms in the Chennai and as Minister for Local Bodies, Mr. Stalin sought to cite himself as a role model in according priority for public interface. “Late Kalaignar (Karunanidhi) himself was awestruck by my public-mindedness. My administrative efficiency was appreciated by persons of impeccable repute such as late C. Subramanian and senior CPI leader Nallakannu, and the reputed national daily The Hindu,” Mr. Stalin said.

Hinting that the DMK would move the court, Mr. Stalin slammed Environment Minister K.C. Karuppannan over the latter’s statement that the State government would allocate less funds to local bodies won by the DMK.

Mr. Stalin urged the elected representatives to refer to party’s handbook about their duties, rights and power.

249,2020/02/01,Lawyers slam police for terming march unlawful,"A section of senior advocates practising in the Madras High Court on Friday accused the city police of having portrayed a peaceful padayatra taken out on Thursday to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi on Martyrs’ Day as an “unauthorised activity” by many lawyers and three retired judges of the court.

In a statement, they said, “To describe a peaceful padayatra to honour Gandhiji as an unlawful protest is an insult to the Mahatma.”

The statement was issued jointly by advocate N.G.R. Prasad, designated senior counsel Nalini Chidambaram, Bader Sayeed, R. Shunmugasundaram, N.R. Elango and seven others.

Asserting that the padayatra was undertaken in a most dignified and peaceful way with the participants carrying the national flag and placards containing the preamble to the Constitution, the advocates said: “The participants did not go anywhere near the High Court building nor was there any disruption of the functioning of any court.

‘Message of peace’

“The padayatra went around the periphery and outside the court campus by which the message of peace, harmony and the idea of Gandhi’s India was sent across to the public at large. By repeated promulgation of orders under Section 41 of the City Police Act, the State has prohibited the right to assembly and that of any democratic expression.

“For them to paint the participation of retired judges who have every right as citizens to pay homage to the Mahatma and his message as suspicious or undesirable deserves to be deprecated. Yesterday, citizens were prevented from assembling at Gandhi Mandapam and some were detained.

“People look to the courts as the last bastion of defenders of the Constitution. It is highly condemnable for the police now to cast a cloud over a non partisan and solemn padayatra taken to remember the Mahatma and to reiterate his enduring message of peace and harmony.

Participating in the closing ceremony of the 31st Road Safety Week celebrations at RTC Karimnagar-2 depot in the town on Saturday, the Collector said that most of the road accidents were due to human error.

‘Follow norms’

Stating that accidents could be prevented if traffic rules and regulations were followed, he called upon drivers to always follow the norms.

He asked them to get good sleep before driving and frequently go for eye check-ups.

There are about 2,000 drivers working in the Karimnagar region. The Collector felicitated 30 drivers for not causing a single accident in their 30 years of service.

The students had cultivated a 1.5 acre plot in the university with spinach and their effort has become part of the campus farming competition on Saturday. The campus farmers, as the students have come to be known, are inspired by Mahesh Babu-starrer Maharishi in which he opts for weekend farming despite being a techie. “This way, the students will be integrated with the community at large,” observed Antahpragnya convenor Swapnil Jangale as he talked of the unique experiment in making engineering students learn agriculture.

The students belong to mechanical, civil, metallurgical, chemical, electrical and computer science branches. They cumulatively spent 1,080 man hours on farming.

B. Ganapathi, a resident, offered boiled rice mixed with ghee to the homa gundam arranged for Lord Venkateswara and Lord Hanuman. He was joined by his wife, brother and children. All of them lit incense sticks and offered prayers. Next to those pits were three more erected in the memory of Ganapathi’s grandfather, grandmother and great grandfather.

A few yards away, Mothiram, a village elder, along with his sons and grandchildren observed similar rituals and made offerings to God as well as their forefathers as they sought blessings for their future.

Though this ritual was scheduled for April or May, the villagers performed it three months in advance as they will be vacating the village next week and shifting to a new location. Some of them arranged even luggage boxes outside their houses to symbolise the process of moving out. Though they have been allotted new houses and compensated for their lands lost to the reservoir, they were not in the least bit happy to vacate the village.

‘Heartbreaking’

“The government has acquired our lands and houses for Kondapochamma reservoir and allotted us houses at Tunkibollaram. But we have been part of this village for generations.

The victim, Chatla Pandu (46), was rushed to Bhuvanagiri Area Hospital in an 108 ambulance after locals found him in a pool of blood. He was then shifted to the Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad, where he was declared dead.

Valigonda police said the incident was reported by few villagers who were returning home at around 10 p.m. on Thursday. Reportedly, Pandu had completed his work at the mandal headquarters and was returning home to Lingarajupalli at around 9.30 p.m., when unidentified persons attacked him with sticks.

The victim lay in a pool of blood with head injuries, a few hundred metres from the village, and soon rushed to Bhuvanagiri for emergency care. At the Gandhi Hospital in the wee hours of Friday, he was declared dead.

Police said the victim’s family submitted a petition, but did not express doubt on any known persons.

Pandu’s body was handed over to his family on Friday afternoon and a pall of gloom descended on Lingarajupalli. Soon, leaders of MRPS and other voluntary organisations staged protest in Valigonda demanding expeditious action. They also demanded that the government extend compensation and jobs to Pandu’s wife Durgamani and their two children, one of whom is in school and the other a college-goer.

254,2020/02/01,Budget disappointing for TS: Uttam,"The Budget presented by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Seetharaman is highly disappointing, especially for Telangana, said Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) President N. Uttam Kumar Reddy.

“There is nothing in the Budget for unemployed youth, farmers, women, students and the sectors that generate jobs have been completely ignored,” he said in a statement here.

It was highly disappointing for Telangana as there is no clarity on devolution of taxes to States. Telangana has been meted out injustice since 2014-15 and not a single promise made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act has been honoured. The BJP government was acting as if Telangana doesn’t exist in India’s map, he said.

“The budget speech was completely silent on rising unemployment in the country which is at 45-year high. The Finance Minister neither made a mention of unemployment nor proposed any measures to address the problem,” he said.

Similarly, he said the government did not specify as to how it plans to double the income of farmers by 2022. The agriculture growth rate must be at least 11% for doubling the income but the Economic Survey 2019-20 says the annual growth rate in real terms in agriculture and its allied sectors is 2.9 per cent. The Finance Minister needs to clarify how the government plans to achieve its target, he said.

Mr. Reddy said the previous Congress regimes created public assets, but the BJP government was selling them to private parties. The proposed scheme to have a medical college attached to a district hospital in public-private partnership (PPP) mode clearly means that people would have to pay for medical services in those hospitals.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/budget-disappointing-for-ts-uttam/article30715833.ece
255,2020/02/01,Budget failed to raise rural demand: AIKSCC,"Foundation for Democratic Reforms and Lok Satta Founder Jayaprakash Narayan has said the Union Government let go of an opportunity to take a strategic big step and introduced a casual budget without trying for fundamental change.

The country in its present situation needed a big and bold step. China had taken such a step and in 1991, P.V.Narasimha Rao and Dr.Manmohan Singh had taken such an initiative when it was required. But the Budget introduced by the government did not reflect any effort to attain China’s position, create one crore jobs per year and create employment opportunities on a large scale like China.

Even in agriculture sector, the Budget failed to announce policies to increase exports and enable farmers earn more income and the it did not lay foundation for fundamental changes in the sector and repeated what had been said for the last 25 years.

All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) said the Budget fails to increase rural demand and purchasing power which would have boosted the economy. Instead, it only boosts the profits of big corporates and MNCs. Total budget allocation for agriculture, rural development and irrigation was ₹2.68 lakh crore in 2019-20 and now nominally increased to ₹2.83 lakh crore and in real terms, taking inflation into account, it amounts to zero increase.

Budget 2020 proposes increased penetration of MNCs and corporate giants in agriculture inputs supply, procurement of crops, storage, agri-processing, insurance and marketing of crops. It gives no relief to peasants from high input costs, low crop prices, distress sale, crop losses. Their exploitation by companies will increase through leasing of their land, making them indebted, buying their crops cheap and earning huge profits in food processing and marketing, the AIKSCC said.

Niranjan Reddy has expressed disappointment over the Union Budget allocations made to the agriculture sector, stating that the measures announced were lukewarm and insufficient towards the Centre’s plans to double the farmers income in the next two years.

In his reaction to the Union Budget, Mr. Reddy said on Saturday that the State government had been for long demanding linking Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) to agriculture to overcome the severe labour crisis faced by the sector as also to provide some relief to the farming community in terms of expenditure. However, the Centre has announced that it would be linked only for raising fodder cultivation.

Similarly, there was no clarity on support to formation of crop colonies and establishing food processing units to help farmers get remunerative price to their produce, the minister said. Although the Budget speech had a mention of support for one crop colony for every district, there was no clarity on the number of districts and States and also the quantum of support.

Further, Mr. Reddy said lack of any support in the form of national project status or in any other form to either one of the two major irrigation projects taken up by the Telangana government – Kaleshwaram and Palamuru-Rangareddy – aimed at irrigating over 70 lakh acres was also highly disappointing.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/allocation-to-farm-sector-disappointing/article30715507.ece

On Thursday, Ministry of Health stated that all those who returned from China after January 15, 2020 should be tested for nCoV.

State Director of Public Health G Srinivas Rao has appealed all those who have returned from China after January 15 to call State Control room number 040-24651119 to give information on where can they give samples for tests, if they had not given samples earlier.

Co-founder of AdOnMo, a digital out-of-home advertising startup which recently raised $3 million, Sravanth Gajula opined that proposal to provide ‘early life funding’, as mentioned in the budget speech, to early stage startups would greatly help them.

“Such seed funding and tax benefits will greatly foster the startup ecosystem as a whole. The proposal enables the transition from idea to product very swiftly, and hence boost the innovation accelerating go-to-market. As startup is a category that stands in the need of resources, be it multidisciplinary team, funding, and technology, such benefits fortify more ideas seeing the light of reality,” he said.

Chief executive officer of the WE Hub Deepthi Ravula too welcomed the move. She said that several early stage startups do not proceed to the next stage, primarily due to a lack of funding. The move, she said, would enable innovators to become entrepreneurs which is likely to lead to an increase in product-based startups. Touching upon the proposed digital platform for in the field of intellectual property rights, she said: “Creation of a digital platform for IP protection would enable more Nano MSME and startup entities to think of and apply for patents. One thing which we would need to see is the pricing and how best it will blend in or incorporate the various IP facilitation cells which function under the various central, state and industry body levels.”

Meanwhile, CEO of the T - Hub Ravi Narayan said that employee stock option plan and the proposal of deferring tax payment by five years would introduce talent and retain it for longer. “The existing online government e-marketplace should open up the government as a customer.

262,2020/02/01,Develop tourist spots like Brundavan Gardens along Godavari: CM,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the officials to develop tourism sector by taking the barrages, pump houses and reservoirs constructed as part of the Kaleshwaram project as an opportunity to promote tourism.

In a review meeting held here on Saturday, he told the officials to identify the places that have potential to attract tourists and prepare plans accordingly.

Narsinga Rao (CMO), secretaries Smita Sabharwal and Bhoopal Reddy, Managing Director of Tourism Development Corporation Manohar, Engineer-in-Chief of Kaleshwaram N. Venkateshwarlu and others attended the meeting.

Stating that the barrages constructed as part of Kaleshwaram project had made the Godavari river course live with water storage round the year for about 150 km and natural forests along the river course would make the stretch a potential tourism centre, the Chief Minister suggested that more trees could be grown on the river banks like what it was around Dal Lake in Kashmir. The stretch would also provide a huge potential for boating.

Further, he suggested that garden on the lines of Brundavan garden at Krishnaraja Sagar project near Mysuru, musical fountains and water parks could also be developed along with river stretch as sufficient government land was available along the course. The pump houses of Kaleshwaram project, Jaipur Thermal Power Plant of Singareni Collieries could also be thrown open to public, he said.

263,2020/02/01,CII-Telangana leaders hail Budget,"CII Telangana leaders welcomed the Union Budget for its thrust to achieve more in the fields of agriculture, rural development, education, health and skill development.

Speaking to media, at a budget viewing session organised by CII here, chairman D.Raju termed the budget very thoughtful and aspirational. Besides seeking to improve rural economy by laying emphasis on food and agricultural sector and its thrust on education and skilling by integrating apprenticeship with graduation programme, the budget gave a big push to manufacturing sector, especially mobile and other electronic equipment manufacturing.

Chairman of CII Education Council BVR Mohan Reddy said there is a special focus on education, employability and skilling of people, though more could have been done for skilling.

The initiative of incorporating apprentice as part of course curriculum is a welcome move. In addition, the scheme of taking students as apprentice in urban local bodies (ULBs) will offer a great learning experience to the beneficiaries. Also, allowing large hospitals to offer PG courses will bring more skilled professionals in the medical sector, he said.

Past chairman of CII Southern region Anil Kumar Epur said through various measures the budget is likely to provide a significant impetus to rural economy and will also help generate jobs.

Make in India

Managing director of Radiant Appliances and Electronics Raminder Singh Soin hailed the Budget for the push it sought to provide for the growth of electronics manufacturing industry. With the ecosystem that exists in Telangana, the State stood to gain from the proposed measures to curb imports. Such a move, by imposing tariffs, is bound to attract private firms, encourage domestic manufacturing and also create several job opportunities.

The first wave was software, now it will be that of hardware, Mr.Soin said, adding how not just electronics manufacturers but others in the ecosystem were likely to get a boost.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her Budget speech, said India needs to boost domestic manufacturing and attract large investments in the electronics value chain. “I propose a scheme focussed on encouraging manufacture of mobile phones, electronic equipment and semi-conductor packaging. Details would be announced later.”

In a statement, Telangana State Federation of Textile Associations president Prakash Ammanabolu welcomed the Budget proposal to set up a National Technical Textiles Mission and the ₹1,480 crore allocation made towards that.

265,2020/02/01,A degree of disappointment: Dr. Reddy’s head,"Pharma industry leader and chairman of Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Satish Reddy has said the Union Budget 2020-21 is disappointing in the backdrop of high expectations industry had nurtured.

“The industry had high expectations as it was seen to be an opportunity to announce big, bold reforms given the state of the economy. On that count, there is a degree of disappointment, in some quarters, as expectations have not been met,” he said in a statement on Saturday.

Mr. Reddy, who is president of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, said he, however, was happy to see healthcare continuing to be an integral part of the government’s key priorities. The announcement on expansion of the Ayushman Bharat programme by setting up additional hospitals in tier 2 and 3 cities was a welcome move.

“I would have liked to see a significant financial incentive to boost exports and improve the competitiveness of the pharma sector. I hope this will take shape with a new export incentive scheme. The overall thrust on ease of doing business, regulatory simplicity and policy stability should help the pharma industry scale new heights,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-degree-of-disappointment-dr-reddys-head/article30714073.ece

267,2020/02/01,Hope investments on infrastructure fructify:FTCCI,"Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry has said that the Union Budget for 2020-21 is balanced overall with allocation for investment on infrastructure and incentivising manufacturing sector.

President of the FTCCI Karunendra S Jasti, speaking to media after the live streaming of Union Budget, here on Saturday said it was important in an economy on the downturn, to invest on infrastructure, job creation and wealth creation. However, one should wait and see how the allocations on investment would fructify. Government should focus on infrastructure rather than subsidies and concessions as in the long-term, only infrastructure development would revive the economy.

The Budget addressed the needs of all sections of society — farmers, women SHG groups, salaried people, individual tax payers, MSMEs and companies. The Finance Minister has considered majority of the concerns expressed by industry and has given major reliefs like — increasing the turnover limit from ₹ 1 crore to ₹5 crore for compulsory audit, bringing smaller NBFCs under SARFAESI Act and reducing the loan size from ₹ 1 crore to ₹ 50 lakh for applicability of SARFAESI Act, extension of debt restructuring facility for MSMEs till March 2021, extension of tax holiday for developers of affordable housing by one year.

Spending power

He however said that the net effect of the changes in the income tax slabs and rate cuts would be known only after examining the exemptions and deductions removed/retained. The revenue that government lost through cut in corporate taxes would come to hands of people.

Chairman of the Direct Tax Committee of FTCCI Premchand Kankariya said that the new tax slabs were for simplification if one would forego deductions. Abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax, a long pending request, was conceded as it amounted to double taxation and now it would be taxable only at the hands of recipient. Another key feature was faceless assessment and appeals that would be good for ease of doing business. The proposed charter for tax payers would be part of statute and mandatory and would enable tax payers to get relief.

Chairman of the GST & Customs Committee M. Jayadev said measures for GST simplification would be helpful and electronic invoicing coupled with Aadhar based verification to be made mandatory would help prevent invoice frauds but one should see how small shopkeepers who do not have computers would do electronic invoicing.

Asked if the Budget has anything to help MSMEs in the State, FTCCI members said nothing much for the States and they would have to fend for themselves. There was nothing to expect from Centre and it was disappointing that way.

268,2020/02/01,Revenue employees too await new Revenue Act,"It is not only Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao who has been reiterating the need to bring a new Revenue Act to streamline the functioning of the Revenue Department, but also employees and general public who are equally eager for the new Act to make the department, with maximum public interface, transparent and accountable.

After the gruesome murder of Abdullapurmet Tahsildar Vijaya Reddy by a man allegedly frustrated that his Pattadar passbook was not corrected though his land was involved in a legal dispute, Telangana Revenue Employees Services Association struck work for over a week in November last year seeking protection for Mandal Revenue Officers/Tahasildars and sought guidelines from the government for resolving pending disputed cases. All the land disputed cases identified under the land record updation programme were categorised under the Category B.

The guidelines on how to go about resolving ‘Category B’ cases in a transparent manner and with accountability fixed on officers have not been issued even more than two months after the assurance was given, revenue employees associations point out.

People who have been doing rounds still for correction of errors that crept into the passbooks without any disputes even after two years too are anxious for a solution and pin their hopes on the New Revenue Act. People too want time-bound delivery of services to save their money and time.

With loss of image among the public with the Chief Minister himself airing his view openly that the Revenue Department was the most corrupt department, the revenue employees associations have decided to meet Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister K. T. Rama Rao again and press for the guidelines for the disposal of disputed cases other than those pending in the civil courts and also for correction of errors that crept into the passbooks.

The revenue employees welcoming the proposed new Revenue Act will be representing to the government to restrict the employees to the services of Revenue Department. At present they were deployed for every work right from conducting elections to implementation of welfare schemes, pulse polio programmes to family planning programmes. The District Collectors would seek the services of revenue employees when there was no progress in other departments. But this often would affect their core work of land administration, they said.

269,2020/02/01,Crash in chilli prices leaves farmers distraught,"Red chilli that sold for a little over ₹ 21,000 a quintal in the agriculture market yard here three weeks ago, fetched a low price of ₹ 13,100 a quintal on Friday, leaving chilli growers distraught.

The initial euphoria over the highest price commanded by red chilli in the second week of January in the present procurement season gradually subsided following slump in the price of the commodity, dampening the hopes of chilli growers of reaping rich dividends.

Chilli farmers are now grappling with the sharp fall in the price of the commodity.

It may be mentioned that some irate farmers staged a protest in the market yard on Thursday distraught over the alleged low price offered to their produce by the traders.

The angry farmers blamed the drastic crash in price of red chilli in a span of just three weeks on the “errant traders” accusing them of trying to attribute it to the alleged decline in chilli exports in the aftermath of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in China.

The agitated farmers termed the contention of a section of traders as “baseless.”

Following the incident, a posse of police personnel was deployed at the market yard to prevent untoward incidents.

Meanwhile, around 20,000 bags of red chilli have arrived in the market yard for sale on Friday.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j6ycg7/article30706769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01KHM-CHILLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/crash-in-chilli-prices-leaves-farmers-distraught/article30706770.ece

271,2020/02/01,Healthy food for tribal students,"Having introduced a few new items to the menu in the Tribal Welfare ashram schools and hostels recently, the Tribal Welfare Department has laid a renewed focus on provision of deliciously wholesome food to the tribal students in strict adherence to the new menu by the wardens concerned.

In addition to the regular food items, some new traditional snacks have been added to the menu and the prescribed quantity of some existing items for each student has been increased to meet the nutritional requirements of students, sources said.

The move is expected to benefit nearly 20,400 students of a total of 82 tribal welfare residential educational institutions, including ashram schools and hostels, in the old composite Khammam district.

As many as 64 of these institutions are located in the Agency areas spanning the predominantly tribal populated Bhadradri-Kothagudem district.

The new menu envisages provision of mutton curry twice a month, which hitherto served only once in 30 days. The existing practice of serving chicken curry four times in a month has been retained in the new menu.

Now students have the choice of consuming milk mixed with a nutritional energy drink with chocolate flavour, sources said.

The comprehensive menu offers students wholesome quality food to boost their energy levels and enable them maintain good health to effectively concentrate on their studies, says Jaheeruddin, Deputy Director, Tribal Welfare, Bhadradri-Kothagudem district.

Semiya, carrot halwa, onion pakoda, boiled channa, jaggery-based groundnut bars and other snacks are integral part of the menu, he notes, adding that traditional items such as poori and bonda are being served to the students daily. “Students are being provided milk mixed with energy drink, Boost, daily before breakfast,” Mr Jaheeruddin adds.

The new menu charts have been prominently displayed in all the tribal welfare ashram schools and hostels in the erstwhile integrated Khammam district as per the instructions of the Integrated Tribal Development Agency, (ITDA), Project Officer, V P Gautham, he asserts.

All the Assistant Tribal Development Officers have been asked to strictly monitor the implementation of the menu and ensure provision of quality food in hygienic conditions in the tribal welfare ashram schools and hostels.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/q7bbtz/article30706637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY01STUDENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/healthy-food-for-tribal-students/article30706638.ece
272,2020/02/01,"Crop dusting using drones is illegal, says Centre","Technology, it is said, is a double-edged sword. It is also the case with pesticide spraying on crops for pest-killing, considering the collateral damage.

Recently, the Union Government clarified to one Donthi Narasimha Reddy in a communication over the issue.

Mr. Reddy, a passionate campaigner of environmental and development issues, in a letter to Rajesh Verma, Additional Secretary (PP), Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, in November 2019, highlighted that usage of drones in for agro-chemical spraying has increased and would create lot of problems.

“As you are aware, aerial spraying impacts a larger area, while decreasing the efficacy on the target pests. We have seen Kasargod in Kerala reeling under such impact due to aerial spraying of Endosulfan for over 25 years. We are also aware that farmers and sprayers ignore and/or cannot follow safety precautions under adverse weather and wind conditions. Drift of spraying can take the fine hazardous chemical beyond the range of application,” said Mr. Reddy.

“The Insecticide Act does not allow aerial spraying. Drones and unmanned machines can be hazardous tools for spraying hazardous chemicals in many ways. Allowing aerial spraying, using drones and unmanned, remote controlled vehicles can be catastrophic,” he added in his appeal.

There is no scientific validity that drones help in precision spraying, he wrote. “Drone manufacturers, suppliers and the entire network have to be cautioned against using drones for aerial spraying of agro-chemicals. We request you to issue an advisory to all concerned regulatory authorities against allowing drone usage for agrochemical spraying,” he urged.

In response, the Union Government has clarified that drone-spraying is illegal. “As per the provisions of Insecticides Act 1968, aerial application of pesticides need approval/ permission from the Central Insecticides Board (CIB). Further, no permission/ approval has been granted by the CIB in the past for the use of drones to spray pesticides,” said a communication on December 30, 2019, from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/w7su2p/article30706525.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THDRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/crop-dusting-using-drones-is-illegal-says-centre/article30706526.ece

The IAF’s Eastern Air Command is situated on the outskirts of Shillong.

On Friday, the Federation of Khasi Jaintia Garo People (FKJGP) wrote to East Khasi Hills Deputy Commissioner Matsiewdor War Nongbri, requesting that she seek an explanation from the IAF. The poster, also written in the Khasi script as ‘Trespasser yn siat’, was scaring the locals, it said.

“This kind of threat of use of force has caused concern among residents,” FKJGP leader Kitboklang Nongphlang said. He said the locals had neither been harbouring any ill-will towards the Air Command, nor had anyone trespassed into the premises, since it was shifted to the present site in 1963.

“Any error of judgement on the part of either the villagers or the armed IAF personnel could result in fatality, given the threat,” the letter said.

The Goa Police’s women and child protection unit on Thursday filed an FIR against the Council for Social Justice and Peace (a Goa church’s wing) and National Human Rights Organisation (Goa Chapter) for using children to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at a rally in Margao.

“The politically dictated FIR by the Goa Police is not only an attack on freedom of expression and speech, but also a direct assault on a religious institution,” Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar said.

Talking to reporters here, Mr. Chodankar accused the BJP-led State government of creating “fear psychosis” among the anti-CAA protesters, who have been fighting to save the Constitution. “When the BJP realised that people are against its ulterior motive of passing the CAA, they are resorting to such actions,” the Congress leader alleged.

277,2020/02/01,U.P. hostage taker’s wife lynched by mob,"Over 20 children, aged between six months and 15 years, were rescued after an armed man, a murder convict who took them hostage after inviting them for a birthday party at his house in a village at Farrukhabad, was killed on January 30 night, police said.

IG Kanpur Mohit Agarwal said the suspect was shot dead in the encounter. “We have found a large cache of guns and gunpowder from him. He was constantly firing at police,” Mr. Agarwal said. The wife of the suspect also died after she was allegedly lynched by a mob of angry villagers when she attempted to flee the spot.

However, the exact cause of death was not clear, said police. Mr. Agarwal said when the woman was sent to hospital, she was injured, bleeding from her head. The reason of death will be known in the post-mortem report, he said. “When her husband was firing at the police, the woman tried to flee from there...the villagers were angry and attacked her with bricks and stones,” said the officer.

The operation, starting from the negotiations, lasted eight hours. Two policemen were injured in the incident, said DGP O.P Singh.

The hostage drama began at Kasaria village in the afternoon on Thursday. Hours later, the accused released a six-month-old girl by handing her over to his neighbour from a balcony, they said.

The DGP said the suspect Subash Batham was engaged in talks by the police and administration “constructively” but he threatened to “blow up” the place many times. “When we felt he was getting aggressive, the police team decided to attack.

279,2020/02/01,Illegal narcotics trade on the rise along Bengal-Bangladesh border,"Cattle smuggling on the south Bengal-Bangladesh border, considered the most porous along India’s entire eastern boundary, has declined over the past few years, but there has been a rise in the seizure of narcotics, particularly “Yaba tablets”, along the same border.

Yaba, considered a big menace in Bangladesh, is a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine sold as cheap red or pink pills. While not much of it was seized in 2018, the South Bengal Frontier of the Border Security Force (BSF) recorded seizure of over 42,023 tablets in 2019. Moreover, in only 24 days of January 2020, about 10,000 Yaba tablets were seized along the same border.

The smuggling of cattle along the South Bengal Frontier dropped from 39,965 heads of cattle in 2018 to 31,210 in 2019, and till January 24, 2020, 1,301 heads of cattle had been seized along the border.

While cattle smuggling takes place from India to Bangladesh, Yaba is usually smuggled from Bangladesh to India.

Increased surveillance

“There has been increased surveillance along the border, so the smuggling of large articles like cattle has fallen and [the smuggling of] narcotics, which can be easily carried, has increased,” said a senior BSF official of South Bengal frontier

There has also been an increase in the illegal trade of cough syrup Phensydl, which is smuggled largely from India to Bangladesh. In 2018, 1.39 lakh units of Phensydl were seized along the international border; this increased to 2.12 lakh units in 2019.

The BSF’s South Bengal Frontier, with jurisdiction that extends from Sunderbans in the south to Malda district in the north, guards 913 km of the international boundary. About 35% of the border is riverine, making it the most porous border along the whole eastern theatre.

Tending to animals

Additionally, border forces are grappling with the problem of housing seized cattle. Data available for seized cattle till the end of 2019 shows that personnel are tending to 1,700 heads of cattle in different border outposts (BOPs) along the Frontier. The cattle with the BSF is almost 6%-7% of all the seized livestock.

“In many of the BOPs, we have accommodated the cattle, but you have understand that BSF personnel are not trained to tend to cattle,” another BSF official said.

Prior to 2018, seized cattle along the border were handed over to the Customs Department, but following a Supreme Court order, they now have to be handed over to the police. According to BSF officials, in certain areas of the State, the police are “reluctant” to take the responsibility of seized cattle, and the BSF has to depend on non-governmental organisations (NGO) that can house cattle in sheds. Meanwhile, a few weeks ago, an NGO wrote to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) over the death of cattle in the BSF’s custody.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/illegal-narcotics-trade-on-the-rise-along-bengal-bangladesh-border/article30708325.ece
280,2020/02/01,Parents resist CWC notice to keep children away from sit-in,"“Who will take care of them? Shall we hand over our kids to Yogi Adityanath?” asked Aisha, a protester at the Hussainabad Clock Tower, where women have been staging a sit-in against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) since January 17.

Tagging along with Ms. Aisha is her three-year-old son. In the crowd of a few hundred protesters, mostly women and children, Ms. Aisha is not the only mother with her child in tow.

On January 29, the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of Lucknow issued a notice to parents bringing children to the dharna site and asked them to immediately send the children home.

It advised parents to immediately take the children home in their “best interest” so that there is “no negative impact on their psyche”. Otherwise, the CWC warned, action would be taken under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act.

Nazia Khan has two children, ages 6 and 8 years. While her husband goes to work, she comes to the protest and stays back till the evening. “Who will take care of my children at home if I don’t take them with me?” she asked.

281,2020/02/01,Top Jamia Masjid cleric calls for Mirwaiz’s release ‘to attend prayers’,"For the first time since August 5 when Hurriyat chairman and head priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was arrested, top cleric of Srinagar’s historic Jamia Masjid Maulana Ahmad Sayed Naqashbandi on Friday demanded Mr. Farooq’s release “to allow him to lead prayers in the mosque"".

In his Friday address at the Jamia Masjid in the old city, here, Mr. Naqashbandi, vice president of the Anjuman Auqaf Jamia Masjid (AAJM), expressed regret and concern at the continued detention of president AAJM Farooq.

“The Mirwaiz is under arbitrary continued house detention since August 5, 2019, by the authorities. He’s the religious head of Muslims of Kashmir and incapacitating him from performing his religious duties as the Mirwaiz and barring him from performing religious obligations as a Muslim of offering congregational Friday prayers is a violation of fundamental human rights,” he said.

He demanded that the Mirwaiz be released “forthwith and allowed to lead the congregation in the Jamia Masjid”. “In fact, all prisoners including youth languishing in various jails across India should be released,” he added.

Kashmir Bar chief’s heath deteriorating in jail

Meanwhile, Adil Asimi, Joint Secretary of the J&K High Court (J&KHC), on Friday expressed convern over the deteriorating and falling health of the Bar president Mian Abdul Qayoom in the Central Jail Agra.

“An extraordinary meeting of the Bar was held on Friday over the reports of Qayoom's health. Mr. Qayoom has been shifted to a local hospital for treatment where the facilities are inadequate,” said Mr. Asimi.

Quoting the family members, Mr. Asimi said they were allowed to meet Qayoom recently. “Three ECGs and one Echocardiography Cardio-graphy conducted on Qayoom Sahab indicated serious problems, including artery blockage of 60%. It's fatal at his age and his illness has aggravated to such an extent that he has been unable to walk for the past two days and has been relegated to a wheelchair,” he said.

The family members, according to the Bar, complained that advocate Qayoom has “suffered complete neglect at the Agra Hospital, where he was given nothing to eat despite being diabetic for the entire day.”

“His health quickly worsened as soon as he was back in the prison and is in grave pain at the moment and requires immediate advanced treatment,” the family members added.

The Bar has demanded ""to revoke the unconstitutional and illegal detention order and release Qayoom. “If anything happens to Mr. Qayoom, the concerned authorities under whose orders he has been detained would be solely responsible for the same,” the Bar warned.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/top-jamia-masjid-cleric-calls-for-mirwaizs-release-to-attend-prayers/article30707485.ece
282,2020/02/01,ED attaches Asadullah Biswas’ assets worth ₹4.67 crore,"The Enforcement Directorate has provisionally attached properties worth ₹4.67 crore of of Asadullah Biswas in a counterfeit currency case.

The action has been taken on the basis of an FIR registered by the National Investigation Agency under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

During the money laundering probe, 34 FIRs, 27 charge sheets and one prosecution complaint against Biswas and others were collected by the ED from the NIA, the Narcotics Control Bureau and the Malda police in West Bengal.

The cases have been registered under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code, Arms Act, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Explosive Act, Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, West Bengal maintenance of Public Order Act, Explosive Substances Act and the Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances Act.

It is alleged that Biswas and his accomplices indulged in criminal activities over a period of two decades.

“Despite a number of cases against him, he continued to operate as a mafioso , raised illegal funds through a range of crimes and laundered money in connivance with his family members and close associates,” said an official.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ed-attaches-asadullah-biswas-assets-worth-467-crore/article30708175.ece
283,2020/02/01,780 Pune-based institutes yet to furnish scholarship disbursement details to ED: RTI reply,"As many as 780 colleges and educational institutions in Pune district have yet to furnish details pertaining to the disbursement of scholarship fund amounts meant for backward class students despite an Enforcement Directorate (ED) notice directing 1,500-odd educational institutions in the district to this effect.

A Right to Information application filed by student leader Kuldeep Ambekar has revealed that a substantial scholarship fund amount between 2010 and 2017 meant for students from the SC, ST and OBC communities has yet to be accounted for by these institutions.

Following complaints of irregularities in the disbursement of scholarships meant for backward community students, the erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis government had ordered a probe by the ED. The directorate had directed 1,500-odd educational institutes in Pune district to furnish details of the scholarship funds.

On October 4 last year, the ED had accordingly directed the Pune division of the Social Justice and Special Assistance Department to gather details pertaining to the financial transactions involving the disbursement of the scholarship funds.

A week later, on October 12, the department had issued notices to educational institutions requesting details of students, course names, and money allotted to them from the State’s scholarship fund, to be submitted by November 14.

Observing that half of the educational institutions in Pune had yet to furnish details to the Social Justice Department despite the expiry of the November deadline, Mr. Ambekar alleged that several SC, ST and OBC students had yet to receive their scholarship amounts totalling more than ₹1,000 crore over the seven-year period.

“These funds are generally given in an ‘offline’ manner, that is instead of directly being deposited into students’ accounts, they are routed by the Social Justice Department to the colleges, which in turn give them to the students. So, when students petition the department for their scholarships, the department says it has already given the funds to the respective colleges. Typically, colleges use this money for their development works or divert it to some student activity,” alleged Mr. Ambekar, a founding member of volunteer outfit Student Helping Hands, and leader of the student wing of the Loktantrik Janata Dal United.

He said the list of the institutions yet to furnish details includes noted ones like D.Y. Patil College, Fergusson College and Bharati Vidyapeeth.

A student, requesting anonymity, said, “When I asked the college authorities to give my due scholarship amount, the authorities told me the funds are with the Social Justice Department. When I visited the department, they said they had already given the funds to the college. So, we are being tossed about like ping-pong balls.”

Mr. Ambekar said he recently met Dhananjay Munde, State Minister for Social Justice and Special Assistance, on this issue and urged him to order an ED inquiry into the matter.

Meanwhile, Vijay Gaikwad, Deputy Commissioner of the Pune division of the Social Justice Department, said they had already furnished details received from institutions that had complied with their directive, to the ED.

“I cannot comment on what the ED’s next course of action will be. We have already apprised them from our end,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/780-pune-based-institutes-yet-to-furnish-scholarship-disbursement-details-to-ed-rti-reply/article30707383.ece
284,2020/02/01,Transport Department to modernise 150 bus depots,"The State Transport Department wants to modernise 150 ST bus depots, starting with the ones at Trimbakeshwar, Karjat and Dapoli. The plan includes installing digital signboards, vehicle tracking systems, clean surroundings, good toilets and better seating, among other things. The bhoomipujan of the three depots could take place in February, Transport Minister Anil Parab has said.

The ST depots across the State are riddled with poor infrastructure including poor seating area, lack of good toilets, announcement systems, food stalls and illegal hawkers. Mr. Parab held a meeting with bureaucrats of the department to look at various measures to be taken to modernise the depots. The department has drawn up a list of 150 depots that will be modernised in a phased manner, starting with the three depots. The department chose these first since Trimbakeshwar and Dapoli see a large number of tourists. Mr. Parab is also the guardian minister of Dapoli.

“We want to standardise all these depots to bear the same look, digitise all signboards and put up a video wall wherein people can see the status of their buses similar to screens in airports. Most of all, we want to lay stress on cleanliness. We want the depots and toilets to be clean with enough clean drinking water stations because we lose passengers due to the lack of cleanliness. People don’t want to come into depots and prefer private options instead, from outside the depot,” said Mr. Parab, who also wants to crack down on unauthorised transport operators.

However, with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s finances in poor shape, Mr. Parab said the department will look at financial models including utilisation of land bank, commercial exploitation of depots as well as public private partnership.

Mr. Parab has called road safety his first priority and has directed his department to submit a report on accidents and what measures can be taken at a policy level to curb them. Mr. Parab recently visited the site of the Nashik accident where 26 people lost their lives. He wants to bring in an app-based vehicle tracking system for ST buses as well.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/clpikw/article30707363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BMPARAB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/transport-department-to-modernise-150-bus-depots/article30707364.ece
285,2020/02/01,Businessman quarantined in Nagpur,"A 30-year-old spare parts importer suspected of exposure to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) has been quarantined at the government hospital in Nagpur. In all, 12 patients have been quarantined in the State including five each in Mumbai and Pune, and one each in Nagpur and Nanded.

According to the medical superintendent of Nagpur Hospital, Dr. Rajesh Gosavi, the businessman had returned home on January 6. “He was about 1000 km away from Wuhan and had some symptoms which subsided. He panicked after reading news reports and walked in to the hospital on Thursday. At present, he only has a runny nose,” said Dr. Gosavi adding that his samples have been sent to National Institute of Virology in Pune. Dr. Gosavi said that a 24-year-old woman studying in China has also reported with diarrhoea but she has no other symptoms associated with nCoV like fever, cough, and cold.

State health officials said that nine of the 12 samples have tested negative while reports of some repeat samples were awaited.

Meanwhile, the panic has resulted in shortage of masks. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Friday prohibited the export of personal protection equipment (PPE), including clothing and masks used for protection air borne particles. This also includes the N95 respirators.

State government authorities however assured that they had enough protective gear for now. “We have 1,6831 N95 masks and have placed an order for an additional 1.8 lakh,” said Dr Anup Kumar Yadav, director of National Health Mission, Maharashtra. Mumbai's additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani, said the civic body has around 17,000 masks including the three layered masks and N95, 6,600 rubber gloves and 790 PPE sets.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/businessman-quarantined-in-nagpur/article30707359.ece
286,2020/02/01,"No funds, wind up probe, says Bhima-Koregaon Commission","The secretary of the Bhima Koregaon Commission, which was set up to look into the riots of January 1, 2018, in which one person lost his life, has written to the Chief Secretary recommending that the inquiry be wound up for want of funds.

Matter of survival

The three-page-letter said, “Officials of the commission have not received salaries from November 2019. Salaries and honorarium of all including the chairman are due from December 2019. Peons on the establishment of the commission are required to borrow money for survival. Most of the staff members are hired on a contract basis. They will starve for want of salary.”

After the initial budget of about ₹52 lakh, “which was hardly adequate”, was exhausted, the government either delayed sanctioning a supplementary budget or sanctioned a lower amount than was required, the letter said. “Salary and other bills were not promptly passed. Advance was never sanctioned for day-to-day expenses,” it said.

Staff and officers are spending from their pockets for day-to-day expenses that are not reimbursed for months together, the letter said. “Obstacles were created in sanction of lump sum payment to the staff and professional charges of the advocate of the commission.”

When the commission’s term was extended on November 8, 2019, it had sought a supplementary budget of ₹65 lakh. According to the directives issued by the Finance Department, the supplementary demand should have been submitted to it on or before November 16, 2019. But the Home Department did not submit the supplementary demand before that date and the Finance Department did not take the demand for approval in the ensuing budget session, it said.

“Surprisingly, the Home Department has prepared a note to the effect that only ₹25 lakh were demanded by the commission which is totally wrong. The commission, on the other hand, demanded a sum of ₹65 lakh.”

The letter also said that when the deputy secretary, Home, who is dealing with the affairs of the commission, was called to explain the financial position relating to the commission, he said, “At the moment there is no budget and the commission will get it only after the budget session.”

‘Unable to function’

When the superintendent of the commission went to the Home Department to make inquires about pending bills, the relevant under secretary asked him to wind up the commission, it said. “The circumstances indicate that the government is not serious about the commission, [which] is unable to function for want of money even for day-to-day expenses,” it said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-funds-wind-up-probe-says-bhima-koregaon-commission/article30707345.ece

They will submit their reports to the government within a month.

Mr. Wadettiwar said a criminal case would be filed against those found guilty. He said 608 cattle camps were set up in Beed district in 2019, while 296 were operational in Solapur and 504 in Ahmednagar. “The government spent around ₹1,200 crore on the camps.

288,2020/02/01,Four held for thrashing young couple in Jalna,"A video clip showing a youth and his female partner being beaten and verbally abused by a group of men in Jalna district has evoked strong condemnation from Maharashtra’s political spectrum, while prompting the police to launch a hunt to nab the miscreants.

By late Friday evening the police said it had caught at least four people, including a minor.

The video, which had gone viral a few days ago, shows the young woman and her male partner being assaulted, manhandled and humiliated at an isolated location by a group of youths, one of whom filmed the entire proceedings.

One of the miscreants, apparently a self-appointed vigilante, is seen clutching the girl’s tie as the boy tearfully pleads with them to let her go and says they had not done anything wrong.

Ignoring him, one of them is seen dragging the girl away before the clip ends, triggering suspicion among authorities that the she may have been molested.

“We are verifying the location of the incident and trying to ascertain the motives of the miscreants. Two police teams have been formed. We have taken one minor into custody while hunt is on for the others,” said S. Chaitanya, Jalna Superintendent of Police.

Condemning the incident, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted: “I urge the police to investigate the incident and have ordered the immediate removal of the viral video from social media platforms.”

Expressing concern that the girl may have been molested, BJP leader Chitra Wagh said, “It is utterly shameful. This video evokes a strong rage within oneself. I pray nothing terrible has happened to the girl.”

Likewise, NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal warned of stern action against the miscreants while senior BJP leader and Jalna MP Raosaheb Danve said the police should take the matter seriously and bring the offenders to book.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/four-held-for-thrashing-young-couple-in-jalna/article30707331.ece
289,2020/02/01,Probe finds irregularities at SARTHI,"A preliminary inquiry into the Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research, Training and Human Development Institute (SARTHI) has found irregularities worth crores in merely eight months after the institute’s formation.

SARTHI denied all allegations of misappropriation of funds in a statement issued on Friday. It said the expenditure was necessary as these were the institute’s early days and infrastructure had to be set up.

Formed under the previous Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, SARTHI is registered under the Companies Act, 2013, as a non-profit government company for research, policy advocacy and training for socio-economic and educational development of Maratha, Maratha-Kunbi, Kunbi-Maratha, Kunbi communities and families dependent on agriculture.

Soon after coming to power, the Maha Vikas Aghadi government appointed a one-member committee under Relief and Rehabilitation Department secretary Kishor Raje-Nimbalkar to probe alleged irregularities in the institute’s operations.

The preliminary probe has found that within eight months of its formation, SARTHI has spent ₹5.5 crore on advertisements, ₹80 lakh on six cars and ₹8 crore to train 226 students for UPSC.

OBC, SEBC, and VJNT Welfare Minister Vijay Wadettiwar said, “SARTHI director D.R. Parihar had demanded funds of over ₹530 crore. In the wake of this preliminary report, an IAS officer has been appointed as managing director at the institute and will probe further.” Mr. Parihar has already resigned.

The probe report said SARTHI did not take permission before spending the money, and no advertisement was issued for recruitments. Over 300 people were hired with salaries ranging from ₹18,000 to ₹20,000. A training institute for UPSC was paid ₹2-2.5 lakh per student, while ₹1.93 crore was spent on merely 127 students who were preparing for MPSC exams. Another ₹20 lakh was spent on just 13 students preparing for the National Defence Academy exam.

In its statement, SARTHI said it does not require the government’s permission for the expenditure. Mr. Wadettiwar, however, said, “SARTHI is a government initiative. It cannot spend money as per its wish. Government permission is a must.”

The ₹530 crore sought by Mr. Parihar in this year’s budget included ₹5 crore for library expansion, ₹12 crore for UPSC training, ₹30 crore for the skill development programme, ₹54 crore for PhD students, ₹54 crore for military training and ₹90 crore for human resources.

290,2020/02/01,Ajit Pawar assures of benefits to farmers regularly repaying loans,"Assuring farmers that the Maha Vikas Aghadi government would soon come up with benefits for cultivators who regularly repay their loans, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the committee formed in this regard would submit its recommendations to the government within a fortnight.

While the Uddhav Thackeray-led government has already announced an immediate waiver of loans up to ₹2 lakh per farmer, it constituted a seven-member committee headed by Mr. Pawar earlier this month to finalise benefits to farmers with crop loans of more than ₹2 lakh and those regularly repaying their loans.

“After we announced the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule farm loan waiver scheme, several farmers who regularly repaid loans and had never defaulted were left wondering why no benefits had been announced for them. However, I want to reassure them that our committee to look into their benefits has already had two meetings. Within the next 15 days, this committee will submit its recommendations,” Mr. Pawar said, during his visit to Nashik.

Tongue in cheek

The Deputy Chief Minister, who had a slew of review meetings with officials during his tour of north Maharashtra on Friday, reached Nashik with his customary punctuality well before his first event of the day, a ground-breaking ceremony scheduled at 7 a.m. Mr. Pawar’s swift appearance startled officials generally used to ‘latecomer’ ministers, prompting much hustle-bustle before the start of the event.

Taking a self-deprecatory jibe, Mr. Pawar remarked: “I apologise that you all had to come here so early, but I had a number of review meetings planned in Dhule, Nandurbar and other districts today… While one organiser doubted whether I would make it this early in the bitter cold, another reminded him that I had come very early for my swearing-in as deputy chief minister.”

Mr. Pawar’s disarming allusion to his temporary defection to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and his early morning coup when Devendra Fadnavis and he were respectively sworn in as the chief minister and deputy chief minister for a brief period, drew peals of laughter from the audience.

‘No rift with Chavan’

Mr. Pawar also downplayed reports of tensions between him and senior Congress leader Ashok Chavan, remarking that there was no rift between them.

He also expressed confidence in the three-party alliance, regardless of what its detractors said. “The Maha Vikas Aghadi government has been formed by three parties of differing ideologies. But we will complete our full tenure,” he said, adding that the government would also strive to eliminate any problems in the implementation of its Shiv Bhojan scheme.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nvis5j/article30707267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01bmAjitPawar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ajit-pawar-assures-of-benefits-to-farmers-regularly-repaying-loans/article30707268.ece
291,2020/02/01,Odisha medical student from Wuhan reports sick,"Twenty days after returning home to Phulbani in Odisha’s Kandhamal district, a student approached local authorities, suspecting that he may be infected with the coronavirus. The youth is a final year MBBS student of an institute near Wuhan in China. The student said he had developed a cough, cold and chest infection after he reached home on January 11.

Fearful that he may have been infected by the coronavirus while in Wuhan, he wrote to the Kandhamal Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO). On Friday, he met the CDMO, Dr. Rajyashree Patnaik, and was admitted to an isolation ward at the District Headquarter Hospital (DHH), Phulbani, for strict medical supervision.

Special arrangements

According to Dr. Saroj Kanta Sahu, Superintendent of SCB Medical College, Cuttack, where special arrangements have been made for patients suspected to be ailing from the coronavirus infection, State Director of the National Health Mission Shalini Pandit has directed blood and throat swab samples of the youth be sent to the Regional Medical Research Centre, Bhubaneswar.

293,2020/02/01,"Don’t speak to media, Visva-Bharati orders staff","Visva-Bharati University has issued an order prohibiting its staff from speaking to the media “until further order”, saying anything they want to express publicly should be routed through Assistant Registrar Anirban Sircar, who is the university’s spokesman as well as ‘Social Media Champion’.

“To seek the public limelight and self-importance through media for oneself is unworthy of any teacher or employee of Visva-Bharati. Visva-Bharati itself seeks no publicity,” a notification issued on Thursday said.

“No staff members of the university other than the Social Media Champion and the spokesperson shall make any statement/views on the matters pertaining to the university to the press personnel of electronic/print media without prior permission of the competent authority of the university as per Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964,” it said.

“In case of violation, the competent authority of the university may take appropriate action,” the notification warned.

Visva-Bharati, in the recent weeks, has been in the news for all the wrong reasons and this notification is an attempt at preventing further damage. The university has of late seen noisy protests organised by the Left-wing student leaders, who feel emboldened by the countrywide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the mob attack in JNU.

BJP ideologue

In early January, protesting students had locked up BJP ideologue Swapan Dasgupta after he delivered a lecture on the CAA. This was followed by an attack on the Left-wing students, some of who were injured. And more recently, when Vice-Chancellor Bidyut Chakrabarty questioned the sacredness of the Preamble of the Constitution during a Republic Day speech and his remarks were widely publicised, a student who had recorded his speech was overnight evicted from the hostel. Such unsavoury incidents are usually unheard of on the campus.

How far the gag order will serve its purpose remains to be seen as a teachers’ union is all set to challenge it in court.

“The order is clearly against the statutes of Visva-Bharati. The Rules referred to in this order is applicable only to direct government employees. Since the university is an autonomous body, those rules are not applicable here,” said Sudipta Bhattacharyya, president of the Visva-Bharati University Faculty Association.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/klx2q9/article30707127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01LEFT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dont-speak-to-media-visva-bharati-orders-staff/article30707128.ece
294,2020/02/01,Is tea painting wasteful? Find out at this workshop in Hyderabad,"It started with an accident — no, not that kind of accident. Ayushi Agarwal was having a cup of tea with a friend when the cuppa got knocked over and the tea dripped all over the table. The brown pigments, intense in some places and lighter in others, offered a light bulb moment for the art enthusiast. Why not paint with tea?

An example of tea painting, done at an Art Affection workshop

An upcoming workshop at Tea Villa Cafe held by Ayushi’s company Art Affection will be taking place on Saturday afternoon. Last October, Ayushi held a tea painting workshop at Chai Paani. Ayushi Agarwal is a 23-year-old finance graduate who is also a visiting faculty member at St Francis College for Women. However, she has long been nurturing her love for art and travel. “When I travelled to Assam, Darjeeling and Munnar, I visited tea fields and farms there.”

Tea painting, speaking of, is hardly novel; it has been around for centuries, in fact. Painters would use specific teas for certain hues. Rooibos was used for the red pigment, smoky black tea can bring up some orange hues, berry teas present blues and fruit teas can help with splashes of purples. Aysuhi agrees, adding that the workshop planned will be mainly with green macha tea from the folks at Tea Villa Cafe. “Of course, if someone wants to add more colour range, they can go ahead and I can guide them! Plus, it’s a non-toxic experience.”

Other mediums There are other workshops offered by Art Affection, too: resin art, which go viral online for its satisfying look and feel, is one of Ayushi’s favourites. “Resin is becoming really popular, but I like to make sure my workshops cover not just how to use resin but what materials go well with resin flow. I also really want to do coffee painting workshops. I’ve been looking for a space to hold a workshop so we’ll see!” She also hosts sessions around fluid art, zentangle and oil painting.

Does tea not go to waste for this? “Actually,” Ayushi responds, “the amount of tea used for this is small and a single tea bag can last for a long time or can be shared among many people. Plus, on a cost level, teas are not as expensive as acrylics or watercolours. The only real cost comes in the form of brushes and maybe paper.”

Because tea painting requires a fair bit of water, Ayushi says this technique requires paper of at least 300 gsm. “Over time, tea tends to steep and stain, so a thicker paper with more hold is required to maintain the colour intensities.” More experienced artists have used the actual tea bags as canvases, making sure nothing goes to waste.

301,2020/02/01,Strike hits banking operations,"Banking operations came to a standstill in Coimbatore district on Friday as nearly 3,000 employees and officials went on two-day strike here on Friday, as part of the nation-wide strike.

Transactions worth ₹400 crore were affected in the city. The city had nearly 200 ATMs and these were filled with cash on Thursday night. As the strike would continue on Saturday, cash availability in ATMs might be affected, said sources in the bank employees union.

The district has almost 700 bank branches and employees and officers in public sector banks and the old generation private banks took part in the strike. About 1,500 of them staged a demonstration here on Friday. The main demand of the employees was 20 % hike in wages.

Secretary of Coimbatore Consumer Cause K. Kathirmathiyon said, in a press release, that as per the existing rules, leave encashment for leave accumulated at the time of retirement was fully exempted from Income Tax. However, this was only for State and Central Government employees. In respect of employees in non-government organisations, the tax exemption was limited to ₹3 lakh for leave encashment at the time of retirement.

“It is a discrimination since income is an income whether (for) government employees or others,” he said. The government had the intention to give some relief to retiring employees. But it should be equal and there should not be any discrimination. Even if the government was not prepared to treat non-government employees and government employees on a par for tax, at least the exemption limit should be increased. “We request the government to look into the issue and provide reasonable relief to the retiring employees employed in non-government organisations,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/relief-for-retiring-employees-sought/article30706702.ece
303,2020/02/01,TNPCB report indicates high level water pollution in Vellalore,"The result of a study the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) conducted in and around the Coimbatore Corporation’s dump yard in Vellalore in November 2019 indicates high level water pollution.

The Board had shared the result in response to an RTI query filed by K.S. Mohan, secretary, Kurichi-Vellalore Pollution Prevention Action Committee.

The result showed that of the 15 locations tested, the total dissolved solid (TDS) reading in eight places, chlorides at seven locations, sulphate at a place and total hardness at eight places were higher than the drinking water standards.

As against the acceptable limit of 500 mg/l and permissible limit of 2,000 mg/l for total dissolved limit, the reading showed 3,936 at a place, 2,122 at another, 3,142 and a third place, Mr. Mohan said and argued that it showed how the area residents were severely affected by the Coimbatore Corporation’s open dumping of mixed waste. And, within the Vellalore dump yard, the reading showed that the TDS stood at over 18,000 mg/l, which was at least nine times the permissible limit.

Total hardness - another parameter for which the Board tested the water - showed that as against the permissible limit of 600 mg/l, the readings in a few of the 15 exceeded the limit with one place showing as much 2,050 mg/l.

Air quality

As for the air quality, the Board report showed high concentration of suspended particulate matter at 129 microgram per cubic metre as against 100 microgram per cubic metre. The residents had, for the past two months, been complaining about deteriorating air quality and stink from the dump yard.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tnpcb-report-indicates-high-level-water-pollution-in-vellalore/article30706693.ece
304,2020/02/01,"Corpn. to operate all 69 MCCs, waste to be processed locally","The decentralised approach to waste management that the Coimbatore Corporation has started should continue as it appeared to be a workable model aimed at solving the city’s solid waste management problem, Justice P. Jyothimani, Chairperson, State Level Monitoring Committee of National Green Tribunal (NGT) for Solid Waste Management in Tamil Nadu, told journalists here on Friday after a review meeting with the Corporation officials.

“The welfare of 10 lakh people cannot be compromised just because 10 people protest. In Vellalore too, the residents are protesting against the Corporation’s dump yard. The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court had given an order in this regard, saying that there should be no odour from the micro compost centres (MCCs) and imposing a few other conditions. This is one of the best concepts in waste management – the decentralised approach. Therefore the Corporation should go ahead with its plan.”

Justice Mr. Jyothimani was responding to a question from journalists who sought his comments to the residents’ opposition to the Corporation establishing such MCCs in their midst and activists alleging misuse of reserved sites.

Tamil Nadu was the first State to adopt such a decentralised approach to solid waste management. Now, Bihar had evinced interest, he pointed out and said as the project in Coimbatore was at a nascent stage of implementation, it would be wrong to scuttle it.

Every citizen was responsible for the waste he or she generated – they would have to segregate the waste and hand it over to the Corporation, he said and added that his visit to a few MCCs had revealed that there was no odour or fly menace.

Since his interaction with the Corporation officials at the last inspection of August 9, 2019, the Corporation had made considerable progress. It had put to use 12 such centres and had promised to start operations in another 23 to take total operational centres to 35 by March 31 this year. And, the remaining 34 in due course.

Since the last meeting, the Corporation had also purchased 90 light commercial vehicles to be deployed in waste management. The Commissionerate of Municipal Administration had given approval for another 56 such vehicles. The Corporation would deploy the vehicles to strengthen waste collection.

If the Corporation were to ensure segregation of waste at source, take all the organic waste to the centres and recycle all dry waste, the quantity of waste going to Vellalore would be halved to 450 – 500 tonnes a day, which a private contractor, UPL, was processing.

Justice Mr. Jyothimani also said that in the absence of new waste entering the Vellalore yard and the Corporation processing accumulated (legacy) waste through biomining, Vellalore, in about two years, would be rid of all the problems caused by waste.

Earlier, he along with senior Corporation officials interacted with Vellalore residents, Rapid Action Force personnel to learn about their difficulties. Petitioners in the NGT – V. Eswaran of the MDMK and K.S. Mohan, secretary, Kurichi-Vellalore Pollution Prevention Action Committee – highlighted the suffering of people due to high level of air and water pollution.

J. Daniel, an activist, complained to Justice Mr. Jyothimani that the Corporation constructed the MCCs, but did not put them to use. After hearing the grievance, he promised to return in two months to monitor the progress in waste management.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/xt6jn1/article30706683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB01WASTEMANAGEMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/corpn-to-operate-all-69-mccs-waste-to-be-processed-locally/article30706684.ece
305,2020/02/01,Tri-series | India women look to improve fielding,"The Indian women’s team will look for an improved show in the fielding department to complement its fine bowling when it takes on Australia in its second game of the Tri-series here on Sunday.

India beat England by five wickets in the tournament opener on Friday.

India put up a fine bowling performance, led by the spinners, to restrict England to 147, which was followed by a match-winning unbeaten 42-run knock by skipper Harmanpreet.

Good form

The top four — Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues and Harmapreet — were all among the runs, but the middle-order, comprising Veda Krishnamurthy and Taniya Bhatia, struggled.

However, India was far from impressive when it came to fielding with Harmanpreet, Jemimah and Veda dropping catches, apart from misfields, and the side will will look to quickly make amends.

Happy for youngsters

“I’m really happy that our young players could play with freedom. We have to work hard on our fielding. We need to improve,” Harmanpreet had said after the match.

Defending T20 World champion Australia, on the other hand, will be desperate to bounce back after going down to England in a thrilling game that was decided via Super Over on Saturday.

Neither the Australian bowlers nor the batters, except Beth Mooney, could make much of an impact on Saturday.

The Australians will also take confidence from the fact that India had lost both its matches against them in the tri-nation series in 2018.

306,2020/02/01,Pakistan vs Bangladesh | Ashraf and Bilal recalled,"Pakistan on Saturday recalled all-rounder Faheem Ashraf and off-spinner Bilal Asif for the first Test against Bangladesh starting in Rawalpindi next week.

Ashraf, 26, showed a lot of promise in his debut Test against Ireland in 2018 when he scored 83 but then faced injury problems and was discarded after the South Africa tour in January last year.

Bilal, 34, played the last of his five Tests against New Zealand in December 2018 and was not selected last year.

Azhar Ali will lead the team.

Head coach and chief selector Misbah-ul-Haq said Ashraf did well in the domestic tournament final two months ago.

The first Test starts in Rawalpindi from February 7.

Bangladesh had agreed to tour Pakistan in three phases and after playing three Twenty20 Internationals returned home earlier this week.

It will play the first Test and then return again for the sole One-Day International (April 3) and second Test (April 7-11) —both in Karachi.

308,2020/02/01,IND vs NZ T20I series | Invincible India eye rare 5-0 whitewash in final T20I,"Invincible so far, India will eye a rare 5-0 whitewash against a bruised and battered New Zealand in the final T20 International here on Sunday.

New Zealand have never lost all games in a bilateral T20I series (three or more matches) at home.

Since 2005, they have only once lost all games in a bilateral T20I series at home, going down 2-0 to England back in February 2008.

While this puts India in a unique position going ahead, they will still stay fifth in the ICC T20I rankings behind Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa.

India will have their mind set elsewhere though, pertinently the experimentation cycle ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia. The fourth T20I was a step in that direction, but it mostly came to nought with the likes of Sanju Samson and Shivam Dube wasting their opportunities.

Samson has been promoted up the order in his limited opportunities against both Sri Lanka and New Zealand, and has been dismissed while attacking the bowling.

The team management would want him to show more patience, while backing him to come good once again. Meanwhile, Dube has lacked footwork against both spinners and pacers.

Elsewhere, with Manish Pandey firming up the number six spot, Shreyas Iyer could be promoted to number three. The bigger question is about the keeper-batsman spot.

Ever since the Australia series at home, K.L. Rahul has played with an increased workload in that role. Pre-series, skipper Virat Kohli had more or less confirmed that Rahul would continue to keep in the ensuing three-ODI series. While he has been in great form, the team management could afford to rest him and bring in Rishabh Pant.

There is incentive to do so, for this fifth and final game of this series is the last T20I India will play in the current 2019-2020 season. In the shortest format, there is only the Indian Premier League to look forward to in two months’ time, and the next T20I series — against Sri Lanka later in the summer — is quite far away.

Pant, meanwhile, has been benched since suffering concussion in the first ODI against Australia in Mumbai. While he has fully recovered, his spot in the first-choice playing eleven is long gone. In fact, his status in the current scheme of things is far worse.

At the Westpac Stadium, Rohit Sharma was rested to create an additional space in the batting line-up. Logic dictates that Kohli will take Sunday off and Rohit could lead instead, thus continuing with the one additional batting spot.

In the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah could be rested with Mohammed Shami coming back to maintain the three-pacer theory.

Meanwhile, Kane Williamson is expected to be fit for the clash, after he missed out in Wellington due to a left shoulder niggle. The Black Caps’ team management were confident of his recovery even on Friday.

The hosts will have greater concern over their lack of finishing though, after squandering two last over winning positions in two consecutive games, and the series along with.

Whether the Kiwis can recover mentally and beat an Indian side that is flying high on confidence and momentum, could eventually have a bearing on the ODI series as well.

Teams:

India: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar.

309,2020/02/01,"Another firing in Delhi, this time at Shaheen Bagh","For the second time in three days, a man opened fire near the site of an anti-CAA protest in the capital. The man, identified as Kapil Gujjar, declared that only the “voice of Hindus would count” in the country, as he was taken away by the police from the protest site at Shaheen Bagh.

No one was injured as Gujjar fired two shots in the air, police said on Saturday evening.

Chinmoy Biswal, DCP (South East) said the shooter was a resident of Dallupura area. Police were trying find out from where he had procured the pistol. An FIR has been registered under sections of the Arms Act.

“We have recovered the countrymade weapon from his possession,” said a police officer. “He is in the dairy business and claimed that his family faces problems while commuting to the Lajpat Nagar area in south Delhi to shop for an upcoming wedding because of the road blockade by the protesters.”

Police said they had beefed up security around the protest site and people entering the area would be frisked with the help of volunteers. “People roaming around the protest site will be randomly checked. It is for the safety of the protesters,” said the officer.

On Thursday, a “juvenile” had shot and injured a Jamia Millia Islamia student, Shadaab Farooq. He had posted on Facebook that the “Shaheen Bagh game was over.”

With polling in Delhi only eight days away, Home Minister Amit Shah has gone on record asking voters to press the button for the BJP on the electronic voting machine so that the “current” was felt in Shaheen Bagh.

Earlier on Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at a rally in Delhi. “They [the AAP] don’t want good quality roads, water, the expansion of the metro... all they want is Shaheen Bagh... You have to decide whether you want all-round development or Shaheen Bagh... he will waste tax payers’ money on feeding them biriyani.”

On Thursday, the Election Commission barred Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur from campaigning for three days after he participated in a chant of “desh ke ghaddaron ko, goil maro salon ko” (shoot the traitors in the country).

Thousands of people have been sitting on a peaceful dharna since December 15 in Shaheen Bagh against the CAA-NRC-NPR regime, demanding that the Government not go ahead with its divisive agenda.

AAP MP Sanjay Singh said in a tweet after Saturday’s shooting that he had warned on Friday itself that a “conspiracy” was being hatched to create a “major incident” in the Capital to postpone the elections.

“You had said 45 documents are needed to open a restaurant and just 19 documents to get a gun in Delhi. Is it a fallout that less restaurants are visible in Delhi and guns are more visible,” asked a journalist.

The question came a day after a lone gunman fired a handgun at a crowd protesting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi. A student of Jamia Millia Islamia was shot and injured.

“I am sad that the criminals are finding loopholes in the law and avoiding hanging. They should be hanged immediately. We must amend the law so that in cases of rape, the hanging is done within six months,” he said in a tweet.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said there must be a debate on how the convicts in heinous crimes continue to delay execution of death penalty by exploring the judicial process even after the Supreme Court upholds their conviction.

His remarks came in the wake of a Delhi court postponing the execution of death warrants of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case—Mukesh Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar—till further orders.

322,2020/02/01,Cong. calls BJP manifesto deceptive,"The Delhi Congress on Friday said that the BJP manifesto for the Assembly elections was “deceptive”.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said that the BJP’s ‘sankalp patra’ for the February 8 polls was a “jhansa patra [deception paper] to throw dust into the eyes of people to get their votes”.

“The BJP manifesto has promised to provide 10 lakh jobs for the youth of Delhi even after failing to fulfil the promise of giving two crore jobs to the youth of the country every year, made in its 2014 Lok Sabha election manifesto. The country is now staring at the highest unemployment rate in 45 years and several lakh people have been rendered jobless in Delhi due to the sealing drive,” Mr. Chopra said.

Stating that due to the “frequent strikes” by sanitation workers, the Capital had become a “huge garbage dump,” Mr. Chopra said: “The BJP is promising to make Delhi garbage-free within two years, something it could not do after ruling the civic bodies for 12 years. It is saying that sanitation workers will be paid their salary arrears but the irony is that despite the BJP being in power at the civic bodies, the workers had to resort to strikes to get their salaries.”

Mr. Chopra added that the BJP manifesto lacks “pronouncements regarding taking strong steps” to curb pollution that has adversely affected public health.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cong-calls-bjp-manifesto-deceptive/article30707129.ece

“Manifesto of BJP proved that if you vote for them, then your free electricity, free water and free bus journey will be stopped. Think and vote,” Mr. Kejriwal said in a tweet.

Addressing a press conference, AAP MP and party’s Delhi election in-charge Sanjay Singh, termed the manifesto a “jumla patra [a bundle of lies]”.

“After having gone through the BJP’s manifesto for Delhi, I can confidently say that this is nothing but a jumla patra and proof that they are out to cheat the people. This manifesto clearly says that all the welfare schemes being run for common people today will be closed if the BJP comes to power. Free electricity upto 200 units, 20,000 litres of free water, free bus rides for women, the ‘Farishtey Yojana’ for accident victims, the ₹50,000/hectare crop damage compensation scheme will be shut down by the BJP,” Mr. Singh said.

The AAP MP added that the BJP, which “spread the fear” of sealing, was now saying that it would not allow sealing. “It’s amusing that the culprit is saying that I will not commit crime any more. It’s the BJP that spread the fear of sealing in Delhi, ruining the lives and livelihood of traders. No BJP leader stood with the traders at that time, while we fought for them, on the streets and in Parliament. Who is going to believe these blatant lies of the BJP?” he said.

Mr. Singh said that the BJP was cheating people by stating that they would regularise safai karamcharis.

“They say that they will regularise safai karamcharis. This is ridiculous. As of now, ‘services’ is under their jurisdiction. Manoj Tiwari is on record, in a video captured during the campaign for civic polls in 2017, in which he said that the dues for all safai karamcharis will be paid. What happened to that promise? Now again, they have brought this up during the Assembly elections,” he said.

326,2020/02/01,"BJP manifesto promises 10 lakh jobs, flour at ₹2 per kg","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) released its ‘sankalp patra’ (manifesto) for the upcoming Assembly elections on Friday in which it has promised to provide “quality flour” at the rate of ₹2 per kg to the poor, 10 lakh jobs in the next five years, and a “gift” of ₹51,000 to the daughters of poor widows at the time of their marriage, among other sops.

The manifesto was released by the party’s senior leadership, including Union Ministers Nitin Gadkari; Prakash Javadekar, who is the Delhi elections in-charge; and Harsh Vardhan, who was in-charge of formulating the document on the basis of 11,35,636 suggestions from as many respondents.

Several BJP MPs were also present on the occasion.

“The BJP’s politics is not based on falsehood and communalism. It is continuously working to change the fate of the poor, the workers, the farmers and the country. For starting the ‘bullet train’ of development, Delhi needs a BJP government,” Mr. Gadkari said.

While the issue of conferring Statehood to Delhi — one of the BJP’s oldest poll promises — was missing from its manifesto this time, the party said it would not only “allow the continuance” of the flagship power and water subsidies implemented by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Delhi government. The enactment of the Lokpal too, it said, would be “a priority” if the BJP formed the government.

These subsidies, the party argued, would benefit the people of Delhi “more” since they would be in place “for 60 months and will implement them in a better manner”. This, even as it promised cheaper power through competition between the two discoms , a city “free from [water] tankers” and “perfect synergy” between all three levels of government from the Centre down to the level of civic bodies in addition to filling up all vacancies in government departments.

Women empowerment

Empowering women and transgenders would also be a priority for the BJP, it said, besides the creation of a Sanskrit Board to promote the language, an All India Institute of Homeopathic Medicine to “boost research in the field of homeopathy” and promoting traditional Indian sports such as kabaddi, kho-kho, malkhamb and kushti.

Apart from 10 new colleges and 200 new schools, the party also promised education and health budgets increasing at the rate of 10% per year, 10,000 ‘green buses’, free electric scooties for girls and young women. It also promised the deployment of female home guards to make public places safer for women.

“A comprehensive scheme for the development of unauthorised colonies [now authorised] will be framed and now a dedicated Colonies Development Board will be formed... A new ‘Prosperous Delhi Infrastructure Scheme’ will be started through which construction of better roads, flyover and other basic amenities will be done on priority basis,” Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xoz9uu/article30707108.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01BJPMANIFESTO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-manifesto-promises-10-lakh-jobs-flour-at-2-per-kg/article30707109.ece

Meanwhile, Indian Youth Congress president B.V. Srinivas on Friday lodged a criminal complaint against BJP leader Anurag Thakur at Parliament Street Police Station for delivering “inflammatory hate speech leading to a man opening gunfire on a peaceful protester outside Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday.”

“When Anurag Thakur made an inflammatory speech, it triggered the perpetrator’s mind and he opened fire on students.” Mr. Srinivas said.

He added “Yesterday’s [Thursday] incident proves that the Nathuram Godse mindset is still alive. BJP leaders are disturbing the atmosphere of the country with their statements. The huge rise in hate crimes around the country are a reflection of the Godse fan club the BJP govt. has created through their venomous politics.”

The teachers body also appealed to the protesters at Shaheen Bagh to allow passage of traffic on one side of the road as an act of “civic responsibility” and “sensitivity”.

“We are convinced that the shooting, which could have been fatal, was a direct result of the call to “goli maro” or “shoot” by an elected Member of Parliament, who is also the country’s Minister of State for Finance,” the Jamia Teachers’ Association (JTA) said in a statement.

“Nothing can be more anti-national than a Minister inciting citizens to violence from a public platform, and we severely condemn his words and action,” it added.

Appreciated students

The teachers’ association also appreciated the restraint shown by students “in the face of grave provocation of their batchmate being injured in a shooting before their very eyes.”

The association also reiterated its opposition to the CAA, NRC and NPR and argued that if the government cherishes values of inclusiveness and equality, it should undertake a re-think on these. “When thousands across the country have severe reservations about a law and have been vociferously expressing them, it is time for any government that truly respects democracy to take measures to resolve the concerns and fears of its citizens,” it said.

In an appeal to the protesters opposing the government’s moves at Shaheen Bagh, the JMI called for one side of the road to be opened for traffic. “It would be an act of civic responsibility and sensitivity, and also a gesture of facilitation to all whose destinations would be easier to access,” it said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jamia-teachers-body-blames-anurag-for-inciting-violence/article30706924.ece

“They are trying to make us afraid,” said Aleena Ariz (21), an engineering student at the university. She argued that they had witnessed worst violence on the night of December 15 than the Thursday’s shooting.

Ms. Ariz highlighted that the ‘incendiary’ statements made by Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur had encouraged the shooter to carry out the attack.

“Since action was not taken against him, people thought it was okay to say such statements... leaders should condemn this,” said Ms. Ariz.

Salman Ali, who lives near the university, said that fewer people had come for the protest given that a fear had been created. “When something like this happen in broad daylight, of course you’d be afraid,” he said. Despite being instructed not to step out by his family, he decided to attend the protest.

Amid chants of “Azadi” and “Delhi police hai hai”, voices from the speakers at the protest site appealed to the people to come out without any fear and protest wherever they wanted.

“They want us to get scared and retaliate. But nothing like that happened. Everything is going peacefully,” said Mohammed Asif (18).

334,2020/02/01,EC appoints two special observers for Delhi polls,"With just over a week to go for the Delhi Assembly elections on February 8, the Election Commission of India (ECI) on Friday reviewed preparations, including the law and order situation in the Capital, for polling day and appointed two special observers.

The ECI held a meeting with the Delhi Chief Electoral Officer, State government and police officials to review poll preparations. Chief Election Commissioner Sunil Arora said the poll panel “would be ready to handhold whenever required but field-level officers should take swift action wherever warranted to ensure fair, just, legal and impartial elections”.

He further asked officers to focus on law and order arrangements in the border districts of Delhi.

Delhi CEO Ranbir Singh said preparations had been made for peaceful polling, including in the border areas.

The review meeting, which is a routine affair ahead of polling, was held a day after the city saw violence in Jamia Nagar, when a young man opened fire on a group of anti-CAA protesters.

After the meeting, the Commission announced it had appointed retired Indian Revenue Service officer B. Murli Kumar as a special expenditure observer and retired Indian Police Service officer Mrinal Kanti Das as special police observer for the upcoming elections.

Mr. Kumar would be supervising the work of the election machinery against the use of cash, liquor and other freebies to induce voters, a statement issued by the ECI read.

336,2020/02/01,"In Kalkaji, it’s a matter of legacy","Meandering through the narrow bylanes of Bhoomiheen Camp on Friday, Congress’ Kalkaji candidate Shivani Chopra promised the slum dwellers that she would make the constituency “number one in Delhi”.

Ms. Chopra is an advocate and daughter of Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra — a three-time MLA (1998-2013) from the area.

Between assurances of carrying forward the work done by her father and promises of better living conditions in the slums, the first-time contestant introduces herself as Kalkaji ki beti (daughter of Kalkaji).

“You all know who my father is and you have seen how he has served you all for 15 years. But in the last five years, did the government do anything for you apart from making excuses for not being able to work?” she asked the locals. Addressing a group of women, Ms. Chopra said: “Women should be able to step out of the house irrespective of what time it is. If elected, I will ensure that roads improve and CCTVs are installed. I am here for your sewa [to serve you] with your bhagidaari [participation].”

When asked about the major poll pitches, the 40-year-old said: “Women’s safety, tackling garbage and pollution situations, and improving infrastructure are the issues that I will be concentrating on. The roads across the constituency are not in good shape and need improvement. Also, Govindpuri residents are getting dirty water in the name of free water — we will focus on this issue as well.”

She said she wanted to use technology and “probably use an app where people can lodge their complaints directly. I want to work by involving people and will be available to them always”.

A 45-year-old housewife, Sumitra Devi, a resident of the slum cluster, said: “All pre-poll promises are good to the ears but what happens next is important. Mr. Chopra is well known and the councilor from the party also works for us, maybe giving his daughter a chance is not a bad idea. For us, we can be hopeful that the person elected will not forget us.”

Ms. Chopra, along with her party workers, has been holding meetings with small groups of people across the constituency for the past few days.

At the Delhi Assembly polls scheduled on February 8, Ms. Chopra will be contesting against Aam Aadmi Party’s Atishi (sitting AAP MLA Avtar Singh was denied a ticket) and BJP’s Dharamveer Singh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lv6fri/article30706857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01CHOPRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-kalkaji-its-a-matter-of-legacy/article30706858.ece
337,2020/02/01,Empire of ants,"There are bird walks, tree walks and butterfly walks, but have you heard of ant walks? Ant enthusiast and researcher Sunil Kumar M recently led nearly 50 people on one at Lalbagh. Organised by Eco Edu, a city based environment education organisation, the walk was an eye-opener to many. “I wasn’t even a part of the group,” Narayan Reddy, 34, a railway employee said. “When I saw Sunil help a group discover nearly 60 species of ants, I started following them and was hooked. I now look for ants and observe their paths on my morning walks in Lalbagh.”

We do not stop to observe the myriad creatures that share this earth with us, says Sunil, to the group as he leads them down pathways and grassy mounds on the banks of a water body in Lalbagh. “One living organism that goes unnoticed, in spite of its omnipresence, is the humble ant. It is only recently with the growth of socio-biology as a discipline that ants have begun to receive considerable scientific attention.”

Most of us divide ants into red and black ants and ants that bite and those that do not.

The earth’s bio-diversity is a large canvas where ants play a major role. “There are 11,931 species of ants the world over, varying in size from 40 mm to 1 mm. About 25 per cent of the total insect biomass of this world is made up of ants,” says Sunil. While India has nearly 800 species, Bengaluru has more than 125 species, with Lalbagh alone having nearly 60.

Ants navigate following a complex chemical trail left by other ants. “They may move in a group showing us as examples of team work, but they never move in a straight line. When an ant stands guard at the entrance of its colony, it checks each ant to ensure that it belongs to its own clan,” says Sunil calling them social insects.

Bridging the gap

“Ants are a female-dominated society,” says Sunil. With a Masters in Environmental Sciences, Sunil has co-authored a book in 2007 with Ajay Narendra, On a Trail with Ants: A Handbook of the Ants of Peninsular India. “It was important to put our research on record. The last ground-breaking work on ants was by Lt. Col. Bingham, Ants and Cuckoo-wasps of British India, published as part of the Fauna of British India series in 1903. “There was no other study in this subject. Ajay is a scientist and professor of Ants at the Australian National University.”

Sunil has also held other positions in Centre for Environment Education and the IT industry.

The book covers over 50 ant species of peninsular India. “The book has fascinating photographs capturing ants in movement. The chapters are arranged around the wide variety of ant behaviour rather than being mere descriptions of the species. The book is a short course in biology with ant examples. We raised money through donations from wildlife enthusiasts, collected photographs and networked with ant specialists all over the world to put the book together.”

Over the last few years, Sunil has conducted nature walks to educate people on ants. “After my MSc in 1996, I worked on a project at IISc on Ant Diversity in Bangalore, species and their behaviour.”

Ecological markers

Ants are found everywhere — from a tree canopy in a rainforest to subterranean burrows or a rotting log. “Ants make best use of available resources. They are now being recognised as ecological indicators like birds. For instance, if you see ants nesting in leaf litter, it indicates the pristine and undisturbed nature of that forest. Over millennia, ants have developed a close relationship with plants and animals. They pollinate and even disperse seeds.”

There are trees that develop a hollow cavity in their trunks to enable a particular species of ants to build its colony. In the tropical forests of southern India, certain species of arboreal ants build a large nest, called the Pagoda nest by chewing leaves and mixing it with secretions from their salivary glands, on trees.

Masters of the universe

The Department of Entomology, University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK in Bengaluru has an insect museum. “Ants are one of the most dominant species of insects found throughout the world,” says Prakash KV, Assistant Professor, Department of Entomology, UAS, talking about the huge study on ants that UAS has undertaken. “While we have scientists who have documented several kinds, I have studied the Solenopsis Geminata, a red ant, a pest that damages crops.”

Ant so it goes

* Ants are the most common urban and forest wildlife

* Not just red and black, there are orange, yellow, brown ants too

* Apart from biting, there are some species that sting with acid and jump as well

* Ants vary in size from 40 mm to 1 mm and can carry 100 times its weight to build its colonies

* Ants have a powerful sense of navigation and can travel up to 150 metres for food and return to their nest",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/v31kal/article30711369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGM-ANT4,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/ant-walk-book-on-ants/article30711371.ece

In a meeting with GHMC zonal commissioners and engineering officials here on Saturday, Mr.Rama Rao noted that the city’s infrastructure should be developed in consonance with increased health consciousness among citizens. He discussed construction of footpaths, development of greenery, parks, playgrounds, and construction of toilets, foot-over bridges and internal roads, zone-wise.

He asked the officials to ensure construction of 500 public toilets per zone over the next two months and equip 1,100 playgrounds with lighting, toilets and volleyball, football and shuttle badminton courts. The Minister said at least 10 km of cycling tracks should be developed in parks and playgrounds of each zone.

Further, he asked the zonal commissioners to ensure CCTV cameras, lighting and toilets in parks and deployment of security guards at major parks. Funding for the greenery and park maintenance will be increased from the present ₹10 crore to ₹50 crore, he said.

Deliberations are to be conducted with 40 architectural designers in the city to seek their suggestions in development of parks and junctions, and landscaping. Interest expressed on this front by large establishments and companies should be taken leverage of, in carrying out the mandate, he said.

To improve road safety, barricades should be put in place on footpaths near schools, and free-left barricading should be done at all major junctions. Cellar ramps should not be allowed directly onto the road, he said, adding that encroachments should be removed from footpaths, and vending zones should be established locality wise.

343,2020/02/01,"Central budget disappointing, discriminatory: KCR","Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao said the Union Budget for 2020-21 presented in Parliament on Saturday was totally disappointing and expressed concern that the budget allocations would have an adverse impact on the growth prospects of Telangana.

He alleged that Centre showed discrimination against Telangana by imposing a cut on the funds due to the State and it was deplorable that the share of Telangana in the Central taxes was reduced and it could result in fund crunch for the ongoing development and welfare schemes in the State.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao held a meeting with senior officials at Pragathi Bhavan here on Saturday for over four hours to review the the aspects that would have an impact on the State.

The State’s share in the Central taxes was a constitutional right and Telangana should have got ₹19,718 crore for 2019-20 but in the revised estimates, it was curtailed to ₹15,987 crore, resulting in reduction of funds to the tune of ₹3,731 crore for this fiscal. This had turned the financial plan of the State topsy-turvy, he said. The Centre normally released funds to the States based on the estimates announced in the budget but this year the shortfall of 18.9 percent in the promised funds was an indication of failure in the management of financial affairs of the Centre.

Even in the 2020-21 budget proposals, Telangana suffered losses on two counts. The share of States in Central taxes was brought down from 42 per cent to 41 per cent as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission. Last year, while Telangana had got 2.437 per cent of tax share, in 2020-21, it was reduced to 2.133 per cent, giving it ₹2,381 crore less. “This is clear discrimination and it will impact the development plans of the State,” he said. In 2019-20, Telangana’s share of Central tax had been reduced by ₹3,731 crore. For 2020-21, it proposed ₹16,726 crore and by the time of revised estimates, one would not be sure how much it would be reduced. “There is no relation between what the Centre promised and actual release of funds,” he said.

The Centre did not give clarity even on payment of ₹1,137 crore due under GST compensation to Telangana, he said.

The Centre also imposed a huge cut on allocation for development of cities and this would derail the ongoing urbanisation in the State. In 2019-20, ₹1,037 crore had been allocated for urban development but in 2020-21 it was reduced to ₹889 crore. Funding for urban development were reduced by 14.3 per cent. There was no mention of ₹24,000 crore recommended by NITI Aayog for Mission Bhagiratha and Mission Kakatiya and the Centre did not heed the request of the State for maintenance expenditure for irrigation projects taken up in the State in a big way.

The Centre did not announce any progressive measures to pull the country out of the economic slowdown, and reduced allocations for agriculture, education, health, rural development and other sectors compared to last budget and this would affect the social sector development, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/central-budget-disappointing-discriminatory-kcr/article30714923.ece

The Telangana police have procured state-of-the-art mobile restrooms and toilets for women personnel.

Home Minister Mohammed Mahmood Ali, on Friday, rolled out 17 mobile toilets, which will help “boost the performance of women officers on outdoor duties”.

“The government and the department have given special emphasis to women’s safety and health. Due to the inconvenience and health issues faced by women police officers during bandobust duties, the government has sanctioned mobile restrooms and toilets,” Director General of Police M. Mahender Reddy said.

The vehicles will be deployed during Medaram jatara, and eventually, the number will be increased to 25, he said.

According to a senior officer, there are around 3,000 women police personnel in the State, and when they are deployed on bandobust duties, many do not drink water due to the fear of having to look for toilets.

“There are instances when women officers fainted while performing outdoor duties, especially in summer, as they don’t consume enough water fearing lack of toilets. But, now we have come up with a solution,” said IGP (Law and Order) and in-charge of women’s safety Swati Lakra.

She said that mobile wash rooms were the need of the hour for women police force in the State with recruitments going on.

“This is the basic facility that has to be provided and will go a long way. Soon, eight more mobile wash rooms will be rolled out and our idea is to have one vehicle in each district,” Ms. Lakra said.

She said that State Police is committed towards the safety of people and the welfare of its personnel, especially women officers.

The vehicles, which are procured through e-tender, have state-of-the-art amenities, including two toilets (Indian and western), a wash room, a changing room and two wash basins fitted with a water tank, which can be used by 100 individuals per fill. Each salon is equipped with cross flow air ventilation to enable fresh air and eliminate bad odour in the cabin, the officer said.

Shankar filed a PIL petition challenging alienation of the land to the film director. The bench instructed the government to file a counter affidavit on the matter in four weeks.

The petitioner said the government allotted the land at the rate of five lakh rupees an acre while the market value is close to ₹5 crore rupees per an acre.

He requested the court to pass a direction setting aside Government Order No. 75 of Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department issued on June 21, 2019, alienating land to Mr. Shankar.

According to the petitioner, the director represented to the State government to allot him 10 15 acres of land in survey no. 96 at Mokilla village to set up a TV and film studio. There was no justification for allotment of the land to him, the petitioner stated.

Need of the hour,” KTR tweeted tagging the Telangana DGP, Hyderabad Police Commissioner and GHMC Commissioner.

The tweet received good response with lot of people supporting the initiative and wishing for its implementation in the city where traffic snarls are quite common. Some said that the Minister should follow it up seriously and hoped that the police will respond positively.

However, there were quite a few who expressed anger over the behaviour of police and wanted to know why they blocked traffic for VIP movement. They urged Mr. Rama Rao to ask the police to do their duty with sincerity before following such initiatives.

Mumbai model

As a part of its efforts to instil discipline among habitual honkers, Mumbai traffic police’s initiative called ‘Punishing Signal’ involves doubling of the waiting time at the signal if the decibel levels from honking crosses 85.

Police installed decibel monitors in several areas connecting traffic signals to deter honkers from blaring their horns.

Police shared on social media some visuals of honkers expressing frustration and irritation after the waiting time doubled due to incessant honking even when the signal was red, and those went viral. The video shows how honkers realised the more they honked, the more they had to wait at the signals.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/dbl9cl/article30706612.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31-KTR2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ktr-wants-honkers-to-wait-longer-at-traffic-signals/article30706593.ece

Prashanth Reddy has asked Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar to identify vacant government land and buildings to house skill development centres of the National Academy of Construction (NAC) in district headquarters and Assembly constituencies to decentralise activities of the academy.

Speaking at the executive committee of NAC here on Friday, Mr. Reddy also asked the Director General of NAC K. Bikshapathi to draw up plans to take programmes of the organisation to constituency level. They should impart high-end training to unemployed youth and construction workers and must take initiative to prepare proposals for wage hike of workers, he pointed out.

The organisation must come up with new courses on technology upgrade in construction activity, security of construction sector and capacity building of workers, Mr. Reddy added.

Earlier, the Minister addressed a workshop on long span bridge construction at NAC. It was attended by R.K. Pandey, member-Technical, National Highways Authority of India; B.K.

352,2020/02/01,"'Butta Bomma' singer Armaan Malik: Every city I visit, I want to be able to sing in the local language","The songs of the Telugu film Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo have been topping the charts for the last few weeks. Among them, ‘Samajavaragamana’ by Sid Sriram, ‘Ramulo Ramula’ by Anurag Kulkarni and Mangli, and ‘Butta Bomma’ by Armaan Malik have become quite a rage. Twenty four-year-old Armaan is beaming at the overwhelming response: “The song has a happy vibe to it and makes you want to dance. I’ve been getting such good response even from those who don’t understand Telugu.”

Armaan remembers the mood in the studio while recording the song: “Thaman (the composer of the album) told me to have as much fun as possible while singing so that the joyous mood reflects in the song.” Most of the song was recorded in a Mumbai studio and Armaan recorded a few lines again, in his hotel suite while on a visit to Hyderabad. “Thaman and me have busy schedules and travel often, so we carry our recording equipment to do these small recording sessions,” he adds.

Thaman and Armaan have collaborated earlier for songs like ‘Ninnila’ (Tholi Prema) and ‘Anaganaganaga’ (Aravinda Sametha). “Thaman makes me take my singing to a slightly higher level with each song. I’ve been able to put out a different version of me with each of these songs,” shares Armaan.

Following ‘Butta Bomma’, Armaan has also sung ‘Ninne Ninne’ in Aswathama, composed by Sricharan Pakala.

Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde in the ‘Butta Bomma’ song

Singing with ease in different languages — Hindi, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Malayalam, Urdu, Marathi and Gujarati — Armaan has consciously groomed himself into a pan-Indian space and is aware that there’s a huge audience out there for non-Bollywood films. Hindi cinema might be his mainstay and he has several hits to his credit, but he’s also been eager to build a large fan base outside of it. “Every city I visit, I want to be able to sing in the local language to have a better connect with listeners. When I perform in cities like Kolkata or Hyderabad, I sing Hindi songs and there’s a lot of demand to sing in Bengali and Telugu, and I am happy I can do that,” he says.

Armaan’s mother is Telugu, so singing in the language isn’t tough for him. He admits he cannot speak Telugu fluently and is working towards changing that. “But there’s steady improvement. When I am asked to record a song in a language I don’t know too well, I write down the lyrics in English and jot down my own code notes — dots and hyphens — to know where to stress. Earlier I would take an hour to learn Telugu pronunciation before I start recording. Nowadays I need only half an hour of preparation,” he explains.

Recently, he collaborated with composer Anirudh Ravichander for the first time for the Hindi version of Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar. Talking about the process, he says with a laugh that he didn’t have to modulate his voice to suit the older superstar: “He exudes so much energy on screen and it feels like he’s much younger than his age.”

Straddling film music in different languages and performing live often, Armaan is among the busiest singers today. Yet, he’s aware that he needs to think ahead and work towards staying ahead of the curve by not getting stagnated. Occasionally, he’s been releasing his independent music singles as well, the latest one titled ‘Jaane Na Dunga Kahin’. “It’s high time we have a vibrant non-film music industry in India,” he says. The music he listens to is largely international: “I listen to international music, mostly in English, to stay up to date with the sounds and beats in the global arena,” he says, signing off.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/dum75p/article30711466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Armaan-Malik-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/armaan-malik-talks-about-the-ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-and-darbar-experience-and-why-hes-keen-to-sing-in-many-languages/article30711469.ece
353,2020/02/01,No let-up in helmetless driving,"Helmetless driving seems to be on the rise among college students in Ernakulam.

As per the estimates by the Motor Vehicles Department, nearly 50% of the violations recorded under its Operation Smart Campus drive in the district were cases involving students.

“Of the 25 cases registered over the last two days of our drive, helmetless driving was one major offence committed by the youth on the campuses. This cannot be allowed as they are risking their lives,” said Manoj K, Joint Regional Transport Officer, Ernakulam.

The Operation Smart Campus drive was aimed at checking road accidents involving students in colleges. The squads were deployed nearby the educational institutions to track the rash driving and other violations by the students. Twenty-two motorbikes were seized for violations of rules.

Inspections revealed that many students were not even carrying helmets. Despite the campaigns to create awareness among the youth, many still preferred riding their motorbikes without wearing helmets.

The squads found instances of triple-riding on the campuses. The modification of the silencers was another major illegal act being done by the youth.

The special drive focussing on campuses will continue. The squads will collect information using the CCTV footage and from the public. Stringent action will be taken against the violators, the officials said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/no-let-up-in-helmetless-driving/article30714894.ece

355,2020/02/01,Pipelines at Vyttila to be restored by Friday night,"Officials of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) said pipelines that burst at Vyttila would be restored by Friday night.

Work was in progress on a joint replacement of the pumping main from Nettoor to Thammanam that was damaged on Wednesday. The KWA had been planning to complete the work by Friday morning. The authorities hope to charge the lines immediately after all the three pipelines are repaired.

Cable laying

The pipelines burst as Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) was laying an optical fibre cable for the Indian Navy in a push-through process on the northern side of Vyttila Junction. It affected water supply to the southern parts of the city including Vyttila, Pettah, Poonithura, Chambakkara, Elamkulam, Chilavannoor, Kadavanthra, and Panampilly Nagar.

356,2020/02/01,Encroachments on Pipeline Road trigger concern,"Encroachments are rampant on the 20-km-long Pipeline Road from Aluva to Thammanam and Perumannoor sumps, posing a threat to human life in case the large pipelines suffer any damage.

The three pipelines of 900 mm, 1,050 mm and 1,200 mm width carry water at high pressure to be supplied to the city and nearby municipalities and panchayats. However, since the time when the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) first acquired the road, which had then an average width of 24 metres, it has constricted to an average width of 15 metres thanks to encroachments.

Pipeline Road passes through thickly populated areas, with shops, godowns, and educational institutions dotting its sides.

These details were mentioned in a report submitted by the KWA to the Kerala High Court in response to a public interest litigation filed by one Udayakumar around 10 years ago. The case had come up for hearing recently.

According to the report, a pipe burst could adversely impact people living in the vicinity. “The loss could be beyond prediction. At some places along the road, the pipes are exposed over the ground without earthen cover,” the report said.

It further said that the public seemed to be unaware of the danger.

Incidentally, the KWA Assistant Executive Engineer at the Public Health division, Aluva, had issued notices to 833 encroachers between October 2018 and November 2018, and efforts were made with the help of the Aluva tahsildar to demarcate the land owned by the KWA along the road. However, the final drawing is yet to be submitted by the tahsildar.

According to the report, once the KWA gets details to identify the land it owns, it plans to take action to evict encroachers.

Pipeline Road is not generally used by the public as there are crossbars, barriers, and caution boards set up at various points on the road, especially, where it meets main roads.

But at some places it has been found that the local bodies along with the traffic authorities, telephone companies, KSEB, and other private parties are misusing the road which was bought by the KWA and maintained by it.

A recent survey showed 81 visible encroachments by the public on the road. Owing to the presence of godowns near the road, plying by heavy vehicles, including container trucks, should be viewed seriously, the report said.

Since the pipes are quite old, even a light vibration along road gets transmitted to the pipe surface and joints. The wear and tear of over 40 years could also result in a hazardous situation.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/76m2lc/article30707398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-KI-PIPELINE-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/encroachments-on-pipeline-road-trigger-concern/article30707399.ece
357,2020/02/01,Vembanad ecosystem study to begin soon,"The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) will soon start work on a major research project on the deteriorating ecological condition of Vembanad lake in Ernakulam.

The board is expected to submit the proposal before the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). It had earlier conducted a similar study on the Alappuzha stretch of the lake. Designated as a Ramsar site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), the lake is also classified as an ‘Ecologically Sensitive Zone’.

The study assumes significance at a time when the waterbody is bearing the brunt of the increasing anthropogenic activities.

Senior board officials said the project would be presented before the Central and State Governments for formulating a conservation programme. The findings will be beneficial while drafting the action plan for protection of the lake, which has been under tremendous stress due to unchecked pollution and rapid urbanisation, they added.

The lake, which extends for a distance of 96 km from Azheekode in the north to Alappuzha in the south with a northwest-southeast orientation, is spread across the three central districts of the State including Ernakulam in the north, Kottayam in the east, and Alappuzha in the south.

A major focus of the proposed study will be the declining water quality levels in the lake following the spike in human activities. Studies conducted by the board in Alappuzha had revealed that waste water and untreated sewage were being dumped into the lake at several locations in Ernakulam. The high density of population along the banks of the lake had resulted in the growing level of water contamination, it had said.

The research will highlight the impact of the violation of coastal regulation zone norms on the lake. Board officials said untreated sewage from households and slaughter houses in Ernakulam were reaching the lake through various natural and artificial canals. Local bodies along the lake, which have a greater role to play in preventing pollution, have not been able to act against violators, they said.

Studies by the School of Marine Sciences, Cochin University of Science and Technology, had found that the ecological decay of the wetland was on the rise due to intense pollution and unauthorised construction from the southern to the northern regions of the backwaters.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/5b25bx/article30707369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-KI-VEMBANADLAKE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/vembanad-ecosystem-study-to-begin-soon/article30707370.ece

In a report submitted to the court on Friday, the amici curiae pointed out that the agencies could report to the nodal officer and keep the officer informed about the work being planned by them. Besides, notice in advance should be given to the Kochi Corporation by the agencies about the proposed digging up of roads.

They also suggested the court’s interference in ensuring allocation of required funds to the Kochi Corporation for repair of roads under the control of the civic body. The Corporation officers had expressed concern over non-sanctioning of funds for road repair work.

The Corporation, in its action taken report, submitted that the main hurdle in completing the road work was paucity of funds and restrictions on payment to contractors.

The contractors were not coming forward to take up repair works as huge arrears were due to them.

With Ms. Nadeera’s resignation, the municipality is set to elect its fifth chairperson in five years. “According to the agreement, my stipulated term of office was one year,” said Ms. Nadeera, who assumed office in January last year. “It was a challenging term right from the start,” she added, referring to the recent Maradu flat demolitions.

Elections to the position of chairperson will take place within three weeks, during which municipal vice chairman Boban Nedumparambil will be the acting chairperson.

The position of the chairperson in the 33-member council is reserved for women.

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) would consider fielding former chairperson Divya Anilkumar as its candidate, a councillor said.

361,2020/02/01,PCB gets NGT nod to recover compensation from civic body,"The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has permitted the Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to proceed with the recovery of environment compensation of ₹1.12 crore from the Kochi Corporation for its failure to set up leachate treatment and biomethanation plants at the civic body’s waste dumping site at Brahmapuram.

The directive was issued by the Chennai Bench of the tribunal comprising Justice K. Ramakrishnan and judicial member Saibal Dasgupta when the case pertaining to the original Application Nos. 533 and 535 regarding the Brahmapuram issue was taken up on Thursday. The Bench accepted the Board’s contention that the reply given by the Corporation to the notice served on why it should not recover the environment compensation was not satisfactory, according to those close to the development.

The KSPCB had issued the notice to the civic body on December 11. The environment compensation was assessed for the period from November 22, 2018 to November 30, 2019.

SLMC directions

The Board pointed out that the Corporation had not fully complied with the directions of the State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on solid waste management under the provisions of the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016. The directions were issued based on inferences gathered by the SLMC Chairman, who had visited Brahmapuram on October 16 ahead of reporting the present status before the NGT on original Application Nos: 514 and 533-535 of 2018 filed before the Tribunal.

Inspections

The inspection revealed that the Corporation had failed to install proper effluent treatment facilities at the site. The plant installed just before the visit of the then Regional Monitoring Committee of the NGT in January this year was in a dilapidated condition. All windrow sheds were in a damaged state, and the drain provided was found to be blocked with thick slurry flowing from the windrow compost and the primary area where biodegradable waste was dumped.

In its reply submitted before the board, Secretary of the Kochi Corporation had pointed out that the preparation of the detailed project report for the installation of leachate treatment plant at Brahmapuram had been initiated and it was expected to be over by March this year. The leachate generated from the windrow composting plant was taken to the nearby septage treatment plant in tanker trucks and treated there on a daily basis, it said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-gets-ngt-nod-to-recover-compensation-from-civic-body/article30706926.ece
362,2020/02/01,Project Roshni going places,"Three years since it was launched on a pilot basis for enhanced academic performance of migrant children through improved language proficiency, Project Roshni has won accolades from all corners and the Government’s decision to extend it across the State is the latest feather in its cap.

The proposal for the State-wide expansion of the project found mention in the Governor’s policy address on Wednesday.

The project is being implemented jointly by the Education Department, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and the district administration using the corporate social responsibility funds of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited.

“It remains to be seen whether the Government plans to make use of our expertise in expanding the project across the State. We have already assisted in running the project in two schools in Pathanamthitta and a school in Kannur,” said C.K. Prakash, general coordinator of Roshni.

The project using code-switching as the main pedagogical tool, which involves a speaker alternating between two or more languages in the context of a single conversation, was first introduced in four schools covering about 110 students in lower and upper primary classes during 2017-18. “Since then it was extended to 20 and 40 government and aided schools covering 670 and 1,230 migrant students respectively in the next two years,” said Mr. Prakash.

Students under the project are given classes for an hour before the normal school hours. Forty-five volunteers having completed Plus Two and proficiency in at least one language other than Malayalam have been drafted in with a monthly remuneration of ₹10,000.

“Besides, we have now deployed multiple student volunteers in each school from among both migrant and local students with good linguistic skills,” said Mr. Prakash. A performance analysis conducted by SCMS at the end of 2018-19 academic year had noted increased proficiency of migrant students in Malayalam and English languages. Post-Roshni, students were generally found to secure better grades in English reading, writing, and speaking compared to their grades prior to it.

The beneficiaries were mostly from West Bengal followed by Tamil Nadu, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, and Rajasthan with a smattering of students from Lakshadweep, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Punjab, and even Nepal.

The analysis found that more than 90% of parents, a majority of whom daily labourers, were supportive of the project and the dropout rate from the project was “minimal overall and none in most of the schools.”

The analysis observed that proficiency in Malayalam was 83% in the 10-to-12 age group and 84% among those between 13 and 15 years of age and attributed the trend to a great deal to Roshni as most children aged between 10 and 15 years were part of the project for more than 10 months.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4rkiap/article30706915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/teacherki30a,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/project-roshni-going-places/article30706916.ece

366,2020/02/01,Renovated park to be run by agency from cooperative sector,"The Vadakara municipal authorities have decided to hand over the management of its newly opened public park to a competent agency from the cooperative sector.

Responding to the municipality’s call, two cooperative societies, including Uralungal Labour Contract Cooperative Society (ULCCS), have expressed interest in the project.

The park, which was recently renovated at a cost of ₹1.10 crore and thrown open to the public on January 24, has a mini stadium, open stage, children’s park, and several other amenities for hosting cultural events. The municipal authorities hope that the management of the facility by a professional agency from the cooperative sector will transform the location into one of the most sought-after venues in Vadakara. With the expansion of the park, there will be more additions like art gallery for painting exhibitions, aquarium, computer game park, snack parlours, and meadows.

Efforts are also on to ensure better parking facility in the area by taking the required private land on lease.

The park had been in an abandoned state for long thanks to poor management by the agency in charge. Visitors too began ignoring the space in the absence of basic facilities and poor management.

367,2020/02/01,Confusion over revised building tax structure,"The revised building tax structure of the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation has caused confusion not just among the residents but councillors too, which was reflected in the council meeting on Friday.

IUML councillor M. Kunhamutti said several residents in his division were being charged absurd amounts, and that some were shocking.

Displaying photographs and the revised tax for some houses, he said they did not have to be levied such a huge tax even by the revised standards. He came down on the corporation for finding solutions to problems only when they arise and not in advance.

CPI(M) councillor K. Nisha pointed to an abnormal increase in tax rates for some people. C.K. Seenath, another party councillor, said tax notices were sent to houses that did not have numbers yet. Responding to the issue, Mayor Thottathil Raveendran said tax exemption for houses under 660 square feet space was applicable only to those with only one house. It is also relevant for houses under 2,000 square feet, for which there will be no increase in tax.

The councillors were conveniently neglecting that clause, the Mayor alleged. Under the tax revision that came into effect recently, for the first time in the last 25 years, residential buildings will be charged 25% extra, while commercial buildings will have a 100% increase. Houses, hospitals, and educational institutions have less tax, while malls and mobile towers have the highest tax rates.

The Mayor said help desks had been set up in the main as well as regional offices of the corporation to address people’s concerns. “If their issues are not solved through the help desks, let them come directly to me or the Deputy Mayor,” Mr. Raveendran said, adding that no appeals would be entertained as the tax for each category of buildings had been specifically fixed.

Earlier, town planning standing committee chairman M.C. Anil Kumar presented an adjournment motion, condemning the armed attack by an individual against students of Jamia Milia University in Delhi. The motion condemning violence in general was passed, with LDF and UDF councillors supporting it completely and the BJP opposing it. The BJP councillors’ plea to remove the premise from the motion was rejected by Mr. Anil Kumar.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/confusion-over-revised-building-tax-structure/article30707440.ece
368,2020/02/01,Chaos in corporation council meeting over LED conversion project,"Mayor Thottathil Raveendran’s refusal to grant permission for a submission by K.T. Beeran Koya of the IUML led to a few minutes of chaos in the Kozhikode Municipal Corporation council meeting on Friday.

Mr. Beeran Koya wanted to draw the council’s attention to the delay in the implementation of the project for converting all street lights to LED. However, the Mayor denied permission on the grounds that submissions on the same topic could not be repeated in a span of three months. A few councillors had made a similar submission on November 27, 2019, he said at a press conference later.

Councillors of the United Democratic Front (UDF) raised slogans against the Mayor, accusing him of favouritism as the LED conversion project had already been implemented in their divisions. They alleged that the Mayor’s promises were empty, and that the ruling front was cheating the public.

They continued to protest inside the council hall in a peaceful manner until the council was dispersed.

The Mayor later said the conversion was being carried out in various sections of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB). The conversion work in the West Hill section is almost complete, and that in the Karapparamba section will start soon, he added. The ₹56-crore LED conversion project is executed by Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. with an annual maintenance contract of 10 years and a penalty clause that the company is to change the bulbs if they did not work for 48 hours at a stretch. The agency is also liable to pay energy charges for the 40,000-odd street lights in the city, while it is not allowed to place advertisements on lamp posts.

However, anticipating the frequent voltage fluctuations that may damage the bulbs, the agency has incorporated an inbuilt mechanism to protect them.

This change of plan is the reason for the unexpected delay, the Mayor explained. Though the agency has promised to complete the work by the end of March, the Mayor said it might take a little longer.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/fejmrn/article30707419.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01-KI-STREETLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/chaos-in-corpn-council-meeting-over-led-conversion-project/article30707420.ece

The play was preceded by a rock show by J. Rajasekaran and his band. A regular performer at the festival, his show had several youngsters enthusiastically cheering him on. The evening ended with a performance by Kalai Kaveri, a dance and music school which performed classical and folk styles.

371,2020/02/01,Railway unions oppose privatisation move of train services,"MADURAI

Railway employees unions have objected to the Centre's move for privatisation of train services.

In a statement, the Divisional secretary of Southern Railway Mazdoor Union, J.M. Rafi said that disinvestment of public sector units will lead to extinction of PSUs in future.

He added that of proposal to operate 150 private trains as announced in the the Union Budget will cripple the Department of Railways.

The union assistant divisional secretary V. Ramkumar said that the private sector will come forward only to operate trains on the most profitable routes leaving unprofitable routes to the railway administration.

Consequently, the Department of Railway will face huge loss and go the BSNL way.

Dakshin Railway Employees' Union too has opposed to the move of operating 150 private trains.

Its divisional secretary R. Sankaranarayanan said that among 150 private trains, 11 trains have been identified in Southern Railway.

The private players would be given a free hand in fixing the train fare leading to exorbitant increase in train fare that would badly affect the passengers.

Similarly, the move to operate Kisan cargo trains through private players will not benefit the farmers in transporting their produce as the private players would not provide them any freight fare concession.

The union said that the budget has not made any announcement on filling up of 3 lakh vacant posts in Indian Railways.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/railway-unions-oppose-privatisation-move-of-train-services/article30715133.ece

Taking cognisance of the fact that a woman was only a silent partner in a firm that was involved in a scam, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court quashed trial court proceedings pending against her. The trial court proceedings were pending against her before the CBI Court, Madurai.

Justice M. Nirmal Kumar allowed the petition filed by N.G. Bharathi who was a silent partner in the firm, Bharathi Traders. The court took into account that the woman had not taken part in the business activities of the firm and was only a partner due to sentimental reason that she was a female member of the family.

The case of the prosecution was that the accused in the case had entered into a criminal conspiracy in 2002 to cheat the Punjab National Bank, Sivakasi branch, by obtaining cash credit in the name of Vinayaga Corporation and Karthick Trading Company and not use the funds for business purpose.

The Bharathi Traders also got involved in the scam and a case was registered. The woman being a partner in the firm was also arrayed as an accused in the case.

Addressing the participants, Corporation Commissioner S. Visakan said that the main aim of the drive is to create awareness among residents of the preservation of the Vaigai. “Earlier the legendary Kiruthumal river and the Vaigai were the main rivers which flowed through the city. But, today, Kiruthumal has become a carrier of waste and sewage. Hence, there is an urgent need to preserve the Vaigai,’ he said.

He also urged the residents to not dump waste along the Vaigai and said that the drive aims to bring a behavioural change among them.

“On Sunday, the conservancy workers will clean the stretch starting from AV Bridge to Fatima College. So, we request the residents to dump garbage into the river,” he said.

He also said that the work for setting up a sewage treatment plant at Panthalkudi channel will begin in a couple of weeks. “This will arrest the discharge of sewage into the Vaigai. Similarly, the Corporation is regularly cleaning the stormwater drains across the city. Hence, residents must also cooperate with the civic body in preserving the waterbodies,” he said.

Though the conservancy workers regularly clear the waterbodies, residents immediately dump waste into them, said M. Pandiammal, a conservancy worker.

Earlier, around 400 children took part in kidathon, which started from Gandhi Memorial Museum and was completed at Tamukkam grounds. Saplings were also distributed for them.

Successful entrepreneurs develop their own ideas and strategies, rather than following the techniques of their competitors. While the former always focus on improving their business, an entrepreneur who tries to copy business strategies does not learn much, according to Founder and Chairman of Ramraj Cotton K.R. Nagarajan.

He was addressing entrepreneurs from across the State here on Saturday, who participated in the first edition of ‘EVOLVE 2020’, a business conclave, organised by Young Indians (Yi), a wing of the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII).

“Learn from the experiences of successful entrepreneurs and use your strengths and weaknesses to build your business plan,” he said.

Narrating the story of how he turned into an entrepreneur after failing to attend higher education, Mr. Nagarajan said, “Every failure in life teaches new lessons and leads to the path of success. I learnt a lot from my experiences and by interacting with people from various walks of life,” he added. He also stressed that an entrepreneur must be ethical and consider the needs of other people in order to be successful.

Minister for Adi Dravida Welfare V. M. Rajalakshmi inaugurated the book fair in the presence of Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish.

Booksellers and publishers from various parts of South India have exhibited books in 110 stalls. To popularise this event among the public, the district administration organised a ‘mass drawing programme’ in which over 200 students participated. The students showcased their talents on canvas that stressed the need for inculcating reading habit among the younger generation and the benefits of reading.

As another promotional event, a mass reading event was organised at Kallai Girls’ Corporation Higher Secondary School in Tirunelveli Town.

To encourage the students, the district administration has made arrangements for holding competitions for school and the college students between 11 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. everyday while the next one hour has been reserved for folk artists to exhibit their talents.

After releasing books of local writers between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., guest speakers will entertain the audience between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The next two hours will be for ‘pattimantram’ or seminars. Sahitya Akademi winners from Tirunelveli and neighbouring districts will be honoured everyday.

Arrangements have been made to train the younger generation in drawing, photography, culinary, folk arts, sign language etc.

A few thousand visitors came to the book fair on the first day and the venue was virtually overflowing with huge crowd in the evening.

In an attempt to create world record while highlighting the importance of reading books, students and the public have started reading books round-the-clock at the venue. A group of 5 girl students from Rani Anna Government College for Women in Pettai started the relay-reading exercise that will go up to February 10, in which students from various colleges are going to participate.

The Tamil Nadu government’s Direct CTO (Consent to Operate) scheme instantly enabling industrial units operating under the ‘green category industries’ to obtain faster clearances from government to commence operations will be useful to the public, say members of the Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

In a press statement, the chamber said that green category industries defined as those with a pollution index score between 21 and 40 fixed by the Ministry of Environment will get a certificate from the agricultural department within 30 days and reclassification of land for industrial purpose within 50 days.

If the approval is not received within the time limit, it will be considered as deemed approval and the project will receive a ‘go ahead.’ This is opposed to the original time frame of six months to two years.

“This efficacious initiative will largely benefit industrial units, especially in the micro, small and medium industry sector in the State. The move will go a long way in motivating the creation of industrial units in Tamil Nadu,” the statement read.

Members of the Madurai District Tiny and Small Scale Industries Association said that such a move will create employment in the State, particularly in pockets like Madurai. Lack of bureaucratic barriers would also mean quick setting up of industries, particularly during a difficult time that the economy was facing, a statement said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/direct-cto-scheme-will-be-useful-to-public/article30713422.ece
383,2020/02/01,Trade and industry bodies hail Union Budget,"Trade and industry bodies on Saturday hailed the Union Budget, terming it a smart balancing act by the Finance Minister and a forward-thinking action plan. However, they demanded more support to the MSME sector, immediate streamlining of the GST filing system, and smooth functioning of the FASTag system on priority.

Canara Plastic Manufacturers’ and Traders’ Association (CPMA) president B.A. Nazeer in a statement here said the proposal to introduce a scheme to provide subordinate debt to MSME entrepreneurs was a good step, if implemented efficiently. The decision to continue restructuring loans for MSMEs for one more year needs to be appreciated, he said, adding Aadhaar-based PAN was also a welcome move.

Mr. Nazeer said there should have been schemes for increasing employment as many jobs were lost because of the economic slowdown and industries were still unable to create employment opportunities. He demanded that MSMEs be empowered through interest subvention schemes, market assistance schemes, easy credit and interest reduction for GST-registered SME units immediately.

The Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) complimented the Finance Minister for her budget speech made with fewer populist schemes and a more forward-thinking action plan. KCCI president Issac Vas, in a statement, said the budget needed to be complimented for giving a thrust towards gainful employment through a healthy business environment.

He said the chamber appreciates the initiatives for economic development and for creating a caring and compassionate society to meet the aspirations of a resurgent India. “But we observe with caution that the fiscal deficit is pegged at 3.8%, against the targeted 3.3% — a small variation in number but [one] of immense impact leading to a need for tightrope walking!” he said.

Mr. Vas complimented many initiatives, including the centralised investment clearance cell to support MSMEs and startups, restructuring window for debts of MSMEs, national cold storage supply chain, e-logistics market, Make in India initiatives in mobile and electronics goods market, national gas grid, Common Eligibility Test for employment in non-gazetted posts, and framework for development of marine fisheries.

384,2020/02/01,Leaders in Mangaluru differ on Union Budget,"Stress on the fisheries sector in the Union Budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will give a fillip to the coastal fisheries, said D. Vedavyasa Kamath, MLA, Mangaluru City South, on Saturday.

The budget proposes to hike fish production to 200 lakh tonnes by 2022-23. The government hopes to raise fisheries exports to ₹1 lakh crore by 2024-25. The Minister said that the government would involve youth in fisheries extension through 3,477 Sagar Mitras and 500 fish farmer producer organisations. In addition to this, growing of algae, seaweed and cage culture will also be promoted.

With all this, Mr. Kamath said, youngsters in coastal areas will benefit through fish processing and marketing. He also said the Union government had also proposed to put in place a framework for development, management and conservation of marine fisheries resources. The MLA said the budget was presented according to the aspirations of the people and reflected economic growth and social concern. “It has given special stress on agricultural development and promotion of education,” he said.

Nalin Kumar Kateel, MP and State BJP president, called it a visionary and inclusive budget that puts stress on the growth of all sectors.

Meanwhile, Harish Kumar, president of the Dakshina Kannada unit of Congress, said it was an anti-farmer budget as it paves the way for the corporate sector to purchase farmland easily. The budget has not proposed any visionary projects and it will hit the middle class hard, he said.

B. Ramanath Rai, former Minister, said the budget had nothing on creation of jobs and revival of the economy.

386,2020/02/01,Citizens of Mangaluru urged to take part in ease of living survey,"Mangaluru Smart City Ltd. (MSCL) on Friday urged the residents of the city to actively participate in the ‘Ease of Living Index 2019’ survey that will be hosted by the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs between February 1 and 29.

Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh told reporters on Friday that people participating in large numbers and answering identified queries online would help the city improve its ranking in the ‘Ease of Living’ index. People can access the survey on http://eol2019.org/citizenfeedback.

There will be 22 questions in the survey, said MSCL managing director Mohammed Nazeer. Some of the questions cover affordability of education, quality of healthcare, affordability of house rent, cleanliness of the city, waterlogging, safe commuting, city as a safe and secure place to live in, emergency services, drinking water supply, and safety of women in public places.

He said the survey would also help the city administration move towards outcome-based planning from the present input-based approach. With this, the ministry has sought to facilitate smart cities and other million-plus population cities in assessment of the outcomes that would lead to better planning and management. Besides the online survey, residents can also participate in the survey through social media — on Facebook (@SmartCitiesMission) and Twitter (@easeofliving2019), he said.

388,2020/02/01,Economic Survey 2019-20: Bigger banks needed for $5 trillion economy,"The country will need much bigger banks to become a $5 trillion economy, the Economic Survey 2019-20 said. In particular, at least eight banks are needed which are large enough to belong to the top 100 banks globally, the Survey said noting there is now only one bank in the country, the State Bank of India, with 55th rank, in the world’s top 100 banks.

“The state of the banking sector in India, therefore, needs urgent attention,” the Survey said.

Lag in performance

Observing that even though public sector banks are the dominant players in the banking sector, they lag considerably in performance metrics when compared to their peers, the Survey said, pointing out that these entities have destroyed capital deployed by the government over the years.

“In 2019, every rupee of taxpayer money invested in public sector banks, on average, lost 23 paise. In contrast, every rupee of investor money invested in ‘New Private Banks’ (NPBs) — banks licensed after India’s 1991 liberalization — on average gained 9.6 paise,” it noted.

The report highlighted that while a large economy needs an efficient banking sector to support its growth, credit growth among PSBs has declined significantly since 2013 and has also been anaemic since 2016. Credit growth for the new private banks, however, remained healthy.

Commenting that anaemic credit growth has impacted economic growth, the Survey called for enhancing the efficiency of public sector banks as they operate in the same market as the new private sector banks.

Less operating freedom

The report says the decline in PSB market share has been largely absorbed by new private banks. The report also pointed out that the PSBs enjoy less strategic and operating freedom as compared to private banks. It says the majority ownership by the government also subjects public sector bank officers to scrutiny of their decisions by the Central Vigilance Commission and the Comptroller and Auditor General.

Wary of risks

“With no real restrictions on what can be investigated and under what circumstances, officers of state-run banks are wary of taking risks in lending or in renegotiating bad debt, due to fears of harassment under the veil of vigilance investigations,” the Economic Survey added.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/gom66f/article30706140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th01NBFCcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economic-survey-2019-20-bigger-banks-needed-for-5-trillion-economy/article30706141.ece
389,2020/02/01,Pro-business policy crucial to meet aspirations: Sitharaman,"India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on promoting “pro-business” policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth on the one hand, and weaning away from “pro-crony” policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents, on the other, according to the Economic Survey2019-20 tabled by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament on Friday.

The Survey said that economic events since 1991 provide powerful evidence supporting this crucial distinction. “The creative destruction has increased significantly after reform. The liberalization of the Indian economy in 1991 unleashed competitive markets and enabled the forces of creative destruction, generating benefits that we still witness today. Creative destruction brings new innovations in the market that serve people better than the old technologies they displace.”

The Economic Survey 2019-20 observed that pro-crony policies, in contrast to pro-business ones, erode wealth in the economy as cronyism fosters inefficiencies by inhibiting the process of creative destruction. Despite impressive progress in enabling competitive markets, pro-crony policies have destroyed value in the economy.

For example, an equity index of connected firms significantly outperformed the market by 7 per cent a year from 2007 to 2010, reflecting abnormal profits extracted at common citizens’ expense. In contrast, the index under-performed the market by 7.5 per cent from 2011, reflecting the inefficiency and value destruction inherent in such firms.

“The strengthening the invisible hand of markets with pro-business policies and minimum government intervention would go a long way to build confidence of the policy makers, investors and the consumers,” said Dr. D K Aggarwal, president, PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

The Survey said that wilful default, if unchecked, would increase the cost of borrowing for everyone else, including genuine businesses with profitable investment opportunities before them. Adverse selection may force genuine borrowers to exist the market altogether, leaving only cronies in the market and resulting in a market failure that slows economic growth, employment and wealth creation capacity.

“The tone of the Survey aligns well with the government’s pro-market, pro-entrepreneurship and wealth-creation stance. We expect the FM to adhere to these principles and deliver a strong and credible budget tomorrow,” said Ms. Anagha Deodhar, Economist, ICICI Securities .

Before liberalisation, a Sensex firm expected to stay in it for 60 years, which decreased to only 12 years after liberalisation. Every five years, one-third of Sensex firms are churned out, reflecting the continuous influx of new firms, products and technologies into the economy.

“The argument in favour of pro-business policies, the need for aggressive divestment of CPSEs, concerns on the injurious effects of freebies and debt waivers are all pro-market views that are to be welcomed. The survey leaves little room for doubt about economic thinking. The big question is whether the budget too will reflect the same thinking.” said, Dr. V.K.

390,2020/02/01,"Essential Commodities Act is outdated, must go, says Economic Survey","The Centre’s imposition of stock limits in a bid to control the soaring prices of onions over the last few months actually increased price volatility, according to the Economic Survey 2019-20 tabled in Parliament on Friday.

The finding came in a hard-hitting attack in the report against the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and other “anachronistic legislations” and interventionist government policies, including drug price control, grain procurement and farm loan waivers.

“The Essential Commodities Act has been in existence since 1955, when the economy was very different from what it is today,” said Chief Economic Advisor Krishnamurthy Subramanian, speaking to journalists after the Survey was tabled. “It was an economy ravaged by famine and food shortages. The mindset was very different. What we have shown is evidence of interventions not working... It’s important to make the distinction between storage and hoarding.”

In July 2019, the NITI Aayog set up a panel of Chief Ministers to suggest agriculture reforms, whose mandate included possible amendments to the ECA. However, just a few months later, in September 2019, the Centre invoked the Act’s provisions to impose stock limits on onions after heavy rains wiped out a quarter of the kharif crop and led to a sustained spike in prices.

Increase in volatility

Although the restrictions on both retail and wholesale traders were meant to prevent hoarding and enhance supply in the market, the Survey showed that there was actually an increase in price volatility and a widening wedge between wholesale and retail prices.

“The lower stock limits must have led the traders and wholesalers to offload most of the kharif crop in October itself which led to a sharp increase in the volatility from November, 2019, onwards,” it said.

The Survey argued that if the government had not intervened, traders would have stored part of their produce to ensure smooth availability of the commodity at stable prices throughout the year. “In the long term, the Act disincentivises development of storage infrastructure, thereby leading to increased volatility in prices following production/ consumption shocks — the opposite of what it is intended for,” it said.

The Survey also offered similar examples of stock limits on sugar and pulses which had little impact. It added that despite 76,000 raids conducted under the ECA in 2019, the conviction rate was abysmally low. “The ECA only seems to enable rent-seeking and harassment. The Survey provides clear evidence that the case for jettisoning this anachronistic legislation is strong,” it said.

The Survey argued that the Drug Price Control Order issued under the ECA also distorted the market and actually made medicines less affordable. Estimates showed that the prices of drugs that came under DPCO, 2013, increased ₹71 per mg of the active ingredient, in comparison to just ₹13 per mg for drugs unaffected by the order. The increase in prices is greater for more expensive formulations than for cheaper ones and for those sold in hospitals rather than retail shops, said the Survey.

With regard to the farm sector, the Survey argued that the beneficiaries of farm loan waivers consume less, save less, invest less and are less productive. It added that the government procurement of foodgrains led to a burgeoning food subsidy burden and inefficiencies in the markets, arguing for a shift to cash transfers instead.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/27aajn/article30705357.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01ONION,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/essential-commodities-act-is-outdated-must-go-says-economic-survey/article30705358.ece
391,2020/02/01,Thalinomics: the calculation behind one square meal,"For the average worker in India’s organised manufacturing sector, the affordability of a plate of vegetarian food — comprising rice or roti, dal and sabzi — has improved 29% since 2006-07, according to Thalinomics, a take on the economics of food by the Economic Survey. For non-vegetarians, affordability has risen 18%.

However, accelerating food inflation over the last few months has broken that trend, with workers now forced to use an increasing share of their wages on food, the data compiled in the Survey shows.

The thali prices include the costs of raw cereals, vegetables and protein, as well as the spices, condiments, cooking oil and fuel needed to prepare the meal.

While Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian pitched Thalinomics as “economics for the common man”, the fine print shows that the affordability factor was calculated using daily wages derived from the Annual Survey of Industries. This deals with workers engaged in the organised manufacturing sector, who form only 28% of the total manufacturing workforce. It excludes workers from the unorganised sector, as well as rural and agricultural workers.

“While it is true that there was a decline in food prices during most of the period since 2015-16, this is also a period of stagnant or declining rural wages and highest unemployment,” said Dipa Sinha, a member of the economics faculty at Ambedkar University and food security expert. “So where are the incomes for people to buy food? Low inflation is meaningless when real wages falling in rural areas means that the poor are not able to consume more.”

The Survey found that a worker who would have spent 70% of their daily wage on two vegetarian thalis a day for a household of five in 2006-07 would only have to spend 50% of their income for the meals in 2019-20. This year, the most affordable meal was in Jharkhand, where two vegetarian thalis for a household of five required about 25% of a worker’s daily wage.

The Survey said there was a “shift in the dynamics of thali prices” from 2015-16. “Many reform measures were introduced during the period of analysis to enhance the productivity of the agricultural sector as well as efficiency and effectiveness of agricultural markets for better and more transparent price discovery,” said the Survey. It showed that after 2015-16, the household of a worker in India’s organised manufacturing sector on average gained ₹10,887 per year from the moderation in vegetarian thali prices.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/jbrpxk/article30706741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thalinomics,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/thalinomics-the-calculation-behind-one-square-meal/article30706742.ece

395,2020/02/01,Thinking beyond farm sops,"The year 2019 witnessed a series of interventions and disruptions in the farm sector. The first half of the year saw the launch of a grand farm sop in the form of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) with a record allocation of ₹75,000 crore. The second half, however, was a disaster for the sector as many parts of the country witnessed drought and floods. The economic slowdown and the spiralling onion and vegetable prices burdened consumers (including farmers), providing a short respite to only a section of farmers.

This clearly reflects two things: one, populist measures have a low bearing on the economy. Second, despite several measures to reduce vulnerability of climate-induced disasters, the farm sector and farmers continue to suffer losses. Therefore, taking cognisance of past experience and leveraging on opportunities that exist is a must to boost agriculture.

Focus areas

Agriculture is a crucial segment for inclusive development and provides stimulus to the economy, especially when it is not doing too well. Since the country has several targets and commitments to be achieved in the next decade, it is imperative to lay a strong foundation by launching measures that can stem falling farm growth. First, the disparity in agriculture expenditure and growth drivers, mainly the subsidiary sectors, must be addressed. Despite higher growth in livestock and fisheries sector, only moderate to low expenditure was recorded. Expenditure on livestock and fisheries must be increased, as they are mainly connected with resource-poor families in rural areas and also to raise the decelerating growth rate. Moreover, the expenditure on research and development in agriculture needs to be raised from nearly 0.40% of agriculture GDP to 1% as it pays huge dividends in the long run in ameliorating poverty and improving livelihoods compared to any other investment. Considering India’s dependency on agriculture and recurring climate-induced disasters, it is imperative to expand the implementation of Climate Smart Villages of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) across the nation.

Second, the Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs), which are currently facing operational and structural issues governed by different Acts and funded by various sources, may be strengthened by bringing them under one institution, preferably an FPO Development and Regulatory Authority. A structured impetus must be given to build block chain based e-market places connecting farmers, traders, agencies, institutions and exporters on a common platform to check price fluctuations and harness decentralisation. Further, affordable technologies must be developed and deployed particularly in rural and remote areas where digital literacy of farmers has improved considerably. Key farm institutions and organisations in the front line of farm service, dealing with perishables and low shelf life commodities, must digitalise so that they are efficiently managed.

Private sector involvement

Third, large-scale investment in agriculture over several years have encouraged monoculture, threatening the environment and soil health (mainly in green revolution areas). Thus small-scale investment measures or an incentive-based system is essential to scale up sustainable practices such as agroforestry, climate-smart agriculture, ecosystem services, conservation agriculture and others. Increasing corporate social responsibility will help to tap more private investments besides encouraging private players in potential areas where production sustainability is possible.

Fourth, the government must establish a farm data agency, which can consolidate, collate and maintain farm data available at various platforms. Ongoing efforts of digitisation of land records must also include farmer-centric advisories. The farm data agencies can also facilitate beneficiaries identification, better targeting of subsidies, support systems of various developmental programmes. Access to farm agency data for scientific institutions and all other relevant stakeholders can hasten the process of technology dissemination and aid research systems for better policies.

Fifth, commissioning ease of farming index is necessary to ascertain the progress made by national and State governments on the key indicators of farming. Possibly, the exercise can be done with active involvement of proven private/public institutions or international agencies. This perhaps stands away from the conventional assessment of effectiveness of agriculture policies and programmes that are part of the farm support system. Moreover, the exercise may foster cooperative and competitive federalism besides encouraging States which are lagging behind to catch up.

Welfare commissions

Last, the need of the hour is setting up two institutions; one, a national agricultural development council on the lines of the Goods and Services Tax Council under the chairmanship of Prime Minister for effective coordination and convergence of States on key reforms and policies; two, farmers’ welfare commissions (both at the Centre and State level), as an independent institutional mechanism which will act as a neutral platform for assessing all agriculture-related issues and schemes. Involvement of centrally-funded research organisations as knowledge partners would help to coordinate and refine existing developmental schemes in agriculture and allied sectors.

It is pertinent to deliberate on an ‘Indian Agricultural Service’ on the lines of the Agricultural Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. In addition, to deal effectively with increasing droughts and floods and other extreme events, transfer of some subjects to the concurrent list is of prime importance.

In the era of global uncertainty and domestic glitches, we need well-tailored farm measures beyond short-run sops to balance the national requirement with the farmer’s aspirations. Moreover, the right mix of direct benefits and price support with focused investment on resource conservation will bring stability in a farmer’s income. The promised achhe din for all must include farmers too which is only possible with steps engaging all stakeholders and sectors.

396,2020/02/01,India abroad: On diplomats firefighting negative references to India,"The European Union Parliament’s discussion recently on India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, is more proof of concern, particularly in the West, over the possible repercussions of the law and the protests across India. Parliamentarians in the U.K. and U.S. Congressmen, including Democratic presidential contenders, have asked India to “reconsider” the law and to “engage” with the protesters. The EU parliamentarians went a step further: putting out six different and extremely critical resolutions, including one that spoke of the possible risk by the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens, of creating “the largest statelessness crisis in the world”. A sixth less critical resolution, but which worried about the “brutal crackdown” on protesters, was dropped. After India’s intense diplomatic outreach, the parliamentarians agreed to put off voting on the resolution until after External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Prime Minister Modi visit Brussels; according to the EU member requesting the postponement, India will address Europe’s concerns. The government has called this a diplomatic victory, blaming Pakistan and also a British MEP with Pakistan occupied Kashmir origins for “strenuous efforts” to attack India in the EU Parliament. The hope is that with the U.K. scheduled to leave the EU on January 31, interest in the anti-CAA resolutions will wane. Finally, the government has held that the CAA is India’s internal law.

While the government is right about India’s sovereign right, it would be deluding itself if it thinks any of these explanations are passing muster with the EU parliamentarians. The government diluted its own case against foreign interference when it facilitated a visit by EU MEPs to Srinagar last year, when even Indian MPs were not allowed to visit. By engaging the EU MEPs to avoid a vote in the EU Parliament this week, and offering to explain the reasons behind CAA, the government is slipping up further. New Delhi must also consider the impact of its repeated reference to Pakistan as the sole mover of any motion against it at world legislatures and fora. It seems a stretch that Pakistan, which is itself on international notice for terrorism and attacks on minorities, can bring such weight to bear. In the EU Parliament, 626 MEPs of the total 751 were members of the groups that originally drafted the six resolutions, and it seems unlikely that Islamabad could have achieved such a majority. Above all, the government must reflect on the cumulative toll on its diplomatic heft following international alarm over the CAA, plans for an NRC and the dilution of Article 370. Instead of pushing a positive agenda for India or handling global challenges, Indian diplomats seem to be overwhelmed keeping out any negative references to India at official fora.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-abroad-the-hindu-editorial-on-diplomats-firefighting-negative-references-to-india/article30706266.ece
397,2020/02/01,Unfounded optimism: On Economic Survey’s GDP forecast,"As a report card-cum-blueprint for the future, Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) Krishnamurthy Subramanian’s Economic Survey 2019-20 is a mixed bag of interesting diagnosis combined with some optimistic prognostication. Seven months after his maiden survey, he finds himself again having to assess the economy’s health and provide signposts for the agenda ahead. And the CEA, who in July projected real GDP growth rebounding to 7% this fiscal, acknowledges that 2019 was a difficult year for the global economy, including for trade and demand, and by extension a challenging period for the Indian economy as well. The Survey concedes that “a sharp decline in fixed investment induced by a sluggish growth of real consumption” has weighed down growth, which the National Statistical Office now estimates at 5% for the 12 months ending in March. The stress in the non-bank financial industry and decline in credit growth that the IMF flagged in January when it cut its India growth estimate for the current fiscal to 4.8%, from October’s 6.1%, find reflection in the Survey. Interestingly, a chapter devoted to “Financial fragility in the NBFC sector” recommends a dynamic health index that policymakers can use as an early warning system to avert incipient liquidity crises in this key credit providing sector.

Listing downside risks to next fiscal’s outlook including continuing global trade uncertainties, escalation in West Asian geopolitical tensions, slow pace of insolvency resolution and the possibility of further fiscal pressure crowding out private investment, the CEA, however, takes a leap of faith. In forecasting growth rebounding to a 6.0-6.5% range, he reiterates an expectation from his previous survey: given the government’s strong mandate, it ought to expedite reforms. The Survey also makes a political statement on Budget eve. Expect more policy incentives for “Wealth creation”. Featuring as a central theme of the first volume, the Survey asserts that India’s vaunted historical economic dominance was reliant “on the invisible hand of the market for wealth creation” supported by ethical practices that engendered trust. To ensure smoother functioning of markets as creators of wealth, the Survey makes several policy prescriptions. Contending that government interventions hurt more than they help, it recommends scrapping the Essential Commodities Act — enacted in 1955 when famines and shortages were the concern. Similarly, it asserts that the Drug (Prices Control) Order of 2013 has failed to achieve its aim of making drugs affordable and needs to go. And the CEA wants a complete review of the policy on foodgrains, which he argues has made the government the largest “hoarder” thereby distorting these markets. All are suggestions that traders and market players, a key electoral constituency, will cheer, but may be fraught with risks.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unfounded-optimism-the-hindu-editorial-on-gdp-forecast-of-economic-survey-2019-20/article30706263.ece
398,2020/02/01,No room for panic: On novel coronavirus,"The Emergency Committee convened by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on January 30 has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak in China as a ‘public health emergency of international concern’, a development that comes after its meeting for the second time in just a week. The virus, that has been infecting hundreds and killing several each day in China, is now being reported in at least 23 other countries — nearly 14,380 cases as on Sunday — since the committee last met on January 22-23. There has also been the first confirmed fatality outside China, with a death in the Philippines. As on Sunday, Chinese authorities said 45 more deaths had been recorded in Hubei province by the end of Saturday, bringing the death toll in the country to 304. All of China’s provinces and territories have now reported cases. But the critical factor that prompted WHO’s emergency declaration is the virus’s human-to-human spread in other countries. In fact, WHO’s committee reconvened to assess the situation mainly because of local transmission in other countries — a scenario for further global spread. China is also having to deal with another disease outbreak — a “highly pathogenic” strain of bird flu, or H5N1.

All about the Coronavirus

In Kerala, after a student who had travelled from Wuhan city, the epicentre of the current outbreak, was found to be infected, State health authorities, on Sunday, reported a second case being detected. This patient too had a history of travel from China. Besides isolating those who exhibit overt symptoms and conducting contact tracing, there is an urgent need to raise public awareness. This is essential so that they report to a hospital when symptoms show up later or in case of contact with a person who has travelled to China recently. There is evidence that those who appear to be healthy despite being infected can spread it even during the incubation period. Also, cases have been reported wherein people have not exhibited symptoms in spite of being infected. In both instances, thermal screening at airports, which is largely helpful, would fail to detect infected people — as in the case of the Kerala patients. Hence, time-tested measures which include handwashing and hand hygiene, wearing protective gear while attending to sick people and covering one’s mouth and nose properly when coughing or sneezing will drastically reduce the infection risk. There is no clinical evidence whatsoever that any specific drug, either modern or of the traditional system of medicine, can prevent infection or treat infected people. And it is the novel virus transmitted through physical contact or droplets that causes the infection, and not any food items as social media claims.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/no-room-for-panic/article30721007.ece
399,2020/02/01,Illegal flexes for birthday of MLA’s son,"The civic body has registered a police complaint after banners and flexes were allegedly put up on Friday for the birthday celebrations of Mohammed Nalapad, son of Shantinagar MLA N.A. Haris.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has banned flexes, banners and hoardings.

However, banners were put up in parts of Shantinagar and also Jogupalya, which is Mayor M. Goutham Kumar’s ward.

Based on a complaint filed by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials, the Indiranagar police on Friday registered a case against Rama Nayak, a supporter of Nalapad. “For the celebrations, a pandal had been erected in a BBMP ground in Halasuru for a cultural programme, but initially, without the necessary permissions,” said a civic official.

BBMP officers claimed they were not allowed to remove the flexes.

“When we questioned them about flexes and setting up a pandal in a BBMP ground without prior permission, supporters of Nalapad quarrelled with us and continued their work despite our opposition. We were not allowed to pull down the flexes,” a BBMP official said. Later, they got permission to set up a pendal and organise cultural programmes from an official of Shantinagar.

Revenue officials of the BBMP filed a complaint at Indiranagar police station under Karnataka Open Places Prevention of Disfigurement Act 1981, Section 3.

“They prevented us from discharging our duty. Moreover, they did not have permission from any department, be it Bescom or the BBMP,” a revenue official of the BBMP said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/illegal-flexes-for-birthday-of-mlas-son/article30715401.ece

401,2020/02/01,Make-up artiste held for picking up lost watch at KIA,"A 32-year-old make-up artist was arrested and charged with theft after she picked up an expensive watch lying at Kempegowda International Airport. She told the police that she was going to give it to the authorities but was arrested before she could do so.

The incident occurred on Friday afternoon. The wristwatch belonged to a male passenger headed to Port Blair. According to the police, his watch slipped from his wrist after he cleared baggage check. It was only after boarding the flight did the passenger realise that the watch was missing and filed a complaint with security personnel.

“CCTV camera footage showed the woman picking up the watch and walking away. She then went to the washroom,” said the police.

When she got out of the washroom, she was confronted by a team of CISF officials, who detained her, recovered the watch and handed her over to the police. “The accused is a make-up artist from Mumbai, who had come to Bengaluru for an assignment but was returning home as she was unwell,” the police added.

The woman told the police that she had no intention of stealing the watch and was planning on handing it over to security personnel. Based on a complaint by Tara Chand, senior officer of CISF, the airport police filed an FIR against the accused. The woman was let off on station bail.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/make-up-artiste-held-for-picking-up-lost-watch-at-kia/article30714234.ece

The expansion would take place either on Sunday or Monday, sources close to the CM said.

405,2020/02/01,‘Weed out invasive species’,"While welcoming the decision of the State Government to cultivate an environment park on Adambakkam Eri, the residents of Nanganallur and Adambakkam have made a plea to the State Government to expedite the works at the earliest.

Before embarking on the work (cultivating an environment park), residents say steps should be taken to de-silt and deepen the lake, form bunds and a walkers’ path.

Besides, steps should be taken to arrest discharge of sewage through storm water drains and dumping of garbage on the lake bunds and on Thillai Ganga Nagar side below the road bridge.

Located on Southern Sector Inner Ring Road, the lake is covered by water hyacinth. The invasive species has reduced the holding capacity of the water-body. The water-holding area has shrunk considerably due to large growth of the hyacinths, say environmentalists. They cite the discharge of sewage into the lake results in the growth of the weed.

They were initially found on a few portions; but now, the entire waterbody is covered by hyacinth. Water hyacinth blocks sunlight from reaching native aquatic plants and starves the water of oxygen and kills the fish population, environmentalists pointed out.

Besides, it doesn't allow growth of native aquatic vegetation. The water holding area covered by the invasive

species becomes a breeding ground for the mosquitoes.

V. Rama Rao of Sabari Green Foundation, says, “ For more than a decade, we have been urging the State

Government to rejuvenate the lake. But, no action has been initiated till date.

Except, for cleaning the trash, weeding the bushes, and removing coconut trees logs, by environmental

organisations, volunteers of Sabari Green Foundation, and Environmentalist Foundation of India (EFI) members of Thillai Ganga Nagar Residents Welfare Association, and Nanganallur and Adambakkam

Federation of Residents Welfare Associations, with the help of Zone 12 officials, and permission from Public

Works Department, no other restoration work has been started by PWD, he says.

“Similarly, to construct a terminal – Vanuvampet MRTS station, without any concern for the water body, the Southern Railway has reduced the breadth of the water channel , Veerangal Odai, which carries excess rainwater from Adambakkam Eri to Bay of Bengal through the Odai. The open canal has been closed and converted into a tunnel.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/590c/article30712845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02dctbrmAdambakkamErijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/weed-out-invasive-species/article30713563.ece

For many years, this stop does not have a shelter as there is no space to install one. It is a busy stop as services to Iyyappanthangal, Poonamallee, Koyambedu, T. Nagar, Ambattur, ICF and Ayanavaram halt. Sans shelter, commuters have been braving rain and sweltering sun.

“Here, commuters could be found waiting almost on the carriageway. They are at the risk of being hit by speeding motorists,” says a resident.

Therefore, FEDERA suggests to relocate the stop where there is enough space to install a shelter with seating facilities.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/federa-seeks-relocation-ofmtc-stop-at-gandhi-nagar/article30713052.ece
407,2020/02/01,Commuters left in the lurch,"In certain pockets of the city, bus commuters have no option other than boarding a couple of buses to reach their destinations, if that is where these buses are headed. Or, have cover a part of their journey and change buses at some point. Boarding a direct destination route number is now a matter of luck. The Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) has decreased and stopped services of many route numbers.

Residents of areas along Medavakkam Main Road have made a request to the MTC to reintroduce and increase the services of many route numbers.

At present, route numbers 14M and V51 ply through Medavakkam High Road.

R. Anand, a long-time resident of Nanganallur and a commuter, says, “There is a drop in services of route numbers M18C (Keezhkattalai - T. Nagar) and 18D (Keezhkattalai - Broadway). Commuters have to wait for more than half-an-hour to board the route number 18D to go to Broadway. Even the services of route number 70N have reduced. The services of the route number are operated once in a couple of hours.”

Steps should be taken to increase the services of these route numbers or introduce cut services from Medavakkam Koot Road and Keezhkattalai bus terminuses to Alandur Metro station and Guindy Industrial Estate halting points, where commuters can board route numbers to other parts of the city or switch to other modes of public transport, commuters say.

The commuters have also batted for the reintroduction of regular route numbers M21G, M18N, M11 and B51, which were plying from Nanganallur and East Tambaram to Broadway, Guduvanchery and Saidapet.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7ocqj9/article30713818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCTBRMMEDAVAKKAMMAINROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/commuters-left-in-the-lurch/article30712952.ece
408,2020/02/01,‘Dependability matters’,"With AC buses having been introduced on some routes in Chennai, there is widespread expectation from various parts of the city. They have their views about how and where they should ply. Commuters-residents living in areas along Medavakkam Main Road say the services of the air-conditioned route number buses should be dependable.

At present, the commuters wait for more than half-an-hour to get their buses go to Koyambedu, T. Nagar and Broadway. At present, a good number of commuters travel by Metro rail to go to Koyambedu and other places across the city, they say. So, for AC buses to make an impact this time around, they have to be dependable.

R. Sriram, a long-time resident of Nanganallur, says, “Whether the Metropolitan Transport Corporation introduces air-conditioned or deluxe route number buses is immaterial. The services should be dependable and should not force commuters to wait for 45 minutes to an hour. Due to poor bus services, commuters often have to travel by an auto to reach the nearest Metro Rail or suburan railway station. Buses should be introduced in Guindy and Saidapet from Velachery, Nanganallur, and Keezhkattalai bus terminuses through Thillai Ganga Nagar, Pazhavanthangal and Nanganallur.”

For example, the services of 154V, which plies between Nanganallur and Poonamallee, ARE operated once in two hours. On Sundays, there are literally no services.

The services of the air-conditioned route number buses should be operated around Metro rail and railway stations, every 15 to 20 minutes.

On the new AC bus services that have been introduced, V. Rama Rao, director, Traffic and Transportation Forum, Chennai, says, “The fare structure has been revised and reduced. Plying of buses towards Broadway through Mount Road and Kamarajar Salai, Triplicane and Porur will be a boon to the commuters.""",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dependability-matters/article30712778.ece
409,2020/02/01,Residents demand steps to de-silt Narayanapuram lake,"The Narayanapuram lake is a source of drinking, and ground water for the residents of Narayanapuram and Pallikaranai. But, soon this water-body may become dry if steps are not taken at the earliest to de-silt and deepen the lake. The residents are upset over continuous withdrawal of water from by water tankers from an agricultural well located near the lake. The residents are worried that if this practice continues, the ground water level may get reduced before the onset of peak summer.

The residents say that the lake should be de-silted and deepened at the earliest. The residents have made a fervent appeal to the Public Works Department to take steps to de-silt and deepen the Eri.

Residents say opposite to an eatery run by the state government a compound wall is located. In the premises surrounding the wall, an agricultural well is located. Daily, water tankers draw water from the well. “ We are dependent on ground water. The water-holding area in the Eri acts a source of ground water. But, in the coming months, there is a possibility of the water-body getting dried up.

“ The PWD should take steps to restore the lake, protect its flora and fauna, construct a walkers’ footpath and a park around the water body. The work to de-silt the lake was taken more than 10 years ago. The work was stopped midway following rock stones in the water bed.

If steps are taken to de-silt and deepen the lake, the water storage capacity in the lake would be increased thus re-charging the ground water level.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tu2vwb/article30712674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02dc-adyrNarayanapuramLake,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-demand-steps-to-de-silt-narayanapuram-lake/article30712675.ece

411,2020/02/01,Chaos near Peters Road flyover,"There are certain sure-fire ways of inviting a road accident. One of them is taking a U-turn where it is not authorised. The possibility of an accident increases manifold if this violation is carried out around a flyover.

Near the two-lane mini flyover on Peters Road, between Thousand Lights and New College, such violations are common.

Motorists violate traffic rules to avoid having to drive for a distance of around 500 metres below the flyover to take a ‘U’ turn at the intersection of Peters Road and Cornon Smith Road.

Extending the median on the flyover will prevent motorists from taking a ‘U’ turn near the edge of the bridge, say road users.

“The two mini-flyovers on Peter’s Road have eased traffic movement on the route. However, due to traffic violations on the flyover, motorists coming in the opposite direction of the flyover are put to greater risk as they suddenly notice the traffic violators taking a ‘U’ turn on the bridge,” says K. Venket, a motorist from Royapettah.

Motorists point out that such 'U' turn violations on the edge of the bridge are common during evening and night hours, with some motorists taking an abrupt turn and causing an accident in the process.

As traffic police personnel are found only below the flyover near the Royapettah junction and also at the clock tower junction, many motorists violate traffic rules on the bridge in front of New College, with impunity.

“Steps will be taken to prevent such traffic violations on the flyover,” say police sources.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6add44/article30712188.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCMYPRPETERSROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chaos-near-peters-road-flyover/article30712190.ece
412,2020/02/01,Pedestrians at risk,"A portion of the side wall across the Cooum river in Ambattur that is damaged due to weathering is seems to be putting road users out on a limb. The narrow bridge connects both sides of CTH Road, but does not have a footpath for pedestrians to walk.

This situation exposes pedestrians to great danger, as motorists tend to speed on the bridge, especially since a new digital traffic signal was installed at Ambattur police station junction, around 100 metres away from the narrow bridge. Many motorists drive at a fast clip, leaving little space for pedestrians to walk. They find it risky especially during the evening hours when there is a huge volume of vehicles and poor street lights around the damaged side wall of the bridge compounds the problem.

“Earlier, we could hold the sidewall while walking along the bridge to keep ourselves from falling into the river. Now, we have to wait for the vehicles to pass through the bridge,” says B. Sriram, a pedestrian from Ambattur.

The new traffic signal at the junction, traffic police sources say, has brought more safety to the road but speeding is still an issue.

For motorists try to catch up on time lost in traffic between Ambattur Old Town (OT) bus terminus and Canara Bank bus stop.

Secondly, Ambattur OT bus terminus and Telephone Exchange is a short route for motorists from Red Hills, Avadi, Annoor, Puzhal and Ayambakkam to reach the Chennai Bypass and Poonamallee High (PH) Road. As a result, motorists including motorcyclists tend to drive at a high speed near the junction once they cross the Ambattur OT traffic point.

Earlier, along with a few notorious stretches like Poonamallee High (PH) Road, Old Mamallapuram Road (OMR), East Coast Road (ECR), Grand Southern Trunk (GST) Road and Anna Salai, CTH Road between Padi and Tiruvallur was among the deadliest stretches where, on an average, two fatal accidents would occur every day. Most of these stretches were two-lane until a decade ago when they were widened as part of the state government’s efforts to make these key arterial roads safer. However, the CTH Road was the last one among these stretches to witness actual widening of its space since the stretch was laid some four decades ago. “Steps will be taken to rebuild the side wall of the bridge soon,” says a State Highways official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pir184/article30712177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02dcangrwallJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/pedestrians-at-risk/article30712179.ece
413,2020/02/01,MTC reuses spare parts of abandoned buses to maintain its existing fleet,"Until a decade and half ago, most of the “retired” buses that are operated by the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) were auctioned at the MTC Central Workshop in Chrompet, located on Chennai’s southern outskirts. These are buses that would have been certified unfit for use anymore.

Most of these abandoned government buses were brought by educational institutions — schools and colleges, mainly for the vehicle’s chassis to re-use them. At that time, except for government agencies engaged in the transport space, any entity, including educational institutions were not allowed to procure chassis on their own at that time.

There have been some changes in the rules over the years, with the result that MTC is now putting its retired buses to another use: Some working spare parts including tyres, wheels and frame are removed to have them refitted in existing buses that may need require spare-part replacements.

""As induction of new buses into a running fleet has been low due to funds-crunch for many years, we reuse working spare parts of abandoned buses to ensure that we run the existing fleet of buses,” says an MTC official.

On an average, MTC officials say, the lifespan of an MTC bus is around six years, however this number varies depending on its usage, such as the distance it has been covering on a daily basis. Another criteria to classify abandoned buses is the number of total kilometres run by the buses. On an average, buses that are operated more than five lakh kilometres are fit to be abandoned.

However, MTC officials say that the area of operations matters. It may be counter-intuitive, but buses that are operated on longer distance, and outside the core city areas, have a longer life than those buses that are operated within city limits.

Replacement of spare parts are mainly done for buses that are operated within the main parts of city as the spare parts of these buses get damaged often due to slow movement of traffic on city roads.

On the status of air-conditioned Volvo buses that were operated mostly on OMR, MTC officials say that all buses were auctioned a few years due to the expiry of their usage period.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/5ckaxs/article30712135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCMYPRCONDEMNEDOLDBUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/mtc-reuses-spare-parts-of-abandoned-buses-to-maintain-its-existing-fleet/article30712137.ece
414,2020/02/01,GCC restores memorial in Kodambakkam,"A fortnight ago, the Greater Chennai Corporation spruced up a 15-feet-tall memorial on Puliyur Main Road in Trustpuram in Kodambakkam (Zone 10) to its original splendour.

The memorial was built by the State government to commemorate the inauguration of Low Income Group Housing Scheme in 1955. But over the years, the memorial fell into a state of neglect. It was marred by posters.

The worn-out spots have been plastered and the foundation of the pillar has been strengthened with cement concrete. Besides, a fresh coat of paint has been given.

The plaque has been painted with fluorescent colours so that they serve as reflectors for motorists at night.

Moreover, the inscriptions on the plaque are now legible.

CCTV cameras have been installed at the pillar.

“The pillar serves as a roundabout for traffic regulation. Restoration of the pillar has let us learn about its rich past,” says R.

415,2020/02/01,Samayapuram Main Road residents heave a sigh of relief after installation of crash-barrier,"It is a few weeks since a crash-barrier was erected on Samayapuram Main Road in Porur. As the road runs parallel to the Chennai Bypass, a parade of heavy vehicles can be seen passing through it, most times of the day. To prevent this, a barrier has been placed on Samayapuram Main Road near Vanagaram toll-plaza by the police. It was a long-pending request of the local residents. “Lorries were plying through Samayapuram Main Road round-the-clock. We had to keep our windows always shut as swilrs of dust would rise from the roads dusty due to the movement of these vehicles. During night, their honking was quite annoying. Now, the crash-barrier is a relief,” says K. Vasanth, a resident of Porur. Samayapuram Main Road comes under the purview of Vanagaram Village Panchayat and Greater Chennai Corporation (Zone 11 - Valasaravakkam). While the stretch that is part of the Corporation is well maintained, safety amenities are not found on the section that is under the Vanagaram Village Panchayat. The portion of the road under Panchayat limits lacks a footpath, reflectors and signboards.

416,2020/02/01,Where old buses turn into swanky toilets,"Chennai can probably take some inspiration from this sustainability initiative where old public transport buses are refurbished and turned into a multi-purpose facility that combines a cafe, laundry space, a hair saloon and a toilet.

Inspired by a project initiated by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), four other cities have started putting their discarded buses to good use.

In 2016, when Pune was put on the smart cities project list, PMC invited ideas from citizens on how to make the city more residents-friendly.

Saraplast Private Limited, a company that makes portable and mobile toilets, suggested that old, dysfunctional BEST buses be transformed into toilets for women. The idea had been inspired by a model followed in San Francisco.

“These were 13 to 15 year old buses with no engine, gathering dust at the garage. Sending them to scarp isn’t profitable and recycling could be expensive. We refurbished it completely to give it an all new look, and it’s not just a toilet,” says Ulka Sadalkar, co-founder, Saraplast.

They called the project TI, which expands to Toilet Integration (Ti) and also translates into ‘she’ in Marathi. The first project was a simple wash room, but in the subsequent ones they added more features to make it profitable. Of the 12 old buses turned into Ti centres, some have a cafe, laundry space and hair saloon. It is partitioned with one western and three Indian toilets. They also come with WiFi connectivity and other amenities one generally looks for in a wash room like disposable sanitary vending machine, diaper changing station and water dispenser.

“Our idea was to not make it boring as well as change the perception that public toilets are dirty; and so we had to be creative. An attendant is in-charge of maintaining the Ti centre, so adding additional features ensured more footfalls and also gave her a decent income,” says Ulka.

Today, an average of 100-150 people use the Ti centres. “The café and advertisements have ensured there is some revenue in keeping these buses engaging,”says Ulka. A fee of ₹ 5 is charged per usage from public.

Ulka says constructing the brick and motors toilet take longer time, requires a lot of permissions to be taken and is also costly. “The cost of doing up an entire bus and making it run is around ₹10-13 lakhs, and it takes around a month to do-it-up,” Ulka says. The company has been taking up these projects with some CSR funding. The toilets are not really mobile and sometimes need to be towed to a venue where there is a huge gathering of women.

Ulka says to see this model really make profit one has to try it for a longer period. They have a five-year MOU with PMC, which monitors these centres on and off. “We have bagged work with government departments in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Nagpur and Mumbai,” she says.

In Bengaluru, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation is planning to convert its old fleet into toilet cum library and also into a skill development centre. Bangalore International Airport has come forward to support the initiative under its CSR initiative. “In Bengaluru, we are only refurbishing the buses and giving it to the agencies,” says Ulka. In Hyderabad, the project would also have health centres where women can opt for consultation and check-up among others.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kn7k06/article30712057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCti2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/where-old-buses-turn-into-swanky-toilets/article30712061.ece
417,2020/02/01,Are Chennai’s kidneys packing up?,"In Samuel Beckett's play “Waiting For Godot”, the two main characters don’t get anywhere even in the rare occasions when they display some degree of decisiveness. At the end of the play, they are still where they began.

The narrative about the Perungundi landfill and the Pallikaranai Marsh is somewhat similar. There have been a lot of conversations and even some efforts in recent times to do something about the landfill that has been plonked in a wetland, which include reducing the amount of garbage reaching it, and still the problem seems ominously big.

During the decade that just passed into history, the Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management (CCC&DM) at Anna University had been carrying out studies to assess how well the Marsh plays its role as natural kidneys in a urban expanse.

Over the years, the Marsh may have shrunk due to encroachments, and now reduced to a wafer-thin semblance of what it once was. However, the focus now is on what remains of the wetland and how to make it an effective filter, which is what wetlands are supposed to be. And how the landfill is queering the pitch, is an inextricable part of this narrative.

Environment scientists and researchers at CCC&DM point out that the Marsh is under-performing and also causing damage to the environment, due to the garbage piled up on one section and also the sewage and grey water that are flowing into it.

“Pallikaranai Marsh is a bad emitter rather than a good sinker. It emits considerable amounts of methane. It is supposed to function as a carbon sink, but it emits more carbon dioxide than it absorbs. As per our studies, the carbon sequestration potential of the wetland is 0.0020 Giga grams of carbon/year; and the wetland emits 26.6 Giga grams of carbon/ year. At this Marsh, the dissolved oxygen is considerably less, which pushes up the biological oxygen demand of living organisms,” says A. Ramachandran, emeritus professor, CCC&DM, who conducted the study “Identification of Pollution Source, Biodiversity Degradation and Adaptive Mechanism for Sustainable Management of Pallikaranai Marshland – Phase I”. The study was carried out on behalf of The Tamil Nadu Forest Department.

Though this study was carried out from 2010 to 2013, it gained traction around the corresponding time last year, around World Wetlands Day, when a seminar discussing the Marsh and its role as an ecosystem-regular was organised.

It is a moot point whether the message of this study has spurred a powerful wave of initiatives. As this study and a couple of others, conducted by the Centre, evoke a sense of urgency, their core message is being shared on the eve of another World Wetlands Day. Significantly, the theme of the Day this year is “Wetlands and Biodiversity” and this decade — 2020s — has been named the “United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration”.

By their very nature, wetlands characterised as they are by anaerobic conditions, will generate methane as a natural process of organic matter (plants and animals) being decomposed as soil carbon — it is termed methanogenesis. However, there is cause for concern when the amounts of methane that are produced and let into the atmosphere are high. A high level of methanogenesis is a characteristic feature of wetlands marked by a great degree of pollution. As methane is one of the most significant greenhouse gases contributing to climate change, this is a really serious concern.

“The landfill on the Perungudi side of the Marsh is pushing methanogenesis to an alarmingly high level, due to the huge amount of biodegradeable waste from the landfill getting decomposed in the Marsh. Besides, heavy metal components – such as lead, chromium and iron – from the landfill leaches into the wetland, and poses a threat to the organisms in it. When the metallic concentration and other polluting material increase, the biological oxygen demand will be higher, due to reduced level of dissolved oxygen in the wetland. Due to the reduced dissolved oxygen, aquatic fauna will suffer,” says Ramachandran.

That takes us to the obvious question of reducing the garbage that reaches the landfill. In recent times, there has been considerable focus on composting at the residential and institutional level. Last year, the Greater Chennai Corporation shared information on how the amount of garbage reaching the landfill is being reduced, through composting of biodegradable waste as well as material-recovery initiatives related to dry waste and e-waste.

The sense one gets from scientific community’s view of the situation is that there has to be more of the good initiatives that are being carried out, and they have to be executed at a maddeningly accelerated speed.

“If this situation continues, without any strong intervention, there is a very high possibility that biological systems at the Marsh will collapse sooner than we expect. Diatoms, which form a carpet of green; algae and bryophytes will be hit. As the presence of lead and chromium is huge in the Marsh, this can affect the fish population significantly. Those fish species that are more resilient and survive the heavy metal contamination, will be carriers passing on the toxins to those next in the food-chain, in a case of bio-magnification,” says Ramachandran.

K. Palanivelu, director, CCC&DM, says, “In a study about the seasonal variations in the quality of water in the Pallikaranai Marsh, we found heavy metal contamination around the place where the landfill is located. The presence of lead, chromium, nickel and zinc is significantly huge.”

Now, the issue of bio-magnification cuts closer than we may think. People are known to fish in the Perumbakkam wetland, a spit of a wetland that is cut off from the Marsh but is actually a part of it, and signifies a part of its southern section.

Besides the landfill, there is the problem of sewage and grey water making their way into the Pallikaranai Marsh through its various channels.

“Treated or partially treated sewage water is being let into the Pallikaranai Marsh,” says Palanivelu.

Besides, water from many lakes in the surrounding areas flow into the Pallikaranai Marsh before entering the Buckingham Canal via Okkiyam Maduvu. These lakes being polluted on account of the sewage and grey water that are illegally let into them, they carry the problem to Pallikaranai marsh.

In certain parts of the world, a section of wetlands are used as natural filters for grey water, by growing certain plants that can carry out this filtration process efficiently. Can’t such a exercise be carried out at small outlying sections of the Pallikaranai marsh, with the grey water treated in this manner before being allowed to get into the Marsh? “That is possible only if there is an interface between the catchment area and the wetland. Only in the presence of such an interface can the exercise be carried out without the wetland being affected. That is not the case with the Pallikaranai Marsh. There is no question of an interface anymore. The inflow of polluted water is straight, coming from urban sections that swarm around the wetland. So, we have gone well beyond the stage where we could have earmarked small sections of the Pallikaranai Marsh for such an exercise. Now, given the huge sewage pollution, there is a need to have sewage and effluent treatment facilities at all the inlet points, around the Marsh,” says Ramachandran.

There seems to be a lot of work on our hands. And it is also clear that there is no time to waste anymore.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/luv7xu/article30712045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCMYPRPALLIKARNAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/are-chennais-kidneys-packing-up/article30712047.ece
418,2020/02/01,For that cool ride,"Chennai is entering a new phase of air-conditioned buses, with the recent launch of services on a few routes. With the re-introduction of AC buses by the Metropolitan Corporation, there are certain inevitable questions to be asked. The primary ones are: One, have there been efforts to weed out problems that led to the failure of the first exercise? What are the factors that can make for the success of a public transport exercise?

Those connected with public transport planning and strategising told The Hindu that operational efficiency of any public transport, including AC buses, depends on four key factors — comfort, convenience, pricing and time of travel.

Every city has been facing some challenges in keeping its fleet of AC buses running. Sometime ago, Mumbai was complaining of low occupancy. Bengaluru also has a similar grievance with its Volvo buses said to be making loses and The Hindu reported that the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation is procuring electric buses fitted with air-conditioning, on lease.

Ashish Verma, Associate Professor Transportation Systems Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru, says operational efficiency is not just about the cost of running buses.

The strategy relating to AC buses have to etched differently, because among others, it usually targets a section of people who have the choice of using their own vehicles.

“Unless you provide a compatible, comfortable and convenient service, why will people leave their cars to commute on AC buses?” he says. For this to happen, transport corporations must be able to influence commuters’ travel choices.

Where regular trips are concerned, the service should enable commuters to make these trips faster, says Verma, adding that Bengaluru, for instance, has introduced ‘Bus Priority Lane’ on a section of the city on a pilot basis.

“Unless we introduce bus priority on a mass scale or across a network, commuters will not see much difference in their travel time,” says Verma.

S.A.Vijayakumar, former managing director, MTC, says AC buses must not be viewed in isolation. He says access to bus stops and how passenger-friendly they are, are an important factor in getting a new section of people to patronise bus services.

“Intelligence transport system is very much needed to know real time of buses and also to offer any other information that a commuters looks for before making their journey,” says Vijayakumar.

In the early 70s, he says, a ‘collection incentive’ was introduced to improve efficiency of buses. “I know it’s still there but it is not so attractive for the crew to also play a role in driving the patronage of bus commuters,” says Vijayakumar.

In a report titled ‘Performance of City Bus systems in Major Indian Cities-2017’ by Sai Ratna Chiatnya Gurugubelli, the author says the financial gap can be bridged by taking various measures, including fine-tuning operations, optimising the use of resources and by route rationalisation.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/q3d3jt/article30712018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02DCMYPRACBUSCROWD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/for-that-cool-ride/article30712020.ece
419,2020/02/01,Chennai Corporation finds a sudden rise in the number of homeless people,"The Chennai Corporation has directed zonal officials to start the eviction of homeless people near residential areas.

The Corporation has been receiving complaints from residents about civic issues caused by a rise in the number of homeless people who have encroached upon footpaths, roads and bridges in residential areas of the city. Residents of a high- end apartment complex in Gopalapuram on Peters Road have reported civic issues caused by homeless people on the footpath stretch, who have reportedly migrated from other parts of the country.

“Many homeless people have made the footpaths their home. They came recently. We have found a gradual rise in the number of such encroachments, causing public health problems. They have also started commercial establishments such as eateries on the footpaths. We are unable to walk along the stretch,” said a resident.

Corporation officials have been directed to visit such residential areas this week and plan the eviction of homeless people from the streets.

The civic body is also planning to conduct a study of homeless people in residential areas to offer them rehabilitation and resettlement.

The Corporation has already identified most of the homeless people in commercial areas such as George Town, estimating the number at 10, 000. “A rise in the number of homeless people in residential areas has happened only over the past few weeks. We have to study the reasons for the increase in number of homeless people in residential areas.

420,2020/02/01,Small quantity of water from Chembarambakkam lake being released for irrigation,"Water flowing out of Chembarambakkam reservoir into a channel towards the rear of the water body had raised concerns of local residents. However, the Water Resources Department (WRD) clarified that the water from the lake, which is one of the major storage points for the city’s drinking needs, is being released for paddy cultivation in neighbouring areas.

Spread over 2,316 hectares, Chembarambakkam lake is the largest among the four water bodies used as a drinking water source for Chennai. It now has 1,547 million cubic feet of water against its capacity of 3,645 mcft.

Referring to his post on social media, K. Natarajan, a resident of Kundrathur, said, “I noticed that water is being let out of the reservoir through a small channel on the rear of portion of the lake towards Thirumudivakkam and Sirukulathur for the past 10 days. The department must ensure that there is water for drinking water needs in summer as well.”

However, residents of Chembarambakkam said it was normal for a small quantity of water to stagnate in the irrigation channel that covers areas including Keluthipettai near Kundrathur.

M. Elango, area committee member, Chembarambakkam, CPM, said residents in neighbouring areas use this water for washing. Paddy cultivation is still being done in Sirukulathur and surrounding localities using this water.

“Instead of water being let out regularly and leading to misuse, the Department must regulate water discharge for cultivation and save even small quantities of water from being wasted,” he said.

An official of the WRD said the water discharge was regulated, and was being released for irrigation of 400 acres of land in Sirukulathur and Pazhanthandalam. “As residents still have irrigation rights, about 60 mcft of water is discharged for paddy cultivation in January and March,” he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/53nb22/article30711138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01FEBTH-Chembarambakkamjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/residents-raise-concern-about-water-wastage-from-chembarambakkam-lake/article30711139.ece
421,2020/02/01,Ayanavaram rape case: 15 of 17 offenders convicted,"A special court to try cases under the Pocso (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act, in Chennai, on Saturday convicted 15 of the 17 offenders who were charged with grave offences, including aggravated penetrative sexual assault, on an 11-year-old girl with hearing impairment in Ayanavaram, in 2018. The judge will pronounce the quantum of sentence on On February 3.

An accused was let off and another died during the trial period.

The All-Women Police arrested 17 persons — all of them service staff at the residential apartment where the girl lived with her family. The accused had developed an acquaintance with the victim and reportedly committed aggravated sexual assault and aggravated penetrative assault on several occasions, from January 15 to July 14, 2018.

The prosecution alleged that the child was unable to understand what happened to her, and that she was raped by 17 persons, on several occasions, in a period of six months. The crime came to the notice of the girl’s parents when they took her to a hospital after she complained of stomach ache.

All accused were employed in the apartment complex as lift operators, electricians, plumbers, security guards and gardeners. The apartment association had engaged them through three agencies. Lift operator Ravikumar, 56, is said to have initiated the sexual assault. Other offenders followed him, the prosecution claimed.

The trial was conducted by special public prosecutor N. Ramesh, before special judge R.N. Manjula. One of the accused, N. Babu, died of ill health during trial, and 16 others went on to face trial. On Saturday, amid tight security, the 16 offenders were brought to the court complex, located on the Madras High Court premises. The court conducted in-camera proceedings.

“On the production of the offenders, the special judge, Ms. Manjula, held 15 of them guilty for offences they were charged with, and convicted them, while A.P. Gunasekaran was acquitted. Later, she questioned them about the quantum of sentence to be imposed against them. After recording their individual replies, the judge adjourned the matter to Monday to pronounce the quantum of sentences on them.”

423,2020/02/01,Onion prices drop at Koyambedu market,"The cost of onion, which was ruling high until a few weeks ago, has dipped to ₹35 a kg in the city’s wholesale market. On Friday, most vegetables were priced 30% cheaper, compared to the last month, due to better arrivals and fewer takers.

Fresh arrivals from Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh to the city, over the past few days, have begun to stabilise the price of onions, that hit a record price of ₹160 a kg, last month. The wholesale market in Koyambedu has been receiving about 40 vehicles of onions, daily, since Tuesday. Similarly, small onions are sold for ₹60-70 a kg now — nearly half its price in December.

However, traders note that sales have not picked up since Pongal. Though arrivals to the market and quality of the produce are slowly improving, sales have been sluggish, and have dipped by 20%, as there are not enough takers.

Wholesale prices of many vegetables now remain within ₹30 a kg. A few other staples vegetables, such as potato and tomato, are priced at ₹20 a kg and ₹15 a kg, respectively, due to better yield.

V.R. Soundararajan, advisor, Koyambedu Wholesale Traders’ Welfare Association, said several other vegetables, that are usually costly, such as beans, carrots and ginger, are also affordable. “The market is yet to make brisk sales, as customers are buying less, for want of cash,” he said.

Drumsticks and coconuts, are among the expensive vegetables at the market. While drumsticks are sold up to ₹120 a kg, coconuts are priced between ₹22-34 a piece, as they are out of season. “We are getting drumsticks from Gujarat. We expect the cost to come down by next month, when stock from Tamil Nadu begins to arrive. The same price is set to continue for two more months,” he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/uv0v3n/article30709046.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chennai-Onionjpga,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/onion-prices-drop-at-koyambedu-market/article30707325.ece

A senior Corporation official said the land was given to the club for entertainment and development of women and children, in 1944. But the club was found to be acting against its stated objectives for which the land was allotted.

426,2020/02/01,‘Leather sector will play a key role in achieving $5-trillion economy’,"Mahendra Nath Pandey, Union Minister for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, said the leather industry would play a key role in India’s goal of achieving a $5-trillion economy, and should focus on enhancing the quality of products.

“India’s leather industry is predominantly an MSME-driven sector and is employment intensive, providing jobs to about 4.42 million people, mostly from the weaker sections of the society. Women employment is noticeable in the leather sector, with a 30% share,” he said, inaugurating the 35th edition of the India International Leather Fair, at the Chennai Trade Centre.

The Trade Fair is organised by the Council for Leather Exports, in association with the India Trade Promotion Organization (ITPO) and other apex leather bodies. Over 450 participants, including 150 from abroad, are expected to participate.

Mr. Pandey also urged the leather sector to focus on skill development, while adopting global standards. The leather industry has to bridge the skills gap, which will positively impact and create a multiplier effect in the skill-development space.

He also assured the industry full support from his Ministry and the Centre.

Speaking at the event, M.C. Sampath, Tamil Nadu Industries Minister, and Nilofer Kafeel, Labour and Employment Department, highlighted the key strengths of the State in terms of investment potential.

Mr. Sampath also said that the State government was willing to extend all support to industries.

Rajesh Agarwal, executive director, ITPO, pointed out that leather exports had stagnated at nearly $6 billion in the last five years, and upgrading of skills was the need of the hour for moving to the next level.

P.R. Aqeel Ahmed, chairman, CLE, said the industry was expected to grow 5% in the coming years. He pointed out that Tamil Nadu accounted for 37% of exports.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/leather-sector-will-play-a-key-role-in-achieving-5-trillion-economy/article30707294.ece

428,2020/02/01,"Screening not up to scratch, say flyers","At a time when several airports across the world are meticulously screening passengers for coronavirus, flyers arriving in Chennai airport claim the checking mechanism here is far from satisfactory.

Prasanna Sundar, a 30-year-old working in Shanghai, came to Chennai via Colombo a few days back. He says it wasn't until they were waiting in the immigration line that they were called for health check-up. “Many of us had been waiting in the regular immigration line for over ten minutes and only then did an airport official announce that all passengers from China should form a separate queue. Some passengers would have finished their immigration process and left to claim their baggage by then,” he said.

He said, at Colombo airport, passengers were put through thermal screening as soon as they entered the airport after disembarking from their flight and taking a bus. In the Chennai airport as well, the checking should be carried out much earlier or passengers travelling from China must be instructed to proceed to the place where they get checked as soon as they disembark, he added. Thereafter, they proceeded for thermal screening and other procedures, he said.

Another student Anand P., studying in Tianjin Medical University, echoes a similar experience. Anand who left Tianjin had two transits, one at Macau and another at Bangkok before landing in Chennai. “In both airports, we weren’t checked. When we landed here too, the officer at the immigration counter who saw my passport realised I was from China and asked me to go for a health check. The checking procedure was good, but it would have been nice if someone had guided us,” he added. Officials of Airports Authority of India said, they are following the rules laid down by Ministry of Civil Aviation. “The rules say we have to immediately screen passengers directly arriving from an airport in China. We have been screening passengers rigorously and providing all the support they need. There was only one direct flight from Hongkong which has also been cancelled now. We are strictly abiding by the rules of the ministry and checking passengers,” an official said.

Health Department officials said a protocol had been put in place for screening travellers from China. “Blood samples will be drawn for travellers from Wuhan. For those coming from other parts of China, there is thermal and symptomatic screeningTravellers coming from countries where the disease has spread will be asked if they have any symptoms,” a senior official said. If case of symptoms, they would undergo a preliminary screening and would be advised quarantine for 28 days during which they would be monitored on a daily basis. “They are being asked to fill in self-declaration forms through which we note their information. If they do not have any symptoms, we give them certain advisory for the next 30 days,” the official said.

429,2020/02/01,Court rejects pleas to recite only Tamil verses at Thanjavur Big Temple,"The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday dismissed a batch of petitions that sought a direction to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR and CE) department to conduct the consecration of the Thanjavur Big Temple with the recitation of only Tamil verses.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran observed that the petitions were filed only on the premise that the proposed consecration ceremony and other functions scheduled for February 5, would be conducted by reciting only Sanskrit verses. The petitioners have not placed any convincing proof to support why the consecration ceremony should be conducted and performed only in Tamil language, other than barely mentioning the same, the court said.

The court took cognisance of the counter filed by the HR and CE Department that submitted that the consecration ceremony would be conducted by reciting both Tamil and Sanskrit verses. The counter had stated that prominence would be given to Tamil. The court observed that various rituals and pujas were being done in the temple in accordance with the agama principles. Tamil was given its due place, particularly by chanting Tirumurai.

On the allegations by the petitioners over the distribution of Dhanam and gifts, the court said that each and every worker participating in the function would be receiving it, irrespective of caste or creed. There was no infraction of the Constitutional norms.

“We are of the considered view and opinion that the court should be hesitant and reluctant to interfere with religious functions and ceremonies of temples, unless a strong case has been made out and established that the religious practices and functions of the temples are violative of the provisions of the Constitution,” the court said.

The court directed the HR and CE department and temple management to file a compliance report of the conduct of the consecration ceremony and other functions within a period of four weeks after the event, to the Registry and the same shall form part of the record.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/90iwdm/article30707122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TH-BIGTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/court-rejects-pleas-to-recite-only-tamil-verses-at-thanjavur-big-temple/article30707123.ece
430,2020/02/01,Anti-human trafficking clubs launched in Chennai,"The police department would work with NGOs for “zero human trafficking” in Tamil Nadu. Like drugs and arms trafficking, human trafficking is an organised crime, and is difficult to prevent unless public cooperate with enforcement agencies, said M. Ravi, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP).

Launching the Anti Human Trafficking Clubs (AHTC) on Friday, he said, as per the 2012 statistics, human trafficking cases were high in Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. “But in reality, cases of human trafficking are very less in Tamil Nadu. It is important to prevent and achieve zero human trafficking in the State. We will work with respective NGOs for this,” he said.

Stating that the anti-human trafficking units were already in function in many districts of Tamil Nadu, Mr. Ravi said that 70% of the trafficked victims were sexually exploited, and 70% of the sufferer were women.

“Our aim is to prevent all forms of crimes against women and children,” the ADGP said.

Mr. Ravi also stressed on the need of proactive strategies by the enforcement agencies, and involvement of every organ of the government as the reasons for trafficking are poverty and social backwardness.

P.M. Nair, retired IPS officer and an expert in the subject said that every year, 1.17 lakh children went missing in India. Of them, 41,000 remained untraced, meaning that they were exploited. “If we start working together, all the missing children can be traced,” he told the student members of the AHTC.

Indian Community Welfare Organisation (ICWO), a NGO, plans to form 100 such AHTCs in colleges across the State in the coming six months. The clubs would work within and outside the campuses in creating awareness, rescue and re-integration of trafficking survivors in partnership with district NGOs.

434,2020/02/01,Exotic species seized at Chennai airport,"Several exotic species, including meerkats, fat-tail gerbils, albino pacman frogs, tarantulas, sphynx rats, chameleons and iguanas, were seized from a passenger, by Customs officials at the Chennai airport.

Based on information that such species may be smuggled into the city from Bangkok, Chennai customs officials detained Ibrahim Sha, 38, a passenger who arrived by a Thai Airways flight. On Friday morning, when he was leaving the arrival hall in a suspicious manner, he was held at the exit. The officials questioned him and wanted to checked his baggage.

When his baggage was opened, two plastic containers, a tiffin box and a cake box, hidden along with chocolates and wafers, were found. The containers had rodents and reptiles. The officials questioned him about where he got the animals from and to whom he had to hand them over. The passenger said they were given to him by someone outside the Bangkok airport, and that he had to give it to an unknown passenger who would be waiting for him outside the Chennai airport. Though the officials waited along with the passenger for a while, no one turned up.

Exotic species seized at the Chennai airport.

Later, Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) officials were called in to identify the species. The seized animals include: two meerkats (a carnivore of Mangoose family and a native of Kalahari Desert and Angola), four fat tail gerbils (a native of northern Sahara), one sphynx rat (indigenous to Africa), one albino pacman frog (indigenous to South America), three tarantulas (an African species), one chameleon (indigenous to Africa) and an iguana (indigenous to northern Mexico), a press release said.

435,2020/02/01,Industry expects a rejig in tax rates,"Industries in the State are expecting that the Union Budget will spell out measures to revive the slowing economy and rejig personal income tax rates.

Southern India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) president R. Ganapathi suggested a revised tax slab where income of up to ₹5 lakh would be exempt and income above ₹20 lakh taxed at 30% when compared to the above ₹10 lakh threshold now.

“Another important issue is to create rural demand. SICCI feels the government has to give equal attention to the rural sector which is very much under stress and grew at the low rate of 2% in the last quarter,” he added.

Mr. Ganapathi said giving a boost to the manufacturing sector through corporate tax cut, the task remains to revitalise the rural sector and the government’s help is needed to create non-farm employment by facilitating food processing and other allied industries and more money is needed to revive the farmers’ demand.

Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Ramkumar Ramamoorthy expects the budget to focus on four key areas to turn the economy around, spur growth and drive employment by enabling private sector investments, increasing government spending, facilitating increased exports and increasing savings rate.

“Key to enabling private sector investment is to improve credit availability both for large and small borrowers. MCCI recommends creating specialised term lending institutions for project financing, setting up of a credit guarantee corporation for providing credit enhancement and credit insurance, increasing the scope of Credit Guarantee Scheme to cover all scheduled banks and systemically important NBFCs which will help lending to MSMEs,” he added.

P. Srinivasavaradhan, president, TVS Srichakra Ltd., pointed out that reviving the rural economy could help tackle the current slowdown.

“While the government is taking steps to improve supply of goods and services, we expect the government to take steps to increase the demand by making more liquidity portion available in the hands of consumers,” he added.

438,2020/02/01,"Over 20,000 shops set to lose licence","The Chennai Corporation will stop renewing trade licences for commercial establishments that have illegally linked sewage to stormwater drains.

The civic body will start renewing trade licences from February 1, and complete the process by the end of March. The existing licences issued to commercial establishments, under Sections 279, 287, 288, 299(1), 304 and 309 of the CCMC Act, will expire on March 31.

439,2020/02/01,"A sneeze, a global cold and testing times for China","The Year of the Rat has begun on an inauspicious note for China. A new virus belonging to the Coronavirus family (now named novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV) has claimed over 200 lives in China and the numbers infected have touched 10,000 confirmed cases, as on Friday. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a global emergency, as the outbreak continues to spread outside China. On January 25, China’s President Xi Jinping convened a meeting of the top leadership to underline the seriousness of the outbreak. Chinese authorities have been directed to take whatever steps are needed on an emergency footing to deal with “a grave public health crisis”. However, for Mr. Xi, it is more than a public health crisis; it is a credibility challenge, with both domestic and global dimensions.

At the epicentre

Ironically, the epicentre of the outbreak is the bustling town of Wuhan, China, which also hosts a number of biotech enterprises. Early on, many of the patients in Wuhan are reported to have had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to such markets, which shows that person-to-person spread is occurring.

Normally, coronaviruses is a large family of viruses that are often the source of respiratory infections, including the common cold. Most of the viruses are common among animals and only a small number infect humans. Sometimes, an animal-based coronavirus mutates and successfully finds a human host. Rapid urbanisation that forces animals and humans into closer proximity (as in the “wet market” in Wuhan) creates a perfect petri dish from where such zoonotic outbreaks can originate.

The first official acknowledgement of a new virus outbreak in Wuhan came on December 31 after an outbreak was confirmed. During the past four weeks, the number of those infected and fatal casualties have climbed rapidly. Cases have been reported from different parts of China as well as Hong Kong; cases/suspected cases have been reported from Thailand, Japan, Nepal, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, the United States, France, Austria, Germany, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Singapore. However, about 4,000 Chinese from Wuhan are reported to be still abroad. For India, the most critical is cases being reported in Nepal since India and Nepal share an open border though so far, all tests undertaken in India have been negative. A tweet by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on January 30 said that one positive case of a novel coronavirus patient — a student studying in Wuhan University, has been reported in Kerala. The patient, who is in isolation in a hospital, is stable and being closely monitored.

Decoding the new virus

According to the World Health Organization, during previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus, human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites (objects or materials which are likely to carry infection, such as clothes, utensils, and furniture), suggesting that the transmission mode of the 2019-nCoV can be identical. More significant is the new understanding that the virus is contagious even during incubation, that is even before a patient exhibits any symptoms. This characteristic amplifies transmissibility. It also explains the travel bans across China, and the literal isolation of Wuhan, a city of 11 million and the Hubei province with a population of nearly 60 million.

For China, the timing of the outbreak could not be worse. The Chinese Lunar New Year began on January 24 and normally, it marks a week-long holiday, marked by feasting and travel by large numbers to join their families for the celebrations. Undoubtedly, this movement contributed to the rapid transmission of the disease across China and to many countries before the Chinese authorities cracked down.

Holidays across the country have been extended by three days till February 2 in an effort to stagger the returns. Starbucks and McDonalds have temporarily shut down outlets in Hubei; in Shanghai, Disneyland and in Beijing, the Forbidden City are closed; a number of temple celebrations have been called off to prevent large-scale gatherings. In Shanghai, businesses have extended the holiday period till February 10, except for supermarkets, medical suppliers and public utilities. Hong Kong has drastically cut travel between the mainland and the city.

An earlier outbreak

Comparisons are being drawn the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in 2002-03 which infected around 8,000 patients and claimed nearly 800 lives. SARS is also a zoonotic case, part of the coronavirus family with clues pointing to horseshoe bats in China as the likely source. The first incidents were reported in Guangdong province in November 2002 but WHO was officially informed only after three months though mysterious flu outbreaks were being widely reported. It quickly became more than a public health issue and later, the Chinese health authorities issued a public apology. It was the first case of a coronavirus family virus developing lethal pathogenicity together with high transmission. The global economic loss was estimated at between $30-$100 billion.

This time round, the Chinese government has been more open but the question being asked is whether it has been open enough? The response mechanisms, especially in the early days, evidently fell short, reflective of the the ‘top down’ bureaucratic approach of the Chinese system. The system has kicked in now with the all-of-government approach which characterises the China model. This is embarrassing for the “core leader” Mr. Xi, the author of ‘China’s rejuvenation’ who replaced Deng Xiaoping’s advice of ‘“hide your capability, bide your time” with the mantra “demonstrate capability, assume responsibility and claim rightful place”, implying that China’s time has come. How China manages this challenge will be a test, demonstrating that the Chinese model can deliver when it comes to a crunch and that it is a responsible global player, no longer hesitant about engaging with WHO. For SARS, it took 20 months from the genome sequencing to the first human vaccine trials; for the 2019-nCoV, authorities in the U.S. are working on a deadline of 90 days.

Lessons from Kerala

All this provides an interesting contrast with how the Kerala government dealt with the Nipah virus outbreak in May 2018. Nipah is also zoonotic and made the jump from fruit bats to humans. Though there were 17 deaths in India, effective quarantine measures by local authorities prevented the spread. It helped that health is a state subject. A local doctor took the initiative to contact the Manipal Centre for Virus Research which had worked in the northeast (where Nipah is more prevalent and a 2001 outbreak in Siliguri had claimed 49 lives) and had the diagnostic tools to identify the virus. The State health machinery responded with alacrity with many put under observation. No new case was reported after June and a month later, Kerala was declared Nipah-free and travel restrictions removed. Had the district and State authorities not taken the initiative and only reported matters to Delhi and awaited instructions while Delhi sent teams to prepare plans, the outbreak would have taken a higher toll.

Kerala managed to curtail the Nipah outbreak with few casualties. However, infectious diseases including those of the zoonotic variety are on the rise in India. In addition, regions in India suffer from seasonal outbreaks of dengue, malaria and influenza strains. The nation-wide disease surveillance programme needs to be strengthened.

There is an acute shortage of epidemiologists, microbiologists and entomologists which translates into wasteful delays in diagnostics. Given the growth potential of India’s biotech sector, it is time to put in place a robust public-private partnership model that can transform the health services sector in the country, covering disease surveillance, diagnostic kit availability and accelerated vaccine development.

440,2020/02/01,No to event,"Musician and writer T.M. Krishna’s response to the Kalakshetra Foundation’s abrupt decision to revoke permission to hold the release function of his book only sheds more light on the inane arguments put forth by those in the Foundation (Page 1, “Kalakshetra says no to T.M. Krishna”, January 31). Their reasons only end up giving more credence to what Mr. Krishna tries to highlight in his book — of a Janus-faced approach and hypocritical mindset of some. The ill-advised move of Kalakshetra cuts at the very root of the cherished freedom of expression. We are still aeons removed from that famous line: “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say.”

There is nothing wrong in Mr. Krishna’s defence that the book brings out only the reality of mrdangam makers who have been marginalised for generations. But the writer has exceeded his own brief in his book by unnecessarily including a chapter to take potshots at a community on the ethical aspects of playing an instrument made of skin. Casting aspersions on a community in this manner is totally irrelevant to the cause of marginalised sections that he is trying to espouse in the book.

What if the mrdangam vidwans succeed in finding out an alternative way of making the instrument in deference to his wish, say synthetic, then what would be the fate of these marginalised sections whose very livelihood would be under threat? As a prominent classical singer, he could have tried to find a solution by taking up the case with senior musicians in the field instead of going public. As a government unit, Kalakshetra has made the right decision in disallowing the staging of a function on its premises to prevent communal discord.

441,2020/02/01,Coronavirus ready,"The novel coronavirus has now entered India (Page 1, “Country’s first coronavirus infection confirmed in Kerala”, January 31). It would be very pertinent for the government health agencies and other stakeholders to take the requisite and immediate precautions in preventing its further spread. Existing surveillance and screening mechanisms must be strengthened at vulnerable points. Most importantly, the lessons learnt from the earlier handling of other virulent viruses such as Nipah in Kerala and Zika in Rajasthan should ideally enable India’s health agencies to fine-tune their overall preparedness in handling any possible outbreak. The government must also quickly disseminate awareness bulletins and timely health advisories. In view of the dangerous ramifications of the outbreak, the overall strategy requires structured and effective coordination with the World Health Organisation and other apex medical bodies.

One fails to understand how and why the Ministry of AYUSH issued an advisory suggesting medication to treat the coronavirus infection (OpEd, “A troubling prescription”, January 31). Is it an example of half-baked knowledge at play? Some viral diseases are dreadful, and there are times when all allopathic doctors can do is to maintain vigil using vital data and then attempting symptomatic treatment.

442,2020/02/01,"'Choosi Choodangaane' movie review: A listless narration, held afloat by an effervescent Varsha Bollamma","Choosi Choodangaane is an apt title for a hero who falls in love with the first woman who calls him cute. She dates him for a while and ditches him. He is crestfallen and then another woman walks into his life. They become good friends, but they haven’t expressed their feelings towards each other, so the woman gets engaged. He is heartbroken once again and she is still pining for him but his ego prevents him from admitting his feelings. Misunderstandings deepen and when it gets too difficult, they sort it out and all’s well that ends well.

The story is not so simple as it reads. The plot looks tailor-made for teens or for those in college. The script doesn’t appear to suit the primary cast. When they all look matured and behave and talk in a juvenile manner, nothing keeps you engaged.

Choosi Choodangane Direction: Sesha Sindhu Rao

Cast: Shiva Kandukuri, Varsha Bollamma

The story begins with Siddhu (Shiva), a B.Tech student who falls in love with Aishwarya (Malavika). After three years, the aspiring fashion photographer becomes a wedding photographer and he can’t face the barbs that neighbours throw at him — they keep asking why he hasn’t taken up an IT job. Added to that, we are given to understand that he lacks focus and clarity through a scene of him playing cricket. A scene shows Siddhu as a kid playing cricket and dropping a catch because his focus is on his friend eating chocolate.

It is time filmmakers break such stereotypes to establish a character. Also, a good-looking Shiva is made to wear spectacles and look dumb. Producer Raj Kandukuri who made the super hit Pelli Choopulu, falters in his judgement this time by choosing a routine, listless story. Varsha Bollamma is the only one who, thanks to her prior experience in acting, shows chutzpah. The story is dreary but gets enlivened by Varsha’s effervescent performance. Shiva is a bit frigid and needs to loosen up a bit. Right from the beginning, the way the hero and the heroine fancy each other shows no emotional connect. Something is seriously amiss and that is quite apparent.

We admire Sruthi’s (Varsha) character, but even that gets irritating after a while. The director attempts to blend together various elements but none stands out. The cinematography is very good though. The film looks crisp, but is a painful experience nevertheless.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/j01sdz/article30710606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/choosi-choodangane,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/choosi-choodangaane-review-varsha-bollamma-stands-out-in-an-otherwise-listless-film/article30710607.ece
443,2020/02/01,Kasab’s cell escalates cost of barrack work in Arthur Road,"As most of the funds earmarked 13 years ago for the construction of a barrack in Arthur Road jail here were spent on setting up a high security cell for 26/11 terror attacks convict, Ajmal Kasab, the cost of the project has now nearly doubled to ₹4.49 crore, an official said.

The Maharashtra Home Department this week issued a government resolution (GR) sanctioning funds as per the fresh cost estimate for construction and electrification work of Barrack-1 in Arthur Road prison in central Mumbai.

“The prisons department was sanctioned ₹2.62 crore in the 2006-07 financial year for the ground-plus-one storey structure of the barrack under the central government’s Prisons Improvement Scheme,” an official said on Thursday.

“The funds were sanctioned as per the prevailing rates. However, after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks accused Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab was brought to the prison, priority was given for the construction of a high security cell to lodge him,” he added.

“Most of the funds that were sanctioned for the construction of the barrack were then diverted for setting up the high security cell. With the remaining funds, work for the ground floor of the barrack was carried out,” the official said.

Executive Engineer of Public Works Department (PWD) and the prisons department had submitted a fresh proposal stating the cost of the project has escalated to ₹4.49 crore.

Ten Pakistani terrorists, including Kasab, had launched an attack on key locations in the city on the night of November 26, 2008. The terrorists killed 166 people and injured over 600 others.

While nine of the terrorists were killed during the siege, Kasab was caught alive by the Mumbai police at Marine Drive in south Mumbai.

444,2020/02/01,Godse’s ideology still alive: Maharashtra Minister,"The ideology of Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi, is still alive, Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik said on Friday, a day after one person fired at a group of anti-CAA protesters in Delhi, in which a student of Jamia Millia Islamia was injured.

Mr. Malik, who is also the NCP’s chief spokesperson, said the incident occurred a few days after BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur on Monday egged on participants of an election rally in Delhi to raise an incendiary slogan that “traitors should be shot”.

Alleging that such remarks by BJP leaders were vitiating the atmosphere in the country, the Minority Affairs Minister also called for a probe into the Jamia episode and into the source of the weapon and whether the man was trained to use it.

“The (Delhi) incident took place on the same day when Father of the Nation Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated (on January 30, 1948).

The protest was held near the Gateway of India on Thursday, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

Around 36 protesters, who were wearing T-shirts emblazoned with ‘Who killed Judge Loya?’, took part in the protest that lasted for about 15 minutes.

They also held a banner with the image of Mahatma Gandhi and ‘Satyamev Jayate’ written on it.

“Justice Loya died under suspicious circumstances. Our demand is that the death case must be properly investigated and the government should file a case. A court trial should be held,” one of protesters said.

448,2020/02/01,Kasturba Hospital staff gets a refresher course in infection control,"The novel Coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak in China has prompted civic officials to hold fresh rounds of training for the staff of Kasturba Hospital, the city’s only infectious diseases facility. The hospital, located in Chichpokli, re-activated its isolation facility after patients suspected with exposure to nCoV have been referred to be quarantined since last week.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s Executive Health Officer Dr. Padmaja Keskar said two rounds of training have been conducted for the staff including doctors, nurses, ward boys and other Class IV staff. “Two more batches will be put through the training in the next few days,” said Dr. Keskar. The sessions mainly refreshed their knowledge about infection control measures and etiquette to be followed in the facility, as well as aspects such as how to wear the personal protection equipment such as clothing and masks.

The city had last seen a outbreak of H1N1 virus in 2009 when patients were isolated at Kasturba Hospital. The staff was abreast of quarantine measures back then. “With every new virus, the protocol may be slightly different. The staff needs to be refreshed with how to handle patients, wearing the gear etc. This is not only for patients but also for the safety of staff,” said Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani.

According to Dr. Kakani, Kasturba is the only hospital where all symptomatic patients will be directed for quarantine. While the airport authorities have displayed alert messages at prominent places, travellers have also been mandated to fill self-declaration forms. “For the past one week, we have been checking with passengers of all flights coming from China and Hong Kong to confirm that airlines are making in-flight announcements. Also, to ensure that there is no shortage of self-declaration forms, they have been made available at the health counter prior to immigration,” said a Mumbai International Airport Limited spokesperson.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kasturba-hospital-staff-gets-a-refresher-course-in-infection-control/article30707476.ece
449,2020/02/01,DHFL’s Kapil Wadhawan being tested for swine flu,"Kapil Wadhawan, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) chief managing director, who was arrested in a money laundering case involving gangster Iqbal Mirchi, has been hospitalised and is undergoing tests for suspected swine flu, his lawyer told a special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court on Friday.

His lawyer, Amit Desai, had informed the court that Mr. Wadhawan could not be produced before the Bench as he is undergoing tests. Mr. Wadhawan was admitted to JJ Hospital after he was diagnosed with lower respiratory tract infection and hypertension on Thursday.

Mr. Desai requested the court not to shift Mr. Wadhawan from the ICU to avoid spread of the disease. The court said it will hear his bail plea on Monday.

Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) counsel Hiten Venegavkar did not press for his custody, and special judge Prashant Rajvaidaya remanded Mr. Wadhawan in judicial custody till February 3 or till he is discharged.

Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court on Friday refused to grant interim relief to Mr. Wadhawan on his plea challenging his custody by the ED. A single Bench of Justice A.M. Badar was hearing a plea filed by Mr. Wadhawan through Mr. Desai seeking to quash an order of arrest by ED. Mr. Desai argued that as long as his client is cooperating with the probe, there is no need for arrest.

However, Mr. Venegavkar opposed the plea and sought time to file an affidavit in reply. The Bench will hear the matter on February 11.

Mr. Wadhawan was remanded in ED’s custody on January 29. According to the ED, ₹12,773 crore was siphoned off from DHFL as loans for one lakh fictitious individual customers using 79 firms which were linked to promoters of the company.

450,2020/02/01,"Isolation facility at Kasturba Hospital too weak to handle tough cases, say doctors","A negative pressure room with frequent air conditioning cycle changes, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ultraviolet (UV) lights and an anteroom between the patient’s area and general corridor are some of the basic requirements for a good isolation facility dealing with patients who have contagious infections. But Mumbai’s only government-run isolation facility at the Kasturba Hospital, Chinchpokli, dedicated for infectious diseases, has none of these. With the ongoing deadly outbreak caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus (nCoV) in China, Kasturba Hospital has quarantined eight patients who are feared to have had an exposure to the virus. However, the hospital’s infection control capacity has now become a subject of debate.

Ward number 30 in the hospital has six glass cabins and four side rooms for isolating patients. The ward is equipped with four ventilators and an equal number of multi-para monitors. Officials also said there are adequate stocks of personal protective equipment, N95 masks, medicines and trained doctors and nurses. However, a team from the Centre that visited the facility recently pointed out many problems such as merely one metre between two cots, requirement of capacity building, training of staff and so on.

“A negative pressure room is a must in an isolation facility, and besides HEPA filters and UV lights, walls and floors have to constantly remain dry. This entire system is called an Air Handling Unit, in the absence of which it cannot be termed an isolation facility,” said a senior doctor.

The concerns about the quality of infection control were also raised by patients who have been quarantined for suspected nCoV over the past few days and their relatives. “They insisted that this was the only isolation facility where we could admit the patient. He hardly had any symptoms but we were more concerned that he would get some infection while at the hospital,” said a colleague of a 65-year-old UK citizen who was discharged on Thursday after two consecutive samples tested negative. Some quarantined patients and their relatives have pleaded with the hospital authorities to let them go, others have even quarrelled.

Built in the pre-independence era, Kasturba Hospital was among the few infectious diseases hospitals located in the midst of green areas, where a person with a contagious infection could recover as well as limit the spread of infection. However, over the years, isolated areas such as these have became part of the city centre. “The problem is with our policymakers. These hospitals come into the limelight during an outbreak and remain neglected otherwise. Why can’t these facilities be upgraded and maintained to be ready to face an outbreak?” said another doctor.

A 2003 editorial published in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics said under normal circumstances the State shows very little interest in its infectious disease institutions. “For example, in Mumbai, the municipal corporation-run Kasturba Infectious Disease Hospital has been a victim of neglect for many years. It is ironical that the same system, which completely ignores the health needs of the common man, was remarkably energetic and efficient when dealing with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, as it literally hounded every case with even the slightest suspicion of infection,” it said.

Additional Municipal Commissioner Suresh Kakani said it would be wrong to say that the isolation facility is not up to the mark. “There are two schools of thought when it comes to isolation facilities. One believes that central air-conditioning and closed premises may circulate the infection while the other believes in properly ventilated rooms at the facility located in an isolated area,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/gzu632/article30707461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BMKASTURBAHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/isolation-facility-at-kasturba-hospital-too-weak-to-handle-tough-cases-say-doctors/article30707462.ece
451,2020/02/01,Please feel free to honk if you don’t mind waiting at traffic signals,"In what is being lauded as a witty yet brilliant move on social media, the traffic police on Friday released a video about an experimental initiative that was started in November 2019.

The Punishing Signal campaign involves connecting decibel scanners to traffic signals. When the decibel level exceeds a dangerous 85dB, the signal timer will reset itself, forcing motorists to wait longer at the signal.

Pravin Padwal, Additional Commissioner of Police, Mumbai traffic police, said, “We connected decibel scanners to signals at spots like Marine Drive, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Bandra and Tardeo, where the phenomenon of motorists honking for no reason at red lights was observed in high density. The apparatus was only made operational for 15 minutes on one day so as to not cause major traffic problems and yet help us gauge the reactions of the motorists.”

Mr. Padwal said cameras were stationed beforehand at a couple of locations to record the reaction of people. The reactions were edited and made into a video, which was released on Friday.

The video, which is a collage of visuals with a voice-over, shows the city and its traffic. The voice-over speaks in Hindi with a pronounced Marathi accent. The narrator throws in some Marathi words, which is in sync with the general public’s image of an average policeman.

Honk louder, wait longer

After a few establishing shots, the video talks about the tendency of motorists to honk at red lights even though it serves no purpose and adds to the city’s noise pollution. It then takes the viewers through the initiative and shows the confused reactions of people, till a billboard displays a message saying, “Honk more, wait more”, followed by a scene of two traffic police personnel exchanging high-fives.

“Kashi vatli idea [How did you like the idea]?” says the voice-over before ending with a chuckle.

Traffic police officials said a decision is yet to be taken on whether the initiative will be implemented as a policy. “We are still taking stock of feedback for the experiment and further course of action will be based on it,” Mr. Padwal said.

The tweet was released on Friday morning through the Mumbai Police’s official Twitter handle and remained its ‘pinned tweet’ throughout Friday. “#MumbaiPolice” was among the top trending hashtags on Twitter till Friday night.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ndt9kk/article30707452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMPunishing-signal,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/please-feel-free-to-honk-if-you-dont-mind-waiting-at-traffic-signals/article30707454.ece
452,2020/02/01,Maharashtra State Women’s Commission chief moves SC against Bombay HC order,"Maharashtra State Women’s Commission chief Vijaya Rahatkar has moved the Supreme Court against a Bombay High Court order asking her to step down from the commission now that the government has changed. Ms. Rahatkar, who is also national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s women’s wing, has contended that the position of chairperson is statutory.

Ms. Rahatkar was re-appointed chairperson of the commission once again on February 20, 2019 for three years. In a hearing of a 2013 public interest litigation related to various matters of the commission on December 3, 2019, the HC had observed, “We do not know whether the political appointment made to the post of chairperson of this commission will continue with the change in government. In other words, a new political dispensation has emerged, which has assumed power. That may not like to continue with the present chairperson Ms. Vijaya Rahatkar,” the HC had said.

The court directed the matter to be placed on January 15, by which time it expected a new chairperson to be appointed and a meeting of the commission to be convened. In a hearing on January 22, wherein the HC was told by the State government that it will initiate the process of appointing a chairperson, the HC observed, “The present chairperson is Ms Vijaya Rahatkar. She has not demitted office. Though she is aware that this office is held by her at the pleasure of the government and that she was appointed under the erstwhile political dispensation, she is yet to demit office or resign from the post. We expect the learned AGP to apprise all concerned of the position in law that the chairperson cannot continue and hold the office when the present political dispensation is keen to appoint a chairperson of its choice. We expect that before the next date, we will be informed about the appointment of the new chairperson.”

Ms. Rahatkar has filed a SLP in Supreme Court against the two HC orders. The SLP reads, “Creation of the commission is by way of statute. Therefore, it was incorrect on the part of the HC to make unnecessary observation suggesting removal of the petitioner from the post of chairperson of the commission.”

It further reads, “On one hand, the HC observed that it is not the job and function of HC to monitor such activities in PIL but on the other hand, the HC has suggested removal of petitioner from the post of chairperson.”

The SLP has cited the MSWC Act which provides for removal of chairperson from office but only in exceptional circumstances. The SLP has appealed against the two HC orders and as interim relief, requested for ex-parte stay on these orders.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/maharashtra-state-womens-commission-chief-moves-sc-against-bombay-hc-order/article30707447.ece
453,2020/02/01,MMRDA to revisit alignment of Metro 5 corridor,"The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is reviewing the alignment of Metro 5, which will connect Thane and Kalyan, after PWD Minister Eknath Shinde directed officials to look into the grievances of locals.

“There is a demand to change the alignment in the second phase of Metro 5, which is between Bhiwandi and Kalyan. We are looking into it currently,” R.A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said.

MMRDA officials said in Bhiwandi, the Metro corridor is going over a Muslim burial ground and passing through a congested area, and hence residents want the alignment to be changed. In Kalyan the line is sought to be extended to Birla College via Khadakpada instead of going through old Kalyan.

The 24.9-km-long Metro 5 is expected to cost nearly ₹8,400 crore and expected to ferry around three lakh passengers daily in 2031. The corridor is expected to be completed by December 22, with the State government allocating ₹200 crore in the 2019-20 budget.

The line will be merged with Metro 4, being built between Kasarvadavali in Thane and Wadala.

Work on the first phase of Metro 5, between Thane and Bhiwandi, is under way with civil contracts awarded in August 2019 for the construction of the viaduct and seven elevated stations.

The Metro corridor is expected to bring rail connectivity to Bhiwandi, which is currently accessible primarily by road and has no suburban rail network.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrda-to-revisit-alignment-of-metro-5-corridor/article30707438.ece
454,2020/02/01,Day One of AC local sees chaos at Thane station,"The first day of Central Railway’s (CR) air conditioned service got off to a rocky start with a near stampede-like situation arising for around half an hour on Friday morning. The AC services along with regular services on the trans-harbour line were delayed by nearly 20 minutes during peak hour.

Senior CR officials said, curiosity of passengers led to blocking of the doors that held up the train during its first few runs. “Since the trans-harbour line is a slow corridor with two lines, delay of the AC local had a cascading impact on all other services of the corridor,” a senior CR official said. The AC local runs eight services in the morning and eight in the evening with thefirst train leaving Panvel at 5.44 a.m.

By 8 a.m. services on the trans-harbour line were nearly 20 minutes late, with the crowd surging at Thane station. “When they saw an AC local arrive, many whose trains were late got into the AC local which led to more chaos,” a senior official said.

The CR had deployed nearly 100 Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel of whom 10 were on board the train and 20 were deployed at Thane station. As many as 70 ticket checking staff were also deployed.

“Since it was the first day we did not collect fine from anyone. Instead RPF and TC staff focussed on counselling passengers, advising them not to stand on the footboard as it hampered with the door closing and also to travel with a valid ticket,” Chief Public Relations Officer, Shivaji Sutar, said.

The morning rush left several passengers fuming with many taking to social media to criticise the CR’s lack of preparedness.

“We had informed them that this situation would arise, especially in Thane, which is extremely crowded during peak hour. We had suggested that for a limited period such as ten days, you allow first class pass holders to travel in AC local. It would have mitigated some of the crowd at the station,” Subhash Gupta, Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee member, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v3ey16/article30707427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01BM-Thane-train,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/day-one-of-ac-local-sees-chaos-at-thane-station/article30707428.ece
455,2020/02/01,Protest outside Republic TV office: A journalist relives the ordeal,"“ID card station mein dikhaana ab,” sneered the plainclothes policeman as he pushed me towards a police van. Fellow journalist Shone Satheesh and I were bundled into the van and told to stay off our phones. That we were with the press fell on deaf ears.

Around 10.30 p.m. on Thursday, Satheesh and I were covering the Mumbai Bagh protest in Mumbai Central, when we got to know of another protest in nearby Lower Parel. Republic TV had come under fire for their misleading and provocative reporting on the shooting outside Jamia Millia Islamia that morning, and a call had gone out for people to gather outside the channel’s office in Kamala Mills Compound, Lower Parel.

As I approached, I saw heavy police mobilisation, with several personnel, and a number of vans and jeeps parked outside. A hundred metres away, 15 people were silent and without placards. Two police officials grabbed a young man in a white kurta and skullcap as most scattered away. Another aggressively approached an activist taking a video, and detained him as well.

Along with a couple of would-be protesters, I retreated to a bus stop, hoping to find out where the detainees had been taken. Worli seemed to be the most reasonable destination. By this time, Satheesh had also reached, and that’s when we were picked up.

At Worli police station, we were shown into senior police inspector Sukhlal Warpe’s office. We joined three other detainees, including comedian Aditi Mittal, in the presence of one male and two female police constables. Mr. Warpe was not present. Unlike those at the protest site, these officials were friendly and accommodating, especially after we wrote down our names and address details. When asked why they had detained journalists, the constable refused to answer stating that the Bombay Police Act allowed detention if the police apprehended a threat to public order. Any further questions will only be answered when the senior officer arrived. When some of the other detainees tried to find out about the location of four others — including photographer Anurag Banerjee — who had been picked up by the police, the constables pleaded ignorance. They had been kept in a police car for two hours before being released.

Mr. Warpe finally arrived around 1.45 a.m., two hours after we had been detained. He checked the credentials of the reporters present before telling us we were free to go. He too refused to comment on why the police had chosen to detain journalists despite being furnished with our credentials, only complaining that he was forced to come to the station because of us.

It was 2.10 a.m. by the time we left. The other detainees were also released soon after. Apart from the constables at the protest site, the other police personnel were courteous and respectful. However, this incident does raise concerns about the impunity with which the police often harasses and detains journalists just trying to do their jobs. If the police cannot protect journalists, or bring their killers to account, the least that they can do is not intimidate them as they go about their jobs.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2w2jy0/article30707411.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMRepublic-TV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/a-journalist-relives-the-ordeal/article30707412.ece
456,2020/02/01,Soon travel to BKC on e-bikes,"The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with e-bike sharing startup Yulu to provide last mile connectivity to Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) from Bandra and Kurla railway stations.

“MMRDA is playing the role of facilitator and there is no financial commitment. It is to promote non-motorised green transport,” R.A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said.

The MoU was signed in the presence of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and PWD Minister Eknath Shinde. The e-bike operator will provide 500 e-bikes at 25 different locations in BKC and at Bandra (East) and Kurla (West) stations, where commuters will be able to avail this facility 24x7.

To use the service, commuters will need to download the Yulu app. They will have to pay ₹10 to unlock the bike through the app, and subsequently pay ₹10 for 10 minutes of use. The top speed of the bikes has been capped at 25 km per hour. The bikes are powered by interchangeable batteries, and hence would not need to be recharged at the docking station.

Yulu has been in operation in Navi Mumbai in partnership with the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation for over a year. Hemant Gupta, co-founder and chief of operations at the startup, said they have identified zones in BKC and are aiming to roll out the services in 10 days. “We will start with 20 to 50 bikes and gradually increase the number based on the demand,” he said.

MMRDA officials said the locations within BKC are being reviewed and will be finalised in the coming week.

Mr. Rajeev said the MoU doesn’t mean that Yulu has exclusive rights, and other similar initiatives will also be encouraged in future. The MoU is for three years and will be reviewed annually. The initiative is an outcome of the Station Access and Mobility Program (STAMP) challenge, which the MMRDA conducted along with the World Resources Institute.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v4ka2r/article30707391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01bmUddhavYULUbikes,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/soon-travel-to-bkc-on-e-bikes/article30707393.ece
457,2020/02/01,The return of homely ingredients to restaurants,"Long before Halloween and Thanksgiving became trendy in India and superfoods became buzzwords, the pumpkin was a regular in Indian homes, served as kaddu with puri and often passed off by mothers as potato. Makhana or fox nuts were the unpretentious evening snack and aubergines were simply called baingan, starring in the baingan ka bharta, baghare baingan or begun bhaja that we all knew and relished.

As beloved as they were at home, for decades, eating out meant escaping them. Not any more.

These humble foods have now acquired fashionable status, and staid seems to be trendy, owing to enterprising chefs who have given these ingredients a comeback on kitchen shelves and are using them to jazz up menus.

Diners are lapping it up, owing partly to their health benefits and partly to their intriguing makeovers, in terms of recipe and presentation.

Global trends impact popularity, and chefs unanimously agree. Chef Vineet Manocha, Senior VP – Culinary, Lite Bite Foods says, “Healthy, sustainable and traceable ingredients, is the biggest food trend these days. A successful chef understands his ingredients thoroughly and knows how to create a balance by combining these with other ingredients.”

Anirban Dasgupta, Executive Chef, Hyatt Regency, Pune, elaborates, “Vegetables have by and large come back because we have realised both the importance of eating right, and the imbalance that we are creating to our bodies and the planet by eating way too much meat. And as a chef, vegetables present a wider spectrum of cooking opportunities for me.”

The golden ingredient

Chefs have elevated the status of this rustic, flavour-packed vegetable that was relegated to the background, and pumpkins have finally got their due on menus in India. Roasted pumpkin soup, pumpkin fritters, pumpkin pancakes and pumpkin tarts now stare back at us from several menus, even as gourmands experiment with this vegetable at home.

Stems and leaves of fruits and vegetables have always been a part of our cooking tradition, with a view to curtailing food wastage, as well as imparting unique textures and flavours.

In Bengal, pumpkin skin is fried and used as a side dish, while some restaurants use the skin to add flavour to stock or as crisps to garnish the food.

There are also ingredients that are more surprising. For years, chefs never thought of using the red leaves of choulai or amaranth, grown abundantly across India. Rajgira, the grain of the same plant, is an equal treasure trove, chefs are now tapping. From rajgira puri to rajgira coconut barfi and nachos to rajgira halwa, chefs are exploring the infinite possibilities that this grain presents.

Gouri of Gouri’s Goodies, Mumbai, says, “You’re probably seeing amaranth pop up with increasing frequency, but it has been around for 8,000 years.” She adds, “A source of protein for those who don’t eat meat, it has a great advantage in India with its high vegetarian population. Try roasting or popping it for a bit of crunch, malty sweetness and add it to granola, salads, or even as a crisp coating to meats.”

Augmenting the aubergine

At home, the baingan, termed as aubergine or eggplant on restaurant menus, has acquired star status. Owing to its versatility and texture, it lends itself easily to a lot of cuisines like Middle Eastern and Italian, apart from Indian.

Moringa or drumstick leaves too have been rediscovered by chefs, and from methi moringa ka jhinga to moringa soup, its subtle flavours, now, tease palates. Other ingredients, such as makhanas and millets, have found their rightful place back in kitchens. Rich in protein, with a low glycaemic index, makhanas or lotus seeds, a humble snack or used when one was fasting, is now back in various forms.

Chefs use it to make chaats and chikki and, at home, people snack on peri peri-flavoured makhanas instead of a buttery popcorn.

Chef Vishal Atreya of The Pump House, Bengaluru, acquiesces, “Given the fibre, essential vitamins and antioxidants they provide, these ingredients are indispensable in a kitchen.”

Millets too are seen making a return in an array of dishes. Ragi halwa, is what Chef Atreya proudly serves on his menu. Chef Anirban concurs, “I make a conscious attempt to use ragi, amaranth and jowar at our European Bistro, Zeta, in tacos and sourdough.”

Punjab Grill too, does its share. Chef Vineet lists out, “Amaranth mutton seekh kebab, kathal ke kofte, kali gajar di kanji, bajre di khichadi, ragi te khubani da halwa are some unique dishes we serve using these ingredients, and guests enjoy them.”

Chef Milan Gupta of Taftoon, Mumbai, says chefs have a pivotal role to play in popularising these ingredients. “Although, for years, restaurants and commercial kitchens have stuck to only a few ingredients that they use daily like a formula, things are changing now.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/q91drl/article30710227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPForgottenKurkurikandTaftoonBarKitchenjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/the-return-of-homely-ingredients-to-restaurants/article30710230.ece
458,2020/02/01,A DIY citizenship test to sift out the true Indians,"Suppose a bunch of Indians who went to bed in 1920 were to wake up 100 years later, say this morning, they would go right back to sleep. The first thing they hear would be cries of ‘Azaadi!’ and ‘Inquilab zindabad!’. They would conclude, naturally, that the people of India were still fighting for freedom. If that’s the case, then why not stay put in bed, and wake up only on that bright sunny morning when every Indian would be truly free — free from poverty, hunger, disease, Aadhaar, CAA-NRC?

Sorry folks, that sunny morning ain’t coming any time soon. Get used to it. We have to deal with what we’ve got. And what we’ve got is a citizenship problem. This may be an unpopular opinion, but trust me, the government is right. Be honest. Think about it for a second. How can you be sure, as in really sure, that you are indeed an authentic Indian — and not Mughlai, Chinese, Lebanese or Tandoori — citizen? I can’t.

In my case — and I am being totally frank here — there has always been a part of me that has wanted to be a citizen of a country whose nationality can’t be derived from its name, like ‘Indian’ from India. Or ‘Pakistani’ from Pakistan. So I’ve often dreamed of being Monégasque. A part of my soul is permanently Laotian, while another is obsessed with everything Tuvaluan. Hope you enjoy searching for Monégasquoia, Laotia and Tuvalua on GoogleMaps.

My point is that citizenship is not such a simple thing that we can automatically assume all Indians to be your brothers and sisters. That is why we need the CAA-NRC — to sift out the true Indians from the pretenders. I do believe, however, that there ought to be a cheaper way to conduct the citizenship test. I read somewhere that the government has allocated thousands of crores for a pre-NRC exercise in which you have to provide your father’s birth certificate, grandfather’s address proof, and great-grandfather’s horoscope. All that is unnecessary.

A two-minute quiz

I have a simple solution: a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Citizenship Test that the government can make available online. It’s a two-minute quiz. You respond with ‘Agree’ or ‘Disagree’ to every statement. The answers will reveal whether or not you are an Indian. Lying is not an option because 360-degree surveillance and real time data capture of every aspect of your miserable animal farm existence would ensure that any falsehood would be exposed sooner or later. So here, take the test:

1. On at least 10 of your last 50 trips by air, you were the first passenger in the entire plane to open the overhead cabin, grab your oversized, misshapen baggage and poke a co-passenger in the eye as you dashed to the aisle — all while the seatbelt sign was still on.

2. The first thing you ask when you meet someone is, “What do you do?”

3. You have littered through the window of a moving vehicle on your way to, and return from, Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.

4. What India really needs is a dictatorship.

5. Women should enjoy all equality with men, but within the limits prescribed by Indian culture.

6. You are a custodian of Indian culture.

7. You were born with the knowledge of what ODF stands for.

8. You have gleaned the true meaning of life from the golden words of your favourite billionaire godman.

9. You don’t believe anything you read in the papers unless it comes to you as a WhatsApp forward.

10. There is no difference between India and the government of India.

11. When the people and the government disagree, the government is always right and the people who disagree are anti-nationals.

12. Protests are fine so long as daily life is not affected, all permissions are taken in advance, and the protesters stage their protest in the privacy of their homes.

13. The police who beat up some people are the victims of the people the police beat up.

14. You will joyfully pay ₹295 for a coffee at Barista but will badger the sabziwala for half a kilo of free dhania patta every time you buy 25 grams of onion.

15. A man in uniform can do no wrong.

16. You have paid a bribe, taken a bribe, and joined an anti-corruption march, all on the same day.

17. No matter how much you love India, if you had a choice, you would any day exchange Indian citizenship for the citizenship of the U.S./ U.K./ Australia/ Canada/ New Zealand/ Bahamas/ Bournvita/ Malta.

18. Regardless of your age and sex, you are, at heart, an uncle.

If you answered ‘Agree’ to all the 18 statements, congratulations, you have won an early bird membership in the soon-to-be-implemented NRC. If you answered ‘Disagree’ to even one, don’t panic. An executive will soon contact you with everything you need to know about life in a de-radicalisation camp.",columns,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/4t0edt/article30701340.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02SMINDIANSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/a-diy-citizenship-test-to-sift-out-the-true-indians/article30701341.ece
459,2020/02/01,Mr. Mathrubootham’s life goes up and down like stock market,"Respected Madam/Sir,

Compared to Mr. and Mrs. Mathrubootham life, up and down motion of stock market is jujube. One day up and up, next day collapse.

Three-four days back suddenly my son entered the dining room as if police entering college library. Mrs. M and self were sitting and eating tiffin items calmly and doing small talks. “How are you.” “I am fine.” “Have you seen electricity bill?” “This idli is little bit dry no?” “No.” “Yes, little bit dryness is there Kamalam, just I am giving feedback.” “If you like feedback so much, eat feedback for tiffin.” “OK Kamalam, kindly please put davara down.”

Just like that domestic talks. Suddenly son is coming. Whether you remember? He is working from home every day. Software or insider trading or something. So far police raid not there in house.

He came and said, “Appa-Amma, one very sad news is there.” Immediately, Mrs. M started shouting like anything. “IS IT POLICE CASE KANNA? IS IT HEART PROBLEM? IS IT LOVE MARRIAGE? HOW MANY YEARS I AM SAYING IF BOY IS SPENDING FULL DAY IN FRONT OF INTERNET MEANS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY ONLY. KADAVULAI, DID YOU SAY SOMETHING ABOUT MODI?”

“Amma, what is all this? No, it is different sad news. I have received job offer from company in Bengaluru. Today one meeting is there near Alwarpet signal. If salary is OK means I will find flat in Bengaluru and go there March itself. I have to leave you both alone. I am sorry for this sad development.”

Madam/Sir, Mrs. M and I looked at each other for two-three minutes quietly. It was a very delicate situation. Inside feelings are coming and coming like ‘Aaluma Doluma’ song. But outside we have to put face like VIP people at Gandhi Samadhi. How many years we have been waiting for this manda shiromani to get job in office like normal youths.

Mrs. M put one award-winning sentiment voice and said, “It is OK, kanna! Sometimes career thousand times more important than other issues. Why you’re joining in March? Notice period and all is not there for work from home no? You join immediately?”

“Appa,” my son said, “Say something. Are you in shock?” I said, “Words are not coming for two reasons: one, shock and two, dryness of idli in throat.” Mrs. M put one kick under the table. Then I got up and hugged my son. This is good move for avoiding talks.

In the evening he went for interview. I said, “Kamalam, after son is gone, shall we use his room for one library? Or maybe home theatre?” She said, “No, it has to be bedroom only, when guests are coming whether they will sleep in balcony?” I said, “OK, maybe bedroom-cum-library? Many good designs are there in Internet.” So we spent two-three hours looking at photos. Kamalam said, “I will call carpenter to take measurements.”

Madam/sir, at 5 p.m. carpenter Aravindan is coming. We are discussing and he is giving ideas. At 5.15 p.m. son is coming from interview. “Appa! I have good news! When I saw your dumbstruck face and shock I thought I can never leave family. So during interview I told company, what is need to work in Bengaluru, full office is there at home itself, I will sit and do all the works. Company said, why not, maybe once a month come to Bengaluru for meetings.”

Mrs. M and myself celebrated like anything but fully duplicate sentiment. Meanwhile Aravindan is urgently eating vazhaka bajji then leaving.

Carpenter is gone, library is gone, bajji also gone.

Yours in exasperation

460,2020/02/01,Strike hits banking services,"Banking operations across the Union Territory were severely impacted on Friday with hundreds of employees and officers attached to nine unions joining the two-day nationwide strike called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) in support of demands pertaining to wages and service conditions.

The demands of the unions include wage revision settlement at 20% hike on pay slip components with adequate loading thereof; five-day banking; uniform definition of business hours and lunch hour in branches.

Merger of special allowance with basic pay; scrapping of new pension scheme; exemption from income tax on retirement benefits without ceiling, defined working hours for officers and equal wage for equal work for contract employees are some of the other demands.

A spokesperson of the Pondicherry Bank Employees Union said that the first-day of the strike was total and banking transactions worth ₹200 crore were affected in Puducherry.

Normal banking operations such as cash withdrawals, cheque clearances and deposits in public sector banks were badly affected. The impact of the strike was felt in most of the 300 public sector bank branches in the Union Territory.

462,2020/02/01,"A.P. rivers discharge over 4,400 tmcft into the sea","The unprecedented floods witnessed in Krishna, Godavari and Vamsadhara, three major rivers of the State, had resulted in their discharging a record 4,466.78 tmcft water into the Bay of Bengal in this monsoon year (beginning June 1).

The “outflow” from these rivers into the sea in the last monsoon year (June 2018 to June 2019) was just 2,588 tmcft and the outflow in the monsoon year (June 2017 to June 2018) before that was just 1,149 tmcft. A little over 1,600 tmcft is ususally consumed per annum for various purposes — irrigation, industrial and domestic.

The proper utilisation of floodwater has become the focus of the State government with Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy reiterating the importance of increasing the carrying capacity of the canals to enable quick filling of reservoirs in the Rayalaseema region. Though there were record floods in the three major rivers of the State, the carrying capacity of canals to various reservoirs in the drought-prone districts had become a bottleneck.

CM asks officialsto get cracking

While it required three months to fill medium and minor irrigation reservoirs and tanks that were linked to these on the major rivers, the Chief Minister asked the officials to find a way to fill them in one month.

The State on an average consumes 1,600 tmcft in a monsoon year (MY). A consumption of 1,150.44 tmcft was recorded in MY 2017-18, 1,698.79 tmcft in subsequent year (MY 2018-19) and with still five months to go in this MY a consumption of 1,615 tmcft has already been crossed. Similarly, 992.54 tmcft was utilised for irrigation in MY 2017-18, 1,540.94 tmcft in the subsequent year (MY 2018-19) and 1,513 tmcft in this MY.

The difference in storage which depends on the rainfall of the previous year and the total water in all the major reservoirs also provided an indication on the availability of water, Water Resources Department officials said. The water in the reservoirs increased by 360.96 tmcft at the end of MY 2017-18 and reduced by 28.87 tmcft at the end of MY 2018-19. Because of the repeated floods in the rivers this year, there has been an increase of 1,066 tmcft in this MY (2019-2020) till date, the officials said.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/l0vw0s/article30709382.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01VJDOWLESWARAMBARRAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ap-rivers-discharge-over-4400-tmcft-into-the-sea/article30709383.ece

465,2020/02/01,AU students stage demonstration against hike in examination fee,"Students of Andhra University led by the Greater Visakha City Committee of Student Federation of India (SFI) staged a demonstration near the Administrative Block, seeking withdrawal of the hike in examination fee.

The protesters squatted near the Administrative Block till late in the night seeking solutions to sanitation issues in hostels, delayed release of scholarships and other issues. Students from various departments, especially girls in large numbers, raised slogans against Vice-Chancellor P.V.G.D. Prasad Reddy and Registrar V. Krishna Mohan.

They alleged that that university administration never showed any concern for their issues of students.

“The examination fee has been hiked by almost 40% and the decision was intimated to the students. The hostels reek of poor sanitation and students are being served food of poor quality. Three students have been accommodated in the hostel rooms meant for one student. We get at least ₹1,000 of electricity bill per month for a fan and a light. The university collects ₹300 from each students,” said a student who is living in the Boys’ Hostel of AU.

‘Scholarships delayed’

Many students also pointed out that scholarship money was not being released regularly. Several students alleged poor infrastructure in the hostels.

“We staged a protest against the fee hike two days ago. On that day, the Registrar promised to find a solution after discussing it with the Vice-Chancellor. Even though the V-C is present in the campus, no official has responded yet to our demands. We have decided to take up a massive protest,” said AU SFI president A. Gowtham.

Mosquito menace

meanwhile, the girl students of AU Women’s Hostel staged a protest over mosquito menace. They alleged that despite repeated requests, the issue still lingered. They blamed poor sanitation for the death of a second year political science student, Blessy.

“The hostels are infested with mosquitoes. Though thousands of girls live here, not a single medical staff is available to care. We need to rush to dispensary in case of medical emergency,” alleged a student.

Many students alleged that when they brought the issue to the notice of the Registrar, “he did not respond”. “After death of Blessy, the AU officials sprinkled some chemicals.

470,2020/02/01,Kejriwal will waste taxpayers’ money on feeding protesters biryani: Adityanth,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday alleged that his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal would waste taxpayers’ money on “feeding biryani” to protesters sitting on dharna at Shaheen Bagh.

At a meeting in support of the BJP’s Karawal Nagar and Mustafabad candidates, Mohan Singh Bisht and Jagdish Pradhan, Mr. Adityanath accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) of being the “worst” among the “political blackmailers operating in the country”. The AAP and Mr. Kejriwal “wanted” protests like Shaheen Bagh, he said.

“When Kejriwal is not getting support from the people of Delhi, he is getting support from a minister from Pakistan...The AAP is the worst example of the political blackmailers operating in this country. They [AAP] don’t want good quality roads, water, the expansion of the metro — all they want is Shaheen Bagh...you have to decide whether you want all round development or Shaheen Bagh... he will waste taxpayers’ money on feeding them biryani,” he stated.

Not only had Mr. Kejriwal not delivered on his promise of ending corruption in the city, his own ministers were found to be corrupt, he alleged. He also accused Mr. Kejriwal and the Congress of being “stumbling blocks” when it came to “significant developments” such as Ram Mandir and the Nirbhaya case.

“I’m amazed at the fact that five years ago, the AAP under Kejriwal said that we will form a Lokpal to tackle corruption, and here most of his ministers have cases of corruption against them... Mr. Kejriwal is responsible for the smog everyone in Delhi is forced to breathe.

472,2020/02/01,"This is not a novel: Review of ‘Hassan’s State of Affairs’ by Mirza Athar Baig, trs Haider Shahbaz","Mirza Athar Baig has emerged as one of the most significant Urdu fiction writers from Pakistan in the last one decade. His debut novel, Ghulam Bagh, came out in 2006 and he hasn’t looked back since. His third novel, Hassan ki Soorat-i-Haal, published in 2014, has now been translated into English as Hassan’s State of Affairs by Haider Shahbaz, a university teacher in Lahore.

Hassan is the protagonist here who travels from youth to old age in the course of the novel. But his story doesn’t have a definitive ending — it remains open-ended and subject to various interpretations. Hassan has a habit of looking out of his vehicle at life along the roadsides as he travels to and from office. Going beyond appearances, he starts weaving stories to match the fleeting images.

The other main characters are a group of amateur filmmakers trying to make a film titled This Film Cannot Be Made; a junkyard owner and a collector, both of whom have a penchant for collecting useless objects; and a professor whose family has sold his manuscript as junk by mistake.

An air of surreality surrounds the plot and characters and Baig pulls off this feat with aplomb. Baig had once told me in an interview that he has stretched this narrative approach to the breaking point in this novel, which also contains elements borrowed from film and theatre.

Many situations can easily be seen as metaphors for what is happening in societies of Pakistan and India. But what keeps the reader hooked is the humour. Baig is lucky to have found an able translator who has expanded the scope of meanings and added rather apt titles to chapters.

Baig, in his own words, has “thrown a challenge to the reader” with a novel that can have many dimensions but not necessarilya a typical storyline.

The reviewer is a journalist and poet based in Lahore.

473,2020/02/01,"In a tower without a staircase: An extract from the inaugural issue of B.R Ambedkar’s journal, ‘Mooknayak’","Mooknayak (The Leader of the Mute), the first journalistic venture of Babasaheb Ambedkar, was a fortnightly newspaper he started in 1920 with the patronage of his mentor, Shahuji Maharaj. Ambedkar’s aim in launching this journal was to put forward his own point of view on matters such as Swaraj, the education of the ‘untouchables’, and the evils of untouchability, which had hitherto not found due representation in mainstream Hindi journals.

Mooknayak remained in circulation for three years. This is an excerpt from the editorial of the inaugural issue, of Muknayak, which appeared on January 31, 1920.

If anyone were to take stock of the sum-total of all the elements, of human as well as non-human origin, which constitute the fabric of our nation, it would doubtless be revealed that India is most distinguished by the many disparities which characterise its composition. Among these disparities the most shameful is that which manifests itself in acute inequalities in material standards of living.

Although Indians stand divided by many kinds of differences, the differences in religious affiliation are potentially more dangerous than those stemming from physical or intellectual factors. Often the differences on the basis of religion find expression in such extremities of conduct that they are the cause of bloodshed. The distinctions between the Hindus, the Parsees, the Jews, the Muslims and the Christians, and various other denominations, take diverse forms, but close scrutiny bears out that the stark hiatus between Hindus of different orders is both as reprehensible as it is incredible.

If a European is asked who he is, the answer provided by him, indicating his nationality — English or German or French or Italian — as it may be, will be enough to resolve the matter. The same cannot, however, be said about Hindus. The statement, “I am a Hindu”, satisfies nobody. It is necessary for a Hindu to declare his caste in order to spell out his specific identity.

A page from the Hindi translation of ‘Mooknayak’ by Sheoraj Singh Bechain | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

The castes which constitute the so-called Hindu community are arranged in hierarchical order. Hindu society is like a tower, each floor of which is allotted to one caste. The point worth remembering is that this tower has no staircase and therefore there is no way of climbing up or down from one floor to another. The floor on which one is born is also the floor on which one dies. No matter how meritorious a person from a lower floor might be, there is no avenue for him to climb up to the upper floor. Likewise, there is no means by which a person entirely devoid of merit can be relegated to a floor beneath the one to which he has been assigned.

The inter-relationship between castes is not founded upon the logic of worth. However unworthy an upper-caste person might be, his status will ever remain high. Similarly, a worthy lower-caste person will never be allowed to transcend his lowness. Because of the strict taboos against inter-dining and inter-marriage between members of lower and upper castes, the respective caste bodies are destined to remain always already segregated from each other. Even if bonds of intimacy are kept outside of consideration within the realm of caste relations, there is close surveillance of possibilities of contact which might transgress caste laws. While some castes are permitted limited mobility within the caste structure, some other castes, branded ‘impure’, are denied such movement altogether. The latter are the ‘untouchable’ castes whose ‘impure’ nature poses a threat of contamination to all caste Hindus.

At the pinnacle of the caste hierarchy are the Brahmins who regard themselves as the Gods of the earth. All other men and women have been born to serve them, or so they seem to believe. Hence they feel absolutely entitled to claiming the devotion of these subordinates. The Brahmins are convinced that they have earned their dues by their authorship of the sacred scriptures of the Hindus, notwithstanding the illiberal lessons which are preached through these texts.

The non-Brahmins, on the other hand, have remained backward due to lack of possession of adequate property and education. But their backwardness does not necessarily entail the misery caused by total deprivation because they have never lacked the means of subsistence obtainable from agricultural and industrial occupations, trade and commerce and other employment opportunities. The worst victims of social discrimination have been the outcastes who find themselves impoverished, weak and lacking in self-esteem, and thus it is their sorry plight which needs to be consciously highlighted. Their only redemption lies in their self-emancipation from their chains of bondage, a process which has now happily begun.

Unfortunately, there is yet hardly any institutional forum of communication, any media resource, which is yet prepared to foreground, frankly and fearlessly, the numerous problems which beset the outcastes. There are, no doubt, a few newspapers and journals which raise issues connected with the due need for resolution of the problems facing the so-called lower castes, but none of these really give exclusive attention to the question of the rights of the ‘untouchables’. It is for the purpose of filling up this void that the periodical called Mooknayak has been planned and put into circulation.

474,2020/02/01,‘The Indian population is a result of four migrations’: Tony Joseph,"The new understanding of global migrations has upended much received wisdom, says Tony Joseph, author of Early Indians, which is shortlisted for The Hindu Prize for Non-Fiction. An excerpt from a short interview:

Why has it been possible to write a book like Early Indians now and not earlier?

Over the last five years or so, we have gained far greater clarity into how different population groups formed across the world as a result of ancient migrations. This applies to Europe, the Americas, East Asia or Central Asia as much as to South Asia or India. This has happened mainly because in recent years, population geneticists have acquired the ability to extract and analyse DNA

from the bones of people who lived thousands or tens of thousands years ago. Now we know which ancient population groups moved where and when. These new findings fit each other like pieces of a global jigsaw puzzle, and they are also in harmony with the latest discoveries from other disciplines such as archaeology and linguistics. It is because the book is based on findings that have resulted from the latest advances in technology across disciplines, including population genetics, that it could not have been written earlier.

Where do population groups in India draw their genes from?

Most population groups in the world used to assume that they have always been where they are today, and that they are ‘pure’ in some sense. The new understanding of global migrations has upended this received wisdom. All populations that exist today are the result of mixing between prehistoric/ historic migrant groups. Therefore, there is no such thing as race or genetic purity.

The Indian population, for example, is the result of four major migrations. First, Out-of-Africa migrants who reached here around

65,000 years ago, whom my book calls the First Indians. Second, a population related to the farmers of Iran who were in the northwestern region from around 12,000 years ago and who mixed with the First Indians and together created the agricultural revolution that resulted in the Harappan Civilisation.

Third, a migration from East Asia around 4,000 years ago that brought Austro-Asiatic languages such as Khasi and Mundari to India. And last, central Asian Steppe pastoralists from regions now known as Kazakhstan who brought Indo-European languages to India 4,000 to 3,500 years ago and called themselves Arya. Almost all population groups in India today are a mixture of these four components, in differing proportions.

What are some of the ‘facts’ that have been proved wrong?

The understanding that our present demography is the product of four migrations leads to many surprising conclusions. For example, we now know that the Harappans are the ancestors of both north Indians and south Indians because when their civilisation declined around 3,900 years ago, they spread across the country, carrying their genetic and cultural heritage.

You could, therefore, say that the Harappan Civilisation is what holds us together, and is the fountainhead of our culture. Second, the language of the Harappans, most likely proto-Dravidian, continued to thrive in south India but was overlain by Indo-European languages when the Steppe pastoralists arrived in the north later.

Third, between around 4,000 years ago and 2,000 years ago, there was a great mixing between groups with different migration histories that left no Indian population group untouched (except perhaps the Andamanese). Fourth, endogamy, or the practice of people marrying within their own groups, began only around 2,000 years ago, which suggests that the caste system did not begin with the arrival of the Arya but was the result of political developments around the beginning of the Common Era. Fifth, almost all population groups of India carry 50-65% of their ancestry from the First Indians, no matter where in the caste hierarchy they stand, what language they speak, which region they inhabit or what religion they belong to.

475,2020/02/01,"A window for the weird languages: For Indian language publishers, the times are changing","For Indian language publishers, the times are changing — in some ways, for the better. This is not about the technological shifts, bridging the digital divide etc,. which have been endlessly discussed.

I am a regular visitor to international book fairs that focus on the business of publishing. A key aspect of such fairs is selling and buying of translation rights. Buying rights can be quite easy if you have the money. But to find a buyer for your list is tough. When it comes to Indian languages (often slotted under ‘weird languages’ in the West) it is more challenging than finding Mackenna’s gold.

One has to ping, persist, stalk and employ militant non-violence to even get an appointment with a representative of a major publisher. Over the last decade I have done all of the above — and more — with limited success. But now the bamboo curtain across translated writings appears to have lifted. We got a few walk-ins to our stall in last year’s Frankfurt Book Fair offering to consider our titles for translation. Many ‘selling-to-us-meetings’ also turned into ‘buying-from us’ meetings. Publishers are more conscious now of presenting a diverse list, and this has opened a window for Indian language publishers to pitch their works.

Door to the world

Some Indian language writers and writings have received international exposure. Vivek Shanbhag, Ambai, Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay, Rajathi Salma, Geetanjali Shree and Perumal Murugan are among the contemporary writers published (or signed to be published) outside India by noted imprints. Some modern classics like The Aunt Who Wouldn’t Die (Bangla, Shirshendu Mukhopadhyay), The Tale of the Missing Man (Hindi, Manzoor Ahtesham), The Walls of Delhi (Hindi, Uday Prakash) and Tamarind History (Tamil, Sundara Ramaswamy) are either published or to be published, internationally. A door to the world has clearly opened. But how long will it last? Are there enough Indian language publishers taking rights trade seriously?

In India, my publishing house Kalachuvadu, based in Nagercoil, is located as far away as possible from New Delhi, the publishing capital of our country (as Nagercoil is at the southern tip, I once put up a cheeky poster in Frankfurt that read “Kalachuvadu, the last outpost of Indian publishing”). I stepped into the world of Indian publishing in 2002, so to speak, at the New Delhi World Book Fair. The fair used to be held on alternate years those days. I continued to go to the fair over the next 10 years without harbouring any illusions of making a profit from book sales there. One does not do costing for a window to the world.

When I could get some time away from my stall, I went to meetings and seminars that often happened in the fairgrounds but sometimes outside of it too. Standing in the shadows of the walls, I would observe and absorb everything. In the book fair ground, I was excited to see books sold in about 26 Indian languages, and I would compare the content, printing, production and pricing with Tamil books.

Hallowed halls

But in those hallowed halls where mostly English publishers, editors and intellectuals gathered to discuss Indian publishing, Indian publishing was tantamount to Indian English publishing. Hindi, that spoilt brat of the Indian state, was mentioned now and then. All the other languages were as good as non-existent. Especially when it came to representing Indian publishing to delegations of Western publishers, English publishing became omnipotent and omnipresent. Even today in lit fests, publisher’s forums and conferences, Indian publishing is often merely an euphemism for Indian English publishing.

Topic: Women in Indian publishing. Read: Women in Indian English publishing. Topic: The challenges before Indian indie publishers. Read: As before. Fact? An overwhelming number of publishers of Indian languages are indie publishers and dominate their markets. Here, one should rather discuss the challenges confronting corporate publishers as they enter Indian language markets.

Adversary & ally

English can be an adversary and an ally. Sweeping as it does the entire battalion of Indian language publishing under the carpet, it is a formidable opponent. But when you wish to navigate beyond the ecosystem of your own language, it can be a useful tool. I understood early on that unless one negotiates with English publishing in India, a Tamil publisher can never hope to step into the international publishing sphere.

For many language publishers of the world, rights sales begin when they publish a book. Not so in Indian languages. Without a well translated and edited English text, there is no point in pitching regional books to other languages, including other Indian languages. The translation might happen directly from the source languages, but the acquisition editors can decide to buy only by reading the English translation.

So, the first step would be to sell rights to an English publisher. This can happen in two ways. If you are lucky, there might be an editor in an English publishing house who can read the Indian language text in the original and decide, or one may have to present sample translations. Few years down the road, after the publication of the English version, if the book has the potential to travel outside India, one can include it in the rights catalogue and present it at international fairs.

So it is an uphill task. But it does have the potential to bring in some additional income. In times like these when the economy is in the doldrums and books sales are low, rights trade can lend some support to the publisher and the author. Rights sales can bring some distinction to the profile of the publishing house. Selling rights is a steep but exciting learning curve, one that needs to be negotiated with some business acumen and a lot of passion.

476,2020/02/01,Foreheads with a view: Review of André Aciman’s ‘Find Me’,"The Portuguese poet, Fernando Pessoa, is known for his ‘heteronyms’ — his term for the 75 distinctive authors of different genders, thoughts, feelings and languages he created and under whose names he published his poetry, criticism and philosophical writing. Find Mehas four chapters — ‘Tempo’, ‘Cadenza’, ‘Capriccio’ and ‘Da Capo’ — each referring to four different musical movements. And in each, the four main characters of different ages, whose lives and loves get entangled in a not-so-complex plot, narrate in first person singular how they gravitated towards each other in inexplicable ways.

Perhaps, as one of them explains, it was all in the stars. The first voice is that of an ageing academic who falls for a woman half his age whom he meets in a train. His son, Elio, is a pianist, whom the couple meet before the chapter terminates. The second voice is that of another ageing academic, who inevitably falls for Elio, and his passion is reciprocated by the young pianist. Together, they unearth the truth about a mysterious musical composition that connects them with dark familial secrets.

Elio, meanwhile, feels the stirrings of desire for his first love, Oliver, a college professor, now married and with children of his own, whom he had met in his teens. Oliver is the third voice, who probably through telepathy, reaches out across the continents to Elio. The fourth and final voice is Elio’s, and quite predictably, Oliver has flown all the way from America to join him in old Europe and its picturesque cities, where all the main characters kind of walk into the sunset, never mind the inevitable deaths.

Unlike Pessoa’s heteronyms, all four voices are unmistakably Aciman’s. For all their pretensions to high culture, they spout nothing but words that signify nothing. Sample: “Above all I liked her forehead... which hinted at thoughts I couldn’t put into words but wanted to know better...” For those who have not caught on yet, this is the sequel to Aciman’s Call Me by Your Name, on which the 2017 eponymous film was based. The characters are prone to philosophising about life and death, but it is much too anodyne to be affecting. To borrow an expression from Aciman, it’s all written in “pale sepia ink”. Like dewdrops, it could evaporate in sunshine.

The author is a heritage and culture writer from Kolkata.

477,2020/02/01,Little moments from married life: Illustrator Alicia Souza on her debut book Dearest George,"There are some works in literature and art that supply the comfort of a fleece blanket on a wintry night. Many children’s comics fall into this category. Alicia Souza’s artworks do too even as they aren’t necessarily for kids. Even sadness appears sweet in her cartoons about her daily life, which usually involves three characters — her husband, George; her dog, Charlie Brown, and her guinea pig, Henry Oats. The sweet, semi-autobiographical comics have garnered a considerably big fanbase for her — her follower count on Facebook currently stand at 1,41,000-plus. Alicia, who had collaborated with Chumbak, now has her own brand. In her first book, Dearest George (published by Penguin), she talks about marital life through her experiences, using her signature illustrations.

Alicia discusses the book, her craft, her idea of love and more.

Excerpts:

Is Dearest George entirely autobiographical?

Well, it is about daily incidents. But not all of them have happened exactly the way I have illustrated it. It is not purely autobiographical in that sense. But they are inspired from moments in our relationship.

How long did it take for you to finish the book?

It didn’t take long. I already had a lot of drawings (which she had posted on her website, aliciasouza.myportfolio.com, and the now-defunct website, dearestgeorge.com, which she created last year to announce her wedding). I got a massive response to the cartoons. So, I thought I must compile them. Penguin had wanted me to illustrate another book. That is when I pitched the idea for this book.

Is the book a deliberate attempt to talk about how the romance between two people changes after marriage?

No, it is not. I have been drawing about life around me. The book is just an extension of that.

What is your idea of being in love?

I think it should be easy and not an effort. That is the gist of it.

There is an effortlessness about your cartoons. Do you practise every day?

I don’t think [drawing] is a talent; it is a skill. I wasn’t a born artist. No one in the family was one. I didn’t know an illustrator for a long time. It was hard when I started. I didn’t think it would work out. But you have to keep working on it. I start early in the morning. I work till about 3.30 pm on client projects. Then, I do a bit of housework. Then, I get back to my desk to work on personal projects. I am very diligent with work. And, you can be an illustrator by drawing just stick figures. It is about how you communicate a message through drawing.

There are perhaps many artists who don’t know how to market themselves or their products. Do you have suggestions for them?

Everyone starts on the same page. But we are living in a time when there is so much information available on how to market yourself, which can also be a problem. And, the hardest bit is not about knowing how to do it but just to do it. My suggestion is to be super strict with yourself. It has worked for me. You will face a lot of struggle initially — that’s the case with anything. But take it as a part of the process and not as a horrible experience.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/axwwlc/article30712873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bgm-Alicia1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/little-moments-from-married-life-illustrator-alicia-souza-on-her-debut-book-dearest-george/article30712876.ece
478,2020/02/01,"Author Mary Higgins Clark, known as ‘Queen of Suspense’, dies at age 92","Mary Higgins Clark, the tireless and long-reigning “ Queen of Suspense”, whose tales of women beating the odds made her one of the world’s most popular writers, died Friday at age 92.

Her publisher, Simon & Schuster, announced that she died in Naples, Florida, of natural causes.

“Nobody ever bonded more completely with her readers than Mary did,” her longtime editor Michael Korda said in statement.

“She understood them as if they were members of her own family. She was always absolutely sure of what they wanted to read — and, perhaps more important, what they didn’t want to read — and yet she managed to surprise them with every book.”

A widow with five children in her late 30s, she became a perennial best-seller over the second half of her life, writing or co-writing A Stranger Is Watching, Daddy’s Little Girl and more than 50 other favourites.

Sales topped 100 million copies and honours came from all over, whether a Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters in France or a “Grand Master” statuette back home from the Mystery Writers of America.

Many of her books, including A Stranger Is Watching and Lucky Day, were adapted for movies and television.

She also collaborated on several novels with her daughter, Carol Higgins Clark.

Mary Higgins Clark specialised in women triumphing over danger, such as the besieged young prosecutor in Just Take My Heart or the mother of two and art gallery worker whose second husband is a madman in A Cry in the Night.

Mary Clark’s goal as an author was simple, if rarely easy: keep the readers reading.

“You want to turn the page,” she told The Associated Press in 2013.

“There are wonderful sagas you can thoroughly enjoy a section and put it down. But if you’re reading my book, I want you stuck with reading the next paragraph. The greatest compliment I can receive is, ‘I read your darned book ‘til 4 in the morning, and now I’m tired.’ I say, ‘Then you get your money’s worth.’”

Her own life taught her lessons of resilience, strengthened by her Catholic faith, that she shared with her fictional heroines.

She was born Mary Higgins in New York City in 1927, the second of three children. She would later take on the last name Clark after marriage.

Mary Clark’s father ran a popular pub that did well enough for the family to afford a maid and for her mother to prepare meals for strangers in need.

But business slowed during the Great Depression and her father, forced to work ever longer hours as he laid off employees, died in his sleep in 1939.

One of her brothers died of meningitis a few years later. Surviving family members took on odd jobs and had to rent out rooms in the house.

Mary had always loved to write. At age 6, she completed her first poem, which her mother proudly requested she recite in front of the family.

A story she wrote in grade school impressed her teacher enough that Mary Clark read it to the rest of the class.

By high school, she was trying to sell stories to True Confessions magazine.

After working as a hotel switchboard operator (Tennessee Williams was among the guests she eavesdropped on) and a flight attendant for Pan American, she married Warren Clark, the regional manager of Capital Airways, in 1949.

Throughout the 1950s and into the ‘60s, she raised the children, studied writing at New York University and began getting stories published.

Some drew upon her experiences at Pan American. One story which appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, Beauty Contest at Buckingham Palace, imagined a pageant featuring Queen Elizabeth II, Jackie Kennedy and Princess Grace of Monaco.

But by the mid-60s, the magazine market for fiction was rapidly shrinking and her husband’s health was failing; Warren Clark died of a heart attack in 1964.

Mary Clark quickly found work as a script writer for “Portrait of a President,” a radio series on American presidents.

Her research inspired her first book, a historical novel about George and Martha Washington.

She was so determined that she began getting up at 5 am, working until nearly 7, then feeding her children and leaving for work.

“Aspire to the Heavens” was published in 1969. It was “a triumph,” she recalled in her memoir Kitchen Privileges, but also a folly.

The publisher was sold near the book’s release and received little attention. She regretted the title and learned that some stores placed the book in religious sections.

Her compensation was $1,500, minus commission.

479,2020/02/01,Human-to-human transmission in Wuhan started in mid-December,"As on January 31, the number of confirmed cases of novel coronavirus in mainland China reached 11,791 and deaths reached a toll of 259. China’s Hubei province alone, where the city of Wuhan is located, reported 7,153 confirmed cases and 249 deaths on Friday. On January 31 alone, totally 2,102 new, confirmed cases and 46 deaths were reported from mainland China.

The very high number of confirmed cases reported just a month after the World Health Organization was intimated and the continued increase in the number of new confirmed cases each day strongly suggest that human-to-human transmission had begun long ago. There are more reasons to believe so, as the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was shut down on January 1. This market is considered to be the main source from where the virus had infected people working there or those who were frequent visitors.

According to the WHO, as on January 12, China had reported no clear evidence that the virus can spread among people. This was based on the premise that of the 763 people, including medical staff, who had come in close contact with patients infected with the virus had not become infected themselves.

Spreading even in mid-December

Now, a study of the first 425 people with confirmed infection with the novel virus that were reported by January 22, strongly suggests that human-to-human transmission had “occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019 and spread out gradually within a month after that”. The study was published on January 29, 2020 in The New England Journal of Medicine.

“The majority of 425 cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases,” they write. This would mean that the remaining 45% cases came through human-to-human transmission.

The mean incubation period for the 425 cases was 5.2 days and in its “early stages, the epidemic doubled in size approximately every 7.4 days in Wuhan”, they note.

CDC China denies withholding info

On February 1, China Daily reported CDC denying withholding information on virus spread. According to a CDC statement, the “conclusion [by the NJEM authors] is a deduction based on a retrospective study that looks back on epidemiology research of infected cases, reaffirming that the risk of the virus spreading among people was not discovered at the onset of the outbreak in December.”

China Daily also said that the “information about the 425 cases analysed in the paper, including infections of 15 medical workers, had already been released to the public before researchers conducted the study.”

First case of human spread

On January 15, Japan had alerted WHO of a person infected with the novel virus, who had returned from Wuhan. According to the WHO, the person had not visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or any other live animal markets in Wuhan. In fact, he had come in “close contact with a person with pneumonia”.

It was only on January 17 that WHO reported of a possible human-to-human transmission. In a tweet WHO said: “The fact that some cases do not seem to be linked with the Huanan seafood market means we cannot exclude the possibility of limited human-to-human transmission.

The January 17 disease outbreak news put out by WHO clearly suggest that it was not certain that human-to-human transmission was taking place. It said: “Preliminary investigations have identified environmental samples positive for novel coronavirus in Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan City, however, some laboratory-confirmed patients did not report visiting this market… Additional investigations are needed to determine how the patients were infected, whether human-to-human transmission has been observed.”

Strangely, even on January 17, the number of confirmed cases stayed the same, at 41, ever since China reported the outbreak to WHO on December 31.

According to Qun Li from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing and the first author, as on January 4, each infected person was spreading the infection to 2.2 other people (R0 is 2.2). An epidemic will continue to increase till such time the ability to spread infection is greater than one (R0 is greater than 1). The R0 was 3 in the case of SARS.

The authors say that since January 4 there has been increased awareness and more testing and increased control measures in Wuhan. All these would have reduced virus transmissibility. “But the detection of an increasing number of cases in other domestic locations and around the world suggests that the epidemic has continued to increase in size,” they write.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nid108/article30712156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02SCICHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/human-to-human-transmission-in-wuhan-started-in-mid-december/article30712157.ece
480,2020/02/01,How bats harbour several viruses yet not get sick,"Bats serves as natural hosts for numerous viruses including Ebola virus, Nipah virus, coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the 2019 novel coronavirus that has infected nearly 10,000 people and killed over 200 others. Even as these viruses cause harm in humans, they rarely if at all cause any harmful effects in bats. This is the case even when the viral load is extremely high in bats.

A study carried out last year and published in the journal Nature Microbiology revealed the mechanism responsible for bats to harbour numerous viruses without themselves getting affected and also live long. Compared with terrestrial mammals, bats have longer lifespan.

The reason why bats can harbour these viruses without getting affected is simply because bats can avoid excessive virus-induced inflammation, which often causes severe diseases in animals and people infected with viruses.

When pathogens infect humans and mice, the immune system gets activated and typical inflammatory response to fight the microbes is seen. While controlled inflammatory response to fight infection helps keep humans healthy, it can contribute to the damage caused by infectious diseases, and also age-related diseases when the inflammatory response becomes excessive.

In complete contrast, the researchers found that the inflammatory response is dampened in bats immaterial of the variety of viruses that are present and the viral load. The researchers from Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore used three different viruses — Melaka virus, MERS coronavirus and influenza A virus — and tested the responses of immune cell and other cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone-marrow derived macrophages) of bats, mice and humans to these viruses. While inflammation was high in the case of humans and mice, it was significantly reduced in bats immune cells.

“This supports an enhanced innate immune tolerance rather than an enhanced antiviral defence in bats,” they write. “This may also contribute to our understanding of the role of the inflammation in disease tolerance in bats as reservoir hosts” they say. This is in complete contrast to what is seen in mice and humans for disease-causing zoonotic viruses.

The researchers found that significantly reduced inflammation in bats was because activation of an important protein — NLRP3 — that recognises both cellular stress and viral/bacterial infections was significantly dampened in bat immune cells.

Studying further, the researchers found that reduced activation of the NLRP3 protein was in turn due to impaired production of mRNA (transcript). Since mRNA production is impaired the NLRP3 protein production gets compromised leading to less amount of the protein being produced. But this was not the case with mice and humans — there was no impairment to mRNA production so the NLRP3 protein was unaffected.

The NLRP3 protein is found as four variants in bats. The researchers found that the function of all the four variants in bats was dampened compared with human NLRP3. To test if their finding on NLRP3 holds true in evolutionally distant bats, the researchers studied two very distinct species of bats — Pteropus alecto, which is a large fruit bat known as the Black Flying Fox, and Myotis davadii, a tiny vesper bat from China. The variations have been found to be genetically conserved through evolution.

Further analysis comparing 10 bat and 17 non-bat mammalian NLRP3 gene sequences confirmed that these adaptations appear to be bat-specific.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/dey3u8/article30711333.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02SCI-ROOSTING-BATS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/how-bats-harbour-several-viruses-yet-not-get-sick/article30711334.ece
481,2020/02/01,Extended chain of human-to-human spread seen in Germany,"The case of a German adult who acquired novel coronavirus infection locally in Munich from a Chinese who hails from Shanghai is the second reported case of a person human-to-human transmission the incubation period. But a Correspondence published in the New England Journal of Medicine now sheds more light on how people who are asymptomatic for the virus can infect others.

It also reports the first known case of fourth-generation transmission (assuming that the infection was transmitted to the Chinese lady by a close contact) of the novel virus outside China.

Though nine cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported from five countries — Vietnam, Germany, Japan, the U.S. and South Korea, all local transmission had occurred only among people who had come in contact with an infected person who had recently visited China.

Even more sobering is the fact that persons recovering from illness can have huge viral load. This raises “concern about prolonged shedding of the virus even after recovery,” writes Dr. Camilla Rothe, who is the first and corresponding author from University Hospital LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.

China’s National Health Commission Minister was the first to warn that the novel virus might be spreading even during the incubation period when symptoms do not show up.

The work “suggest spread can occur from asymptomatic patients and there may be viral shedding, and risk of contagion, after recovery. If true, this will make control more challenging,” Dr. Scott Gottlieb former Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says in a tweet.

The Chinese lady who had arrived in Munich on January 19 was asymptomatic till January 23. She became ill on her flight back to China, where she was tested positive for novel coronavirus on January 26. Hers is a case of virus transmission during incubation period.

The German businessman met the Chinese lady of January 20-21 but developed symptoms on January 24 and recovered quickly. But he had “high viral load” of 108 copies per millilitre in his sputum sample.

Three other German employees at the same company too tested positive for the novel virus. While only one of them had contact with the Chinese lady, the other two had contracted the virus from the German businessman who first fell sick, thus extending the chain of human-to-human transmission.

Containing the spread

In the case of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) people began spreading the virus only after they developed symptoms. But the novel coronavirus seems to be behaving like influenza and measles where people can spread the virus even before symptoms show up.

Unlike in the case of Ebola where the virus spread happens only after symptoms show up, symptomless spreaders like the novel coronavirus will make it difficult to contain the spread. Also, while Ebola spreads only through contact with body fluids, the novel coronavirus, SARS and influenza can spread through air droplets, making it even more easy for the virus to spread and even more difficult to contain the spread.

More studies are needed to know how infectious people with novel coronovirus are during the incubation period.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/s2tpsr/article30711297.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/coronajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/extended-chain-of-human-to-human-spread-seen-in-germany/article30710655.ece
