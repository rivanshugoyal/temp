2,2020/02/11,"With over 22 million monthly users, Bigo Live is on a fast rise in India","Dimple D’Souza, a fashion designer from Chennai, cannot decide on the perfect eye shadow for her black dress. She settles on a metallic purple and starts her live broadcast. No, she is not on the news; every night, she connects with thousands of her followers on a mobile live streaming app called BIGO LIVE. “What song should I dance to first?” she asks and, messages with suggestions and virtual gifts pop up almost instantly.

At the BIGO Awards Gala 2020 held on January 15 in Singapore, Dimple bagged the third prize in the top regional host category. “I’ve been on this app for three years and I have nearly five million followers. They send me virtual gifts which I can encash later, as my Google Pay is connected to the app,” she explains. Dimple tells me that the app helps her earn at least five to 10 lakh every month. To make things clearer, she asks: “Guys! Send me some gifts. Let my friend here see how it works.” A family shield pops up on the screen. One fan under the alias Redbull has sent her the gift. A sword is worth ₹1,400 and she earns ₹1,000 from it. The most expensive virtual gift Redbull has sent is a luxury yacht that costs him about ₹56,000 and she earns ₹39,999.

Who’s on it?

BIGO LIVE has over 22 million monthly active users and Nagesh Banga, deputy country manager of BIGO LIVE, explains that it is more popular in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. He adds that the users are located across the country with the exception of a few South Indian cities.

and Nagesh Banga, deputy country manager of BIGO LIVE, explains that it is He adds that the users are located across the country with the exception of a few South Indian cities. From passing time and making friends to sharing a slice of their life, each user has a different motivation for watching and participating in live streams.

“BIGO LIVE helps content creators not just become famous but also earn an income. The support given by followers to these content creators/broadcasters is tremendous. This kind of monetisation is missing on short video apps,” adds Nagesh.

Unlike sending direct cash, these gifts are seen more as a fun, casual exchange, a celebration for the sender and receiver. The app has no direct link to these transactions and the data resides with the payment gateways providers.

According to ‘You Watch, You Give, and You Engage: A Study of Live Streaming Practices in China,’ by Zhicong Lu et al, presented at the 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, more than 60% of the studied users reported sending paid gifts.

Dimple’s top sender, who goes by the ID Nitesh Agarwal, a business owner in Gujarat, has spent over ₹2 lakhs on her over the years. He justifies this spending, “She is a talented person. If I go out to the movies or the mall, I would end up spending the same amount there. Here, I sit at home and am entertained every day after my daily job.”

Safety and big picture

Like most other social networks, BIGO LIVE has strict community guidelines, and much of the content flowing through the system is moderated by in-app Artificial Intelligence, which scans for obscenity, pornography, graphic images, gambling, terrorism, under-age usage. “Individually, within each segment, there are ways to ensure that AI is compliant and in-line with the local laws and culture,” explains Mike Ong, Vice President, Government Relations, BIGO, in an email to The Hindu.

Dr Manoj Sharma, who runs the SHUT Clinic, a technology de-addiction centre in Bengaluru’s NIMHANS, says, “These live-streaming apps are relatively new and we don’t have much empirical data to suggest if the streamers spend additional time on the app to make extra money and get a few more followers.”

In 2019, the Madras High Court briefly had TikTok pulled from app stores as it was criticised for inappropriate content and also pointed out for lack of safety to children. “Many video streaming apps feature suggestive content posted by young women to gain eyeballs. This may promote further objectification of women. However, we cannot police the choices of adult women,” explains Devdutta Mukhopadhyay, associate counsel, the Internet Freedom Foundation. “To promote women’s well-being, we should focus on data protection principles such as informed consent, purpose limitation and right to erasure. Further, women should be granted more control over who can view and share their content, and some social media platforms have developed technical features to facilitate this.”

“Freedom of speech and expression is a fundamental right, and in as much as it does not violate others’ right to privacy or is not obscene, no one can object to it. This right includes expressions through videos or such live-streaming apps. The duty of the state will have to be to protect this right as far as possible,” adds advocate and women’s rights activist Sudha Ramalingam.

Nagesh Banga, deputy country manager of BIGO LIVE, concludes that the company sees great potential in the future.

3,2020/02/11,China's Q1 smartphone sales may halve due to coronavirus -analysts,"China's smartphone sales may plunge by as much as 50% in the first quarter, as many retail shops have closed for an extended period and production has yet to fully resume due to the fast spread of a new coronavirus, according to research reports.

The virus outbreak, which has killed more than 900 people and roiled China's manufacturing industry, comes as top smartphone vendors such as Huawei had hoped China's 5G rollout plans this year would help the world's biggest smartphone market rebound after years of falling sales.

“Vendors' planned product launches will be canceled or delayed, given that large public events are not allowed in China,” research firm Canalys said in a note last week.

“It will take time for vendors to change their product launch roadmaps in China, which is likely to dampen 5G shipments.”

Canalys expects China's smartphone shipments to halve in the first quarter from a year ago, while IDC, another research firm that tracks the tech sector, forecasts a 30% drop.

Apple Inc said last week it is extending its retail store closures in China and has yet to finalise opening dates, as Foxconn, which assembles iPhones, struggles to fully resume work.

Foxconn received government approval on Monday to resume production at a plant in the city of Zhenghzou, and reopened a major plant in the southern city of Shenzhen. But many others of its factories have yet to resume operation.

Huawei, China's biggest smartphone vendor, said its manufacturing capacity is “running normally” without specifying further. But like many other local peers, Huawei relies heavily on third-party manufacturers for production.

If factories cannot resume production to full capacity on time, this could delay brands' ability to bring their newest products to market, analysts said.

Xiaomi Corp, Huawei, and Oppo, three of China's top Android brands, are all expected to announce flagship devices in the first half.

Oppo told Reuters that while the impact of the virus will affect operations at some local factories, “manufacturing capacity can be guaranteed effectively” thanks to its plants overseas.

Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment.

“The delays in reopening factories and the labour return time will not only affect shipments to stores, it will also affect the product launch times in the mid- and long-term,” Will Wong, an IDC analyst, said.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/q5wlz0/article30790190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30NETSMARTPHONES,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/chinas-q1-smartphone-sales-may-halve-due-to-coronavirus-analysts/article30790183.ece
4,2020/02/11,This Augmented Reality app leverages poetry to spread the love,"“What if we could leave a message on the Gateway of India that nobody could take off?” When Sheetal S’ friends thought out loud, they were not talking about graffiti. The Kochi-based Augmented Reality (AR) designer has a number of friends in Mumbai who had participated in protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. She also had many others who couldn’t, because of their parents’ concerns for their safety.

It is the latter’s urge to leave a silent, lasting sign of support that got her thinking, and made her come up with Air Poetry.

Back-end story

Developed with the help of Kochi-based AR outfit Kitebe, led by Jithin MS, the simulation currently lets you leave a pre-composed phrase or slogan on any surface — or even just (apparently) in the sky — as long as your phone camera is pointed at that space. The idea, eventually, is to leave an imprint that can be picked up by any other device that happens to look at that same space even days later, through the app. A message that leaves no mark.

“So if you were to leave your poetry somewhere near the Taj in Mumbai, I should be able to see it three days later,” says Sheetal, over phone from Kochi, “But that will be Phase 3 of the project, and we will begin our research on it post-February 15.” Phase 2 would give users the ability to put up their own words “on air”. Though the app is just in Phase 1 at the moment, it is already available on both the App Store (iOS 6S and above) and Google Play (for ARCore-supported Android devices).

AR for good

“The AR Foundation lets developers work on simulations of iOS and Android simultaneously, even though iOS is far more advanced,” says Sheetal, “There were still a number of challenges, particularly in the camera panning for Android.”

An example of how Air Poetry’s AR is used, as shown in Kochi Metro

Currently, there are three phases; users can augment any one of the three phrases onto their surroundings. Once they make their choice, they can take an image of the augmentation, with themselves or their friends in the frame as well. But the real scope for this app seems to lie in Phase 2, with Apple Store users already requesting for the ability to project their own words. Sheetal acknowledges both the scope and the dangers in this: once they allow for that ability, the messages being spread would be out of their hands. “We are working to put some safeguards in place, such as blocking out abusive words,” she says.

At the stage Air Poetry is in currently, Sheetal adds, privacy is not a concern. “We don’t even ask you for user location yet, only access to camera. There is 0% personal data being collected. It is only in later stages, when we customise, that we may require additional permissions,” she says.

Though a self-funded project, the app is currently available for free, and runs without any advertisements. “We have not figured out an income model for it yet,” she admits, before pointing out how similar simulations are being used in education and advertising sectors abroad. “In India, for now, people are just having some fun with it.”",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/s8f4wk/article30789854.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy06-air-poetry,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/air-poetry-augmented-reality-app-jithin-ms-sheetal-s/article30789855.ece
5,2020/02/11,Samsung to unveil square-shaped foldable phones to challenge Apple,"Samsung Electronics is set to unveil a new, square-shaped foldable smartphone and updated versions of its flagship Galaxy S range on Tuesday, seeking to revive sales after ceding its smartphone crown to Apple Inc last quarter.

Ahead of the launch event in San Francisco, Samsung in a surprise U.S. TV commercial on Sunday gave a first glimpse of the new square phones that fold like flip phones and show off a notification panel on the exterior.

The Galaxy Z Flip is expected to be cheaper than the bulky $1,980 Galaxy Fold that opens like a book, partly due to a more compact screen size, analysts and sources said.

While the South Korean firm hopes the new handset will help burnish its innovation credentials, consumers will be keen to see whether Samsung has overcome technological challenges and screen glitches that forced it to delay the Galaxy Fold last year.

“Foldables are expensive and very hard to manufacture. It will take time for foldables to become mass-market products,” said Neil Mawston, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, expecting a mass-market takeoff by 2022 or 2023.

“For now, foldables are a super-premium product that can drive profits or a 'halo effect' for the Samsung brand.”

Limited foldable display productivity and capacity will constrain Samsung's ability to boost the foldable phone production sharply, industry officials and analysts say.

Sales are seen at 5 million units at maximum this year, or less than 2% of Samsung's total smartphone shipments in 2019, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Samsung declined to comment.

Samsung is also expected to launch three variants of Galaxy S premium smartphones, whose sales are expected to exceed that of predecessors, helped by competitive pricing and powerful cameras, researcher Counterpoint said.

Samsung lost its No.1 smartphone position to Apple in the December quarter, according to Strategy Analytics as cheaper iPhone 11 pricing helped the U.S. firm enjoy its best growth performance since 2015.

Also Read Samsung stops making phones in China

While China's coronavirus outbreak has started straining the global supply chain and disrupting smartphone production, the South Korean firm is seen the least affected among major producers, as its main manufacturing base is in Vietnam, analysts said.

Research firm TrendForce forecasts global smartphone production will decrease by 12% in the first quarter to a five-year low but cut its production estimate for Samsung by just 3%.

The Tuesday launch event will also mark first public debut of Samsung's new mobile chief Roh Tae-moon who previously oversaw the company's development of S range models and outsourcing of cheap phones to Chinese contract manufacturers.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/o4ufps/article30358443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THSAMSUNG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/samsung-to-unveil-square-shaped-foldable-phones-to-challenge-apple/article30789597.ece

7,2020/02/11,Four Indian pilots begin astronaut training in Russia,"The four Indian pilots chosen as candidate-astronauts on Monday began their 12-month training at the Gagarin Research and Test Cosmonaut Training Centre (GCTC) in Moscow, Russian space business company Glavkosmos has announced.

Much of the training will take place at the GCTC facilities, a statement issued in Moscow said. The full programme includes basic or generic astronaut training followed by activities specific to the first Indian human space mission, Gaganyaan.

From IAF team

The four candidates are fighter pilots from the Indian Air Force and were chosen from among hundreds of applicants over the last few months. At the end of all training modules in India and Russia, one or two of the four will be finally named to circle the earth in the first crewed Gaganyaan, which is planned around 2022.

12-month module

In June 2019, the Human Space Flight Centre of the Indian Space Research Organisation and the Russian government-owned Glavkosmos signed a contract for the training, which includes Russian support in the selection of candidates, their medical examination, and space training.

Glavkosmos said, “The 12-month training programme includes comprehensive and biomedical training of the Indian candidates, combined with regular physical practices. They will study in detail the systems of the Soyuz manned spaceship, as well as be trained in short-term weightlessness mode aboard the Il-76MDK aircraft.”

The Il-76MDK is an Ilyushin-78 military transport plane specially re-designed for parabolic flights of trainee astronauts and space tourists. The candidates will also be trained to take appropriate actions during emergencies — for example should the spacecraft make an abnormal landing in (unplanned) climate and geographic zones.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/imukjg/article30786909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/iStock-1018982372,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/four-indian-pilots-begin-astronaut-training-in-russia/article30786910.ece

10,2020/02/11,"Coronavirus threat ‘very grave’ to world, not China, says WHO","The coronavirus outbreak in China may be over by April, its senior medical adviser said on Tuesday, but deaths passed 1,000 and the World Health Organization feared a “very grave” global threat.

As the epidemic squeezed the world’s second-biggest economy, Chinese firms struggled to get back to work after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, hundreds of them saying they would need loans running into billions of dollars to stay afloat.

Company layoffs were beginning despite assurances by President Xi Jinping that widespread sackings would be avoided, as supply chains for global firms from car manufacturers to smartphone makers ruptured.

Number of cases drops

China's foremost medical adviser on the outbreak, Zhong Nanshan, told Reuters that the number of new cases was falling in parts and forecast the epidemic would peak this month.

“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” added Mr. Zhong, 83, an epidemiologist who won fame for his role in combating an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in 2003.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday 1,017 people had died in China, where there were 42,708 cases.

Only 319 cases have been confirmed in 24 other countries and territories outside mainland China, with two deaths: one in Hong Kong and the other in the Philippines.

World stocks, which had seen rounds of selloffs due to the novel coronarivus’ impact on China’s economy and ripple effects round the world, kept rising towards record highs on Mr. Zhong’s comments.

WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was less sanguine, however, appealing for the sharing of virus samples and speeding up of research into drugs and vaccines.

“With 99% of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” he told researchers in Geneva.

Sackings start

With travel curbs, lockdowns and production suspensions all affecting China’s economy, many were trying to calculate and predict the probable impact.

JPMorgan analysts downgraded forecasts for Chinese growth this quarter, saying the outbreak had “completely changed the dynamics” of its economy.

Investment bank Nomura’s analysts said the virus seemed to have had “a devastating impact” on China’s economy in January and February and markets “appear to be significantly underestimating the extent of disruption”.

Norway’s biggest independent energy consultancy Rystad Energy predicted the outbreak will cut growth in global oil demand by a quarter this year. However, two European Union officials said the impact on the bloc from damage to China’s economy would only be “marginal”.

Inside China, more than 300 companies are seeking bank loans totalling 57.4 billion yuan ($8.2 billion) to help cope with the disruption, banking sources said.

Prospective borrowers include food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and ride-hailing provider Didi Chuxing Technology Co.

Chinese firm Xinchao Media said on Monday it had laid off 500 people, or just over a tenth of its workforce, and restaurant chain Xibei said it was worried about how to pay its roughly 20,000 workers.

Authorities said they would roll out measures to stabilise jobs, in addition to previously announced cuts to interest rates and fiscal stimulus designed to minimise any downturn.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/efbwl4/article30795217.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-China-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-threat-very-grave-to-world-not-china-says-who/article30795218.ece
11,2020/02/11,United Kingdom team tests vaccine on mice,"A team of U.K. scientists believe they are among the first to start animal testing of a vaccine for the new coronavirus.

Researchers at Imperial College London said their ultimate goal was to have an effective and safe way of halting the SARS-like strain’s spread by the end of the year. “At the moment we have just put the vaccine that we’ve generated from these bacteria into mice,” Imperial College London researcher Paul McKay told AFP.

“We’re hoping that over the next few weeks we’ll be able to determine the response that we can see in those mice, in their blood, their antibody response to the coronavirus.”

Scientists across the world are racing to develop a way to stamp out the new strain of a well-known virus that has been successfully combatted in the past.

Imperial College London said it cannot be sure how advanced other teams’ research is at the moment.

China’s Xinhua state news agency cited a local news report as saying that a Shanghai university also injected a test vaccine into mice on Sunday.

But the local report cited unnamed sources and there has been no official announcement about the Chinese tests.

Britain has recorded eight cases of the virus and been forced to shut down two branches of a medical centre in the southeast city of Brighton where at least two staff members tested positive.

But coming up with a vaccine is a laborious process that usually involves years of animal testing and clinal trials on humans.

Regulators must then make sure that the vaccine is both sufficiently safe and effective to be mass produced.

Imperial College London hopes that research on the SARS coronavirus nearly two decades ago can speed things up.

“We’re hoping to be the first to get this particular vaccine into human clinical trials, and that perhaps is our personal goal,” McKay said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bklvii/article30795097.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/united-kingdom-team-tests-vaccine-on-mice/article30795094.ece
12,2020/02/11,Feds seek 7 to 9 years in jail for Donald Trump ally Roger Stone,"Prosecutors on Monday sought U.S. President Donald Trump's longtime adviser Roger Stone to serve a sentence between seven and nine years in prison.

Stone is due to face sentencing by U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson on February 20, after a jury in November found the self-proclaimed dirty trickster guilty on seven counts of lying to Congress, obstruction and witness tampering.

The government said that under U.S. sentencing guidelines, he faces a range of seven years and three months to up to nine years, and told Jackson he “should be punished in accord” with those.

Mr. Stone is one of several people close to Mr. Trump who faced charges stemming from then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

During the trial, prosecutors pressed their case that Stone lied to lawmakers about his outreach to WikiLeaks — the website that disclosed many hacked Democratic emails ahead of the 2016 election that proved embarrassing to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton — to protect Mr. Trump from looking bad.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/az7d5j/article29986523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROGER-STONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/feds-seek-7-to-9-years-in-jail-for-donald-trump-ally-roger-stone/article30795061.ece
13,2020/02/11,United Kingdom unveils laws to stop early release of terrorists,"Britain will end the automatic early release of convicted terrorists under new fast-tracked legislation to be introduced to Parliament on Tuesday.

The new Bill follows an attack earlier this month by an Islamist militant just days after he was set free half-way through his jail term, despite authorities believing he still posed a threat to the public.

The government had already promised tougher rules on terrorism after another former convict killed two people and wounded three before being shot dead by police near London Bridge in November.

The emergency measures, which the government wants to become law by the end of the month, will mean convicted terrorists cannot be released before the end of their sentence without an assessment of whether they are still a risk. They will have to serve at least two-thirds of their sentence before being assessed.

“No dangerous terrorist should be released automatically only to go on to kill and maim innocent people on our streets,” said justice minister Robert Buckland in a statement.The government said around 50 people currently in jail would see their release blocked as a result of the change to the law

The slogans “Jews awaken” and “Stop assimilating” were scrawled on a mosque and another building in Jish, a small village in the Galilee just south of Israel’s border with Lebanon.

Police said they were investigating the incident.

The tyres of over 150 cars were punctured, Jish council head Elias Elias said, adding that it was not the first time the mixed Muslim and Christian village had been targeted.

15,2020/02/11,China denies role in cybertheft following Equifax accusations,"China denied involvement in any hacking activities on Tuesday after the U.S. indicted four members of the Chinese military for allegedly breaking into the computer networks of the Equifax credit reporting agency and stealing the personal information of tens of millions of people.

The Justice Department accused Beijing on Monday of engineering one of the biggest hacks in history targeting consumer data of some 145 million Americans.

Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China was committed to “firmly oppose and combat cyberattacks of any kind,” adding that it is a staunch defender of cybersecurity and its institutions “never engage in cybertheft of trade secrets.”

Mr. Geng also turned the accusation back on the U.S., saying past events had shown Washington is “engaging in large-scale, organised and indiscriminate cyberstealing, spying and surveillance activities on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals.”

“China is also a victim of this,” Mr. Geng said.

The accusation is the latest against Chinese suspected of breaching the computer networks of American corporations, including steel manufacturers, a hotel chain and a health insurer. It comes as the Trump administration has warned against what it sees as the growing political and economic influence of China, and efforts by Beijing to collect data for financial and intelligence purposes and to steal research and innovation.

16,2020/02/11,Nepal prepares to evacuate its citizens from virus-hit Wuhan city in China,"Nepal is preparing to bring back its 180 nationals struck in China’s Wuhan city, the epicentre of the deadly coronavirus that has killed over 1,000 people, officials said here.

The disease emerged in December in a market in central China’s Wuhan city that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly.

Outside China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in almost 30 places with two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong.

Nepal government is preparing to bring back Nepalese nationals currently residing in Wuhan city of China through a chartered flight of Nepal Airlines in a few days, official sources said.

The government is preparing to send the aircraft to China around mid-February after 180 Nepalese nationals who were struck in Wuhan city, registered their names in the Nepalese embassy in Beijing seeking evacuation, the sources said. It is setting up an isolation centre before bringing the Nepalese nationals from Wuhan.

Five Nepalese nationals were admitted to a government hospital in Kathmandu for the suspected virus infection after they returned from China last fortnight. However, only one of them was found to be infected and he has already been cured, according to Health Ministry sources.

17,2020/02/11,Pakistan court accepts Hafiz Saeed’s plea to club all terror-financing cases,"An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan on Tuesday accepted a plea of Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamat-ud-Dawa chief (JuD) Hafiz Saeed to club all six terror-financing cases against him and his aides, and announce the verdict on completion of the trial.

The anti-terrorism court or ATC had indicted Saeed and others on December 11 in terror-financing case in day-to-day hearing.

“The anti-terrorism court of Lahore accepted the plea of Saeed and his close aides seeking delay in the verdict in two concluded terror-financing cases against them till the trial in other four such pending cases is complete,” a court official told PTI after the hearing.

According to the petition, four other terror-financing cases against Saeed, Zafar Iqbal, Yahya Aziz, Abdul Rehman Makki are pending before the same ATC. “As evidence has been in progress, the court may announce the verdict in six cases including the ones already concluded once the trial is completed,” it said.

The official said the court after accepting Saeed’s request, ordered the prosecution to present witnesses in other four cases against the JuD leaders on Wednesday. “The court will announce the verdict once all witnesses are produced and cross examination is done,” he said.

The deputy prosecutor general opposed Saeed’s plea and argued that the trial in two cases against him and others has already been completed and under the law the court may announce the verdict. He requested the court to reject Saeed’s plea and announce the verdict.

On last Saturday, Lahore ATC judge Arshad Hussain Bhutta had deferred the verdict against Saeed in two terror-financing cases till February 11.

Deputy Prosecutor General Abdul Rauf Wattoo told the Dawn TV that some six cases against Saeed and others are pending before the same court and presentation of evidence in remaining four cases is in progress.

“Hearing of all four remaining cases will be concluded simultaneously at the end of the week and after that the court will issue its verdict,” Mr. Wattoo said.

Saeed and other JuD leaders were produced before the ATC in high security.

In the two concluded cases, the prosecution had produced some 20 or so witnesses in the ATC who testified against Saeed and his close aides for their involvement in terror-financing.

Saeed has already recorded his statement before the court in two terror-financing cases against him in which he pleaded “not guilty”.

The cases of terror-financing have been registered against him in Lahore and Gujranwala cities on the application of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police.

Cross examination of prosecution witnesses against Saeed and his three close aides by the defence counsel has already been concluded.

The Counter Terrorism Department had registered 23 FIRs against Saeed and his accomplices on the charges of terror-financing in different cities of Punjab province and arrested him on July 17. He is lodged at the Kot Lakhpat jail in Lahore.

The cases were registered against Saeed and others in Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan for collection of funds for terrorism financing through assets/properties made and held in the names of Trusts/Non Profit Organisations including Al-Anfaal Trust, Dawatul Irshad Trust, Muaz Bin Jabal Trust, etc.

According to the CTD, investigation launched into financing matters of proscribed organisations – JuD and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) – in connection with implementation of UN Sanctions against these Designated Entities and Persons as directed by National Security Committee (NSC) in its meeting of January 1, 2019 chaired by Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for implementing the National Action Plan.

“These suspects made assets from funds of terror-financing. They held and used these assets to raise more funds for further terror-financing. Hence, they committed multiple offences of terror-financing and money laundering under Anti Terrorism Act 1997. They will be prosecuted in Anti Terrorism Courts for commission of these offences,” the CTD said.

Saeed-led JuD is believed to be the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist and the U.S., since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million reward for information that brings Saeed to justice.

The United States has also welcomed Saeed’s indictment by a Pakistani court, urging Islamabad to ensure a full prosecution and expeditious trial of the charges against him.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/djkuqw/article30285347.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HAFIZSAEED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-court-accepts-hafiz-saeeds-plea-to-club-all-terror-financing-cases/article30792231.ece

The 64-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss, who remains on bail since his arrest on an extradition warrant in April 2017, avoided the usual scrum of reporters at the court entrance and went in with his lawyers separately.

The High Court judges will begin hearing arguments against a magistrates’ court extradition order, signed off by former UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid in February last year.

Mr. Mallya had received permission to appeal on one ground, which challenges the Indian government’s prima facie case against him of fraudulent intentions in acquiring bank loans for his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

19,2020/02/11,Coronavirus-infected woman gives birth to a healthy baby in China,"A 33-year-old Chinese woman infected with the deadly coronavirus pneumonia has given birth to a healthy baby girl with no infection in northwest China’s Shaanxi Province, state media reported on Tuesday.

The Chinese woman was at the 37th week of gestation when she gave birth via caesarean to a baby with a weight of 2,730 grams at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi’an Jiaotong University in Xi’an, capital of Shaanxi on Monday, Xinhua news agency reported.

The infant, whose first nucleic acid test associated with the novel coronavirus was negative, is receiving intensive care and will be tested again in the next few days to confirm the absence of the virus, according to the provincial centre for disease control and prevention.

The woman and the infant have been transferred to the fever ward and neonatal isolation ward, respectively, for follow-up care and treatment. Both of them are currently in a stable condition, Mr. Liu Ming, director of the medical administration department of the hospital said.

On February 7, the woman was transferred from the central hospital of the city of Shangluo to the designated hospital where a workgroup consisting of medical experts came up with a series of treatment plans and made preparations to ensure the safety of the patient and her baby, according to Mr. Liu.

Two obstetricians, two anesthesiologists, a midwife, three neonatologists and two nurses participated in the cesarean section.

On Wednesday, a 30-hour-old infant born in a Wuhan hospital became the youngest person to catch the virus.

CCTV reported the infected baby may be a case of “vertical transmission,” referring to infections passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or right after.

On February 3, the news agency reported that a baby born in January to an infected mother had tested negative.

The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly.

Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said in a tweet Manila’s notice of termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement was received by the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Manila. He refused to provide other details on the drastic step “as a diplomatic courtesy.”

Mr. Locsin signed the notice on orders of Mr. Duterte, who has often criticised U.S. security policies while praising those of China and Russia despite the Philippine military’s close historic ties with its American counterpart.

In a Senate hearing last week, Mr. Locsin warned that abrogating the security accord with Washington would undermine Philippine security and foster aggression in the disputed South China Sea. U.S. military presence in the strategic waterway has been seen as a crucial counterweight to China, which has claimed virtually the entire sea.

Mr. Locsin proposed a review of the agreement to fix contentious issues instead of abrogating it. Philippine defense and military officials did not immediately issue any reaction the government move.

The termination of the 1999 agreement would take effect 180 days after Washington received Manila’s notice but both could decide to keep the pact during the waiting period, Philippine officials said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/czo8cm/article28652607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PHILIPPINESDUTERTE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/philippines-notifies-us-of-intent-to-end-major-security-pact/article30790097.ece

23,2020/02/11,"14 Rohingyas die, dozens unaccounted for as boat sinks off Bangladesh","At least 14 people drowned and dozens more were unaccounted for after a boat carrying Rohingya refugees sank off southern Bangladesh early on Tuesday, officials said.

Some 130 people were packed on the fishing trawler that was trying to get across the Bay of Bengal to Malaysia, coast guard spokesman Hamidul Islam told AFP. Seventy of them had so far been rescued.

Many of the 700,000-plus Rohingya who fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017 have tried to leave overcrowded refugee camps in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar district on boats headed for Malaysia.

Islam said the boat was one of two vessels that was making the hazardous journey.

“We have found one capsized boat. All of them were mainly from the refugee camps in Cox's Bazar. We haven't found any sign of the second boat yet. We will continue our operation,” Islam said.

“So far we have recovered 14 bodies and 70 people alive,” coast guard commander Naim ul Haq told AFP, adding that navy and coast guard boats were searching near St Martin's island.

“They were lured by traffickers,” border guard commander Faisal Hasan Khan said.

Malaysia is the favoured destination of the Rohingya as it is a Muslim majority nation and has a sizeable Rohingya diaspora.

With few opportunities for jobs and education in the camps, thousands have attempted to reach other countries in Southeast Asia.

Since last year, Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies have picked up over 500 Rohingya from coastal villages and boats as they waited to board boats.

At least seven suspected traffickers were shot dead in 2019 in clashes with police.

Trafficking often increases during the November-March period when the sea is safest for the small fishing trawlers used in the risky trips.

The latest wave of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar's Rakhine state joined about 300,000 who had already fled the country to camps in Bangladesh.

An estimated 25,000 Rohingya left Bangladesh and Myanmar on boats in 2015 trying to get to Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said while the spread of the respiratory disease appeared to be slow, it could accelerate. His remarks have come a day after he warned the overseas coronavirus spread may be “tip of the iceberg“.

“In recent days we have seen some concerning instances of onward transmission from people with no travel history to China, like the cases reported in France yesterday and the U.K. today. The detection of this small number of cases could be the spark that becomes a bigger fire,” Ghebreyesus said in Geneva on Monday.

He said the detection of this small number of cases for now was only a spark and the objective for countries “remains containment”.

“We call on all countries to use the window of opportunity that we have to prevent a bigger fire,” he said.

Outside China, there have been more than 350 infections reported in almost 30 places with two deaths, one in the Philippines and the other in Hong Kong.

Apart from Germany, Britain and Italy, other European nations with cases of the virus include France, Russia, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Spain.

The overall pattern of infections has not changed, Ghebreyesus said, adding that 99% of the reported cases were in China, and most cases are mild.

WHO’s Director of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases, Sylvie Briand, said that 80% of cases displayed mild symptoms, 15% were severe — developing into pneumonia — and three to five per cent required intensive care.

“This is of course too many,” the WHO chief said of the fatalities, noting that many questions still needed answering, such as where the outbreak was growing and where it was getting better or worse.

WHO team in Beijing

As part of measures to coordinate an international response to the epidemic, on Sunday, Tedros confirmed that WHO had sent an advance team of international epidemiology experts to Beijing, to assist the authorities with the outbreak.

Leading them is Bruce Aylward, a WHO veteran outbreak expert, who recently coordinated the agency’s response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.

His job will be to “lay the groundwork” for a larger international team of experts which is expected to follow to China, Tedros said.

WHO’s other measures have included equipping laboratories in some 14 countries with kits to “fast diagnose” infections, including Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Tunisia and Zambia. This was essential to being able to identify coronavirus infections which can resemble other respiratory bugs, the WHO chief said.

To date, WHO has identified 168 labs around as having the right technology to identify the coronavirus. On concerns that the incubation period for the coronavirus could easily be as long as 24 days, WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme chief Michael Ryan said that the agency was not considering changing the current 14-day quarantine requirement period.

The UN health agency also reported that all crew and passengers on board a cruise ship harboured in Yokohama, Japan, were being quarantined for a 14-day period on board. Their quarantine period will come to an end on February 19, but will be extended for any close contacts of newly confirmed cases, WHO said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pzzvij/article30789632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TEDROSADHANOMGHEBREYESUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/who-warns-countries-to-use-window-of-oppportunity-to-contain-coronavirus/article30789634.ece
25,2020/02/11,Islamic State’s South Asia branch poses security threat to nations neighbouring Afghanistan: UN report,"The dreaded Islamic State’s South Asia branch remains active, ambitious and threatening, and has established contacts with other terror groups like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and has the potential to exacerbate the security threat to countries neighbouring Afghanistan, a UN report has warned.

The 10th report of the Secretary-General on the threat posed by ISIL (Da’esh) to international peace and security and the range of United Nations efforts in support of Member States in countering the threat said that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) came under severe military pressure from the security forces of Afghanistan and Taliban fighters towards the end of 2019, leading to its virtual expulsion from what had been its Afghan headquarters in Nangarhar Province.

The report said that even though the Afghan authorities took custody of more than 1,400 people, including ISIL-K fighters and their dependants, the terror group remains a threat to regional security.

“ Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan remains active, ambitious and threatening. It continues its online recruitment and propaganda, for which it also conducts outreach activities in religious and academic institutions in Afghanistan, including Kabul University,” it said.

“It has established informal contact with other terrorist groups, including Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Islam, which regularly mount attacks on border posts of Pakistan. The approach of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan has the potential to exacerbate the security threat to countries neighbouring Afghanistan,” the report said.

The report added that most of the ISIL-K fighters taken into custody by the Afghan authorities were Afghan nationals but also included foreigners from Azerbaijan, Canada, France, India, Maldives, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan.

It said the impact on the number and geographic distribution of the group’s fighters is assessed as significant.

Some 2,100 fighters are now in Kunar Province, which has effectively become the group’s new Afghan core area, whereas the number of fighters elsewhere in Afghanistan may now be as low as 400, giving a total estimate of 2,500 for the whole country.

Up to 25 of them constitute a covert Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan presence in Faryab Province, led by a former Taliban member Qari Salahuddin, the report said.

The Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee had in May last year blacklisted ISIL-K, which is also known as ‘ISIL’s South Asia Branch’, ‘ISIL Khorasan’, ‘Islamic State’s Khorasan Province’ and ‘South Asian Chapter of ISIL’

ISIL-K was formed on January 10, 2015 by a former Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander and was established by former Taliban faction commanders “who swore an oath of allegiance” to IS and its slain leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

The group has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.

According to the terrorism backgrounder of ISIL -K on the website of Washington-based nonprofit policy research organisation Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), in 2014, Pakistani national Hafiz Saeed Khan was chosen to spearhead IS-K province as its first emir.

Khan, a veteran Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) commander, brought along other prominent TTP members — including the group’s spokesman Sheikh Maqbool and many district chiefs — when he initially pledged allegiance to al-Baghdadi in October 2014. IS-K’s early membership included a contingent of Pakistani militants who emerged in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province around 2010, just across the border from the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan. Many of these militants were estranged members of TTP and Lashkar-e Islam, who had fled Pakistan to escape pressure from security forces, the organisation said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/33k6bh/article30290270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IslamicState-12dec,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/islamic-states-south-asia-branch-poses-security-threat-to-nations-neighbouring-afghnaistanun-report/article30789611.ece

“Five including three military personnel and two civilians were killed,” interior ministry spokesman Nasrat Rahimi told Reuters, adding that 12 people were wounded, five of them civilians.

The academy, modelled after European war colleges to train Afghan cadets, has been the scene of several attacks in the past, including an Islamic State-claimed assault last May.

The UN Chief is expected to visit one of the most prominent Sikh pilgrimage sites next Tuesday.

Guru Nanak Dev spent the last 18 years of his life at Kartarpur Sahib, which has now become the world’s largest Sikh Gurdwara.

On February 17, Mr. Guterres will also speak at the International Conference on 40 Years of Hosting Afghan Refugees in Pakistan, which is being organized by the Pakistan government and the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), along with High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi.

He will participate in a high-level panel discussion and other events at the conference.

Mr. Guterres will also meet Pakistan President Arif Alvi.

The Secretary-General will be in Lahore on February 18, where he will meet students and attend an event on Pakistan’s polio vaccination campaign.

He will visit Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib before returning to New York on February 19.

In November last year, the UN Chief welcomed the opening of the Kartarpur Corridor between India and Pakistan, saying it paved the way for interfaith harmony and understanding.

We welcome #Pakistan and #India opening #KartarpurCorridor today connecting two key Sikh pilgrimage sites, paving way for interfaith harmony and understanding by facilitating visa-free cross border visits by pilgrims to holy shrines, spokesperson for the Secretary-General had tweeted.

The Kartarpur Corridor links Dera Baba Sahib in Gurdaspur in India and Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib in Pakistan. It was opened by Prime Minister Khan on November 9 in a historic people-to-people initiative between the two countries.

The Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib is located across the Ravi river in Pakistan and is about four km from the Dera Baba Nanak shrine in Gurdaspur district of Punjab.

According to the agreement between Pakistan and India, 5,000 pilgrims from India can visit the shrine daily and the number can be increased in future.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/95ldhd/article29960745.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KARTARPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/antonio-guterres-to-visit-gurdwara-kartarpur-sahib-during-trip-to-pakistan/article30789404.ece

30,2020/02/11,UN warns of ‘major shock’ as Africa locust outbreak spreads,"Uganda scrambled to respond to the arrival of the biggest locust outbreak that parts of East Africa have seen in decades, while the United Nations warned on Monday that “we simply cannot afford another major shock” to an already vulnerable region.

An emergency government meeting hours after the locusts were spotted inside Uganda on Sunday decided to deploy military forces to help with ground-based pesticide spraying, while two planes for aerial spraying will arrive as soon as possible, a statement said.

Aerial spraying is considered the only effective control. The swarms of billions of locusts have been destroying crops in Kenya, which hasn’t seen such an outbreak in 70 years, as well as Somalia and Ethiopia, which haven’t seen this in a quarter-century.

The insects have exploited favourable wet conditions after unusually heavy rains, and experts say climate change is expected to bring more of the same.

UN officials warn that immediate action is needed before more rainfall in the weeks ahead brings fresh vegetation to feed new generations of locusts. If left unchecked, their numbers could grow up to 500 times before drier weather arrives, they say.

“There is the risk of a catastrophe,” UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock told a briefing in New York on Monday, warning that a region where 12 million people already face severe food insecurity can’t afford another jolt.

“Without enough aerial spraying to stop the swarms, the locust outbreak could turn into a plague, and when you have a plague, it takes years to control,” Dominique Burgeon, emergency and resilience director with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, told The Associated Press last week.

The outbreak also is moving toward South Sudan, where another several million people face hunger as the country struggles to emerge from civil war.

The UN has asked for $76 million in immediate aid. So far just under $20 million is in hand, officials said.

The United States said on Monday it has released $800,000 and the European Union has released 1 million Euros.

“The response today is not gonna work, unless there’s a big scale-up, Mr. Lowcock said.

The locusts are eating the vegetation that supports vibrant herder communities in the region, and Kenyan Ambassador Lazarus Amayo warned of the “inherent risk of communal conflict over pastures.”

The outbreak is so severe it might even disrupt the planting of crops in the coming weeks, he said, adding that the locusts “do wanton damage.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pb5x84/article30719371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02LOCUSTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-warns-of-major-shock-as-africa-locust-outbreak-spreads/article30789122.ece
31,2020/02/11,White House proposes $1.5 billion for Indo-Pacific region,"The Trump administration has proposed $1.5 billion in budgetary allocation for 2021 fiscal for the crucial Indo-Pacific region, which it said was part of its efforts to ensure that the region remains “free, open, and independent of malign Chinese influence”.

“The future of the Indo-Pacific, which contains roughly half the world’s population and many of the fastest-growing economies, is critical to U.S. security and long-term economic interests,” the White House said in its budgetary proposal for the financial year 2021, beginning October 1, 2020.

“The Budget provides $1.5 billion for the Indo-Pacific, reflecting a strong Administration commitment to ensuring that the region remains free, open, and independent of malign Chinese influence,” it said.

This funding supports democracy programs, strengthens security cooperation, improves economic governance and facilitates private sector-led economic growth, the White House said.

A total of $30 million is included in the budget for the global engagement centre dedicated to countering foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation from China, it added.

The budget also provides $ 0.8 billion for the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for private sector development internationally to support corporate growth in less-developed countries and to provide a transparent, high-quality alternative to “predatory Chinese international lending” in the Indo-Pacific and other strategic regions, it said.

In the budgetary proposals, the Pentagon alleged that Beijing continued to violate the sovereignty of Indo-Pacific nations and expand its control abroad under the pretense of the Belt and Road infrastructure investments.

According to the Pentagon, in the Indo-Pacific, the Department of Defense (DoD) is strengthening and evolving U.S. partnerships into a security architecture that helps uphold a “free and open” order.

“With India, DoD is expanding military-to-military cooperation and improving interoperability, including by establishing a new tri-service amphibious exercise, TIGER TRIUMPH,” the Pentagon said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/v6kdf1/article30530951.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-ELECTIONTRUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/white-house-proposes-15-billion-for-indo-pacific/article30789078.ece
32,2020/02/11,Donald Trump pays tribute to 2 soldiers killed in Afghanistan,"President Donald Trump was traveling to Dover, Delaware, to pay respects to two U.S. soldiers killed Saturday in Afghanistan when a soldier dressed in an Afghan army uniform opened fire with a machine gun.

National security adviser Robert O’Brien told reporters traveling with Mr. Trump on Air Force One, “These were fallen heroes and we were close by and the president wrapped his rally early.”

The Defense Department has identified the dead American soldiers as Sgt. Javier Jaguar Gutierrez, 28; and Sgt. Antonio Rey Rodriguez, 28. Six other American soldiers were wounded in the attack.

Gutierrez was born in Jacksonville, N.C. He had also served in Iraq. Rodriguez was born in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He deployed eight times in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, which began in 2015. Both men were posthumously promoted to Sgt. 1st Class and awarded the Bronze Star Medal and Purple Heart.

Six U.S. service members have been killed in Afghanistan since the start of 2020, including Saturday’s casualties. Last year, 22 U.S. service personnel died in combat there.

The incident came as Washington has sought to find an end to the war in Afghanistan.

Washington’s peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been meeting with Taliban representatives in the Middle Eastern state of Qatar in recent weeks. He’s seeking an agreement to reduce hostilities to get a peace deal signed that would start negotiations among Afghans on both sides of the conflict.

In his State of the Union Address last Tuesday, Mr. Trump referenced the peace talks, saying U.S. soldiers were not meant to serve as “law enforcement agencies” for other nations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/84dub1/article30789776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/trumpjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-to-pay-tribute-to-2-soldiers-killed-in-afghanistan/article30789055.ece
33,2020/02/11,"With an eye on China & Russia, Trump proposes $740 billion as defence budget","President Donald Trump on Monday proposed $740 billion as the country’s national security budget for 2021, with an eye on China and Russia that are on a military modernisation programme that poses a challenge to the United States.

A key aspect of his defence budget proposals are a massive nuclear modernisation worth $28.9 billion, missile defeat and defence budget $20.3 billion. He has also proposed $18 billion for the space sector, $9.8 billion for the cyber sector and $56.9 billion in the air domain.

In his budget proposals, as released by the White House and by the Pentagon, the Trump administration has underscored the threat posed by its two main adversaries, Russia and China, which it alleges are on a military modernisation spree and coercing its neighbours.

“While the American people still face dangers posed by Islamist terrorists and transnational criminals, America also faces challenges by resurgent rival nation-states, including China and Russia. The Budget reflects the need for a new American posture to match the realities faced in this new era,” says the budget proposal sent by the White House to the Congress.

Unlike India, where the Union Finance Minister tables the budgetary proposals and delivers a speech in the Parliament, the U.S. President send his annual budgetary suggestions in document format to the Congress, which, over the next few months, debates, deliberates and votes on it.

“The Budget prioritizes funding for programs that would deliver warfighting advantages against China and Russia and sustains efforts over the last three years to focus defense investments in modernization, lethality, and innovation that provides the Nation’s troops a competitive advantage over all adversaries, the White House said.

Underpinned by the 2018 National Defense Strategy, the budget sustains and builds on efforts over the last three years to prioritise investments in modernisation, lethality, and innovation.

The budget continues the administration’s work to rebuild the military and improve readiness while balancing the need for reform, efficiency, and accountability at every level, the White House said.

The Pentagon, in its budget proposal, said the security environment continued to change in dangerous ways, China and Russia continue to employ aggressive tactics to coerce neighbours, suppress dissent and undermine freedom.

“They present existential challenges to United States interests and global norms,” it said, adding that Iran and North Korea continued to pursue weapons of mass destruction.

According to the Pentagon, China possesses one of the largest militaries in the world and is becoming increasingly comfortable portraying itself as a counter to the United States. Russia has also upgraded conventional forces while investing heavily in cyber, space, electronic warfare, and hybrid warfare capabilities.

Beijing continues to violate the sovereignty of Indo-Pacific nations and expand its control abroad under the pretense of Belt and Road infrastructure investments, it said.

Meanwhile, it is pursuing advantages in emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and 5G, while exploiting other nations’ intellectual property for its own gain, the Department of Defense said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6a97n/article30721438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/with-an-eye-on-china-russia-trump-proposes-740-billion-as-defence-budget/article30789024.ece
34,2020/02/11,"Storm Ciara: death toll rises to six, transport disrupted across Europe","A storm battered Europe with hurricane-force winds and heavy rains, killing at least six people and causing severe travel disruptions as it moved eastward across the continent on February 9 and bore down on Germany.

After striking Britain and Ireland on Sunday, the storm moved on, leaving a trail of damage including power cuts for tens of thousands of homes across Europe.

A woman and her 15-year-old daughter died in Poland after the storm ripped off the roof of a ski rental equipment building in the mountain resort of Bukowina Tatrzanska and sent it hurtling onto people standing near a ski lift, police said. Three people also were injured in the incident. In Sweden, one man drowned after the boat he and another person were sailing in on the southern lake of Fegen capsized. The victim was washed ashore and later died. The other person is still missing, according to the Aftonbladet daily. Two men, one in the north of Slovenia and another in southern England, also died after their cars were hit by falling trees. And in Germany, a driver died after crashing his truck into a trailer parked by workers clearing storm debris off a highway in the southern state of Hesse.

Five people were injured in the Czech Republic in incidents related to the storm, authorities said. The number of Czech households without electricity reached 290,000, according to power company CEZ.

Britain, which bore the brunt of the storm on Sunday, was assessing the damage and working to get power restored to 20,000 homes. However, for parts of northern England and Scotland, the respite is set to be brief, with forecasts of blizzards and snow.

""While Storm Ciara is clearing away, that doesn’t mean we’re entering a quieter period of weather,” said Alex Burkill, a meteorologist at Britain’s Met Office.

Many parts of the country were mopping up after a month and a half’s rain fell in just 24 hours in some places and rivers burst their banks. Though 360 flood warnings have been removed as the storm moves on, around 75 remain in place across the country.

The River Irwell burst its banks in northwest England, prompting authorities to evacuate residents. The British government said it was offering financial compensation through its emergency Bellwin scheme. Under the scheme, local authorities dealing with the storm can apply to have certain costs reimbursed.

Transport authorities were also working hard to clear up the mess. Network Rail, which runs the country’s rail infrastructure, said thousands of engineers had “battled horrendous conditions” after the storm blew trees, sheds, roofs and even trampolines onto the tracks.

Ferries were operating across the English Channel after being closed down on Sunday, though P&O Ferries said in a tweet that further disruptions were possible.

Airlines operating to and from U.K. airports were still being affected by the storm, with more than 100 flights canceled.

“We’re getting in touch with those affected, and have brought in extra customer teams to help them with a range of options including a full refund or an alternative flight between now and Thursday,” British Airways said in a statement.

The storm has now largely passed through France, though meteorologists warned that the Mediterranean island of Corsica could see winds as high as 200 kph later Monday. Waves lashed the northern coast, and high winds blew a truck onto its side on the A2 highway that links Belgium with France. Up to 130,000 homes were without electricity Monday morning, stretching from Brittany, in western France, through Normandy and the northern regions.

In Germany, utility companies were also scrambling to restore power to some 50,000 homes in northern Bavaria, where a top wind of over 160 kph (100 mph) was recorded. The storm resulted in a record amount of electricity being fed into the German grid from wind turbines, equivalent to almost 44 nuclear power plants.

Train travel across Europe’s biggest economy was also severely disrupted, leaving many commuters unable to get to work. Deutsche Bahn said Monday it was slowly resuming long-distance rail services in the north of the country but warned travelers to expect further disruptions. Airlines canceled hundreds of flights from German airports.

The storm, which was initially called Ciara by the Irish weather service but dubbed Sabine in Germany, also led to school closures in several cities and regions, including Germany’s North Rhine-Westphalia state, where several people were injured by falling branches and toppling trees. Parts of a construction crane fell onto the roof of Frankfurt Cathedral overnight.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/yy932b/article30788976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAIN-WEATHERCIARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/storm-ciara-death-toll-rises-to-six-transport-disrupted-across-europe/article30788979.ece

Prime Minister Modi and Mr. Trump had spoken over the weekend, the White House said. “During a phone call over the weekend, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi agreed the trip will further strengthen the United States-India strategic partnership and highlight the strong and enduring bonds between the American and Indian people.”

The Hindu has learned that India’s newly appointed Ambassador to the U.S., Taranjit Singh Sandhu, who presented his credentials to Mr. Trump last week, also handed over an official invitation to the President to visit India. (The White House had waited for this prior to announcing the visit officially).

Preparations are underway in India. American security teams with scanners and equipment arrived in India last week.

Trade deal

The Indian and the U.S. sides are trying to put together a limited trade deal which Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump will sign during the visit.

The two leaders could not sign on the dotted line when they met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September and talks had continued since then.

Sources close to the negotiations told The Hindu last week that while they were “hopeful” a deal would be reached before Mr. Trump’s visit, it was not a given, as there were gaps in the negotiating positions of the two sides.

A defence deal is also reportedly on the cards. India is preparing to approve a $ 2.6 billion deal for 24 MH-60 Seahawk helicopters from Lockheed Martin, as per a Reuters report.

The potential sale, which is being processed via the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route, is now before the U.S. Congress for consideration, with a 30-day window for Congress raise any objections to the sale.

“The Integrated Air Defence Weapon System, also known as the National Advanced Surface to Air Missile System (NASAMS), provides integrated air missile defence and is currently deployed around Washington, DC,” a Department of State spokesperson said.

38,2020/02/11,Hyderabad’s clubs speak out loud with single eye-catching artpieces,"Prepping for nightlife in Hyderabad requires many a sufferance in the form of dressing to the nines, going out, indulging in nibbles of all kinds, making friends and contacts, taking in the surroundings and good vibes, having a drink or two, maybe getting in some social media action... the list goes on. Sounds tiresome right?

But while this happens, one has to appreciate the design elements that go into creating a cohesive ambience at a venue. Social media has certainly changed this up for a lot of club and resto-bar architects who believe a visual experience is as important as the sound and hospitality.

Neha and Nitin Ganeriawal co-run popular hotspot Absorb in Jubilee Hills. Boasting the longest bar in Hyderabad (of 40-plus feet) is not enough for this club of deep blues and blacks. As soon as you step in, the eye — however inebriated — will wander to the larger-than-life 10-foot stone Garuda statue behind the mammoth bar.

“It is our pride and joy,” says Neha, “and we had it built on site by local artisans.” Indeed, one can see that in the intricate carvings and feathered detailing of the Garuda’s wings as well as the curved sharpness of the beak and talons. During the day, there’s an settling but attractive gleam about the structure but at night, when the violet-blue lights of the bar play against the stone, it seems as though the Garuda comes to life. Significant to Hindu, Buddhist and Jain mythologies, the Garuda eradicates negativity and underpins protection, which could allude to the patrons being wished a safe night out.

Taking photos in front of the Garuda at Absorb has become quite the thing... after all, it is proof that you graced the venue in the first place. “I love when cultural pieces like the Garuda can be modernised,” says Swapna Reddy, a medical student who goes to Absorb at least once a month. “I do not see it as cultural appropriation because the good values of Garuda can be applied to a clubbing session. Maybe it can remind us to make good decisions!”

Along the same street is Farzi Café which is packed pretty much every evening. Inside, the architecture is an amalgam of stone and steel while the outside offers a breath of fresh air... or rather, as much as one can can get in the centre of Jubilee Hills. The rich green vertical gardens have become a strange but welcome attraction for their eco-friendly appeal.

Sateesh Polkam, general manager at Farzi Café, says the garden has a fantastic look both in day and at night. “It’s roughly 8,000 square-feet and took a month to complete with all the irrigation system details. It is also functional, as it cools down the exterior patio by a few degrees which is helpful in the summer. We wanted to do our bit in giving back and promoting these gardens is easy and sends a positive message. Plus, when everything in the area lacks greenery, we wanted to create a space for exactly that.”

Financial District, ironic with its name, has become quite the club proprietor’s playground due to the real estate available. After all, after several hours of being desk-bound, a nearby club is ideal for letting go. One of these places is Prism Club & Kitchen which is about a year old. On week-nights, when it’s a little quiet, it can be anticlimactic to go there. The vast space of the indoor setting is meant for brimming crowds only, and when this happens, the property takes on a crazed character.

White pine: Wood carvers have often been commissioned for wood sculptures to invoke a sense of nature. White pine has been favoured for carving and durability after finished.

Prism’s architecture makes the most of the trippy genre of clubs, using lights and technology. Hanging from the ceiling is a cluster of concentric rings of different sizes, all with lights flashing in patterns and sequences. The lights are operated and automated at different times through a particular night to supplement the musical experience. Usually, it is discouraged to wear sunglasses in a nightclub but for this flashing experience, it is worth donning a pair when it gets a little too intense. Rather than using a simple show-piece, the team at Prism have ensured that their space is interactive from ceiling to floor.

Yash Agarwal, an engineer in Financial District, likes to call himself ‘a loyalty member’ at Prism. “It is inspiring when business are also having a blast with what they have created themselves,” he says, “because I see a lot of club owners laze about once their property is running, but the team here wants to elevate that. The rings of light is a great choice; I love it when the lights flash in accordance with the bass drops on an EDM night.”

So next time you are at a club, be sure to be attuned to your surroundings. The role of architects in nightclubs has grown and sometimes, it becomes even a point of pride.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/5wer7f/article30791288.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy06-PRISM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/hyderabad-nightclubs-single-artpieces-trend-in-design/article30791294.ece
39,2020/02/11,A.R. Rahman set to launch anthem on climate change,"Music composer A.R. Rahman is all set to launch an anthem for ‘Hands around the World’ project along with international composers on global warming and climate change.

The song would be launched as part of the project that is aimed at raising awareness on climate change in a few months. The music composer is pitching in for the initiative of humanitarian Ken Kragen.

Speaking to the media ahead of the ‘Water Matters’ exhibition that opened at Periyar Science and Technology Centre on Monday, he said “Every person must have access to tap water irrespective of whether they are rich or poor. I am here to support the exhibition that would inspire youngsters and bring change.”

Basic right

Pointing out that water is a basic right, Mr. Rahman said it must be given priority to achieve the goal of clean water to all. The music composer, who is U.N. Ambassador for the 2015 Millennium Development Goals, also spoke at the inauguration of the exhibition organised by U.S. Consulate General in cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution Travelling Exhibition Service and Care Earth Trust.

Did you know that the use of biological materials like cotton thread is sometimes sufficient and simple, natural way to purify muddy water. The exhibition that is on till February 29 has many such surprises to offer.

Besides 53 panels on various aspects, including on south Chennai aquifer, challenges and solutions related to water management, the exhibition features interesting installations like different methods used to draw groundwater and ‘5 Kudam Vandi’, a wheeled trolley fitted with five pots to carry water and is part of bridal trousseau in Ramanathapuram district.

At the inauguration, K.P. Anbalagan, Minister for Higher Education, highlighted government projects, including a new desalination plant coming up in Nemmeli and said everyone had a collective responsibility to secure waterbodies. The Education Department gave priority to water related research studies.

On ‘Water Matters’, U.S. Consul General in Chennai Robert Burgess said it was part of an initiative to foster discussion about technological innovations and share ideas and inspire youngsters about water management.

Several water-themed events are being held across the city.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/q3rec1/article30787049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11CLIMATEANTHEM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/ar-rahman-set-to-launch-anthem-on-climate-change/article30787050.ece
40,2020/02/11,"Vada Chennai Vizha subverted convention, presenting Bharatanatyam, therukoothu and parai attam on the same stage","A narrow by-lane, lined on either side by small shops, teems with people. Only, instead of traffic chairs occupy the road: arranged row by row, at the end of which is an unassuming elevation for a stage. We are at Korukkupet’s MGR Nagar, where Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha’s Vada Chennai Vizha is underway.

The audience is an organic mix of locals who go about their daily chores (unpeturbed by what is going on) and visitors who have specifically come to celebrate the evening. And no doubt, a celebration, it is. Food stalls captained by women from the community, displaying home cooked fare, groups of children dancing unabashedly to gaana tunes belted out on stage — everything about the atmosphere screams festive.

The vizha’s deliberate attempt to subvert convention and set examples, rightly manifests itself through the line up of performances. The choice of venue is testament to the same.

This year, a lot of back and forth with the local community regarding their likes and interests was done during the curation, says Sangeetha Sivakumar, one of the volunteers. “We made sure that we don’t go and impose on them. Besides, a lot of the events were also shortened in duration,” says Sangeetha.

A bite of North Atho, kozhukattai, paniyaram and beef kozhambu were some of the gems that the food stalls offered. Equipped with multiple steel plates and fairly big cauldrons, the women from the locality who are also part of the Arunodhaya trust had arrived at 5 pm to feed the crowd. Some were live counters. For instance, the Atho stall had women working almost mechanically: mixing ingredients at the speed of light, for audience and performers alike. Apart from snacks, guests were also provided with dinner fare including rotis.

The evening began with parai attam by the residents of Avvai Girls Home from Besant Nagar. Conceived as an art form performed only by men, this percussive drum is played during funerals. The parai-wielding girls, donning brightly coloured striped saris, set a powerful tone, proving that this folk form (which is often looked down on and considered inauspicious) can also be a marker of celebrations.

It is not just the girls. Amidst the crowd, a group of enthusiastic boys start grooving to the tunes of singer ‘gaana’ Muthu (and troupe), as soon as he begins.

North Chennai’s relationship with gaana and kuthu traditions go a long way back. So, it is not surprising that the crowd visibly relates to these performances. His songs — with strong undertones that question caste hierarchy and its effect on the society — also touch upon the social discrimination that certain communities still face. Similarly, in an attempt to hone local talent, kazhiyal aatam, performed by the Arunodhaya Youth Cultural team, provides a glimpse into the folk art form which draws from traditional war tactics. On the percussion are the boys, while the girls display their martial arts skills with sticks on hand.

Bharatanatyam is not a genre that North Chennai is exposed to very often. Which is precisely why the volunteers of the festival made it a point to include it in the line up. To thunderous applause, the dancers of Indisha Fine Arts and Trust performed in three different acts. Following this, the veteran therukoothu group, Purisai Duraisami Kannappa Thambiran Parambarai Therukoothu Manram, narrated the story of Abhimanyu, through the high-energy traditional form, peppered with movements, choral interludes and song.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/6nds2v/article30792781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MPCHENNAIKALAITHERUVIZHA3,https://www.thehindu.com/society/vada-chennai-vizha-subverted-convention-presenting-bharatanatyam-therukoothu-and-parai-attam-on-the-same-stage/article30792782.ece
41,2020/02/11,‘An Engineered Dream’ explores the claustrophobic world of Kota’s IIT coaching centres,"“This period of nine months is similar to the nine months you were in your mother’s womb… Forget everything else, just remember your parents’ faces the day you left them to come here. You are doing this for them.”

An IIT-coaching academy teacher based in Kota utters these words to a bunch of 17 and 18-year-olds huddled together, in one of the opening scenes of An Engineered Dream. And it hits us then — the devastating similarities between preparing for IIT in Kota and indoctrination.

The movie won Best Documentary at Indie Film Festival Chennai, held over the past weekend. An Engineered Dream follows the lives of four teenagers travelling from different corners of India to Kota, the city famous for its coaching centres, in Rajasthan.

Here, for almost a year, they cage themselves in cubicle-sized rooms in order to prepare for entrance to the Indian Institutes of Technology — “One of the toughest undergraduate engineering exams in the world with an acceptance rate of less than 1%,” says director Hemant Gaba, who was in the city for the festival.

His vision was not to question the hard work that goes into preparing for an exam, but “whether you made that choice after being exposed to all possibilities available to you,” he says. “Is this your dream, or was this given to you? Hence, the title of the fim: An Engineered Dream.”

Building claustrophobia

Inside the four walls of the coaching centres of Kota, the pressure is immense. Former rank holders are brought in to meet the current batches, and are celebrated for not having any other hobbies. Despite being in the company of 1,50,000 other students who come to Kota every year, according to the documentary, loneliness is a recurring issue.

Sincere questions of lust and love among hormonal teenagers are brushed off with an offhand “Concentrate on your career now, love can come later” — a philosophy that the students have taken to heart, and repeat in front of the cameras. But in private phone calls with their parents and friends, the cracks in the armour begin to appear.

As the exam date comes closer, the sense of claustrophobia rises. In a harrowing montage, Hemant shows us multiple doors locked from the inside, with sticky notes of ‘Do not call, do not knock, I am dead’ put up.

To shoot this movie, Hemant spoke to many students across Kota for a year, staying in a hostel with one of his subjects in the movie. “We would wait two days to get access for one hour. But once we had that, we would try and create a good relationship between the students, so that they don’t think of us as outsiders,” says Hemant, adding that his editor even stayed with one of the girl students’ family in Surat for a few days.

However, not all hostels were compliant, so Hemant had to have one of the students, S, film himself with a camcorder, vlog style. This initial disadvantage gave rise to what has become the soul of the movie: his boyish ramblings either alone in his room, trying to study, or with his friends, goofing off, are some of the purest scenes in the movie.

The sarcastic teenager gives us the biggest laughs by praying to Donald Trump for starting the Third World War before the IIT exam, and in the very next moment silences that laughter by wondering out loud, the possibility of killing himself. A reminder that, between 2013 and 2018, 77 students had taken their lives in the city, as per government data.

On the other hand is the second protagonist — portrayed as a textbook good boy, who parrots his parents’ opinions. Asked why he wants to ‘crack IIT’ or ‘do MBA after’, he looks at his father with a blank smile, who quickly prompts an answer.

Sometimes, admits Hemant, “I felt guilty about using the students to drive home a point.” But then, he adds, “It was a point that I had to make.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/hn7rxo/article30792719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AnEngineeredDreamFilmStill1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/an-engineered-dream-claustrophobic-world-of-kotas-iit-coaching-centres/article30792722.ece
42,2020/02/11,50% of new 3-wheelers sold by 2024 will be e-autos:study,"As much as 43-48% of new three-wheelers (excluding e-rickshaws), and 12-17% of new two-wheelers sold in India will be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2024, said a study by Crisil Research.

But traction may be low for four-wheelers with only 5% of new sales likely to be EVs, it added.

Looking at demand, supply and policy growth drivers for EVs such as battery costs, government subsidy and charging infrastructure, the study said that faster adoption of two- and three-wheelers would be a function of cost.

Typically, electric scooters are cheaper to run compared with ICE scooters. And e-autos are cheaper to both own and run compared with their ICE counterparts.

“Supply will also be a critical factor for adoption. The top five electric two-wheeler manufacturers are expected to increase their capacity for electric variants from 0.4 million units in fiscal 2020 to over 3 million units by fiscal 2024. And in three-wheelers, even incumbent original equipment manufacturers are launching e-autos at a rapid pace. But low-speed, four seater e-rickshaws are fast emerging as an alternative to e-autos because of being 30% cheaper,” said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research.

On the other hand, sales of personal electric cars will remain low due to high acquisition and ownership costs, in the absence of demand incentives. Cab aggregators, however, would opt for EVs as these will provide better operational economies and subsidies.

A cab aggregator e-car that runs 50,000 km a year, for instance, can save about ₹1.65 lakh a year compared with the ₹35,000 for a personal e-car that runs 10,000 km a year.

The Crisil Research study said that in the commercial vehicles space, subsidies to State transport undertakings will drive sales of electric buses for intra-city operations. But poor public charging infrastructure will impact adoption.

“The government has created a policy push for EVs with the second instalment of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles in India, or FAME II policy, and numerous efficiency and emission regulations,” Pushan Sharma, Associate Director, CRISIL Research.

“However, India has much catching up to do in terms of the four drivers of growth globally – battery price, demand incentives, supply push, and charging infrastructure. That means policy implementation will be crucial to faster adoption of EVs in India,” he said.

CRISIL Research expects the landed cost of lithium ion battery, a key driver of EV adoption in India, to come down in line with an expected drop in global prices by fiscal 2024.

Execution of the government’s phased manufacturing programme for EV batteries, too, will help drive down battery prices, it said.

Till then, EV adoption will be gradual, giving auto component manufacturers enough time to realign their operations, it added.

46,2020/02/11,IDBI Bank again posts loss,"IDBI Bank posted a net loss of ₹5,763 crore for the quarter ended December 31,2019 on account of a one- time hit of ₹6,273 crore for exercising the option for lower tax, compared with a loss of ₹4,185 crore reported during the same period of the previous year.

This was the 13th straight quarterly loss for the lender.

However,the bank posted profit before tax for the first time in 13 quarters, which was ₹756 crore.

Rakesh Sharma, MD and CEO, IDBI Bank, said the lender has made an accelerated provision of ₹1,679 crore during the quarter.

This helped the bank to lower ratio of non-performing assets (NPAs) to 5.25% from the 14.01% in the year-ago period and 5.97% a quarter ago. With this, the bank is hopeful of coming out of the restrictions under prompt corrective action of the Reserve Bank of India.

Net NPA of 6% is a trigger for such restriction.

NPA ratio still high

The gross NPA of the bank is 28.72% as at December end compared with the 29.67% a year ago. Mr. Sharma said the the ratio remained high as the bank’s loan book contracted as it was unable to grow its assets due to PCA restrictions.

“Recovery during the quarter, which was ₹3,136 crore, was higher than the slippages, which was ₹2,113 crore,” Mr. Sharma said.

Total recovery, including from written off accounts and upgradation, was over ₹3,500 crore.

Loans to DHFL Slippages during the quarter include loans to Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) and Jain Irrigation. Going ahead, the bank expects slippages to remain within ₹800 crore a quarter.

47,2020/02/11,"M&M Korean arm draws up ₹3,000 cr. turnaround plan","Korean automaker SsangYong Motor Company, a subsidiary of Mahindra & Mahindra, which is currently facing steep headwinds and losses in its domestic market and worsened by the coronavirus syndrome now, has drawn up a three-year turnaround plan to get back to profitability by 2022.

The plan includes ways to reduce capex, considering synergies between SsangYong Motor Company and Ford Motors and developing new markets in Russia and Vietnam to increase export volumes, Pawan Goenka, MD of Mahindra & Mahindra and Chairman of SsangYong Motor Company said.

He said the company expected a funding of 450 to 500 billion Korean Won (up to ₹3,000 crore), through a combination of equity and borrowing for a full recovery.

“We do hope that this funding would be arranged by March end. The three-year recovery plan has been approved by the company board,” Dr. Goenka said.

SsangYong is in talks with the Korea Development Bank (KDB) to raise the funds. However, a clear picture on the approval of the funding is yet to emerge. Mr. Goenka said considering the current market situation it would be untenable for a full recovery for SsangYong during calendar year 2020, but a full recovery could be expected in 2022.

SsangYong has been hit hard by its diesel heavy portfolio as well as geopolitical factors, which impacted key markets such as Iran and Egypt. The company is now looking at markets such as Russia and Vietnam to boost exports in addition to rationalising capex.

“Material cost reduction would fetch the company 80-90 billion Won in two years which should help achieve an improvement of 2-3% in SsangYong’s operating margins,” Mr. Goenka said.

Going forward, SsangYong is also expected to work closely as part of the alliance with Ford to develop two SUVs — codenamed CSUV and the BSUV — on all new platforms. The Mahindra-Ford partnership has just received the Competition Commission of India’s (CCI) clearance for the joint venture.

On the domestic market, Mr. Goenka said the spread of coronavirus may have some impact since some parts are imported from China.

For faster and cost effective roll-out of electric vehicles in India, Mr. Goenka has offered all Indian OEMs, namely Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, to ‘co-own’ Mahindra Electric, which has acquired considerable expertise in this field.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/fw3h8y/article30794726.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12THBUPAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/mm-korean-arm-draws-up-3000-cr-turnaround-plan/article30794727.ece

China recorded a daily drop in new cases, offering a glimmer of hope that the epidemic might be peaking. It has so far killed more than 1,000 people, with concerns growing over how damaging its impact would be on the world's second largest economy.

China's top medical adviser on the outbreak said the epidemic may peak in February and then plateau before easing.

“It seems that markets have assumed the worst is over with regards to the coronavirus,” said Piotr Matys, emerging markets FX strategist at Rabobank.

50,2020/02/11,China steel traders hold off post-holiday buys as coronavirus saps demand,"Steel traders in China are holding off returning to the market for their usual post-Lunar New Year purchases, their appetites dampened by sluggish demand from a construction sector hit by the outbreak of a flu-like virus.

The coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000, was first discovered in December in Hubei province and has forced China to limit public activities and cut transport links as it spread across the country.

The epidemic is expected to hurt the world's second-largest economy, with a government economist and other analysts saying that China's first-quarter economic growth may dip below 5%.

China's containment measures have also weighed on a seasonal pick-up in demand for construction steel, forcing traders - who typically replenish stock after the holiday period - to hold back purchases because of the uncertain economic outlook.

A trader in the eastern city of Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, said demand usually recovers after the Lantern Festival, which fell this year on Feb. 8.

“But this year is special,” he said. “There's no construction activity ... Who would buy at this time?”

This trader and three others, all requesting anonymity as they are not authorised to speak to media, said they haven't bought any steel products recently and expect their post-holiday restocking to be postponed until the virus is under control.

Steel product inventories held by traders in China - at 16.33 million tonnes on Feb. 6 - are already at their highest since March 2019, data compiled by Mysteel consultancy showed, indicating they already have sufficient stocks.

Logistical constraints, with many provinces restricting road transport to control spread of the virus, have added to the pressure on the sector, making it more difficult to bring in raw materials and ship out steel products.

“There's downward pressure on steel prices, which means mills' profits will be compressed,” said Richard Lu, an analyst with CRU metals consultancy in Beijing, adding that some mills will cut output out of profitability and supply concerns.

Benchmark construction steel rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange, for May delivery, plunged nearly 10% from Jan. 20 to Feb. 3, as the coronavirus broke out of Hubei province and spread across China and around the world.

While the rebar futures have rebounded 2.7% on Tuesday, demand in spot markets for steel products and iron ore remained weak amid industry shutdowns in China, said Helen Lau, a metals and mining analyst at Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong.

Hunan Valin Steel Co Ltd, listed arm of Hunan's biggest steelmaker Valin Group, told an interactive platform run by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange that it would “consider cutting production when necessary”.

Weekly utilisation rates at blast furnaces in 247 mills were at 77.76% as of Feb. 7, down from 80.01% before the holidays and the lowest since early November, according to Mysteel.

The China Iron and Steel Association said last week the sector is “not promising” this quarter, but it expects a recovery in the second quarter with the implementation of government stimulus measures.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/g8dybc/article30791027.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THBUMANUFACTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/china-steel-traders-hold-off-post-holiday-buys-as-coronavirus-saps-demand/article30791189.ece

The forecast includes a mix of new orders and conversions from other models, Airbus Head of Marketing Francois Caudron told reporters at the Singapore Airshow.

Airbus, which launched the A321XLR last year, has already sold more than 450, including to Asian clients such as Malaysia's AirAsia Group Bhd and Australia's Qantas Airways Ltd.

Mr. Caudron said customers in the region were being hit hard by the downturn in traffic due to the coronavirus epidemic, but he declined to comment if any had requested to defer deliveries.

“Coronavirus is a crisis,” he said. “I would just remind ourselves we are in a very resilient industry.”

Mr. Caudron said airlines were not panicking and were looking beyond the short term in terms of orders.

“When you order an aircraft it is not for the next six months,” he said. “It is for the next 20 years.”

52,2020/02/11,"World Bank not considering new China loans to fight coronavirus, president says","The World Bank is offering technical assistance to China to help battle the coronavirus epidemic but no new loans, the development lender's president, David Malpass, said on Monday.

Malpass told Reuters the bank was working with the World Health Organization (WHO) to aid China, including offering advice about past health crises, but did not plan any financial assistance because China has ample resources of its own.

“My thought is that we all wish them a speedy way to address the coronavirus in China,” he said in an interview on Monday. ”We’ve offered technical assistance in the area of health, sanitation and disease policies.”

Formed after World War Two to rebuild Europe, the World Bank has some $470 billion in assets and counts China among its largest borrowers, with $14.8 billion in loans committed since 2011. China is also the bank's third largest shareholder after the United States and Japan.

“China has its own large international reserves,” and new loans are not being considered at this time, said Mr. Malpass, a former Trump administration Treasury official who took over as World Bank president last April.

China reported that it held $3.115 trillion in foreign exchange reserves in January.

In a Jan. 29 statement, Mr. Malpass expressed sympathy for losses suffered by the Chinese people, adding: “This is a severe public health challenge for China and the rest of the world. It calls for ongoing coordinated action and continued transparency inside China and around the world.”

He said the World Bank's experts were in discussions with Chinese authorities and could provide immediate assistance on disease surveillance, food safety, lessons from previous pandemics and analysis of the outbreak's impact on China's economy.

Inside China, more than 300 companies from food delivery services to smartphone makers are seeking more than $8.2 billion in loans to ease the impact of the coronavirus, banking sources told Reuters.

Economic growth is expected to slow to 5% or less this quarter because of the virus, one Chinese government economist estimates.

Malpass declined to offer an estimate of the effect of the crisis on China's or the world's economic growth. He said it was too early to say if the World Bank's already tepid full-year forecast would be cut.

“Clearly, coronavirus is slowing growth in the first half of 2020. What the long-term consequences are well have to see as the response occurs and the adjustments are made,” he said. ”China is just coming back from a long Lunar New Year holiday, so well have to evaluate the growth.”

TOO WEALTHY

Since taking his job at the Treasury in 2017, Malpass had been critical of the World Bank's continued low-interest lending to China, arguing that the world's second-largest economy was too wealthy for such aid while it was loading up some countries with debt from its Belt and Road infrastructure program.

A former Bear Stearns and Co chief economist who advised President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, Mr. Malpass has called for more of the bank's resources to be devoted to poorer countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

A Feb. 3 World Bank pledge to review financial resources that could be deployed quickly was aimed at poorer countries that could be affected by the pandemic, a bank official said.

China agreed to a decline in borrowing as part of reforms associated with a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank approved by shareholders in 2018.

The World Bank in December adopted a new five-year China plan that calls for $1 billion to $1.5 billion in annual lending, down from a $1.8 billion annual average over the previous five years..

Mr. Malpass said lending to China in the 2020 fiscal year, which ends June 30, would likely fall below that range.

Although the bank is “winding down” its lending to China under terms of a 2018 capital increase, the bank would grant financing for certain “global public goods,” Malpass said.

These include environmental projects, private sector development and reforms to state-owned enterprises.

The only new China financing approved by the World Bank so far in fiscal 2020 is a $150 million loan towards a $686 million project to sustain forests in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River basin.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/1q82ks/article30790673.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/world-bankjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/world-bank-not-considering-new-china-loans-to-fight-coronavirus-president-says/article30790656.ece
53,2020/02/11,Out of bounds,"The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s announcement, on Sunday, that the Cauvery delta region would be declared a ‘Protected Special Agriculture Zone’ is a real bonanza for the State’s farmers (Page 1, “Cauvery delta to be declared a protected agriculture zone”, February 10). The declaration that hydrocarbon units would be kept at arm’s-length is a good move to safeguard the fertility of the land. But the declaration, which is a bold move, will not be complete unless a special law is enacted based on this announcement. The State government should also cancel hydrocarbon projects awarded, if any, in the proposed protected area.

D. Sethuraman,

Chennai

For once the State government cannot be run down as being spineless. One wonders whether the party’s recent poll performances have shaped the announcement. In the end, agriculture will get a boost, and Tamil Nadu’s rice bowl saved. It would be the height of folly to destroy a fertile region of immense ecological importance. The government should withdraw the cases filed against environmentalists and farmers who protested against hydrocarbon exploration projects.

G. David Milton,

The decision is baffling. Why has it been so late especially after much damage has already been done in different parts of the region? Does the decision to go against a scheme which has the blessings of the central government one to be believed? And why attack the Opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam? It is a well-known fact that the two main parties survive in Tamil Nadu where each accuses the other. One hopes that this is not an election stunt.

Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold the “Kem chho Trump” (Howdy Trump) event at the stadium with approximately 1.25 lakh people witnessing the special programme aimed at showcasing the Modi-Trump bonhomie.

Mr. Trump will be accompanied by First Lady Melania Trump. According to senior officials in Gandhinagar, Mr. Trump will fly directly to Ahmedabad where Mr. Modi will receive him at the airport. They will then visit the Sabarmati Ashram where the Prime Minister will take the President and the First Lady around in the sprawling Ashram, including Hriday Kunj, Gandhiji’s house, where they will operate a spinning wheel (charkha).

During their visit to the Ashram, Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite hymn, “Vaishnav Jan to” will be played in the background music.

From the Ashram, the Prime Minister will accompany the President and the First Lady to the main event at the stadium in the evening. The event includes a series of cultural pieces curated by high-profile agencies and artistes.

City gears up

Preparations have been under way in Ahmedabad for the last two weeks with different agencies assigned tasks, including decorating the areas near the Sabarmati Ashram and the cricket stadium, sprucing up roads. The Home Department is making elaborate security arrangements for the VIP event.

SJE Minister of State Ramdas Athawale replied to the question asked by Bharatiya Janata Party MPs Anil Firojiya, Mohanbhai Kalyanjibhai Kundariya and Lallu Singh about the incidents of manual scavenging, which is banned under the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.

National survey

The reply said a total of 14,559 manual scavengers had been identified by Municipalities and Gram Panchayats in 13 States from 2013-2014 till January 31, 2020. Apart from that, a national survey was conducted in 194 districts in 18 States where 48,345 manual scavengers were identified till January 31, taking the total to 62,904.

While saying “there have been no reports regarding death of persons due to manual scavenging”, the Minister’s reply stated that the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis had received reports about the death of people cleaning sewers and septic tanks.

According to the Commission’s reports, 2019 saw the highest number of cases in the past five years, with 110 deaths. The reports showed that there had been 68 deaths in 2018, 93 in 2017, 48 in 2016 and 57 in 2015. These cases were reported from 18 States and Union Territories, while 13 States and UTs submitted “nil reports”.

‘Nil reports’

Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Odisha, Jharkhand, Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, Sikkim, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Puducherry, Lakshwadeep, Meghalaya, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands submitted “nil reports” from 2015 till 2019.

The Minister said the main cause for manual scavenging were insanitary latrines that required to be cleaned by hand.

56,2020/02/11,CBI gives clean chit to Rakesh Asthana in a case of bribery,"The CBI on Tuesday filed a chargesheet in a case of alleged bribery against its former second-in-command Rakesh Asthana and others, giving a clean chit to him and another official. “The chargesheet has been filed against accused Manoj Prasad. The investigation has not revealed any role of public servants. Responses to the letters rogatory sent overseas are still awaited,” said a CBI official.

The move came a day before the matter was to come up in the Delhi High Court which, in January, pulled up the CBI for the delay and set a four-week deadline for submission of the charge sheet in the lower court.

The FIR in the matter was lodged in October 2018 amid a turf war between then CBI chief Alok Kumar Verma and his deputy that saw both of them accusing each other of corruption and misconduct. Both were shunted by the government following a Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) recommendation.

The FIR named Mr. Asthana; the then CBI Deputy Superintendent of Police, Devender Kumar; Dubai-based investment banker Manoj; and his brother, Somesh Prasad, as accused.

It was alleged that Hyderabad-based businessman Sana Sathish Babu had paid over Rs.3 crore in bribe to get relief in a case against meat exporter Moin Qureshi.

The CBI, which arrested Manoj on October 16, 2018, got Mr. Babu's statement recorded before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, alleging that bribes were paid in five instalments.

According to the FIR, Mr. Babu was summoned in the Qureshi case multiple times for questioning. During a trip to Dubai, he met Manoj, who allegedly introduced him to his brother for getting relief. It was alleged that Somesh, after talking to a CBI official on phone, demanded Rs.3 crore as initial sum and Rs.2 crore after the filing of the charge sheet.

After Mr. Verma was stripped of his powers on October 23, 2018, he approached the Supreme Court, which reinstated him with the condition that he would not take any major policy decision till the high-powered committee led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided the question of his divestment.

Within hours of being reinstated, in January 2019, the committee removed Mr. Verma, based on the CVC findings. He was then given the charge of Director-General Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards, which he refused to take up.

In July 2019, the Enforcement Directorate arrested Mr. Babu in the money laundering case against Mr. Qureshi, who has been accused of receiving money from several people on the pretext of getting favours from public servants holding influential positions in the government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ylcgci/article30794985.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12ASTHANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cbi-gives-clean-chit-to-rakesh-asthana-in-a-case-of-bribery/article30794986.ece

58,2020/02/11,Analysis | Defeat of BJP in Delhi election points to lack of strong face and local narrative in States,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) sixth consecutive loss in an Assembly poll — although the party managed to form a government in Haryana — points now to a very real problem for the party going into Assembly polls. Whether in a direct fight with the Congress or a regional player like the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the BJP’s performance in State elections has been sub par as per its own previous records. The Indian voter across States seems to be making a very clear distinction between State and national-level elections, as made clear even by the Assembly polls in Odisha, where the Biju Janata Dal’s (BJD) Naveen Patnaik won a record fifth term in the midst of a Modi wave.

PM’s campaign

Newly elected BJP president J.P. Nadda does have a problem on his hands as the State-level narrative of the party has not been as appealing as that of Prime Minister Modi at the national level, so much so that even Mr. Modi’s campaign in Jharkhand and Haryana did not manage to lift the party’s fortunes (more so in Jharkhand than Haryana, to be honest).

One reason put forward by BJP seniors is the fact that State units in both Jharkhand and Delhi have had festering issues of infighting, as did the the Maharashtra unit of the party going into the polls. Many of these issues were not addressed and, specifically in Delhi, it was felt that while Lok Sabha MP Manoj Tiwari was made State unit chief as a concession to the large number of Poorvanchali votes, it was the old Punjabi leadership of the BJP that prevailed. “Even when issues are addressed, it has been cosmetic,” said a source. He pointed out to the announced merger of the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (P) led by the Babulal Marandi with the BJP, to be done on February 17, as a case in point. “This should have been done much earlier,” he said.

Opposition’s advantage

According to political analyst Rahul Verma, co-author of the well-regarded book Ideology and Identity, the BJP going into polls without Prime Minister Modi’s strong presence is a problem for the party. “Prime Minister Modi is the most charismatic face that the BJP has and has a proven record of affecting the vote, but when it comes to faces in the State level, the Opposition has an advantage, which is going to be the case in the upcoming elections too,” he said.

The most important point, apart from the lack of a strong face in States, is also the lack of a local narrative for the BJP, making it rely on national issues time and again. “Every election has one narrative that dominates over another and in the last few elections, the Opposition’s narrative has been strong both in terms of aspiration and performance. That has been true whether the party comes up against the Opposition’s Chief Minister or contender,” said a senior BJP leader. “Organisationally, the party is a well-oiled machine, but that is never enough to win polls. You need a story that the people identify with, and Prime Minister Modi’s story is about national aspirations,” said the source.

Just as important

While the national narrative of the BJP is in no peril, State elections are just as important if the BJP wants to dominate Indian politics, as well as subsequent numbers in the Rajya Sabha.

59,2020/02/11,Bhim Army chief moves Supreme Court to review February 7 judgment,"Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad on Tuesday moved the Supreme Court for a review of its February 7 judgment reiterating the settled law that an individual cannot claim reservation in promotion as a fundamental right.

The judgment by a Bench led by Justice L. Nageswara Rao is based on a series of Constitution Bench verdicts, from the Indira Sawhney case in 1992 to M. Nagaraj judgment in mid-2000s.

However, Mr. Aazad has argued in his review petition that the Februay judgment would ""act as a tool in the hands of the oppressors to further oppress and exploit the SC, ST, OBC and the economically weaker sections, causing further marginalisation within the society, thereby defeating the endeavor to bring equality between the citizens of this country by the framers of our Constitution particularly those of Baba Sahab Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar"".

The apex court Bench of Justices Rao and Hemant Gupta had observed that State governments were not bound to make reservations. Even the courts cannot issue a mandamus directing States to provide reservations.

""There is no doubt that the State Government is not bound to make reservations. There is no fundamental right which inheres in an individual to claim reservation in promotions. No mandamus can be issued by the Court directing the State Government to provide reservations,"" the apex court had observed in its February 7 verdict.

Citing Constitution Bench precedents which has settled the law, the court said Articles 16 (4) and 16 (4-A) of the Constitution do not confer individuals with a fundamental right to claim reservations in promotion.

Article 16 (4) and 16 (4-A) empower the State to make reservation in matters of appointment and promotion in favour of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only ""if in the opinion of the State they are not adequately represented in the services of the State"".

60,2020/02/11,Supreme Court to hear plea of Omar Abdullah’s sister on February 12,"A petition filed by the sister of the former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah, Sara Abdullah Pilot, is scheduled to be heard by a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice N.V. Ramana on February 12. She has approached the court against the government's move to charge him under the Public Safety Act (PSA).

The other judges on the Bench are Justices Mohan M. Shantanagoudar and Sanjiv Khanna.

Ms. Pilot has urged for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus to the authorities to forthwith produce Mr. Abdullah before the court and set him at liberty.

The petition, represented by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gopal Sankaranarayanan, was mentioned before a Bench led by Justice Ramana on Monday.

Ms. Pilot has said she was gravely concerned about the welfare, safety and security of her brother. He was already under detention from August 5 last - the day the Centre removed the special rights of the Kashmiri people under Article 370 - when the PSA was slapped on him on February 5, 2020.

Also Read Omar’s sister challenges PSA charge against him in SC

Ms. Pilot has said she was shocked to learn that just like what happened to their father, the government has imposed a fresh lease of detention under the PSA on her brother too.

She has noted that Mr. Abdullah's detention from August 5 under Section 107 CrPC (security for keeping the peace) was scheduled to end on February 5. His release was imminent. He had served the maximum period of detention.

On February 5, the Executive Magistrate, instead of releasing him, ordered his further detention under Section 8 of the PSA of 1978 in an “arbitrary exercise of power”.

Ms. Pilot asked what was the point of detaining a man already detained through the long months of lockdown suffered across J&K.

In fact, she has said, in the past six months, there had been no effort by authorities to verify the truth behind the “information” that Mr. Abdullah is a threat to peace. In fact, on the other hand, there are reams of material in the form of tweets and public statements vouching for his exemplary conduct to maintain peace.

Ms. Pilot has urged there is danger to her brother's life and liberty.

The government, in its PSA dossier on Mr. Abdullah, has described him as a threat to public safety. It said he was “planning activities against the Union government”. It has also highlighted “his popularity and potential to draw voters to polling booths”.

The petition has argued that the detention order is illegal as it conflates 'governmental policy' with the 'Indian State', suggesting that any opposition to the former constitutes a threat to the latter.

“This is wholly antithetical to a democratic polity and undermines the Indian Constitution,” it has said.

Both the dossier and detention order contain “patently false and ridiculous material, essentially accusing the detenu of becoming a popular figure among general masses”. The grounds of detention are at best “illusory, vague and irrelevant”, Ms. Pilot has contended.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k0tmur/article30795455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12KASHMIRjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-of-omar-abdullahs-sister-on-february-12/article30793162.ece

Mr. Mehta made a chilling reference to how policemen who gunned down the four gang rape and murder accused in Hyderabad were cheered by people, calling the incident a symptom of people losing faith in the process of law.

“This case [Nirbhaya] is of 2012 and I am still struggling to execute the death sentence. They [convicts] are acting in tandem to misuse the law by filing one petition after the other… People will stop having faith in the judicial system. Seven years have gone by and the convicts are still playing the judicial system… It is in situations like this that people celebrate encounter killings,” Mr. Mehta submitted.

The hearing began with Justice Ashok Bhushan observing that the Delhi High Court’s seven-day deadline for the four convicts to exhaust their remedies was over. The government could very well go ahead and seek a fresh date for carrying out the executions.

“If nothing is pending, you can go back to the trial court and ask for issuance of a new date. Their petitions for review, curative and mercy petition have been dismissed... What is left now? What prevents you from going to the trial court?” Justice Bhushan asked Mr. Mehta.

The Solicitor General said convicts Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay have seemingly exhausted remedies. The fourth, Pawan Gupta, is yet to file a mercy petition.

Mr. Mehta said a plea to fix a new date for the executions in the trial court would immediately see one or the other of the four convicts move court in a bid to further prolong the process. As indicated, within a few hours of the hearing, Vinay moved the Supreme Court challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by the President.

Mr. Mehta stressed that the apex court should instead focus on the government’s appeal to allow the four convicts to be separately executed. The court issued notice to the four convicts on this point and scheduled a hearing for February 13.

The government has argued in the apex court that under the Delhi Prison Rules of 2018, the pendency of legal remedies or mercy petitions of other co-convicts would have no bearing on the fate of a convict whose plea for mercy had been rejected. It said the Rules did not prohibit the execution of the death sentence of co-convicts, one by one, on the rejection of their respective mercy petitions.

Deferring the execution of the death sentence of all the four convicts had led to “gross miscarriage of justice” to the victim’s family as well as society as a whole, the government contended.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7ps8th/article30067685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SupremeCourt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nirbhaya-case-convicts-execution-supreme-court-allows-government-to-approach-trial-court-for-fresh-date/article30792938.ece

Rohingya belong to Rakhine state in Mayanmar but more than a million have taken refuge in Bangladesh and some in India following an ethnic campaign of violence against them.

In a written reply, Mr. Rai said there are reports of some Rohingya migrants indulging in illegal activities.

Mr. Rai said the central government has issued periodic instructions to State governments requesting them to sensitise the law enforcement and intelligence agencies for taking appropriate steps for identification of illegal migrants, and their restriction to specified locations as per provisions of law.

The instructions also include capturing their biographic and biometric particulars, cancellation of fake Indian documents, and starting legal process, including initiation of deportation proceedings as per the provisions of law, he said.

Responding to another question on the number of Rohingya in India, Mr. Rai said “since illegal migrants enter into the country without valid travel documents in clandestine and surreptitious manner, the data regarding number of such illegal migrants living in the country is not maintained centrally.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hhdqdv/article30792623.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ROHINGYAREFUGEECAMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/india-bangladesh-have-agreed-on-need-for-expedited-repatriation-of-rohingya-migrants-mos-home/article30792624.ece

65,2020/02/11,Nirbhaya case: Vinay Sharma moves SC challenging rejection of mercy plea by President,"One of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, approached the Supreme Court on Tuesday challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by the President.

Sharma, through his counsel A P Singh, has also sought commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment.

President Ram Nath Kovind had on February 1 rejected the clemency plea of Vinay.

The trial court had on January 31 stayed “till further orders” execution of the four convicts in the case — Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.

Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition — the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. Pawan also has the option of filing a mercy plea.

The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ‘Nirbhaya’ (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

Six people including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile — were named as accused.

The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013.

Ram Singh, the prime accused, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years.

The juvenile was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. He, when released, was 20 years old.

Mobile internet services were suspended early in the morning as the authorities apprehended violence in the Valley in view of a bandh call given by separatist outfits to mark Bhat’s death anniversary, they said.

Authorities had restored 2G internet services in Kashmir on January 25, more than five months after snapping all communication facilities in the valley following the nullification of Article 370 on August 5 last year.

The internet services were suspended on Sunday as well as the separatists had called for a shutdown to mark the death anniversary of Parliament attack convict Mahammad Afzal Guru.

Police on Saturday lodged an FIR against the banned Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) for calling a strike on Guru’s death anniversary.

Guru was hanged in 2013 inside the Tihar jail in Delhi for his role in the Parliament attack in December 2001.

Bhat was hanged in 1984 and is buried inside the Tihar jail.

Normal life in Kashmir was affected due to the strike, officials said.

Markets and business establishments remained closed while most of the public transport was off the roads, they said.

Security personnel have been deployed in strength at vulnerable places in the city and elsewhere in the valley to maintain law and order, the officials said.

Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha also imposed a fine of Rs. 32 lakh on Thakur.

Six others were sentenced up to seven years in jail. Rosy Rani, who was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, has already served the term. Therefore, she has been released.

Dated February 10, 1929, J.R.D’s license, then called an ‘aviators certificate’, was issued by The Aero Club of India and Burma, an associate of the Royal Aero Club of Great Britain, which was authorised to issue licences by the British Empire’s Federation Aeronautique Internationale. The Aero Club of India and Burma was recognised by Federation Aeronautique Internationale as a sporting authority.

The certificate in itself was a beginning of Indian aviation, as many aviation historians have noted over time. Though not the first to register, J.R.D was the first Indian to pass out with ‘No. 1’ endorsed on his flying licence. Purushottam Meghji Kabali is by various aviator accounts considered to be the first Indian pilot.

Born on July 29, 1904, in Paris, J.R.D. launched India’s first airmail service in 1932, when he flew into Mumbai in a De Havilland Puss Moth from Karachi’s Drigh Road Aerodrome to the Juhu Airstrip via Ahmedabad on the basis of this flying license. This later became the country’s national carrier, Air India.

Capt Russi Bunsha, executive trustee, J. R. D. Tata Memorial Trust recalled that that planned flight was delayed by a month to October 15, 1932, as Juhu mud flats, where it would land was witness to heavy rainfall. “In in first year, Tata Air Mail made a profit of ₹ 60,000, while rose to ₹ 6 lakh by 1937,” Capt. Bunsha said referring to available records.

Arun Kumar, the current director general of the DGCA the aviation regulator was now issuing Commercial Pilots License online after verification of the log-book of the concerned flying training school, while Airline Transport Pilot’s License will go online in May. “As we say, we have miles to go before we sleep,” Mr. Kumar said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cos29m/article30785606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-JRD-TATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/as-indias-first-pilot-jrd-tata-set-countrys-aviation-sector-in-motion/article30785607.ece

The incident took place in Wagholi on the outskirts of the city between June and September last year. An officer said a similar case was pending against the accused in a police station in the city.

Assistant Commissioner of Police, Lashkar division, Ravindra Rasal said the accused used to stalk and harass the girl. “He told the girl that if she meets him once, he would not harass her again. He then took her to Wagholi and sexually assaulted her. He threatened to attacker her with and kill her family members if she disclosed the incident,” Mr. Rasal said. The accused also shot video of the act.

The girl later confided in a counsellor at her school, who then informed her family members. The police have withheld the name of the accused.

“A case was registered under Sections 376 and 354 and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act on February 8,” Mr. Rasal said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/man-held-for-stalking-raping-teen-in-pune/article30788282.ece
81,2020/02/11,"CAA protests | Respecting unity, integrity of country key fundamental duty: former CJI Ranjan Gogoi","Underlining that respecting the unity and integrity of the country is perhaps the “most important fundamental duty”, former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi on Monday said enough protests have been held opposing the new citizenship law and that people should not create “two parallel forums” when the Supreme Court has seized the matter.

Addressing students of the Gujarat National Law University, the former CJI also said everybody has the right to express views on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), but “the resolution of the issue must be through constitutional means”.

Referring to the protests over the CAA in his home State, Assam, the former CJI said there were elements who wanted to harm the integrity of the country, but the student community there called off the violent protests within days, which improved the law and order situation overnight.

“Perhaps the most important fundamental duty is the respect of the unity and integrity of the country. There are issues in this, and why hype them. The Citizenship Amendment Act ... it is an issue. You may have a view about it, I may have a view about it, and our views may not match. I have the right to express my view, you have the right to express your view. Fine. But the resolution must be through constitutional means,” he said.

The former CJI further said the matter (challenge to the CAA) is pending before the Supreme Court. He said, “Trust your judges. They will decide, according to the Constitution.”

Several petitions have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of the Act, including by RJD leader Manoj Jha, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi. “Protests have been held, viewpoints have been expressed. Enough. You cannot have two parallel forums, the Supreme Court and someone else,” he said.

On December 18 last year, the apex court had agreed to examine the constitutional validity of the CAA, but refused to stay its operation. Assam was the first State where protests broke out after the CAA was passed by Parliament. The amended law seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain and Parsi communities who came to the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan on or before December 31, 2014.

Referring to the students’ move to call off the protests in Assam, the former CJI said he had not yet seen such a “constructive role” played by students. He said, “The protests over the CAA were initiated from my State, because the problem of my State is different than the problems in the rest of the country. I had just retired and reached Guwahati. All of a sudden, there were protests. After five days of intense problems, the student community spearheading [the agitations] said we will call off our protests at 5 in the evening. No more protests. The law and order became all right overnight. This is the role of students.”

The former CJI said the moment the students called off the protests, there was no more violence and law and order problems. He said, “People were protesting, yes, but without violence. What is the moral of the story? There are elements who want to harm the integrity of the country. And the students solved it. These are the real leaders of the country.”

He also underlined the need to have a “fearless, independent and working judiciary” in the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/24bch0/article30788398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMRANJANGOGOI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/caa-protests-respecting-unity-integrity-of-country-key-fundamental-duty-former-cji-ranjan-gogoi/article30788399.ece
82,2020/02/11,"No shortage of funds for Siachen, say Army sources","Special areas such as the Siachen glacier “do not suffer from any shortage of funds”, and whenever required, funds are made available to cater to all requirements and exigencies, Army sources said on Monday, referring to a recent report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which flagged deficiencies in clothing, equipment and rations to soldiers on the world’s highest battlefield.

Individually kitted

“Presently, each soldier, prior to his induction to the Siachen glacier, is kitted with special clothing equipment worth over ₹1 lakh, along with auxiliary, medical and mountaineering equipment worth an additional ₹1.5 lakh,” a source said, while stating that there were no international benchmark standards for war fighting equipment for troop deployment in the glacier, and the Army conducted stringent field trials under actual operational conditions to clear each piece of clothing and equipment based on suitability.

The CAG, in a report tabled in the Parliament last week, had pulled up the Army for deficiencies in provisioning of special clothing, rations and housing for troops on the Siachen glacier for the audit period 2015-16 to 2017-18. According to the report, there was a critical shortage of snow goggles ranging from 62% to 98%, and troops were not issued “multi-purpose boots” from November 2015 to September 2016, leaving them to resort to recycling of available boots.

‘Comfort of troops’

On clothing and equipment, the source said that there was “no standard scaling of equipment” used in Siachen and procurement was done keeping in mind the comfort of the troops and the gravity of the situation. “The government has authorised a special scale of rations to all troops who are deployed above 12,000 ft. The government has also authorised procurement substitutes in accordance with the preference of the troops on a cost-to-cost basis,” the source said on the subject of rations, adding that, till date, the supply of rations had never been delayed or denied.

In addition, multiple factors like calorific, nutritional and medicinal requirements, and the taste and palate preference of troops of various ethnicities and regional composition, were kept in mind to overcome “anorexia syndrome”, a condition in which personnel were unable to consume food due to loss of appetite, the source stated.

Calorific values

On the calorific value of the rations also evaluated by the CAG, Army sources referred to an extensive study by the Defence Institute of Physiology & Allied Sciences (DIPAS) undertaken from 2013 to 2016, on the nutritional and physiological aspects of the ration scales for troops deployed above 12,000 ft., according to which whereas the energy expenditure was 4,270 Kcal, the total energy intake from the then provided rations was 5,350 Kcal.

On the special rations authorised for troops in high altitude areas to meet their daily energy requirements, the Central auditor had observed that substitutes in lieu of scaled items were authorised on a “cost to cost” basis, which resulted in the supply of a reduced quantity of substitutes that “compromised the calorie intake of the troops by as high as 82%”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8def68/article30785142.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SIACHEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-shortage-of-funds-for-siachen-say-army-sources/article30785143.ece
83,2020/02/11,Electrocution: Odisha CPI(M) files FIR against power company officials,"The Odisha CPI(M) on Monday filed an FIR against two top officials of the power distribution company, SOUTHCO utility, at the Baidyanathpur police station of Berhampur blaming them for the Sunday bus tragedy, caused by a low-hanging 11KV live wire, that claimed 10 lives.

State secretary Ali Kishor Patnaik filed the FIR against Chief Operating Officer (COO) of SOUTHCO P. Arun Kumar and its Authorised Officer (AO) Pradip Kumar Sahu. He demanded the arrest of the two officials for investigation and legal action. He termed the electrocution of the bus passengers a tragedy caused by human negligence.

Leading a team of senior party activists to the police station, he said it was the duty of SOUTHCO to properly maintain the 11KV power cables and their poles. “In 2008-09, the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) had cautioned that poles and cables in and around Berhampur were in a dilapidated condition and might lead to major accident. In the past 10 years, nothing had been done to rectify the problem.”

He also said the SOUTHCO authorities had not paid heed to the repeated complaints from the locals. Vacancies of posts of field staff since almost a decade and lack of proper maintenance as the work had mostly been outsourced also led to the accident.

The CPI(M) urged the police to investigate whether the road was suitable for bus journeys.

In 2013, Mr. Patnaik had filed an FIR in a Berhampur police station against the Reliance Infrastructure that was managing SOUTHCO at that time, alleging criminal negligence in managing power distribution after the Phailin cyclone and failure to restore power to the cyclone affected in time.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/electrocution-odisha-cpim-files-fir-against-power-company-officials/article30788208.ece
84,2020/02/11,5-nation exercise to focus on heritage structures’ protection,"The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) is building the capacity of its forces to play the role of first responder at heritage sites, which are vulnerable to disasters such as earthquake, flood, cyclone and tsunami across India.

“When Nepal suffered the loss of several heritage monuments in an earthquake, it was a cause for concern for the disaster management authorities across the world. Heritage sites need to be protected during disasters. We are going to build the capacity of our personnel,” said NDRF DGP Satya Narayan Pradhan here on Monday.

Mr. Pradhan was speaking ahead of the three-day Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Disaster Management Exercise beginning in Bhubaneswar and Konark from Tuesday.

Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Nepal are participating in the exercise while Bhutan and Thailand, where travel restrictions are in place, will be absent.

“The exercise is to test the emergency procedures for notification, preparedness and emergency response during major earthquake and flood scenarios. It will also test the multi-stakeholders’ coordination in a disaster scenario involving international, national, State, district and local agencies,” said Mr. Pradhan.

A village has been set up near Ramchandi in Puri district where around 40 motorboats and a helicopter would be pressed into service for the exercise.

There will be a set of personnel in each battalion of the NDRF who will get the basic training in preserving monuments in the pre and post disaster scenario.

More than 300 participants representing the five countries, all States, the UNDP, the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration Cultural Property (ICCROM), the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, the ASI, the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group and the IMD.

Mr. Pradhan said, “We want to finalise the basic premise for a guideline for preserving monuments. Many disaster response actions are likely to be codified.”

P. K.Jena, General Manager of the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority, said the State was also contemplating to train its response teams.

There are 3,686 Centrally protected monument sites under the ASI. Of these, 79 are located in Odisha. According to INTACH, close to 10,000 sites and buildings are protected. However, it has listed about 70,000 sites having heritage value in 500 towns. It says there could be 11 lakh sites in an estimated 8,000 towns and villages. Gujarat had witnessed damage at the heritage sites in the 2001 earthquake.

In the 2015 Nepal quake, 745 monuments had suffered damage including 133 razed to ground, 97 partially damaged and 515 in a minor way.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/5-nation-exercise-to-focus-on-heritage-structures-protection/article30784957.ece

“This was in sharp departure from the healthy practice of live coverage of the address of the Governor on earlier occasions. Further, the media was also kept away. Governor Dhankhar takes this as intolerant act and violation of the right of the people. This also compromises the right to expression,” a press statement from the Raj Bhavan said.

On the first day of the Budget session on February 7, the Governor addressed the Assembly. While mediapersons were allowed inside the Assembly, his speech was not telecast live. The Governor, who had stuck to the line of the State government, described not telecasting his speech as “crucification of democratic values”. Referring to the live telecast of the Budget speech of Finance Minister Amit Mitra, Mr. Dhankhar said this “situation makes discrimination apparent”.

“All over the country there is an increasing transparency of the proceedings of the House. It is for the Legislature, the Executive and the Media to engage in soul searching as regards this kind of media muzzling and censorship,” the press statement quoted the Governor as saying.

86,2020/02/11,"Tarigami slams BJP govt. for PSA against Omar, Mufti","The grounds to book former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Ministers, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, under the Public Safety Act (PSA) showed intellectual and moral bankruptcy of the BJP regime, CPI(M) leader Yousuf Tarigami said on Monday.

The dossier of Ms. Mehbooba states that “green colour of party [PDP] flag reflects radical origin.” “Wasn’t the colour of PDP flag same when the BJP entered into an alliance with it to share the power in Jammu and Kashmir in March 2015?” Mr. Tarigami asked.

Mr. Abdullah’s PSA dossier states his ability to convince electorate to vote in huge numbers even during the peak of militancy and poll boycott calls by separatists and militants. “Is it a crime to have influence over voters and convince them to vote despite threats by militants and separatists? In a democratic set up every leader has influence over people and voters which is not considered a crime in any part of the country or world,” Mr. Tarigami addded.

‘Lost the plot’

The BJP government had lost the plot in Kashmir and in desperation it was taking such steps. The slapping of the PSA against the two leaders flies in the face of the government’s assertion that normalcy had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir. This move was a violation of the spirit of democracy, Mr. Tarigami said.

“It is showing utter disregard for people’s voice and opting brutal methods to suppress dissent. In a democracy people have the right to raise their voices against government policies and register their concern,” he added",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tarigami-slams-bjp-govt-for-psa-against-omar-mufti/article30788025.ece

An ASI official said while the theme of the museum was yet to be finalised, a request for proposal (RFP) had been floated last week inviting ideas on the basic theme of “cities of Delhi”.

The RFP floated on February 7 asked for applications to set up a “museum/interpretation centre celebrating the art of Delhi, ancient and contemporary”. Applicants were asked to send in their bids by February 17 for conceptualising, designing, layout and execution of the museum. “Just a half a mile from the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Qutub Minar, in the Mehrauli area of Delhi, the exhibition should present itself as an Ode to the Art of Delhi,” the RFP read.

The document added that Delhi had seen several cities rise and fall over millennia. Over the years, artists have depicted Delhi’s history and imagined its future, it said.

The plan includes a curated exhibition in a refurbished building of Qila Rai Pithora, which dates back to the 11th century, and would include paintings, sculptures, prints, photographs, maps, posters, books and installations. A virtual reality lab may also be included.

“The aim of the exhibition is to inform and educate the public while providing them a critical understanding of the Capital city’s art history connecting it with its political and social history,” the document read.

Apart from Qila Rai Pithora, the other historical cities of Delhi are Siri Fort, Tughlaqabad, Jahanpanah, Firozabad, Purana Qila and Shahjahanabad over the years.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/museum-on-delhis-art-history-to-come-up-at-qila-rai-pithora/article30785115.ece
89,2020/02/11,"Gurukul system must be revived, says Suresh Joshi","The ‘gurukul’ system of education should be revived and Sanskrit made part of the school curriculum, RSS general secretary Suresh ‘Bhaiyyaji’ Joshi has said.

Speaking at an event at Dona Paula near here on Sunday, he said the Centre should encourage those “who positively experiment in the educational system”.

“Sanskrit should be taught in every school. The government has to give it a serious thought. We feel Sanskrit is the mother of all languages, and if you have to understand India, you can’t do it without Sanskrit. That is why without thinking of who will feel good or bad, Sanskrit should get its position,” he said.

Mr. Joshi underscored the need to revive the ‘gurukul’ system (residential schooling anchored by a guru and based on Vedic principles). “We can’t think of an ashram-like arrangement today, but when we talk about the ‘gurukul’ system, education is the focus of the institution.” The present times required institutions that considered education a mission rather than a business, he said.

India adopted the “British-era educational pattern” in which all institutions had to abide by the government policy. Now, the government should be flexible in its approach to education. “There are a few institutes that have tried to adopt their own policies and they have successfully implemented them. I feel those who positively experiment in the educational system should be encouraged,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gurukul-system-must-be-revived-says-suresh-joshi/article30787494.ece

The hearing is scheduled to commence on Tuesday and is expected to conclude within a few days, following which the U.K. High Court may announce its verdict.

Last year, after perusing the evidence furnished by the enforcement agencies and examining Mr. Mallya’s submissions, the Westminster Magistrates Court had approved his extradition to India. In April 2019, his application for leave to appeal against extradition was turned down by a High Court.

However, in July last year, the Royal Court of Justice in London allowed Mr. Mallya to appeal against the extradition order.

Banks’ plea

In India, several banks have sought from the court recovery of their dues from the assets attached by the Enforcement Directorate in the money laundering case against Mr. Mallya. A decision in the matter is also expected this month.

Mr. Mallya has already been declared a fugitive economic offender by a special court in Mumbai.

The businessman had flown out of India on March 2, 2016. About a year later, he was arrested in London after an extradition request was moved against him. He was released on bail.

According to the Gujarat ATS officials, Mr. Mussa was en route to Dubai via Mumbai on a Pakistani passport. Acting on a tip-off, the ATS detained him at Mumbai airport and subsequently arrested him.

Mr Mussa has been on the radar of Gujarat ATS since last year in connection with a ₹900 crore drug smuggling racket following the interrogation of other accused. Five Pakistani nationals were arrested on January 2 in a joint operation by Gujarat’s ATS and Indian Coast Guard.

“We are probing his role in the drugs case since his name had cropped up during interrogation of other accused,” a top official of the ATS told the media persons after his arrest.

A close aide of the main conspirator of Mumbai serial blasts of 1993 Tiger Memon, Mr Halari allegedly played in a crucial role in the planning and execution of the attacks.

94,2020/02/11,German envoy likely to lead second batch of diplomats to J&K,"A month after a delegation of diplomats visited Jammu and Kashmir, the government plans to take a second batch of Ambassadors there later this week, and allow them to speak with several delegations about the ground situation six months after the amendment of Article 370.

The government has invited several diplomats from the European Union, including Germany, France, the Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary and the European Union envoy himself for the two-day visit, beginning January 12, although sources said they have not received confirmations from all those who will participate.

As one of the most senior Delhi-based diplomats, Germany’s Ambassador Walter Lindner is expected to lead the delegation.

Other invitees include the envoys from Qatar and other Gulf countries, as well as envoys from the 10-nation ASEAN grouping and countries in the neighbourhood.

The Russian Ambassador, who has been invited twice, had said on January 17 that Kashmir is an “internal matter” for India and there is “no reason” for him to travel there, and is unlikely to join this batch as well.

According to sources, the visit to Srinagar had been earlier planned for Tuesday, but was put off due to a call by separatist groups for a ‘shutdown’ on February 11, anniversary of the hanging of JKLF founder Maqbool Bhatt.

From Srinagar

Depending on the status of the shutdown, the delegation of diplomats that is expected to begin its visit to Srinagar on February 12, may be taken to other districts in North Kashmir before visiting Jammu. Officials confirmed that all logistics and security was is in place for the visit, which will be coordinated by the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).

As The Hindu reported last week, the presence of envoys from EU member countries is significant as the last time a batch had visited Kashmir in January, the EU had declined to participate unless they were taken as a group of all 27 (then 28, including the U.K.) members. Diplomatic sources had also said the envoys wanted more than a “guided tour”, and had asked to meet the former chief ministers in detention, who have now all been charged under the stringent Public Safety Act.

The inclusion of EU envoys is also timed just before External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar’s visit to Munich and Brussels, where he is expected to engage with German and EU officials and parliamentarians over concerns on the situation in Kashmir, as well as anti-CAA protests.

Members of Parliament have criticised the previous visits conducted by the government for Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in October last year and diplomats including U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Juster in January this year.

In a tweet about the diplomats’ visit while former chief ministers Farooq and Omar Abdullah, and Mehbooba Mufti have been charged under the PSA, Communist Party (Marxist) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said it was “a sham of ‘normalcy’.”

Sriram submitted before the High Court that the Bills relating to decentralisation have been referred to Select Committee and the AG has also submitted before the High Court that it was not a money bill either.

“In spite of the submission of AG before the High Court of AP that the decentralisation Bill has been sent to the Select Committee of AP Legislative Council, the YSRCP government is still trying to mislead people by saying that the rules can be mended,” said Mr. Ramakrishnudu.

The former Minister for Legislative Affairs said: “The Chairman of Council is supreme in all affairs of the council, just as Speaker is supreme in all affairs of Assembly and vowed that the TDP will use all its resources to stop the passage of the Bills.”

The land transfer records (ROR-1B Adangal) will be made available online without payment of any fee on www.meebhoomi.ap.gov.in portal. The auto mutation pilot project was launched in Kankipadu mandal of Krishna district in 2019. Following the success, the State government has decided to extend the facility across the State.

The whole process of land registration till the issuing of e-passbook will be made available online with the new system of automation. The landowners need not go to the tahsildar office or the MeeSeva office for any transaction as they will be getting updates on their mobile phones.

Moreover, the process of tahsildar’s attestation and the inclusion of their particulars in the revenue records will be completed within 30 days and the e-passbook will be issued immediately. Till now, farmers were running around tahsildar and MeeSeva offices for registration and other changes in the revenue records which was not only tedious for them but was also leading to an increase in corruption in the revenue offices. To curtail all these drawbacks, the State government has introduced the automation of revenue records.

Amendment

With an amendment to the Andhra Pradesh Record of Rights in Land and Pattadar Pass Books Act, 1971, the officials of the Registration Department have been recognised as provisional recording officers to deal with the records pertaining to land transfer with the Collector as their appointing officer.

99,2020/02/11,RTC employees up in arms against management,"The AP State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) Employees Union (EU) is up in arms against the management’s “anti-worker” policies and has urged the government to withdraw certain proposals that has triggered a sense of insecurity among the workers.

Y.V. Rao and P. Damodar Rao, president and general secretary of the EU respectively, met M. T. Krishna Babu, Principal Secretary, Department of Transport and Roads and Building, on Tuesday and conveyed the concerns of employees to him.

Relay fast

The workers also resorted to relay-hunger strikes from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in all the 29 depots across the 13 districts on Tuesday, to register their protest against what they call “indifference” of the government.

Contract drivers

Faulting the appointment of outsourced staff as drivers, they said this would tantamount to putting the lives of passengers at risk and added that the RTC should fill the vacant driver posts with regular appointments.

When they said that the RTC officials were in favour of granting permission to private buses to enter inside the Pandit Nehru Bus Station, Mr. Krishna Babu denied any such proposal and said the workers need not worry as the government would not give permission to anything that would cause harm to their interests.

Responding to their plea that implementation of the Motor Transport Workers’ Act and Factory Act be extended to the newly-created Public Transport Department (PTD), Mr. Krishna Babu said a decision would be taken on the issue after holding a discussion on it. The leaders said the “anti-worker” stand of the management had forced them to resort to the path of agitation.

The PTD was created to absorb over 52,000 employees of the loss-making APSRTC into the government as the proposed in toto merger of the public transport carrier was not possible. Sources in the department said the Centre’s nod was needed for the merger as it held a 31 % stake in the State transport body. Besides, the division of APSRTC assets and liabilities between A.P. and Telangana is also pending under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

The APSRTC remains a skeletal organisation. The staff absorbed into the government is re-deployed on deputation to run the corporation. “The merger is only on the paper,” an official of the corporation had said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/rtc-employees-up-in-arms-against-management/article30794104.ece

Jagan Mohan Reddy to write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi with regard to Kapu quota. “Use your good offices and see that the file relating to BC-F is cleared by the Centre,” he said.

In a letter to Mr. Jagan MOhan Reddy on Tuesday, the Kapu leader said the file was pending with the Home Ministry for some time now. “It may not be justified to seek your help as you have not promised a quota for Kapus. But keeping in view the despair prevailing among the Kapu youth, I request you to do the needful. The Kapu community didn’t forget the help of Ambedkar and Damodaram Sanjeevaiah. Likewise, the Kapus would not forget your services and help,” he said.

It may be recalled that Mr. Padmanabham, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August 2019 requested reintroduction of five per cent reservation to Kapus under the EWS (Economically Weaker Sections) quota. On December 2, 2017, the Andhra Pradesh Assembly passed a Bill giving five per cent EWS quota to the Kapu community.

Requests PM too

Mr. Padmanabham reminded that the Bill is pending with the Home Ministry, and he requested the Prime Minister to consider the issue, and ratify the same so that the poor among the Kapu community can see the light of hope.

In an open letter to the Kapus in 2018, Mr. Padmanabham said he had come to know through the media that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy touring the district was reluctant to give any concrete assurance on the Kapu reservation issue when the youth from the community tried to take up the cause with him. “Kapu reservation is not a charity,” he said, and added that former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Damodaram Sanjeevaiah had issued a G.O. providing reservation to the Kapus, which successive governments had ignored.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mudragada-writes-to-cm-on-kapu-quota/article30790952.ece

Dr. Raghu Babu, who attended as the chief guest for the Inquest-2k20, a two-day technical festival and project expo at Avanthi’s St. Theresa Institute of Engineering and Technology, Garividi, on Monday, said there were ample opportunities for further research in nano technology, bio-technology and information technology.

Dr. Raghu Babu said the tech fests of this kind would make the youth think innovative and come with fresh ideas which would pave way for their bright future.

JNTU-Vizianagaram College principal G. Swami Naidu urged the students not to copy the ideas for projects as it would kill their talent.

Garividi Mandal Education Officer P. Rama Rao felt that planning, preparation and presentation were important for students pursuing engineering and polytechnic courses.

Avanti college principal M. Srinivasa Rao and vice-principal and director of the college A. Chandra Sekhara Rao expressed happiness over the exhibition of more than 60 projects of the college students and 90 stalls of the schoolchildren of surrounding areas of Garividi.

Projects on display

Solar power enabled cycle, remote controlled grass cutter, Wi-Fi facility for operation of agriculture motor pump sets, intelligent traffic management for emergency vehicles, including ambulances, spying spider robot, railway track damage detection mechanism and other projects were displayed at expo.

115,2020/02/11,State govt. likely to set up IT concept city at Bhogapuram,"With no space left for allotment to new investors, the State government is mulling development of an IT concept city, the first of its kind at Bhogapuram, about 45 km from here.

The proposal assumes significance in the wake of the government’s decision to set up Executive capital in Visakhapatnam. A Greenfield international airport is also coming up at Bhogapuram, which is located in Vizianagaram district.

The hint regarding this was dropped by Principal Secretary, IT, Kona Sasidhar, during a recent visit to the city wherein he held an interaction with the stakeholders. He told them that the government had plans to develop an IT concept city without elaborating about the project.

The future of IT city mooted during the erstwhile TDP government at Kapuluppada in an area of 400 acres, for which a layout has been prepared, hangs in balance with the capital talk.

There is buzz that some of the buildings required for the capital maybe built at Kapuluppada or Bheemunipatnam or Bhogapuram. This could be due to availability of large parcels of government land and close proximity to the proposed international airport.

IT Association of AP (ITAAP) and Rushikonda IT Park Association (RITPA) have welcomed the proposal to develop IT concept city for which they sought consultations with the stakeholders before taking a final decision.

‘Release incentives’

“We welcome any decision to promote IT,” RITPA vice-president O. Naresh Kumar said seeking timely release of incentives promised to the existing IT companies. “The GO Rt. No. 1 was issued on January 1, 2020 sanctioning ₹100 crore to release the incentives due to the IT players. We will be happy if the payment is done immediately to send the right signals to the investor community,” he told The Hindu.

The CEO of another company said the government should go for a futuristic township with individual plots plus towers for plug and play operators at the concept city to make Visakhapatnam a prominent hub for IT companies.

Visakhapatnam has a turnover of ₹2,000 crore from IT and IT enabled services, a lion’s share of which comes from Business Process Management (BPM) units.

The city is home to prominent firms including HSBC, Conduent, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, FedServ (wholly-owned subsidiary of Federal Bank), Fluentgrid, IBM, WNS, Patra India, Concentrix and Uber Centre of Excellence.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/state-govt-likely-to-set-up-it-concept-city-at-bhogapuram/article30786532.ece
116,2020/02/11,Domestic usersspared powertariff hike,"In a relief to a majority of domestic power consumers in the State with consumption up to 500 units per month, the AP Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) has spared them from any increase in the tariff for 2020-21.

Besides, telescopic billing for all domestic consumers would be based purely on the monthly billing and not on their annual consumption during the previous year. The telescopic billing for the domestic consumers even with monthly consumption up to 500 units was categorised into three groups – A, B and C for the current (2019-20) year.

In the retail supply tariff for 2020-21 released here on Monday, APERC Chairman Justice C.V. Nagarjuna Reddy along with members P. Raghu and P.

117,2020/02/11,"SCS not a closed chapter, says Jagan","The long-pending and much-sought-after Special Category Status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh is not a closed chapter and the State government is well within its limits to take its development agenda forward through welfare schemes, says Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

Speaking at the first ever media chit-chat, after assuming office as Chief Minister, at his camp office on Monday, Mr. Jagan said, “We’ve been pursuing the Centre for SCS. It’s not a closed chapter. It’ll be a possibility till the day we stop fighting for it. Some day God will soften the Prime Minister’s heart so that it will be a reality. Worst case, it may not be this term. But it may be a reality when the Centre feels our need and this will be our demand.”

Mr. Reddy had written to the Prime Minister reminding him of the bifurcation promise and 15th Finance Commission report that stated that ‘grant of SCS lies in the hands of the Centre’.

For the record, the SCS was promised to Andhra Pradesh by the then Congress government at the Centre in 2014, at the time of bifurcation which resulted in the formation of Telangana. The then Opposition party BJP too agreed to it and even stated that SCS would be extended by five more years if it was voted to power.

Besides tax breaks and other benefits, the State with SCS will get 90% of all the expenditure on centrally sponsored schemes as Central grant. The rest of the 10% will also be given as a loan at zero per cent interest. Usually, the ratio for general category States is 70% loan and 30% grant.

Welfare

Sounding upbeat about the ongoing welfare schemes which are implemented as part of the YSR Congress Party’s flagship programme Navaratnalu, Mr. Jagan said the State would be able to sustain the schemes. “There is a tremendous response to our schemes and we are very much equipped to sustain them financially. We also see our financial ability growing year over year, which means a better scenario,” he said.

Popular among the programmes are English medium in government schools, Rythu Bharosa - payment to ₹50,000 to farmers (spread across 5 years), free healthcare through Arogyasri, payment of ₹15,000 to mothers of school-going kids below the poverty line, pensions to the elderly, liquor ban, housing to 25 lakh poor people and fee reimbursement.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/x7una5/article30786461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VJJAGANPAGE1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scs-not-a-closed-chapter-says-jagan/article30786462.ece
118,2020/02/11,Yediyurappa modifies portfolios of six newly inducted Ministers,"Within 24 hours of allocating portfolios to the State’s newly inducted Ministers, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa yielded to pressure and modified some of them on Tuesday, to placate those who were upset over not getting “prominent” portfolios.

According to sources in the Bharatiya Janata Party, the changes in portfolios came after most of the new Ministers met the Chief Minister at his residence in Bengaluru on Monday night and, during a marathon meeting, expressed displeasure over the “raw deal” meted out to them. The grapevine has it that some of them even told the Chief Minister that they would rather continue as just MLAs if they were not given “good portfolios”.

Only three of the 10 newly inducted Ministers had got prominent portfolios in Monday’s allocation. This left the others anguished.

“Though the Chief Minister did not yield to their pressure by providing the portfolios of their choice to all the new Ministers, he agreed to effect certain modifications to assuage their hurt feelings,” a senior BJP leader said.

The major change in portfolio was that of B.C. Patil, who has now been given the Agriculture portfolio instead of Forest. In fact, the Agriculture Department had been taken away from Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi and given to Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai as an additional charge only on Monday.

The Small Scale Industries and Sugar portfolios, which had been allotted to K. Gopalaiah, have been withdrawn, and he has now been allotted the Food and Civil Supplies portfolio, which had been given to Anand Singh on Monday. Mr. Singh has now been given Forest, Ecology and Environment, which had earlier been given to C.C. Patil, who also holds the Mines and Geology portfolio.

Shivaram Hebbar, who had been allotted the Labour portfolio, has also got Sugar now. Shrimant Balasaheb Patil has been given the additional portfolio of Minority Welfare, which had been with Animal Husbandry Ministry Prabhu Chavan.

Urban Development Minister B.A. Basavaraj too has something to cheer about, as his portfolio has been strengthened with the addition of Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board and Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation to it.

The Chief Minister will keep the Small Scale Industries portfolio with him, along with several other key departments.

Four untouched

Four newly inducted Ministers were kept out of the rejig. While Major Water Resources Minister Ramesh Jarkiholi has been untouched, the demands of Cooperation Minister S.T. Somashekhar and Medical Education Minister D. Sudhakar for grant of portfolios of their choice have not been met.

Sources in the party said the Chief Minister has assured Mr. Somashekhar and Dr. Sudhakar of considering their demands in the coming days. Similarly, there are no changes to the allocation to K.C. Narayana Gowda.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-modifies-portfolios-of-six-newly-inducted-ministers/article30795495.ece
119,2020/02/11,Karnataka to formulate new sand extraction policy,"The State government has proposed to bring out a new sand extraction policy for meeting the demand-supply gap. The government is likely announce it in the State Budget, which will be presented on March 5.

Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday chaired a meeting with top officials and discussed the pros and cons of the existing policy. A draft policy, taken up at a Cabinet sub-committee meeting, was discussed, and Mr. Yediyurappa told officials to formulate a new sand policy based on the sub-committee’s recommendations.

The present requirement of sand in the State is 45 million tonnes. There are many manufactured sand (M-sand) units in the State, and they have been producing 30 million tonnes. About 4.5 million tonnes extracted from patta lands, official sources said.

About 2 lakh tonnes of sand is being transported to Karnataka from neighbouring states. The State is facing a shortage of 8.5 million tonnes of sand and suitable amendments will be made to the existing law to meet this shortage, the sources said.

The new policy is expected to enable crackdown on illegal sand extraction and ensure availability of sand at lower prices for those in need. The construction industry has been hit following the ban on extraction of sand from rivers. The new policy is also expected to give boost to M-sand units for safeguarding environment. It is also expected to provide subsidy on interest on loans taken to set up M-sand units to promote production of M-sand in districts.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-to-formulate-new-sand-extraction-policy/article30795485.ece

I have started preparations for becoming the Chief Minister,” the eight-time MLA said in the video.

Vijayapura MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal responded by saying that he would be happy if Mr. Katti became Chief Minister. “But B.S. Yediyurappa will complete his term. Mr. Katti can become CM after that,” he said.

Another leader who is said to be upset with the exercise is Athani MLA Mahesh Kumathalli, who had defected from the Congress along with Ramesh Jarkiholi. Mr. Jarkiholi made it to the Cabinet, but not Mr. Kumathalli.

“I have not received a copy of the letter appointing me to Mysore Sales International Ltd. But I am not interested in that. I want to be chairman of Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. (earlier called Karnataka Land Army Corporation),” he said. “I am a civil engineer and my interest lies in construction.” He told The Hindu that he would meet the Chief Minister with this request.

Mr. Yatnal had urged the CM to accommodate Mr. Kumthalli in the Cabinet, as otherwise he would be seen as “failing to keep his promise”. Mr. Yediyurappa had promised in an open rally that he would make Mr. Kumathalli a Minister.

123,2020/02/11,"In AAP victory in Delhi, Deve Gowda sees hope for regional parties","Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda wrote a letter to Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday, describing the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) victory in the Delhi Assembly elections as “a remarkably good sign in Indian politics” that focus on development pays off.

Speaking further on the matter at the national executive meet of the JD(S), he said that the Delhi results bring hope of the continued relevance of regional parties. He urged party workers to learn from Mr. Kejriwal. “The people of Delhi have given their mandate to a regional party without getting influenced by caste or religion. This should be an inspiration to us here and we should all now focus on the 2023 elections,” he said.

Mr. Gowda said the AAP victory had assured the rest of India yet again that “desperate acts of communal polarisation has limited currency”. Hailing the developmental initiatives taken up by Mr. Kejriwal in the national capital, he said, “Talk of your government’s good work in the health and education sectors has reached the corners of Karnataka and the rest of India too.”

His son and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, in a series of tweets, said the people of Delhi had shown that “fascist ideology” would never win their hearts.

Mr. Kumaraswamy also said the “mature voter of Delhi” had held out against the might of the BJP, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and the entire Union government on its side. “By upholding the necessity of a regional party, the people of Delhi have also set a model by clearly stating that development is their only priority,” he said in another tweet.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/in-aap-victory-in-delhi-jds-chief-sees-hope-for-regional-parties/article30795466.ece

It has also proposed to extend the project in stages to Hassan city.

The pilot project had 50 per cent funding from the Centre and 25 per cent funding each came from the CESC and the implementing partner.

32 crore spent

A sum of ₹32 crore had been reportedly spent on the pilot project and Mysuru was among 14 cities identified in the country under the Mission and the CESC implemented the project covering around 25,000 consumers, installing “smart” meters.

The project was implemented in 14 feeders covering Vontikoppal and Hootagalli sub-divisions. They are managed by Online Smart Grid Technology, with online meter reading, disconnection and reconnection of meters, regulation of electricity load and several other features monitored and handled online. The details on smart consumers can be accessed from the CESC’s Smart Grid Control Centre and portal.

Mobile phone access

The remote metering technology can be accessed from mobile phones by the consumers and from the control room by the CESC. There is no need for the meter reader to visit the house where the smart meter had been fixed to take the reading.

The data can be accessed online as the smart meter is equipped with radio frequency chip.

Even disconnection can be done sitting from the control room for non-payment of bills.

128,2020/02/11,Leprosy still a concern in three districts of State,"Although Karnataka is considered a low leprosy endemic State, the prevalence rate in Koppal, Uttara Kannada, and Chamarajanagar continues to be higher than the national average of 0.63%. Overall, six districts have a prevalence rate above 0.5%.

While the number of new cases detected every year have come down considerably in the last 10 years, the percentage of multibacillary (infectious) leprosy cases among the new cases detected every year has been on the rise since 2015. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), multibacillary leprosy is a more severe form of the disease.

According to data from the State Health and Family Welfare Department, Karnataka saw 2,145 new cases from April to December 2019, all of whom have been put under treatment. Although the State’s overall prevalence rate is 0.34%, there are six districts where it ranges between 0.50% to 1%. Since 1986 till December 2019, a total of 5,77,890 cases have been released after treatment (cured) in the State.

While the district-wise data shows that Koppal has the highest prevalence rate 1.09%, Kodagu and Hassan have the lowest with 0.05% and 0.07% respectively.

There has been consistent rise in the number of new cases detected in five districts — Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Chitradurga, Haveri, and Koppal. Belagavi has been reporting the highest number of cases since 2017-2018, when 229 cases were detected. The cases increased to 258 in 2018-2019 and 192 cases from April till December 2019.

Parimala S. Maroor, State Joint Director (Leprosy), told The Hindu that multi-drug therapy that is currently used to treat patients is very effective and the success rate is over 90% if patients adhere to the treatment protocol. “Since 2017, 10,749 patients in the State have been released of treatment,” she said.

Spectacular success had been achieved in reducing the burden of leprosy since the inception of National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP) in 1983. The country achieved the goal of leprosy elimination as a public health problem i.e. prevalence rate of less than 1 case per 10,000 population at the national level by December 2005, as set by National Health Policy 2002. Although prevalence has come down at the national and State level, new cases are being detected continuously.

“In Karnataka, the prevalence rate dropped from 40 cases per 10,000 population in 1986 to 0.34% per 10,000 population in 2019,” Dr. Maroor said

To detect hidden leprosy cases, the State had taken up a 14-day Leprosy Case Detection Campaign in August and December covering nine districts in each phase.

Activist K. Neela, addressing presspersons here on Tuesday, said that the conference would demand that the Union government address high urban unemployment by introducing a urban employment guarantee scheme.

The demands include increasing Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme wages to ₹ 600 a day and payment to be made weekly without delay. Ms. Neela also demanded a guarantee of at least 200 days of unskilled wage employment every year.

133,2020/02/11,Using technology to harness tourism potential,"Making use of advanced technologies for attracting more visitors to historical monuments in Vijayapura, the district administration has got a virtual reality video/audio guide and website developed.

Tourism information can be easily accessed from the website, vijayapuratourism.in, which has been designed by techie Kiran Kulkarni, who is the founder of 6i solutions.

“This is for the first time that advanced technology such as 360 degree rotating camera for virtual viewing has been used for developing a video of the whispering gallery, Gol Gumbaz,”, said Mr. Kulkarni.

He said that the video tour guide could be downloaded from the website and watched in Android-enabled smart phones; however, for better experience, a virtually reality kit can also be used.

Besides this, an audio tour guide has been developed in three languages, Hindi, English and Kannada, which gives the complete details of Gol Gumbaz and 10 different monuments located inside the monument.

“Using earphones, one could keep on listening to historical information pertaining to these monuments,” he said and added that information could be added in other foreign languages in future.

Mentioning about the website, he said that it has details of important visiting places in the city, brief information about the city itself, transport facilities, restaurants and accommodation available.

Mr. Kulkarni, however, said that the project has been completed on a pilot basis. “Based on the response, we can add information on other monuments too,” Mr. Kulkarni said.

The website was launched about four months ago, and so far it has received good response from users.

Mr. Kulkarni, however, regretted that owing to lack of cooperation from Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), the website is not gaining its potential popularity.

“We approached the ASI on many occasions to request them to install hoardings that give details of this website and also provide a QR Code which could be used to download those details. But ASI officials have not installed a single banner at Gol Gumbaz where a majority of tourists visit. If visitors see the banner, they will not only go through the website but also inform others when they return to their native places. The cooperation of ASI is must in improving tourism here,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6l9c1c/article30793874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12BGVIJAYAPURATOURISM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/using-technology-to-harness-tourism-potential/article30793875.ece
134,2020/02/11,Samiti condemns courtorder on reservation,"Condemning the Supreme Court verdict that said reservation is not a fundamental right and States are not bound to provide it, members of the Karnataka State Dalit Sangharsh Samiti demanded that the case be referred to a Constitutional Bench.

State convener of the samiti Arjun Bhadre, addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, demanded that the 131 MPs belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes should exert pressure on the Union government so that Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes and other communities can continue to benefit from reservation.

The judgment by a Bench comprising Justice L. Nageswara Rao and Justice Hemant Gupta is against the spirit of the Constitution, he said.

Mr. Bhadre said that the BJP-led government at the Centre and the RSS were trying to end reservation and a conspiracy is being hatched to take away the rights of the deprived sections.

Article 16(4) and Article 16 (4A) of the Constitution represent the spirit of the nation to provide reservation to backward sections. Mr. Bhadre said that the Centre was taking steps to end reservation in BJP-ruled States.

The samiti members would stage a protest outside the Deputy Commissioner’s office on February 17 and submit a memorandum addressed to the President, demanding social justice enshrined in the Constitution.

As a first step, the corporation personnel distributed dust bins to street-side vendors at the vegetable market in Vadagavi Bazaar here. The vendors welcomed the officers and accepted the bins by drawing rangoli around the bins. “All the vendors in ward numbers 11 and 12 have been provided bins,” the personnel said.

“These are distinct from the bins that are to be placed in public places,” Anil Borgave, sanitary inspection officer, said.

The corporation is also providing bins to houses and shops to help them segregate dry and wet waste in them. The garbage is collected regularly, carried in covered vehicles and disposed of scientifically, he said. The programme will cover all wards in the coming days.

The corporation has received complaints in the past from some residents about garbage not being picked regularly. To tackle such issues, “we are putting in place a comprehensive garbage disposal system,” said corporation commissioner K.H. Jagadish.

137,2020/02/11,CESC’s proposal for tariff hike strongly opposed,"Industry bodies and consumers on Tuesday strongly opposed the Chamundeshwari Electricity Supply Corporation’s proposal for revising the tariff to 68.36 paise per unit for all categories of consumers for dealing with the revenue deficit of ₹475.50 crore it has foreseen for the financial year 2020-21.

The CESC submitted its proposal to the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC), which held a hearing at the Deputy Commissioner’s office here to seek the opinion from the general public and various stakeholders such as industries and associations.

KERC Chairman Shambhu Dayal Meena presided over the public hearing. Members M.D. Ravi and H.M. Manjunath were present.

CESC Managing Director H.N. Gopalakrishna made a PowerPoint presentation to the Commission on why the Corporation has sought the hike besides sharing information on its performance, new initiatives and steps taken to minimise T and D losses.

He said the CESC, which has its jurisdiction spread across Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajnagar, Hassan and Kodagu districts, required a revenue of ₹5,183.92 crore and the earnings it was expecting from the consumers was ₹4,708.42 crore, resulting in a deficit of ₹475.50 crore. He, therefore, pleaded before the Commission to approve its proposal for raising the tariff to 68.36 paise, including the fixed costs, to overcome the deficit.

“Last year, the CESC had sought a hike of 99 paise but the Commission revised the tariff by 33 paise. We have sought a moderate hike this year when compared to previous years and other ESCOMs,” a senior CESC official said.

As per the CESC’s estimates, the cost incurred by it for power purchase would be ₹3,611.91 crore, which accounts to 70.95 per cent of expenditure.

KIADB Industrial Area Manufacturers’ Association was the first to raise its objections to the hike. Vice-President K. Ravindra Prabhu described the proposal “anti-industry”, “anti-people” and uncalled-for. He urged the chairman to reject the proposal outright.

He maintained that the CESC had purchased power at an exorbitant rate - ₹11.63 to ₹14.89 per unit. If the hike was approved, it will result in the large-scale closure of small-scale industries (SSIs), which are already in crisis over recession, and job cuts. “The problems faced by CESC were entirely due to mismanagement for which the industries in general and SSIs and the common man in particular should not be victimised,” KIAMA said in a release.

Former MLA and Mysore Industries Association President Vasu also sought dismissal of the tariff hike proposal.

Lakshmikanth of MIA sought cut in tariff by ₹1 since the consumers were already paying more to the CESC. “Let the government bail out the CESC for its losses instead of passing on the burden to the consumers,” he argued.

Activist Shivaprakash also sought cut in tariff and demanded adequate power to farmers.

KASSIA also filed its objections to the KERC and sought rejection of the hike as there is considerable scope for the CESC to reduce its costs and improve efficiency. Also, the KERC was urged to direct the CESC to call for competitive tariff bidding.

The KASSIA, in a note, said, “The CESC was purchasing 405.92 million units of power more than the Commission’s approval, for the use of IP sets and does not go to HT industries. But the industries are made to pay for the energy which is distributed to the IP sets.”

The Karnataka Growers’ Federation, Sakleshpur, also submitted its petition before the Commission.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/x9ooca/article30793789.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MYSKERC1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cescs-proposal-for-tariff-hike-strongly-opposed/article30792442.ece
138,2020/02/11,"Finally, Karwar gets dedicated train service from Bengaluru","The demand for a superfast dedicated train between Bengaluru and Karwar will become reality 13 years after resumption of passenger train services between the mainland and the coast via Sakleshpur-Subrahmanya Road Ghat section.

Bowing to demand and pressure from multiple corners, the South Western Railway on Monday announced introduction of a new train --Yeshwantpur-Vasco da Gama-Yeshwantpur daily special train on special fare via Subrahmanya Road, Padil, Surathkal and Karwar, bypassing Mangaluru. A few days ago, SWR had proposed to bifurcate the existing combined train, Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express that met with stiff resistance from coastal people. While residents of Mangaluru were not prepared to part with its services, those in the rest of the coast too did not want bifurcation as it did not reduce journey hours.

A notification by SWR dtd. 10.02.2020 however said the date of introduction of the new service would be intimated in due course. The train would have commercial halts at Chikkabanavara, Channarayapatna, Hassan, Sakleshpur, Subrahmanya Road, Kabaka Puttur, Surathkal, Udupi, Barkur, Kundapura, Byndoor, Bhatkal, Murdeshwara, Kumta, Gokarna Road, Ankola, Karwar and Madgaon. It would have three general class, one 2-Tier and 3-Tier AC coaches, seven general second class sleeper coaches and two luggage-cum-brake vans.

The new service takes 13.45 hours to reach Karwar from Yeshwantpur while the existing services (via Kunigal as well as via Mysuru) take more than 17 hours, thus bringing in much relief to travellers in Uttara Kannada district. The train will leave Yeshwantpur at 6.45 p.m., reach Suratkal at 4.10 a.m,. Karwar at 8.25 a.m. and Vasco-da-Gama at 10 a.m. In the return direction, it will leave Vasco-da-Gama at 4.40 p.m., reach Karwar at 8.31 p.m., Suratkal at 11.54 p.m. and Yeshwantpur at 9 a.m.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/finally-karwar-gets-dedicated-train-service-from-bengaluru/article30791458.ece
139,2020/02/11,"Bidar sedition case: Distraught girl yearns for mother’s return, misses her exams","It was with the dream of better education for her 11-year-old daughter that Nazbunnisa, a 27-year-old single mother, moved from her native village to Bidar city a few months ago. She had seen a girl from her village study in Bidar’s Shaheen School and later get a medical seat and this had spurred her dreams too.

Dreams gone awry

She rented a small house and started work as a domestic help, while her daughter went to school. But, her dreams did not last long.

A play her daughter acted in about Citizenship (Amendment) Act, with comments allegedly insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, led to the school authorities facing a sedition case and Ms. Nazbunnisa and headteacher Fareeda Begum being arrested. The police, after questioning the children, charged that Ms. Nazbunnisa had “taught the objectionable dialogues” to her daughter and the teacher had allowed the staging of the play.

Mohammad Hafeezuddin and his wife, who were staying in the other portion of Ms. Nazbunnisa’s rented house, took care of her daughter for 10 days, before she was moved to a hostel run by the school.

“The police questioning and her mother’s arrest has left her in a state of shock. She would wake up in the middle of the night and start crying. She was depressed,” says Mr. Hafeezuddin, a cloth merchant.

When contacted on phone, the girl had only one thing to say: “I want to see my mother. Please do something.”

Inconsolable

Asma Taranum, her class teacher, told The Hindu: “The girl did come to school for the first few days after the arrest. She asked me the same question: “When will my mother be back?’ We tried to console her. For the last few days, she stopped coming to school again. Her examinations started on Monday and she is not writing them.”

When this reporter met Ms. Nazbunnisa in Bidar prison on Monday, she insisted: “My daughter must have picked up something from casual conversation and used it in the play... I am worried about her state of mind.”

Nagesh D.L., Superintendent of Police, said: “I personally feel that the investigating officer should not have visited the school premises and questioned the students so many times. What actually happened is that he could not get all the students in his first two visits. He therefore had to visit again. He did not question the same students every time.”

Other forms of criticism

Tauseef Madikeri, Chief Executive Officer of Shaheen School, is still shocked at how a satire attracted sedition, while much stronger dialogues in comedy shows attract none. “Many Opposition leaders criticise Mr. Modi in Parliament. The dialogue delivered by the child in the play was nothing compared to these aggressive criticisms. Yet, a sedition case was booked and students subjected to mental harassment.”

A 10-year-old student of the school told this reporter that he was intimidated by the way the police approached and questioned him. “I got some courage the second time on, and teachers and well-wishers told me not to be scared.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j2m5lv/article30789002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BGHOUSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bidar-sedition-case-distraught-girl-yearns-for-mothers-return-misses-her-exams/article30789004.ece

He was speaking at a conference held to protest against the harassment of women depositors by micro-finance firms here. It was organised by the Karnataka Runamukta Horata Samiti, Zilla Runamukta Horata Samiti, Karnataka Dalit Sangharsh Samiti, Bhima Garjane Samiti, Ambedkar Sene and Ambedkar Yuva Sena at the Mahatma Gandhi Bayalu Ranga Mandir, here.

Mr. Sorake said that there were complaints that the police were booking cases against the women depositors of micro-finance companies because of the pressure being brought on them by the latter. Legal action should be taken against these companies and the government should come to the rescue of these poor women, he said.

Radha Sundaresh, labour leader, said that it was incumbent upon the government to intervene and help the depositors. Uday Kumar Tallur, president of Bhima Garjane Samiti, said that it was the H.D. Kumaraswamy government which had introduced the Debt Relief Act. The benefit of this law should be extended to these women debtors of the micro-finance firms. The samiti will stage a dharna in front of the houses of the legislators if they did not raise this issue during the next session of the legislature. If the micro-finance firms forced women to repay, they should lodge a police complaint and the police should register cases against them under the Goonda Act, he said.

Among those affected, two are from Madhya Pradesh and one from Assam.

Following complaints of high fever among four persons in the estate, the doctors had taken blood samples and sent them to the Virus Diagnostic Lab at Shivamogga on February 2.

“Among the four samples sent, three were confirmed positive. We got the reports on Friday. By then, two of them had returned to Madhya Pradesh. A woman, who is from Assam, is recovering from fever”, said Manjunath H.K., District Surveillance Officer of Chikkamagaluru.

The officer is trying to contact his counterparts in Madhya Pradesh so that the two who returned to their native State are kept under observation for a few more days.

“There are no chances of infection spreading from them, as it is a tick-borne viral disease. However, they need to be under observation for at least one more week”, he said.

The Health Department staff conducted the vaccination drive at Madabur Estate, covering 39 people. Among them four were locals and the rest were workers from different States.

In the second phase, the department is planning to vaccinate all residents staying put in the five-kilometre radius of the estate, the hot spot, where the infection was noticed.

Speaking to The Hindu, he claimed that when he was Civil Aviation Minister, the national carrier was under profit. “Then, Air India had recorded profit of ₹50 crore as it was doing well. Today, because of the irrelevant and failed policies of the BJP government, the national carrier is incurring heavy losses,” he said.

Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could confirm the same from Delhi’s Lt. Governor Anil Baijal, a former IAS officer who was Managing Director of Air India, he said Mr. Baijal was doing great job. “Mr. Modi can still take advise from Mr. Baijal on reviving AI to ensure it profits once again. If the government has any intention to revive the national carrier, it can still do so with the opinion of experts,” Mr. Ibrahim said.

He also claimed that because of the visionary policies of his Ministry, India had several private airlines working today. “Today we have several private airlines operating in India. This is the result of the policies and decisions we made in the past,” he said.

“Every country in the world has its own national carrier. Despite this, the BJP has decided to sell off its own national carrier. This is extremely disappointing,” he said.

He was speaking at a felicitation function hosted by his followers in his native town. “I was in no mood to take oath as a Minister as I felt unhappy that my follower Mr. Kumthalli was not inducted,” he said.

He clarified that he took oath only because Mr. Kumthalli and his brother and BJP MLA Balachandra Jarkiholi forced him to.

He said that he was not particular about the portfolio. “I might get irrigation or library Ministry (he has since been given Water Resources). The choice of portfolio will not bother me. I will accept any Ministry and serve the State happily. I trust Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. I will continue to trust them and work with them,” he said. He said that he would never quit the BJP and would work for the strengthening the party instead.

He said that his only goal was development and that he would not respond to people who were alleging that he joined the BJP for power and money. “What my brother Satish Jarkiholi has done in 20 years, I have achieved in 2-3 years, as Minister and MLA,” he said. He reiterated that the five brothers were united when it came to family matters, but not in politics. “When it comes to politics, we are all different and we work for our parties,” he said.

“I have suffered a lot in the last few months. Even my worst enemies should not suffer such fate. I have made some mistakes in the past. I will not repeat them,” he said.

He said that he had made a mistake regarding the election of BJP candidate Sanjay Patil in 2018. He meant that he had worked for the victory of his protégé and Congress candidate Lakshmi Hebbalkar. “This will not happen again. I will make sure that Mr. Patil wins,” he said. Those in public life should not be arrogant about their power. They should be logical in their thinking and sympathetic in their actions towards others, he said.

In a sarcastic comment, he said that he was thankful to Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar as it was due to him that he had become a Minister. “If he had not opposed me, I would not have grown to such levels,” he said.

Mr. Kumthalli said: “We had told the Congress leaders that Gokak was a ball of fire and that they should not play with it. They refused to listen to us and that led to the fall of the Congress-Janata Dal(S) coalition government,” he said. He credited Mr. Jarkiholi for the return of Mr. Yediyurappa as Chief Minister.

144,2020/02/11,6.18 lakh children to be covered under de-worming drive,"Deputy Commissioner M. Deepa launched the national de-worming programme at a function at the Karnatak High School here on Monday.

Addressing a gathering, Ms. Deepa said that the district administration has set a target of covering 6.18 lakh children in the one to 19 age group in the district under this initiative.

She said that development and progress of the country rely on the youth. Hence, the youth should become mentally and physically strong to build a healthy society.

This drive is being held as part of the national-level campaign to tackle intestinal worm infection among children. De-worming helps combat other health-related issues such as malnutrition and anaemia too that comes in the way of proper growth of the children, she said.

Arrangements are being made to administer Albendazole tablets at all anganwadi centres, schools and colleges. While the school-going children would receive the tablets in their respective schools, those who are out of schools would be administered the tablets at the anganwadi centres, she added.

The role of the government officials concerned is important to make this drive a success. The officials concerned should arrange for wider awareness and sensitisation programmes to ensure the maximum participation in this drive, she said and instructed the officials to see that the drive was successful and no child was left out.

Zilla panchayat chief executive officer B.C. Satish said that Albendazole tablets are provided free twice a year under this drive. Parents and teachers should ensure that all children are administered the tablet without fail, he said.

147,2020/02/11,Planters in Karnataka still waiting for CCD to clear their dues,"Hundreds of coffee planters who had financial transactions with the Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) Group, founded by the late V.G. Siddhartha, are worried about the delay in getting their dues cleared by the company. Many planters, in Hassan, Chikkamagaluru and Kodagu districts had deposited their savings in different firms of the group with the expectation of good returns, besides selling coffee beans to the trading firm.

Siddhartha was found dead in July last year, and since then the company has been facing many financial challenges. Recently, a furniture-making unit — DAFFCO — based in Chikkamagaluru was shut down. Similarly, the trading of coffee has been stopped. A coffee curing unit in Hassan was also closed.

Amid all this, recent reports of the group’s deal to sell its Global Village Tech Park in Bengaluru to the U.S.-based Blackstone have sparked a hope for better days in the planters’ community.

According to a company official, the total dues to coffee growers is around ₹80 crore. Besides this, there is another ₹70 crore to ₹80 crore in the form of fixed deposits. In the first week of January, the company began the process to clearing dues. “The planters whose dues were less than ₹2.5 lakh got paid in one go. However, those expecting bigger amounts got only partial payment,” the official said. However, the depositors have not got their money back yet.

A planter in Hassan, who did not wish to be named, said many like him had deposited money as they were assured of an annual interest 11.5%, which is higher than the interest offered by any bank. “I know some people deposited the money they got by selling their estates. All these years they got interest, but now they want the deposit amount returned.”

Another planter from Alur taluk said he had sold coffee to the firm last season, but had not received payment for it. “I have no funds for the picking season. We all trusted Siddhartha and left our money with him, believing it would be returned when we needed it,” he said.

It is said that the family members of Siddhartha and CCD officials have communicated to the planters’ community that all their dues would be cleared. However, they have sought time as they need to process deals for the sale of company properties.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/planters-in-karnataka-still-waiting-for-ccd-to-clear-their-dues/article30786407.ece

On January 13, the CCI directed its director-general to carry out an investigation and submit a report in 60 days.

The investigation was ordered following a complaint by the Delhi Vyapar Mahasangh, which accused Amazon and Flipkart of giving preferential treatment to certain sellers, leading to foreclosure of other non-preferred sellers.

149,2020/02/11,PM should call all-party meeting on SC order on reservation: Siddaramaiah,"Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Siddaramaiah on Monday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi immediately convene an all-party meeting to discuss the recent Supreme Court order on a petition pertaining to reservation in promotion in Uttarakhand.

In the order, the apex court stated that the issue was a State subject. Mr Siddaramaiah said the case should be referred to a Constitution Bench as this was a constitutional matter. “The Union government should appeal against the order of the two-judge Bench of the Supreme Court that stated reservation was not a fundamental right,” he said.

Alleging that the BJP had “conspired” to dilute reservation provided to the Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and OBC communities, he said, “The judgment is against the basic principles of the Constitution and social justice. The Centre should intervene immediately to protect the interests of the socially and economically backward sections of the country.”

“Article 16(4) and (4A) of the constitution is clear about reservation. This judgment is misleading the country. The provisions of the Constitution should not be manipulated. How else can we set right inequality?” he asked.

He said that such a verdict, at a time when BJP and RSS leaders were already speaking against reservation and about changing the Constitution, would only help the Centre and other BJP-ruled States to misuse it. “The recent judgment will have nationwide ramifications and will be implemented in Uttar Pradesh too,” he said.

Asserting that the Congress was committed to social justice, Mr. Siddaramaiah said his party would come out on to the streets to oppose this.

‘No fiscal discipline’

Justifying his remark that a “daridra (bankrupt) government” was ruling the State, Mr. Siddaramaiah alleged that the government has been unable to maintain fiscal discipline.

“What I meant was this government has no money. They have not paid salaries for the last three months to teachers, not released the ₹2 crore grants to MLAs and MLCs. The flood-affected people are still waiting for monetary relief from the government. If this is not a bankrupt government, what else can you call it? There was no such bankruptcy during our tenure, and not once did we hold up payments,” he said.

“Despite having 25 MPs from the State, not once have Karnataka BJP leaders, including the Chief Minister, demanded that the Centre release additional funds for flood relief. Furthermore, the Centre has released a mere ₹1 crore for suburban rail,” he said.

Meanwhile, in Mangaluru, State Planning Board deputy chairman B.J. Puttaswamy said the government had become “daridra“ because of the erratic rule and policies of the Siddaramaiah government.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pm-should-call-all-party-meeting-on-sc-order-on-reservation-siddaramaiah/article30786368.ece
150,2020/02/11,"Quarantine, an effective tool to check infection spread","Quarantine, a method that has its origins in the medieval times, perhaps, continues to be an effective public health strategy to control the spread of infectious diseases.

The term comes from Italian quanta and means forty (days). The term created panic and social stigma in the medieval times as a plague during the time decimated populations in flourishing cities like Florentine and Venice.

Good strategy

In modern times, with more knowledge about microbes and how they behave and cause diseases, the strategy has proved good globally to control new and emerging infectious diseases that spread from humans to humans.

In Kerala, the strategy had been effective earlier in controlling Nipah infection and now the novel coronavirus infection, both zoonotic diseases, with no known drug, except symptomatic treatment.

The new world has adopted the World Health Organisation guidelines for quarantine, though these measures are often debated and face the risk of people shunning them as they curtail individual rights and employ intrusive methods. However, experts opine that when public health is in danger, persons are to be placed under quarantine even though they show no symptoms, considering that the disease might manifest during the incubation period. During the period, a person’s movements in public space is limited so that he or she does not put the rest of the community at risk. Lack of information from the country of origin was a limiting factor in our knowledge about nCoV, said G.S. Praveen, Assistant Professor, Community Medicine, Government Medical College, Ernakulam.

Incubation period

Medical professionals from various countries and the WHO indicated an average incubation period of 14 days for nCoV, which was said to be spread through droplet discharge — direct or indirect contact. Incubation period was the time taken by the virus to show symptoms of disease in a person. Two methods of keeping infection under control was to place healthy people with risky circumstances under quarantine and moving people with symptoms to isolation in a hospital environment.

Given the unknown nature of the virus, double the incubation period has been decided as quarantine period. The quarantine period could be revised if and when there was more data available from virologists studying the disease.

For any public health strategy to be a success, it needed to be shared with the public so that quarantine became a voluntary act, said a public health expert.

People’s compliance with the directive, sacrificing their own comfort, would make the strategy successful. In case of Nipah, fear factor kept people away from the city of origin of the infection. The Health Department had worked overtime to trace the contacts and take protective measures and this helped in containing the infection. With such a precedent, the health team got into action to face nCoV with a definite action plan and appealed to people with a travel history to China for voluntary quarantine.

Health department representatives call everyone under quarantine twice a day and provide counselling and support for their needs.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2x2gz5/article30795255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tv-quarantine,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/quarantine-an-effective-tool-to-check-infection-spread/article30795257.ece

Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) Pratap Singh Shami has assured the Muthalamada Mango Farmers Producer Company and civic members of the Muthalamada panchayat that better facilities would be ensured at the Muthalamada railway station.

However, the farmers complained that the mango being transported from Coimbatore faced no issues in the North Indian markets, but the boxes sent from Palakkad were charged extra.

The farmers said agents had refused to buy mangoes sent through Palakkad Junction but had accepted the mangoes sent through Coimbatore.

Mr. Shami told the farmers that efforts would be made to transport mangoes in SLR (seating cum luggage rake) coaches. He said Railways would consider sparing a special parcel van if there was a minimum consignment of 23 tonnes during the season.

Based on the complaint, the police filed a First Information Report (FIR) and collected the statements of the complainant and the school Principal. The cellphones used by the accused have been seized and these will be sent for technical examination.

“A defamation case has been registered and based on further investigation, relevant provisions of the IT Act will be added.

165,2020/02/11,Hi-tech corridor invites bids for master plan,"The Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation (DMICDC) has invited international competitive bidding (ICB) from reputed agencies to prepare detailed master plan and preliminary design report for roads and services/utilities for integrated manufacturing cluster (IMC) in Palakkad for the Kochi-Palakkad industrial corridor.

The State government had recently given nod for land acquisition in the Budget and approved the shareholders agreement and State support agreement for the project.

“The idea is to develop a detailed master plan by incorporating all the key aspects for development of over 1,800 acres of land for the project. The agency will have to conduct surveys, technical assessments, market survey, demand assessment, development of a financial feasibility model and preliminary design for all roads, among other activities,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, Principal Secretary (Industries), who is heading the Kochi-Bangalore industrial corridor project.

“The agency will have to work in such a way that the best international practices, specifications and standards in terms of quality and sustainability are brought into the project, for a period of 30 months. The tender for the node is proposed to be issued in February next year,” he said.

It will have to prepare a demand assessment to establish the industry mix, the range of economic activities, projected population and employment for the identified area and prepare a detailed financial analysis that together will form the basis for the development program for the detailed master plan.

The scope includes preparation of preliminary engineering design and drawings for roads, highway structures and utility services for the designated area within the identified economic node site incorporating strategies for sustainability, value addition and value engineering.

The agency will also review the provision of roads and highway structures, structures and all utility services such as drainage, electricity, gas, water, sewerage.

After preparation of the master plan, the agency will have to assist in the process of selection of contractors and provide technical assistance to DMICDC during detailed design by the contractor, ensuring highest quality of standards in implementation. The last date of submission of the bid is March 20.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hi-tech-corridor-invites-bids-for-master-plan/article30794914.ece
166,2020/02/11,State in acute financial crisis: Isaac,"The State is facing a grave financial crisis and the Budget proposals have projects for tiding over the crisis, Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac has said.

Addressing a seminar on “State of Kerala economy’ organised by the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Development Studies here on Tuesday, Dr. Isaac said the industrial sector had posted growth, but the agriculture sector crisis, dip in NRI income and drastic cut in Central transfers had worsened the crisis.

But the State’s economy had registered a growth, which was much higher than the national average since 1987. The higher growth rate in the past three years had revived the industries sector. This was a very positive indication.

The floods that battered the State in two successive years and the threat that the NRI deposits may dry up any time were matters of concern. The coronavirus outbreak would have serious national and international ramifications. This called for strong government intervention. The Central approach at this juncture was not favourable to the State, he said.

The Minister refuted charges of the Budget neglecting the capital and said that his reply to the Budget discussion would address the criticism against the proposals.

V.D. Satheesan, who addressed the seminar, said the Budget lacked proposals to address the economic slowdown. The figures rolled out in the Budget lacked credibility. The packages listed in the Budget were election packages. While the State expected an income of ₹1,15,000 crore in the previous year, there was shortfall of ₹16,000 crore. The income from Goods and Services Tax and Central share would not increase. Hence, there was no room for an optimism in raising the income, he said.

The proposals for imposing additional tax on automobile and real estate sectors that were facing the woes of the slowdown would again worsen the crisis, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-in-acute-financial-crisis-isaac/article30793798.ece
167,2020/02/11,Cong. raises graft charges against Behera,"Congress legislator P.T. Thomas has accused State Police Chief (SPC) Loknath Behera of large-scale corruption in the acquisition of vehicles and electronic equipment for the law enforcement agency.

Participating in the Budget discussion in the Assembly on Tuesday, Mr. Thomas demanded an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the imputations, which, he claimed, was initially flagged by the office of the Advocate General.

Mr. Behera, he alleged, had denied patrol vehicles to police stations and diverted the funds to acquire luxury sports utility vehicles for ranking officers.

Agency’s influence

Mr. Thomas said a private technology firm, which was not an original equipment manufacturer, had outsize influence over the law enforcement’s choice of computers and cameras. The firm had unrestricted access to the Police Headquarters and its representatives had approached several suppliers of electronic equipment, introducing themselves as “digital advisor” to the SPC.

He said the SPC had violated store purchase rules and acquired thousands of cameras and electronic equipment to implement the law enforcement’s proposed central intrusion monitoring system in commercial establishments and well-heeled households in the State. Mr. Behera had tasked District Police Chiefs to find at least 500 subscribers for the costly anti-burglary system every month. They, in turn, pressurised the public to enrol in the pricey network.

‘Created’ committees

Mr. Thomas said Mr. Behera had created committees populated by complaint officers to clear his acquisition proposals without any question.

Mr. Behera had diverted funds meant for fortifying police compounds in regions of armed Maoist activity and sunk the money into building bungalows for senior officers. The SPC had tasked forsaken the Kerala Police Construction Corporation and entrusted the work of the costly dwellings to a private firm.

Earlier, Mr. Thomas had informed Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan in writing that he would raise the corruption allegations against Mr. Behera on the floor of the House.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/or24yf/article30795793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVTV-LOKNATHBEHERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cong-raises-corruption-charges-against-behera/article30793676.ece
168,2020/02/11,Amazon floods with shoppers of ethnic products,"Amazon has been witnessing a crowd of online shoppers for ethnic art and products ever since Gadhika products were launched on the e-commerce platform by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribe Development Department in December last year.

Gadhika products — natural forest produce and eco-friendly handicraft made from bamboo, coconut and coconut shell, and ornaments, food products, clothes, Wayanad turmeric, honey, pickles, puttu kutti, etc. — have been hand-crafted by artisans and others belonging to various tribes and the Scheduled Castes.

Good demand

Though the list of products have been uploaded on Amazon for six months now, it was officially launched only in December and within a month the sale touched over ₹1 lakh, says Renjith Balaji, administrator, hand-holding cell of the department.

“We are moving at a slow pace as it is important to have enough stock of products, considering the huge response we have received within a month,” he told The Hindu. Besides, coordinating and bringing the artisans under a single umbrella is necessary to ensure the regular flow of products, he says.

As many as 240 products have been uploaded on the e-commerce platform and people can access them by searching Gadhika products. Products made by about 80 beneficiaries have been uploaded. The products are reasonably priced.

The acceptance for the tribal products was also visible at the tribal festival Gadhika that concluded in Kannur recently. The exhibition could attract over 50,000 people and there was a record sale of over ₹45lakh.

Mr. Renjith says since the sale of products has evoked a huge response online and in exhibitions, the government has decided to give ₹50,000 to each entrepreneur as grant to increase the production and improve quality. Initially, the grant is given to those who are able to attract huge customers online. To meet the increasing demand they would require an investment, which is provided by the government, he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/829xy5/article30804886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12tv-products02,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/amazon-floods-with-shoppers-of-ethnic-products/article30793431.ece
169,2020/02/11,IIM-K to Mahila Mall’s rescue,"After an exhaustive analysis, an expert team from the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, (IIM-K), has devised a plan to revamp the marketing strategy of the Kozhikode-based Mahila Mall.

The overhaul plan is being drawn up under the Social Outreach programme of the IIM-K. The pro-bono study of the marketing model was shared with the authorities of the mall and the District Collector on Tuesday. It would be discussed among all stakeholders and is expected to be implemented immediately.

The proposed measures consist of both short-term and long-term plans.

The short-term measures include innovative steps such as introducing biannual theme-based festival with the potential to grow into signature events, complete overhauling of the mall’s website to make it more dynamic and interactive, besides attractive membership offerings driven through marketing campaigns through display signage and social media.

The long-term plans offer valuable insights into the structural refurbishment of the mall to maximize the profits through space accessibility and strategic visibility. Several other initiatives, novel in nature, form a part of the shared plan and they expected to increase the footfall in the mall.

Debashis Chatterjee, Director, IIM-K, says overhauling of the mall has been topmost priority.

“The IIM-K aims at providing logical and viable solutions. The makeover of the mall has to be sustainable. We are hopeful that the facelift of the mall will open ways for several other cities in the country and the world to initiate such offerings, he says.

To boost footfall

Deepa Sethi, chairperson, International Relations, and faculty in the area of Humanities and Liberal Arts, says the IIM-K team is confident that the plan would not only address the falling footfall, but also empower women entrepreneurs to overcome crisis situations to scale heights and make the mall a brand name to reckon with.

The mall is the biggest venture of any Kudumbashree self-help group and is stated to provide jobs to 250 women directly and 500 women indirectly.

The 36,000 sq feet mall of five storey boasts of branded outlets, a supermarket, restaurant, boutiques, footwear shops, beauty parlours, banks, outlets for imported gadgets, handicraft, babycare, electronics and home appliances.

Besides, it also houses conference rooms, training centres and underground parking facility.

However, the women entrepreneurs are experiencing dwindling customer numbers during off-season, resulting in an unsteady source of income.

This results in a financial crunch and difficulty in paying rent, electricity bills and the salaries of people employed in the outlets.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/t5flsq/article30800657.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/12TVMAHILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/iimk-steps-in-to-save-mahila-mall/article30792964.ece

171,2020/02/11,Govt. firm on posting curbs,"The State government is reported to be firm on pursuing its decision to impose curbs on creation of posts in aided schools.

The proposal to make government concurrence at the highest level mandatory for creation of posts has drawn flak from school managements, but the Finance Department seems to be determined to pursue the course set in the Budget speech by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac.

Government sources told The Hindu that the proposal is part of a larger political decision to contain the splurge in all realms and any dilution in the stated position would cost the exchequer dear. The proposal is construed as a major bid to check graft and other unethical practices in appointments in the education sector under the cover of the Right to Education Act.

The government does not intend to usurp the recruitment powers or scrap other privileges the school managements enjoy. But the current fiscal crisis gripping the State has called for a realistic move to regulate the use of the limited resources at its command, sources say.

While the government is straining to limit the expenditure to the bare minimum and is thoroughly reviewing the financial implications before creating fresh posts, managements acting in violation of such basic principles would not be tolerated, sources say.

18,000 posts

As many as 17,000 posts have been created in government schools during the past four years and this is done after a thorough scrutiny. The management schools have created about 18,000 posts by reportedly interpreting the Central Act to their advantage and that too when a legion of teachers continue to remain under the protected category.

The proposal for putting fresh appointments under the scanner has been made on the basis of several complaints in this regard.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/govt-firm-on-posting-curbs/article30786905.ece

173,2020/02/11,Foresters’ film captures poachers’ transition,"In 2004, the Forest Department’s efforts had resulted in 23 wildlife poachers and sandalwood smugglers laying down their guns and joining hands with the officials in conserving the Periyar Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Thekkady. The momentous chapter, which remains unmatched elsewhere in the country, has now been adapted into a short film, titled Vidiyal, with a bunch of forest officials tapping their creative selves.

Helming the project is Divisional Forest Officer Raju K. Francis of the Ernakulam Forest Flying Squad, who along with the then PTR Deputy Director and currently Chief Conservator of Forests Pramod G. Krishnan had led the ‘Cheetah’ squad that apprehended the poachers.

With the assistance of the Tamil Nadu police, the team had caught the armed group, after months of futile attempts, from their hideout near a cave in Tamil Nadu where they used to hide the smuggled sandalwood. Following the arrests, they approached Mr. Francis and offered to surrender their arms in return for respectable jobs.

“They did not require a prison to reform themselves. Even after 15 years, 17 among the group continue to serve the department by becoming active members of participatory forest conservation programme in the PTR. They have now part of the Vidiyal Vanapathukappu Sangam (or Vidiyal, which stands for new dawn), an eco-development committee (EDC),” the officer said.

At ₹2.25 lakh

The 21-minute docu-fiction was formally launched by the Head of Forest Force P.K. Kesavan at a screening at the headquarters of the Forest Department on Monday. Despite being made by the Periyar Foundation on a modest budget of ₹2.25 lakh, the short film scores high on production values with support from Collective Phase One, co-founded by filmmaker Rajeev Ravi.

Most of the cast comprises forest officials and some members of the ‘Vidiyal’ EDC. The technical crew includes Umasankar (director of photography), Rinju R.V. (editor), Arjun Menon (colourist), Prasanth S.P. (sound designer), Akhil Hari (sync sound recordist) and Dawn Vincent (background score).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/jdz5wy/article30786814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvtvVidiyal1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/foresters-film-captures-poachers-transition/article30786815.ece
174,2020/02/11,CRZ violations: CM calls meet tomorrow,"The arduous task of refining the tentative list of over 26,000 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations stares at the State government with the Supreme Court cracking its whip on such violations.

The apex court on Monday asked the State government to submit the list of CRZ violations in six weeks. The court directive came on a petition filed by filmmaker Major Ravi, who lost his apartment when one of the Maradu flats was demolished.

During the hearing of the Maradu case, the State Chief Secretary had assured the court that the list of violations would be drawn up soon.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has convened a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the verdict and decide on an action plan. The strategy of the State government on the sensitive issue will be finalised at the meeting, said an official.

State may seek time

The State is likely to seek more time to prepare the list as it is a time-consuming process. The State will also brief the court about the works done so far.

For preparing the final list, notices will have to be issued to owners of all the buildings mentioned in draft list to find out whether any court has regularised the violations. It also needs to be found out whether cases are pending in any court, the official said.

Serving of notices to over 26,000 people is likely to trigger panic and the State needs to tackle the situation.

The Hindu had last week reported on the unprecedented socio-economic and legal crisis looming over the State following the preparation of the list in the wake of Maradu demolitions.

For filtering the draft list, the State needs to segregate the buildings into residential and commercial ones and mark the distance of each building from the high tide line of the nearby waterbody. The plinth area of the buildings also should be ascertained.

Arduous task

The date of construction of the structures has to be obtained to find out the rules applicable to them.

The violations in each CRZ zone need to be classified separately. Also, the list should be cross-matched with the permissible and non-permissible activities in each zone. The process may take some time to complete, said an expert.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/crz-violations-cm-calls-meet-tomorrow/article30786528.ece
175,2020/02/11,Predictability mars a decent attempt,"Conservatism is a value one often associates with the elder ones. When the roles reverse, as it happens in Anoop Sathyan’s debut film Varane Aavashyamundu, one is left perplexed.

Here is single mother Neena (Shobhana) who lives her life freely, and does not meddle in her daughter Nikitha’s (Kalyani Priyadarshan) life.

The daughter is dying to get married, but she has decided that she would go in for an arranged marriage only, with the help of matrimonial portals, unlike her mother who is still a romantic at heart. Later, when she suspects her mother of being involved in a relationship with neighbour Major Unnikrishnan (Suresh Gopi), she raises a hue and cry. In fact, she is not the only ‘new generation’ kid in the movie who cannot stand breaking traditions. The mothers in both cases are independent, while the kids perplexingly often stand for regressive values.

But in his debut film Anoop Sathyan follows his father Sathyan Anthikkad’s footsteps, with just a change in the setting from rural to an urban milieu, telling a story of human bonds, with some preaching thrown in at the end. At the centre of the movie is the mother-daughter bond and how the entry into their lives of a retired armyman changes the equation. Dulquer Salman’s role can almost be called an extended cameo.

Touted as the comeback film of Suresh Gopi and Shobhana, the script depends on references to their characters from yesteryear films, to paper over the thin content. So, the script is filled with everything from the Commissioner theme music to Manichithrathazhu references and the song Vaisakhasandhye.... Nothing sells like nostalgia. There are a few phases where the film is engaging, like when the Major in trying to overcome his difficulty in socialising, takes the help of a psychiatrist, played humorously by Johny Antony.

All four of the central characters have a sob story to share, which gives one the feeling of this being an artificial package. The typical inspiring speech by a character towards the end and two characters having breakups in quick succession so that they both can fall in love, completes this feeling. One can fairly predict how these relationships will pan out in the end, quite early in the film. Suresh Gopi gets a character with some scope for performance after a long time, but Shobana’s character is limited in scope. With a thin storyline and familiar tropes, Varane Aavashyamundu just manages to stay afloat by being engaging in parts.

176,2020/02/11,‘Oru Kutti Kathai’: Vijay to sing for Anirudh Ravichander again in first 'Master' single,"The first track from Vijay’s highly-anticipated Master has been titled Oru Kutti Kadhai, and will be released on Valentine’s Day at 5 pm.

The album marks the reunion of Vijay and composer Anirudh Ravichander after their hit Kaththi album.

Composer Anirudh also revealed the singer of the track to be Vijay himself, posting a picture of the two: ""We’re back baby! Thalapathy #actorvijay sir, the Masster himself lends his voice to tell you guys a kutti kathai!""

The song is Vijay's next after the hit Verithanam from Bigil. The first look shows the actor with a Jack Daniel's hip flask, which could indicate it's a tipsy song, on the lines of his popular Vangana Vanakangana from Thalaivaa.

The title Oru Kutti Kathai marks resonance for fans of both Vijay and Vijay Sethupathi. The former, as Vijay has a habit of narrating a ‘kutti kathai’ (shorty story) at recent audio launches, much to the delight of his fans. Whereas Vijay Sethupathi’s ‘Oru kathai sollutama, sir?’ dialogue from Vikram Vedha is still fondly celebrated for its ‘punch’ quotient.

Vijay recently rejoined the sets of Master in Neyveli, after missing the shoot for a couple of days due to IT raids at his residence in Chennai. The actor took a rare selfie with his fans upon returning to the place of shoot, and later posted it on social media, which went viral.

Master also stars the likes of Malavika Mohanan, Andrea Jeremiah, Shanthnu Bhagyaraj and Arjun Das, and is set for a April 2020 release.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/e6xa7z/article30801080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/masterjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oru-kutti-kathai-vijay-to-sing-for-anirudh-ravichander-again-in-first-master-single/article30792441.ece
177,2020/02/11,A short film festival on road safety in Coimbatore,"A deserted highway at night, an over speeding bike, a rider without a helmet...sounds familiar? How about a ‘ghost’ on a pillion? The 30-second short film Hell-Mate jolts you. V N Navneesh, a visual communication student and director of the film Hell-Mate emaerged as the winner at a short film contest organised by Uyir, an NGO that works towards bringing down road accidents and deaths. “Riding without a helmet can be fatal. Follow road rules is the message I wanted to convey,” says the young filmmaker. The hitchhiking ghost was to lend an added impact,” he says.

The contest received over 100 entries from across India and the films competed in three categories – 30 seconds, one minute and three minute. Artist R. Rajhu’s Naerkodu, a graphic presentation on road safety became the runner up in the 30-seconds category. He also submitted a three-minute film called Sambavam where he recreates a police investigation of a road accident through a rap song.

“The potholes and flex boards are the accused, while the traffic signal and the dumpyard are silent spectators,” says Rajhu. The three-minute film Kayal Vizhi urges you to follow rules before it's too late. It emerged as the winner in its category. Gowtham Selvaraj who directed the film uses a non-linear style. A blind man narrates his experience to a rash bike rider about how he lost his five-year-old daughter Kayal Vizhi in a road accident. “It is a wake-up call,” says Gowtham. S. Sriram's music adds to the dimension of the movie.

The runner up in this category is S.Pratheeksha's Vazhipokkan. “Why are we so careless?” she asks. “The number of road accidents and lives lost is alarming. In my film, actor Livingston and Youtuber Harija play the lead roles. My protagonist wears a helmet but doesn’t strap the buckles. When her bike collides with a car, the helmet is thrown off leaving her with a head injury.”

The film is edited by R. Karuppusamy who says, “We have used drone shots and montage shots, and tried using the camera differently to show the gravity of the accident.” Pratheeksha spent a day at busy arterial roads to film Vazhipokkan. “I was shocked. There is no regard for road rules. People jump traffic signals. I saw a mother-daughter duo on a bike. The girl was not wearing a helmet. Isn't her daughter's life at stake?”

Thaduppan, directed by K. Udhaya Kumar and M. Ram, G. Udhayaraj, A. Azhar is the runner up in the one-minute category. “Most two wheelers attempt a zigzag jump around the speed breakers. My own brother had a fall when he tried the stunt,” says Azhar. “We used minimal dialogues,” says Udhaya Kumar.

More about Uyir Uyir’s mission is to make Coimbatore accident-free. Sanjay Jayavarthanavelu, Chairman and Managing Director of Lakshmi Machines Works is the Chairman of Uyir. Besides investing in infrastructure to ensure road safety it also encourages public participation in its on-road activities. They have UYIR clubs to motivate college students and Kutty Cops for school students.

“Uyir is a people’s movement,” says Dr. S. Rajasekaran, director of Ganga Hospitals and Managing Trustee of Uyir. “We have to create awareness by engaging with the public . When the cops advise the riders to wear helmets, they don’t like it. At the same time, when it comes from a college mate or a member of the public, they listen and that makes a lot of difference. We are connecting` with the youth. When the college students participate in our awareness campaigns they ensure that they and their families abide by road rules. When our Kutty Cops start driving, they will be the responsible ones.”The short film contest, he says is a part of the move to bring in public involvement. “It’s a learning exercise for the film makers too. They will be careful about following road rules.” The top six films will be certified, and will be screened at cinema halls.

The short film competition was held with the Department of Visual Communication, Rathinam College of Arts and Science.The films are available on YouTube

There is also a sweet tale of a pet rushing with the helmet for the owner in Uyir Kaapan, made by a team of S. Harish. M. Periyasamy, G. Prasath and M. Chandru. “It is inspired from real life. My dog ensures that I never step out without my helmet,” says Periyasamy. “We don't over speed. It is after all for our own good.” The film won the first prize.

Special mentions

A bunch of films got a special mention. Watch Out, is one of them C. Udhayanin who did the music says it was a challenging task. “I visited busy market areas to record live sounds of cars honking and chaotic traffic and later edited it and used it in the film. While driving, riding or even walking, talking on mobile phones, listening to music...can be fatal. That is the message of the film.”

Other films are Naama Sonna Yaaru Kekkura is made by D. Aravindsamy and edited by I. Kathirkaiyon, both from Puducherry University. It shows three individuals, one driving a car with his mind consumed by family and office stress, another one playing PUB G game while driving, and the third one on his phone while riding his bike. “The three of them collide and are killed. We used Ilaiyaraaja’s music to build the drama. We used cinematic cuts to build the pace of the story.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/zf9wgx/article30791996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a-short-film-festival-on-road-safety-in-coimbatore/article30792006.ece
178,2020/02/11,Vijay Deverakonda: I want to sit in a café and have normal conversations,"Vijay Deverakonda perches up comfortably on the sofa, tucks in a quick breakfast as this conversation unfolds. A few more interviews have been lined up and he’s also hosting a gig to celebrate the growth of his clothing label, Rowdy. He packs in multiple things before World Famous Lover (WFL) releases on February 14.

The Kranti Madhav-directed film has Vijay romancing Raashi Khanna, Catherine Tresa, Izabelle Leite and Aishwarya Rajesh. Is he playing different roles or is it one man in various stages of love? Vijay wants the audience to discover it for themselves. He talks about having enjoyed playing the Kothagudem-based character Seenayya the most, and how the same film gave him the chance to portray Gautam, who lives lavishly and romances in Paris.

Vijay began working on WFL soon after Dear Comrade and says it was physically and mentally draining to do several love stories. Towards the end, he felt like he was done with them. His statement that WFL is his last love story, has drawn attention. “I am 30; till now, I’ve done so many love stories (Pelli Choopulu, Arjun Reddy, Geetha Govindam and Dear Comrade), with digressions such as NOTA and Taxiwala,” he says.

Style and sensibility: Dressed in all-black, Vijay states at one point he sported a riot of colours and now prefers muted tones. When he launched his clothing label, Rowdy, he monitored the designing, and would fly down to Bengaluru (where the manufacturing happened) for trials. “Now I have a great design team that understands my sensibilities and does some fun clothing,” he says.

Make gifting cool: For three years during Christmas, he turned into DeveraSanta, fulfilling wishes. “I wanted to create moments that people will cherish. Had I been a kid and Mahesh Babu were to ask ‘this Sankranti, what do you want from me?’ I would have been so excited. I wanted to do something like that.” On social media, people expressed their wish and Vijay’s team chose a few. Someone was gifted a Macbook! This initiative is not limited to philanthropy, says Vijay: “I want to make gifting cool, so that others might follow. Someone gifted me ₹3000 when I couldn’t afford a gym membership. I still remember and text her, expressing gratitude.”

Pouring a bit of himself into each of these films, he realised he needed to explore a new zone. “There are many more stories to tell, and I am changing as a person. I am preparing for my pan-Indian project and scaling up, eager to do other genres. There was a time when I was excited by love stories — the slow motion montages, and creating memorable on-screen moments with these brilliant actresses. It doesn’t excite me any more,” says Vijay.

Next up is a Hindi-Telugu action entertainer directed by Puri Jagannadh, in collaboration with Karan Johar.

Vijay also talks about slowing down the pace at which he works, to be able to sit back and analyse his craft, “We churn out films at such a rate that we don’t get the time to reset. All our material and body language come from real life observations. It helps when a director has a clear idea of what he wants from a character. Otherwise it’s up to us to figure it out. And we need time to do this.” He emphasises that he wants his films to be cherished by the audience for a long time.

Has he felt the need to go back and observe real life, and bring those learnings for his on-screen portrayals? “I’ve been feeling that need for the last two years. I want to sit at a café and have conversations. I can have normal relationships only with those who know me for years. Some of them, too, treat me like a star nowadays,” shrugs Vijay.

He accepts that it’s a part of stardom and says he has to turn to alternate sources like books and cinema to analyse characters. But time is scarce, “It’s my own doing; I take up too much work. The only time I can manage to read is just before I go to sleep, or when in the car.”

On set, Vijay juggles responsibilities beyond acting and says the producers place the onus on him, especially when it’s a new director: “I double up and do 15 other jobs, and give it my best,” he says.

When he was an aspiring actor, he wanted to do what he loved (acting) and make some money. Fame was not on his radar. He remembers the days of shooting for Pelli Choopulu, with the then debut director Tharun Bhascker: “We were making the film within a budget of one crore. We wanted to break even so that we can make another film within a similar budget, and then a few more. But ambition is such that new things keep adding to my list. I want to go all out and see what all I can do.”

Summing it up, Vijay draws a cricket analogy, “I will play every ball that comes to me and try to score a century. I have a responsibility towards my craft and my film.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xmet69/article30791915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WFL-Vijay-Deverakonda-Raashi-Khanna,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ahead-of-world-famous-lovers-release-actor-vijay-deverakonda-talks-about-wanting-to-hit-the-reset-button/article30791916.ece
179,2020/02/11,"Eminem reveals why he performed at Oscars, 17 years later after winning the award","Rapper Eminem surprised many with his performance of Lose Yourself at the Academy Awards 2020, 17 years after the song won him an Oscar.

He’d decided not to attend the ceremony in 2003, leaving his collaborator Luis Resto to accept the award from legendary actress-singer Barbra Streisand.

In an interview with variety.com, Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers, opened up about how his Sunday night’s performance came together.

“I kinda figured maybe since I didn’t get a chance to do it at the time, maybe it would be cool. Back then, I never even thought that I had a chance to win, and we had just performed ‘Lose yourself’ on the Grammys with the Roots a couple of weeks before the Oscars, so we didn’t think it was a good idea. And also, back at that time, the younger me didn’t really feel like a show like that would understand me,” said the rapper.

“But then when I found out I won, ‘That’s crazy!’ That to me shows how authentic and real that award is — when you don’t show up and you still win. That makes it very real to me,” he added.

He doesn’t know if he was disappointed about missing the ceremony back then, he was “blown back by the fact that I won”.

“I don’t even think I understood back then that you could get an Oscar for a song, and I remember being kinda confused about why I was even up for one, because as a kid with the Oscars, it was like a vacuum,” said Eminem.

At the time, some reports said he didn’t perform because the Oscars wanted him to do a censored version of the song.

“Oh no, that wasn’t the case at all, because there’s not even that many cuss words in it — there’s only a couple. That’s not true at all,” he clarified.

He enjoyed being at the Oscars this year. “Absolutely. I got to hug Salma Hayek,” he shared.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ims7jk/article30790914.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/92NDACADEMYAWARDS-SHOW,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/eminem-reveals-why-he-performed-at-oscars-17-years-later-after-winning-the-award/article30790915.ece

Choi, who is a budding filmmaker, has garnered a lot of praise and attention for her quick and to-the-point translations for the Oscar-winning Parasite director since the genre-defying film started travelling to international film festivals and award ceremonies.

The Wrap reporter Steve Pond revealed the scoop on Twitter on Sunday.

“Bong Joon Ho’s translator, Sharon Choi, is a director. When awards season ends (ie tomorrow), she says she wants to start making a movie... about awards season,” Pond wrote.

Crazy Rich Asians star Henry Gold was quick to show his interest on working on the potential project.

“I’m free this summer,” Gold replied to Pond’s tweet.

While Choi has not publicly commented on her feature film intentions, Bong confirmed that she was working on a script.

182,2020/02/11,Oscars 2020 TV audience hits record low,"The U.S. television audience for the 2020 Oscars fell to an all- time low for a ceremony that brought big wins for South Korean satire Parasite, but was criticized by reviewers as long and haphazard.

Viewership for Sunday’s show, broadcast on Walt Disney Co -owned ABC, dropped 20% from a year ago to an average audience of 23.6 million, according to Nielsen data released on Monday.

It was the worst TV audience ever for the highest honors in the movie industry and beat the previous record low of 26.5 million in 2018.

Parasite made history by becoming the first non-English language film to win best picture, beating box office favorites like Joker and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix and Brad Pitt were among the acting winners.

The show, which ran 3-1/2 hours, was held without a host for a second year and was slammed by reviewers for random moments, inconsistencies and a surprise but puzzling performance by rapper Eminem of a 17-year-old song.

“The 2020 Oscars bellowed out for a ringmaster to harness what soon became a lackluster circus,” wrote Dominic Patten at entertainment website Deadline.

Audiences for live award shows have been declining in recent years, but the Oscars ceremony was still the biggest draw of Sunday night on television. Nielsen said the Academy Awards also dominated conversations on social media, producing 20.6 million social interactions on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms, up 16 % from 2019.

The average unit cost for a 30-second TV ad during Sunday’s ceremony ranged from $1,689,300 to $2,272,900, according to the research firm SQAD.

Sources tell Collider director Joon Ho is teaming with Adam McKay on the new five-to-six episode series, and Ruffalo has emerged as a front runner to star as one of the leads, although the exact details of the character he’ll be playing have yet to be revealed.

The filmmaker, who made history at the Oscars as Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture trophy, recently opened up about some of the ideas he may include in the TV series adaptation.

“I had all these key ideas accumulated from when I started writing the script. I just couldn’t include all those ideas in the two-hour running time of the film, so they’re all stored in my iPad and my goal with this limited series is to create a six-hour-long film,” he told TheWrap.

184,2020/02/11,Isha Koppikar on making a comeback in Sivakarthikeyan’s ‘Ayalaan’,"Isha Koppikar is back to Tamil cinema after two decades. Last seen in Vijayakanth’s Narasimha (2001), and popular for her outings in En Swasa Kaatre and Nenjinile, she will soon be seen in Sivakarthikeyan’s Ayalaan. MetroPlus had a quick chat with Isha, who’s shooting in the city. Excerpts:

You are back after 20 years. How does that feel?

People are asking me, ‘You look just the same. Do you live in a refrigerator?’ Chennai has always been loving and kind to me, and I’m just very happy to be back here.

You seem to have a strong role in ‘Ayalaan’, your comeback film that stars Sivakarthikeyan. Why did you choose that?

Since 2015, I did a few films in the south, including Kavacha and Keshava. I’ve never really stopped working — it’s just that I’ve been doing a whole lot of other things like running my hospitality business and taking care of my family. I was selective about what I wanted to do — the intention was to do something heartfelt. Ayalaan fit in that scheme of things; I felt that when director Ravikumar came to me with this action script. I love strong female leads, and Ayalaan casts me as Eliza, who is almost like a killing machine, and I’m glad to be part of this Sivakarthikeyan-starrer.

You recently spoke about how you like doing cop roles that offer various dimensions. How do you bring about a difference in the many cop roles you take up?

Crime is different in films, and that brings about the change in emotion. The thinking of a cop is the same — that he should nab the perpetrator — but the graph is different. The challenge is how you can differentiate among the characters. For that, I sit with my directors and work out a character plan. I’ve played a cop in Fixer, Keshava and Kavacha and will be playing one in Ram Gopal Varma’s untitled web series as well.

Do you believe that cops have been represented in a fair way on the big screen?

Yes, we try to make it as real as possible, especially if it has been based on a real life character.

ISHA UNPLUGGED Toughest part about being a mother

To not show failure in front of your children, and somehow put up a strong front.

Post retirement plans

I don’t think I’ll ever retire. I’ll take my work to the grave.

Dream travel destination

The moon. I’d love to go there someday.

Aren’t OTT platforms such a boon?

It’s much more accessible since it’s available on your phone. We see a lot of actors and filmmakers switching over to the platform.

The direction came based on an application filed in 2017 that claimed the land was a park and had sought a stay on the project. However, the Madras High Court had given the go-ahead for the project after a committee carried out an inspection and submitted its report.

It was submitted before the Tribunal that 70% of the civil work has been completed and 65% of construction of the Sewage Treatment Plant was also over. “It is further mentioned that the scheme could not be changed and it will not cause any harm and hazard to the public. No pollution will be caused and this is done in public interest and to protect the environment,” the authorities submitted before the Tribunal.

The Tribunal was further informed that the Chief Minister had inaugurated the project on October 31, 2019 and that two other writ petitions were pending before the High Court in this matter but were yet to be taken up. Counsel for the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board sought time to ascertain the present status of the project.

190,2020/02/11,Plea to stop mechanised boat operators using Chinese engines,"Members of a fishermen association, affiliated to CITU, from Kadaladi block in Yerwadi union here on Monday alleged that a majority of mechanised operators in the district used engines made in China, which were not only banned, but also had higher horse-power.

Submitting a memorandum to Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao here on Monday at the weekly grievance day petition at the Collectorate, the members said the mechanised boat fishermen, in connivance with officials of the fisheries department used higher HP engines. While the government permitted use of 150 hp, the Chinese-make engines were thrice powerful with 450 hp.

Further, the fishermen used double net, which was banned in the region by the government. Though the country boat fishermen submitted several complaints with the fisheries department here, there was no tangible action, M. Karunamoorthi, district secretary of CITU, said.

He added that over 10,000 fishermen from 10 villages in Kadaladi block of Yerwadi union depended on fishing.

Such forceful use of mechanised boats with higher horse-power engines and use of double fishing nets, the woes of country boat fishermen was on the rise. “If the government fails to stop and take firm action, the ordinary fishermen will have no other choice but to come to the streets and fight for justice,” he said.

The mechanised boats, as per a 1983 agreement and Act, were supposed to carry out fishing only beyond four nautical miles. However, they carried out fishing in less than one nautical mile, which led to poor catch for the country boat fishermen in the region, Mr. Karunamoorthi alleged.

The collusion between mechanised boat operators and some officials in the fisheries department would not be tolerated by the fishermen, he warned.

Mr. Karunamoorthi hoped that the Collector would intervene and take severe action, which would ensure livelihood for the country boat fishermen.

The Collector assured them that he would look into their grievances and instructed fisheries department officials to hold a meeting with various stakeholders, officials said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/p8muia/article30789289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA11-FISHERMENCOUNTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/plea-to-stop-mechanised-boat-operators-using-chinese-engines/article30789290.ece

They demanded that instead the State government should issue orders for creation of a new panchayat union block which should comprise all the 26 villages mentioned in the list during the district trifurcation.

State general secretary of the Federation of Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Associations, A.C. Venkatesan, who led the protest said the move to merge villages under Thuthipattu and Melsanangkuppam should not be merged, as they were backward in terms of development. Any move of demarcation should lead to development of respective areas, instead of changing headquarters alone, he said.

Parsanapalli, Modhagapalli, Karumbur, Kumaramangalam, Veerangkuppam, Melsanangkuppam, Thennampattu, Malayampattu, Vadakarai, Kollakuppam, Kailasagiri, Mittalam and Thuthipattu are some of the villages listed for merger with Madhanur Panchayat Union after the formation of Tirupattur district.

“We have expressed our displeasure over the merger and have sought opinions from the respective villagers to further this protest,” said A.M. Sivalingam, district secretary of Farmers’ Association.

A new block development office should be opened in the centre place of these villages, which would help the villages to develop at least from now, he said.

Representatives from various Farmers’ Associations, political party workers from Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam, Pattali Makkal Katchi and Bharatiya Janata Party participated.

197,2020/02/11,Justice Gokulakrishnan did not hide his support for Dravidian movement: Stalin,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Monday unveiled a portrait of the late former Gujarat High Court Chief Justice P.R. Gokulakrishnan and said that while many judges would be reluctant to speak about their association with the Dravidian movement, Justice Gokulakrishnan never shied away from doing so.

Mr. Stalin said that the former judge had taken a keen interest in the working of the DMK. “He called me a week before his passing to congratulate the DMK for its victory in the local body elections. He did call me during the Lok Sabha election. He would discuss and point out various issues in India today and encouraged me. His passing away is a great loss to Dravidian movement,” said Mr. Stalin.

He recalled that former DMK president M. Karunanidhi was very fond of Justice Gokulakrishnan. “Kalaignar would call him Gokul. When he was not keeping well, Gokulakrishnan came to see Kalaignar and despite his ill health wailed inconsolably after he passed away. He stood and spoke about Kalaignar at a memorial meeting even though he wasn't keeping well as he wanted to show his mark of respect to Kalaignar.”

He never missed to reiterate the importance of the Dravidian movement, Tamil and culture. “We need to follow in the footsteps of Justice Gokulakrishnan to take on the current ruling dispensation,” he said.

Representatives of 14 district units of the ruling party, covering parts of the central and southern regions of the State, took part in the first day of consultations. The deliberations touched on the reasons for the “not impressive” performance in the polls to rural local bodies, said a prominent leader from the southern region, adding that the focus of the meetings was more on preparing party members for the forthcoming elections to urban local bodies than on the Assembly polls in 2021.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/losrsl/article30787127.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11TNCMEDAPPADIKPALANIWAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-leaders-begin-intra-party-consultations/article30787128.ece
199,2020/02/11,‘130 out of 136 urban local bodies declared open defecation-free’,"The State government on Monday informed the Madras High Court that out of 15 municipal corporations and 121 municipalities in the State, six were yet to be declared open defecation-free places. Of the 136 urban local bodies, only 130 had so far been declared open defecation-free cities and towns.

The submission was made in a counter affidavit filed before the First Division Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad, who were seized of a batch of cases aimed at effective implementation of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act of 2013.

The Municipal Administration and Water Supply department said so far 13,772 insanitary latrines were demolished and 2,63,372 of individual household latrines constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission scheme. “All insanitary latrines in urban areas of the State have been demolished and converted into sanitary latrines,” it added.

The court was also told that 2,846 animators, 230 supervisors and 11 coordinators were engaged between 2016-17 and 2018-19 at a financial outlay of ₹153.71 crore to identify open defecation areas and bring about behavioural change among people by educating them about the importance of sanitation.

Zero-tolerance policy

Further, the department told the court that the government adopted a zero-tolerance policy against violation of ban imposed on manual scavenging. Yet, 21 people died due to sewer/septic tanks across the State between January 6 and November 11, 2019 and families of 19 of them were paid compensation of ₹10 lakh each.

Two victims alone were not paid compensation because they were not manual scavengers. The victims M. Sampath Kumar and his friend Narendran had gone to get the blessings of priest Santhanam Guruji at Om Sakthi Nagar in Tiruninravur near here in September last and died when they were voluntarily cleaning the blocks in a drain, it claimed.

The counter affidavit also stated that some of the other victims had died due to exposure to noxious gases even though jet rodding vehicles were used to clean the sewers. First Information Reports had been registered in all cases of sewer deaths and criminal prosecution was under way with respect to the 21 deaths, it added.

In so far as Chennai city was concerned, the Chennai Metropolitan and Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) procured 245 hydraulically operated desilting machines, 119 jet rodding machines, 29 jetting-cum-suction machines, 53 super sucker machines and 100 sewer cleaning rods, the department said.

However, advocate Srinath Sridevan, representing the Safai Karamchari Andolan, told the court that many municipalities in the State were continuing to engage contractors who were employing manual scavengers despite a specific bar under the 2013 Act and in violation of an interim order passed by the High Court in 2017. He pointed out that Villupuram and Kumbakonam municipalities have come on record before the court to state that their contractors had engaged manual scavengers. Taking serious note of his submission, the judges called for an explanation from the commissioners by April 28.

The Chief Justice also advised State Government Pleader V. Jayaprakash Narayan to make sure that the government alloted at least ₹10 crore to each district in the State for purchase of machines to clean sewers and ensure that mechanised cleaning became a way of life everywhere instead of continuing to depend upon manual labour.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/7f80wr/article30572154.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15THHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/130-out-of-136-urban-local-bodies-declared-open-defecation-free/article30787115.ece
200,2020/02/11,Shops being cleared in Vellore’s New Bus Stand ahead of renovation,"Ahead of the renovation of the New Bus Stand, a portion on its eastern side is being given a facelift as it will be a temporary terminus catering to buses bound for Tirupattur, Bengaluru and Chennai. Besides these, the other buses will be operated from the Old Bus Stand on Anna Salai.

A few shops and big restaurants in the terminus have already been cleared, while encroachments are set to be evicted, officials said. But there have been no signs of shops and roadside vendors on Anna Salai being relocated, despite the many encroachments.

A press note issued earlier by the Vellore Corporation Commissioner said the work, being undertaken at a cost of ₹45.61 crore, would start from February 9 and buses would be rescheduled from then.

However, officials clarified that the day of the actual commencement of work would be intimated by the contractor. The deadline for the shopkeepers for closing their businesses to facilitate construction work in New Bus Stand ended on February 7.

Business as usual

The traders on the western part of the bus stand were conducting their routine as usual. A trader said he has been doing business since its construction years ago and would only vacate a day before actual demolition work starts.

An official from Vellore Corporation said demolition of the stalls and concrete structures have already begun and it would take a week’s time. After that the entire western side would be barricaded ahead of construction, which would take at least two years.

The remaining space on the eastern side would be utilised for buses, he said. Though plans are on for a terminus along the lines of Chennai’s CMBT, it needs to be seen whether the local civic body here will act on passengers’ demands to ensure cleanliness at the terminus, a passenger from Gudiyatham said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/grp2i1/article30787014.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10FEBTHBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/shops-being-cleared-in-vellores-new-bus-stand-ahead-of-renovation/article30787015.ece
201,2020/02/11,Focus shifts to legislation on special agricultural zone,"With Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announcing that a law will be formulated to accord Protected Special Agricultural Zone status to the delta region, the broad contours of the proposed legislation have become a subject matter of discussion among farmers and experts.

While acknowledging that he did not have information regarding the latest initiative of the government, Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU), N. Kumar, said the concept of reserved forests could be considered in developing the agricultural zone.

As is the case with reserved forests, an independent body could be constituted to consider proposals for permissible industrial projects in the delta region, Mr. Kumar said.

‘Boost farm income’

His predecessor and former Member (Agriculture) in the State Planning Commission, K. Ramasamy, felt that the State government should aim to take steps that would boost farmers’ earnings.

“No great purpose will be served by making the delta confine itself to the present level of agriculture. The government has to take steps to facilitate the establishment of food processing industries and value-added units, besides encouraging farmers to cultivate pulses in a big way,” Mr. Ramasamy added.

Giving an illustration for value-added products, Dr. Ramasamy said numerous units could be formed for batter. This will come in handy as the delta region attracted a large number of tourists, especially pilgrims.

As for pulses, there were two broad varieties — short duration and longer duration. Agriculturists could be incentivised further to raise them, Dr. Ramasamy said.

‘Several challenges’

He pointed out that there were several challenges concerning agriculture-led industrialisation, as a situation had arisen wherein textile units and sugar mills need not be reliant on local production of raw materials.

“This is why the need for new thinking has arisen,” Dr. Ramasamy said.

V. Sathyanarayanan, a farmer from Tiruvarur who, along with P.R. Pandian and a host of other agriculturists, personally thanked the Chief Minister on Monday for announcing that the delta region will be declared a Protected Special Agricultural Zone, said that sustainable availability of water, the protection of farmland against further salinity intrusion, the construction of sub-surface dykes to improve the groundwater table and the modernisation of canals were among the measures that the government should focus on simultaneously.

A policy-maker said the proposed law will be ‘unique’.

A source in the ruling party said that there was talk among his colleagues that the Bill may be introduced in the forthcoming Assembly session, which is scheduled to begin on Friday.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jxxf3x/article30083994.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25NovTyrky02SG0O6OUCGP3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/focus-shifts-to-legislation-on-special-agricultural-zone/article30787010.ece
202,2020/02/11,Tamil Nadu conveys decision on delta region to Centre,"A day after Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami announced that the Cauvery delta region will be declared a Protected Special Agricultural Zone, the Tamil Nadu government on Monday informed the Centre about the decision.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar called on Union Minister of Environment, Forest & Climate Change Prakash Javadekar and Union Minister of Petroleum & Natural Gas Dharmendra Pradhan in Delhi and handed over to them a letter from the CM explaining the State government’s decision.

Emerging from the meeting with the Union Ministers in the Parliament complex, Mr. Jayakumar said, “We hope that a favourable decision would be made in the next few days.”

To a query on a Minister's reported statement that the implementation of the hydrocarbon project will continue, Mr. Jayakumar said he was unaware of the statement.

Policy decision

Replying to another query, Mr. Jayakumar said the Chief Minister had explained the ground reality in the Cauvery delta region to the Centre, and hence, the State government was hoping for a favourable response from the Union government.

When asked whether the State government would pass a resolution in the Assembly regarding the issue, Mr. Jayakumar said the Chief Minister's announcement was by itself a policy decision.

He took a dig at DMK principal secretary and former Minister K.N. Nehru for being unaware of that.

When asked what would happen to the existing industries in the light of Sunday’s announcement, the Minister said the decision pertaining to the delta region was taken only to protect the interests of the State, and farmers in particular.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rv2t6/article30266749.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10DECTH-FISHERIES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-conveys-decision-on-delta-region-to-centre/article30786980.ece
203,2020/02/11,"Haven’t got any proposal seeking green nod for projects, says Centre","The Union Environment Ministry hasn’t received any proposal seeking environmental clearance and the environmental impact assessment report for the eight-lane Chennai-Salem expressway and the Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) projects, the Central government informed Parliament on Monday.

PMK Rajya Sabha member Anbumani Ramadoss had sought details of a recent environmental impact assessment report on the Sterlite Copper plant, the projects being implemented by the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC), coal bed methane projects, the eight-lane Chennai-Salem expressway project of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the proposed PCPIR project in Tamil Nadu.

In a written reply, Babul Supriyo, Minister of State in the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, said no proposals had been received in relation to the expressway and PCPIR projects.

Environmental clearances were provided to the Sterlite Copper plant for an expansion project in January 2009, and to the ONGC in February 2018, on the basis of a review of their Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports, he added.

Mr. Ramadoss had also sought to know the total number of government, private and joint venture developmental projects being implemented in Tamil Nadu without complying with current environmental regulations such as holding public hearings and obtaining environmental clearances.

In his reply, Mr. Supriyo said there were “33 projects or activities of government, private and joint ventures functioning in Tamil Nadu without prior environment clearance, as required under EIA Notification, 2006 and subsequent amendments”.

“These projects or activities were appraised to bring them under compliance of (sic) environmental laws including action under the section 19 of Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/havent-got-any-proposal-seeking-green-nod-for-projects-says-centre/article30786976.ece
204,2020/02/11,TNCC president picks holes in State govt.’s industrial policy,"Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri on Monday questioned the State government’s industrial policy, a day after it announced that the Cauvery delta region will be declared a protected agricultural zone.

While welcoming Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s announcement, Mr. Alagiri said that there was, however, no clarity on which industries will be allowed to set up shop in T.N. “The industrial policy of the State is confusing, and no one knows what it entails. There is no clarity on the kind of industries that can and cannot be set up here,” he said in a statement.

Noting that there have been regular protests against the growth of industries in the State, he said one cannot blame the protesters for opposing industries that affect livelihoods. “But the Tamil Nadu government should clarify which are the industries that won’t affect the people,” he said. In the light of Sunday’s announcement, he sought to know what plans the State government had in relation to the employment prospects of the 25 lakh people in the Cauvery delta region. “These people cannot be dependent on agriculture alone. Does the government have any plans for protecting the livelihoods of these people?” he asked.

The Congress leader said the Tamil Nadu government should immediately clarify what sort of industries can be set up in the State, so that the lakhs of engineering students who graduate every year will have jobs to look forward to.

He said the government should immediately consult entrepreneurs and experts so that Tamil Nadu could continue on the path of industrialisation, and should also take steps to announce a new industrial policy for the State at the earliest.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/5sfby1/article30786973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11KSALAGIRICONGRESSI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tncc-president-picks-holes-in-state-govts-industrial-policy/article30786974.ece

206,2020/02/11,Contractor withdraws plea in unaccounted income case,"Government civil supplies contractor T.S. Kumarasamy of Namakkal-based Christy Friedgram Industry, whose total unaccounted income reportedly runs to ₹2,056.76 crore, has withdrawn all writ petitions filed by him in the Madras High Court challenging the Income Tax proceedings with liberty to face the assessment proceedings.

Justices V. Parthiban and Anita Sumanth permitted the contractor to withdraw his cases. However, they ordered maintenance of status quo in so far as ₹213 crore of the petitioner’s money that had been deposited in a fixed deposit account at the High Court branch of Indian Bank as per orders passed last year by another Bench.

During the hearing of his cases on Monday, the contractor initially said he was willing to let the I-T department take away ₹140 crore out of the deposited amount and sought permission to withdraw the rest for his use so that it could be utilised to settle dues to various banks which had offered him loans and overdraft for his business. The present offer was much higher than just ₹50 crore that he had offered to pay to the I-T department last week.

He wanted the department to stop making any further attachment of the money that was due to him from the State government. However, senior standing counsel for the I-T department A.P. Srinivas refused to give any such undertaking and said the assessment proceedings would be carried forward in accordance with law.

Mangapathy Vivekananda, Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, had already filed a detailed affidavit in the court stating that the contractor was liable to pay tax of approximately ₹700 crore, excluding interest, for his unaccounted income running to over ₹2,056 crore.

207,2020/02/11,Pele experiencing depression: Son,"Football legend Pele is experiencing “a kind of depression” and barely leaves home anymore because health problems have left him unable to walk normally, his son said in an interview.

“He’s pretty fragile in terms of his mobility... and that makes him suffer a kind of depression,” Edinho said of his 79-year-old father, who has had a series of health problems in recent years.

“Just imagine, he’s the ‘King,’ he was always such an imposing figure, and now he can’t walk normally. He gets very shy, very embarrassed about that,” his son said in an interview published on the sports news site Globoesporte.com on Monday.

Pele, the pride of Brazilian football and the only player to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970), is considered by many to be the greatest footballer of all time.

He has been in and out of hospital in recent years for various health issues.

He never fully recovered from one of his hip operations, leaving him dependent on a walker, Edinho said.

“He’s doing a bit better than when he was in a wheelchair recently, but he still has a hard time getting around,” said Edinho, 49.

Pele’s public appearances have grown increasingly rare with age.

Last April he travelled to Paris for a promotional appearance with French rising star Kylian Mbappe, but had to be hospitalized shortly after for kidney problems.

In 2014, he was placed in intensive care for dialysis after contracting a severe urinary infection.

The Brazilian great, whose real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento, has only one kidney, after a broken rib during a match forced doctors to remove the other.

He has also suffered a series of hip problems.

208,2020/02/11,Silverwood concerned over Archer workload,"England coach Chris Silverwood has said he may look to limit the number of overs Jofra Archer bowls as he looks for ways of keeping his pace battery fit and fresh.

Archer, who is out of action with a low-grade stress fracture in his right elbow, bowled more overs than any of his England teammates in 2019 despite making his international debut only in May.

Test captain Joe Root has denied suggestions Archer has been over-bowled but Silverwood said England may need to consider using the Barbadian-born quick in short bursts.

“Things like (bowling 40 overs in an innings) we have to look at,” Silverwood told reporters. “But sometimes, when needs must, you’ve got to do it.

“We managed Mark Wood through both the Test matches he’s played here (in South Africa) and he’s bowled in short, sharp spells. Would we look to do that now with Jof? Yes, we probably would.”

Discussing plans for Archer and Wood, Silverwood added: “Maybe they don’t have to play every game.

“Maybe they can play one on, one off every now and then they play together. That’s an exciting prospect.”

Archer, Wood and Olly Stone are part of Silverwood’s plans for the tour of Australia in 2021-22 and he hopes to keep them fit and firing for England’s bid to reclaim the Ashes.

“I would love to have those for the Ashes because we all know we get judged on the Ashes, so how can we give ourselves the best chance of succeeding?” Silverwood said.

“If I have three of them fit there, whether it is those three or not, then it would be a great advantage for us.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/3q0zg4/article30794862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12JOF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/silverwood-concerned-over-archer-workload/article30794863.ece

211,2020/02/11,India greats ‘shocked’ by youngsters’ conduct,"Sledging may have been Australia’s ‘gift’ to cricket, but the behaviour of players from India and Bangladesh during and after the ICC Under-19 World Cup final on Sunday has left a few India greats and administrators ‘shocked’.

The West Indians never had to sledge. “That look, eyebrows raised, hands on hips, and a vicious bouncer past your nose would give the message,” remembered Kapil Dev, who admitted he was shocked at the manner in which the Indian and Bangladesh juniors conducted themselves.

Control the aggression

“I welcome aggression. Nothing wrong in it. But it has to be controlled aggression. You can’t cross the line of decency in the name of being competitive. Personally, I would say it was unacceptable that youngsters put up such obnoxious display on the cricket field,” he noted.

Mohammad Azharuddin, who led India in 47 Tests, was also critical of both the teams. “How can you do this? You just keep abusing the opponent, right through the game, in the name of playing hard. Australians played hard always but without getting personal. We had fast bowlers who did not believe in using cuss words to pump themselves up or upset the batsmen.”

Unpleasant sight

Kapil, one of the greatest the game has known, wanted the youngsters to remember that they represent the country and have to set examples. “You all can lip read what they were uttering. I don’t want to take names but it was unpleasant to see. The boys were wasting their energy by indulging in needless sledging.”

Another great, Sunil Gavaskar, has always been critical of the poor behaviour on the field by modern cricketers. He would never fail to question the act of bowler abusing the batsman on getting his wicket.

Kapil also held similar views. “When you have got the batsman out what is the need of cursing him. Haven’t you won your battle by getting him out?” he asked.

Kapil and Azharuddin wanted the Board and the coaches to act fast. “I would like to see the Board to take some strict action to set an example. Cricket is not about abusing the opponent. I am sure there is enough reason for these youngsters to be dealt with firmly,” said Kapil.

Azharuddin hoped the support staff was asked to explain. “I would take action against the errant players but also want to know what role has the support staff played in educating the youngsters. Act before it is too late. These youngsters are the future of Indian cricket.

Bengal (26 points) is fourth on the combined Elite A and B table with Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Karnataka trying to sneak past it. Saurashtra and Gujarat have already qualified for the quarterfinals.

Manoj Tiwary (503 runs from nine innings) has been the fulcrum around which Bengal's batting has revolved. Against Hyderabad, Tiwary became only the second Bengal batsman, after Devang Gandhi (323, 1998-99), to make a First Class triple hundred.

His innings allowed Bengal to romp to a bonus-point victory. However, he has struggled for batting form since and will hope to dig deep here.

Bengal has momentum on its side after Shahbaz Ahmed's stunning unbeaten 61 steered it to an improbable two-wicket win against Rajasthan in the last match.

There have also been valuable contributions from Abhishek Raman and Shreevats Goswami at different stages, but captain Abhimanyu Easwaran has failed to string together a consistent run of scores.

A fighting performance with the bat is what Bengal direly needs right now, against Punjab (24 points) — No. 6 in Elite, Cross Pool — that edged past Andhra in the previous round at the same venue.

Gurkeerat, Markande ruled out

Anmol Malhotra struck a fluent 51 to take Punjab over the line. He was ably supported by Siddarth Kaul — who took a hat-trick — Mayank Markande and Vinay Choudhary, on a pitch that saw as many as 24 wickets tumble on day one alone. Markande is down with flu and will not feature in this match while Gurkeerat Mann is out with a knee injury.

It will be interesting to see how the pitch behaves and what the side winning the toss decides. In recent times, more than 24 wickets (28) have fallen in a day only on two occasions — in 2011-12 & 2012-13.

Bengal will leave the spin burden with Ahmed while the promising Akash Deep (20 wickets), Bengal's leading wicket-taker so far, Mukesh Kumar and Nilkantha Das are likely to spearhead the pace department against an in-form Punjab batting comprising skipper Mandeep Singh and Malhotra.

Another win for Bengal should guarantee a quarterfinal berth.

The pitch will be in focus as the spinners called the shots in the Andhra Pradesh-Punjab game and 24 wickets fell on the first day.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/gs4wcv/article30794769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BENGAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/bengal-needs-a-fighting-performance/article30794770.ece
213,2020/02/11,How India’s U-19s became the new glamour boys,"A few decades ago, Indian Universities were stepping stones to international cricket. The Rohinton Baria and Vizzy Trophies were hotly contested, and players like Bishan Bedi, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohinder Amarnath, Kapil Dev, Dilip Vengsarkar, Aunshuman Gaekwad, Sanjay Manjrekar emerged.

New nursery

The new nursery of Indian cricket has been the Under-19. Within six months of leading India to the world title in 2008, Virat Kohli played his first international for the senior team. More players have come through the Under-19 system — Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Rohit Sharma, Cheteswar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja, Shikhar Dhawan, K.L. Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Rishabh Pant — than through university cricket.

This indicates both the decline of university cricket and the planned growth of the age-group system.

Where the university stars were, at one time — the glamour boys — it is now the under-19 players who are feted and around whom fascinating origin stories are written. Yashasvi Jaiswal, Player-of-the-Tournament and top-scorer at the recent World Cup in South Africa, is, at 18, already a heroic figure. He slept in a tent for three years, and sold pani puri at the Azad Maidan in Mumbai, all the while keeping his long-term vision uncluttered.

Now he is on the fringes of the National team, was bought by Rajasthan Royals for ₹2.4 crore in the IPL. It is a heart-warming story.

The cricket board’s handling of under-19 has, in recent years, probably been more professional, more compassionate than their handling of anything else. By putting Rahul Dravid in charge, and giving him a largely free hand it showed the players both respect and concern. Dravid coordinated with the National coaches Ravi Shastri and Anil Kumble, and the pipeline from the Under-19 to the senior level became free of the usual impediments to a smooth transition like quotas and politics and poor judgements.

Dravid’s personality also meant that players were educated in much more than the forward defence or the curling leg-break. He has reverence for the game and what it means. It is doubtful if the fracas that followed the end of the World Cup final on Sunday would have taken place had he been present at the venue.

Bangladesh’s victory was well-deserved, and it is good for the game that a team lower down the pecking order in world cricket should stun favourites India who have won the title four times. It is a win that can do a lot for Bangladesh cricket, with many of their heroes graduating to senior levels.

Bad taste in the mouth

Yet, in the end, the tense day’s cricket left a bad taste in the mouth because of player behaviour. Although the Bangladesh captain said something that has been interpreted to mean he was apologising, I am not so sure. He did use the word “sorry”, but it could have been that he was sorry that such a thing happened. International captains at the Under-19 level, may not fully appreciate the nuances of the language; in any case it was convenient to believe he was apologising and that only one side was to blame.

Clearly the International Cricket Council thought otherwise and the video footage did suggest that both teams were involved. By calling out three Bangladeshi and two Indian players, the ICC made that clear.

You can see this as immature players (in both age and experience) reacting to victory or defeat, and therefore let it go as “one of those things.” But these players are one step away from playing for the senior team, and such behaviour has to be punished now. To see a bunch of teenagers behave in this manner on a sports field is nauseating.

The tension had been building up for a while. A big chunk of the responsibility, therefore, should rest on the umpires who could have nipped the trouble in the bud had they been more proactive and pulled up the players during the course of the match. It is part of their job description to keep things on an even keel on the field of play; such unruly behaviour is seldom spontaneous and gathers steam over the day. That should be clearer to the men in charge than anyone sitting in the stands or watching on television.

That India had both the tournament’s highest scorer and its highest wicket-taker (Ravi Bishnoi) is a reflection of the depth in Indian cricket. Losing a final is no crime. What India sometimes gets wrong is the injury-management and workload of the under-19 players.

A warning

One of the heroes of India’s 2018 World Cup win, the fast bowler Kamlesh Nagarkotti’s words (in an interview last year) are poignant. ""At 19, I must be running in and bowling fast. But here I am, not playing, not studying, out injured, away from home, all by myself, and trying to get fit even as my friends are playing in the IPL and for India-A. It is tough.”

That is a warning too.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2e64mw/article30789998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Yashasvi-Jaiswal-bagged-the-Player-of-the-Series-award-the-defeat-in-the-final,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/how-indias-u-19s-became-the-new-glamour-boys/article30794740.ece
214,2020/02/11,Nagal rolls over Jaziri,"Indian players enjoyed a good day at the office in the $162,000 Bengaluru Open ATP Tennis Challenger at KSLTA Stadium here on Tuesday.

While Saketh Myneni and Niki Poonacha knocked out higher-ranker opponents, Sumit Nagal underlined his class with a comfortable win.

Poonacha created a huge stir, taking out favourite Lukas Rosol 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 in the second round. Rosol, who famously upset Rafael Nadal in the second round of Wimbledon 2012, struggled to get going against Poonacha.

For Poonacha, ranked 937 places below Rosol, this was the biggest victory of his career. “I received a wild-card for this tournament, and I wanted to make the most of it. This win is a huge confidence boost,” the 24-year-old Poonacha said.

As the crowd began to swell in the evening session, Nagal took centrestage. Armed with a crushing forehand, Nagal whipped Tunisia’s Malek Jaziri 6-0, 6-4. Jaziri made the mistake of dropping too many short balls, which Nagal had little trouble dispatching for winners.

Nagal ran around the ball to get his forehand into play — a ploy that worked well. “My forehand is my strength. I’m not going to defeat anyone with a serve-and-volley game,” Nagal said.

The 22-year-old Nagal, however, must be worried about his weak serve, which conceded seven double-faults.

Jaziri, who reached a career-high world ranking of 42 only a year ago, made too many unforced errors. Jaziri was unhappy with a few line calls, but his protests had little impact on the outcome of the match.

Myneni, meanwhile, recorded a 6-3, 6-3 win over sixth-seeded Russian Evgeny Donskoy. Sasikumar Mukund was the rare Indian to disappoint, losing 5-7, 3-6 to Ilya Ivashka of Belarus.

The results: Second round: Saketh Myneni bt Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) 6-3, 6-3; Sumit Nagal bt Malek Jaziri (Tun) 6-0, 6-4; Yuichi Sugita (Jpn) bt Vaclav Safranek (Cze) 6-4, 6-3; Niki Poonacha bt Lucas Rosol (Cze) 6-4, 2-6, 6-3; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Sasikumar Mukund 7-5, 6-3.

First round: Benjamin Bonzi (Fra) bt Manish Sureshkumar 6-2, 6-3; Stefano Travaglia (Ita) bt Filippo Baldi (Ita) 6-2, 6-1; Abhinav Shanmugam bt Daniel Masur (Ger) 7-5, 6-3; Julian Ocleppo (Ita) bt Anirudh Chandrashekar 6-2, 6-1.

216,2020/02/11,March 31 deadline for turning Nizam-era school into lung space,"Concerned over the delay in beautification work of the Old High School grounds and Circus Grounds, Municipal Commissioner Valluru Kranthi has set a deadline of March 31 for the executing agency.

Ms. Kranthi, who assumed charge recently, visited the sites on Tuesday and expressed disappointment over the delay in the development of greenery and construction of compound wall. She advised the executing agency to increase the area for the parking lot in view of ever-increasing vehicles in the town.

TS Planning Board Vice-Chairman B. Vinod Kumar, in his capacity as Karimnagar MP, had in 2017 proposed development of the Old High School — first school in the district set up by the Nizam — into a recreational centre and lung space on the lines of Hyderabad’s Lumbini Park. The plan includes developing greenery, installing fountains, setting up an open-air theatre, cafeteria, children’s playing area etc.

The adjoining Circus Grounds would be turned into a recreational centre with walking track, playground for badminton and volleyball, and a permanent dais for holding small functions.

Ms. Kranthi has also directed the authorities to expedite Smart City works. Local corporator V. Ramana Rao, SE Badraiah and EE Raman were also present.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/o30xuq/article30795449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11-KRANTHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/march-31-deadline-for-turning-nizam-era-school-into-lung-space/article30795442.ece
217,2020/02/11,FASTag operations far from smooth,"A smooth cruise through toll plazas for vehicles which display FASTag is only partially possible at best owing to some unexpected hitches and even glitches in the electronic system of toll collection. It has been about two months since the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) was made mandatory, but problems resulting in unnecessary wait for road users at the plazas persist.

The Nirmal Project Implementation Unit (PIU) of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which has six toll plazas starting with the Pipparwada plaza in Adilabad district to Manoharabad toll plaza near Toopran in Medak district, is a good example of how even avoidable problems are hindering smooth operations of NETC.

The plazas at Pipparwada, Rolmamda, Gamjal and Indalwai have all the infrastructure needed for the NETC. However, brief laxity on the part of the staff at respective plazas often results in a non-FASTag vehicle entering one of the four dedicated FASTag lanes, creating a problem.

While the driver will argue endlessly when asked to pay double the toll amount for his mistake, he cannot turn his vehicle back from the lane as other vehicles would have queued up behind it by that time. “I drove into the FASTag lane as the signboard was not visible,” pointed out Ahmed Altaf from Lucknow, driver of a heavy vehicle destined for Hyderabad, at the Indalwai plaza.

Yes, the toll plazas are poorly illuminated in that the sign designating the lane as FASTag is hardly visible at night and there are no staffers to guide the drivers. Besides, drivers experience a lot of confusion when approaching the plaza as the staff close down a lane temporarily using the rather invisible empty water barrels.

The toll plazas at Bhiknoor and Manoharabad present a picture of chaos with construction work going on there. The staffers scan the FASTags using hand-held scanners, which are prone to malfunction. And when that happens, the flow of traffic is stalled until a new device is put to use. “Poor internet connectivity sometimes has the hand-held devices getting hung and the issue of closing of lanes temporarily arises if the computer systems malfunction,” said Nirmal PIU Project Director A. Tarun Kumar. “With regard to poor visibility of the FASTag signboards, we will rectify the problem,” he asserted.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/gy5h6y/article30795440.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11-ADILA-FASTAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fastag-operations-far-from-smooth/article30795436.ece
218,2020/02/11,Sangareddy stares at water crisis,"Hot summer with a serious water crisis is in the offing for Sangareddy district. Depleting ground water levels have been forcing people to go for more borewells — with water table going down, people are not hesitating to dig borewells even on the roadside.

Diversion of Singur water three years ago to the Sriramsagar project (SRSP) has resulted in depletion of ground water and the impact is felt on the entire district.

Kondapur tops the list of mandals where water levels are falling drastically with availability at 38.58-metre depth, followed by Sangareddy (33.76 metres), Nyalakal (28.49) Gummadidala (28.34), Zaheerabad (27.23), Hatnoora (26.62), Ramachandrapuram (23.72), Pulkal (20.45) and Patancheru (20.21 metres).

The rainfall registered was 764 mm as against the normal 838 m.m. The Manjira has completely dried up and Narayanakhed area is already feeling the pinch.

Even supply of drinking water, which used to be daily before the municipal elections, is now once in two days in some areas while it is once in three days in others. As such, many families are spending between ₹ 300 and ₹ 600 per month on drinking water

“We are a six-member family and we have frequent visitors. Hence, we are forced to buy two water cans every alternate day. With each can costing ₹20, we are spending ₹600 per month,” said T.

219,2020/02/11,Power staff condemn privatisation move in Bihar,"Employees of all power utilities affiliated to several unions and associations staged a protest here on Tuesday under the aegis of National Coordination Committee of Electricity Employees and Engineers (NCCOEEE) condemning “brutal lathicharge” on peacefully protesting Bihar Electricity Employees at Patna on January 27.

The Telananga employees leaders said the Bihar electricity employees had organised a protest opposing privatisation and multiple licenses in power sector. They alleged that the management of Bihar power utilities have suspended Mr. Surendra Kumar illegally.

They stated that the Centre had made its intentions clear during the budget presentation in Parliament recently to privatise the power distribution business completely within the next three years in the name of installing smart prepaid meters at the cost of consumers and the power utilities. The idea was segregation of carriage and content to ensure multiple players in profitable areas, leaving unprofitable areas to the Discoms.

Instead of creating employment the Centre was planning to reduce the employees working in the power utilities by over a lakh across the country, they alleged.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/37gvs3/article30794695.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy11Power,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/power-staff-condemn-privatisation-move-in-bihar/article30794696.ece
220,2020/02/11,Centre reluctant to release funds to Telangana: Vinod Kumar,"Vice Chairman of the State Planning Board B. Vinod Kumar has claimed that the Centre had not provided sufficient funds to Telangana government despite various government agencies like NITI Aayog recommending the same, and it was evident in the response of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Parliament.

In a statement here, he said as per the Finance Minister’s statement the Centre had disbursed just ₹1.5 lakh crore in the last six years, which is ₹25,000 crore per year but the BJP leaders had been claiming much more. “It is time they realise how the Centre has been extending step-motherly treatment to Telangana,” he said.

At the same time, he said the Minister in her reply to a question from Bhongiri MP Komatireddy Venkata Reddy on the State finances had clearly stated that Telangana’s financial position was healthy. Telangana was a revenue-surplus State and the loans raised by the government were well within the stipulated limit as per the Minister’s statement.

Revenue surplus

He asked the BJP and the Congress to stop spreading rumours on the financial status of the State at least now. He reminded that the NITI Aayog had recommended ₹450 crore per annum for the development of backward regions and was approved too. But the instalment for the year 2019-20 is yet to be released.

Mr. Vinod Kumar reminded that NITI Aayog also recommended ₹19,205 crore for Mission Bhagiratha and an amount of ₹5,000 crore for Mission Kakatiya as a special grant to be released over three years. Despite number of requests, the Union Government has not released any amount.

Finance Commission

He claimed there is a shortfall in the release of grants to local bodies and State specific grants recommended by the 13th Finance Commission. Grants allocated to Telangana in the year 2014-15 amounted to ₹3139.46 crore but ₹1557.83 crore were not released to the State.

Out of the grants recommended by the 14th Finance Commission for the period 2015-20, an amount of ₹ 1428.90 crore is yet to be released to the urban local bodies. The shortfall in release of statutory grants recommended by the Finance Commission and the grants recommended by the NITI Aayog amply indicates the neglect of Telangana by the Centre, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/5ns7ei/article30794608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11VINOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/centre-reluctant-to-release-funds-to-telangana-vinod-kumar/article30794609.ece
221,2020/02/11,Government for strengthening District Collector set up: CM,"Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao has said that the State government is for strengthening the institution of District Collector to streamline the administration.

In an interactive session during the Collectors’ Conference at Pragathi Bhavan here on Tuesday, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao heard the views of senior officials and collectors on ‘Palle Pragathi’, ‘Pattana Praghathi’ and ‘Haritha Haaram’ programmes. Under Pattana Pragathi, a ward should be considered a unit, he said.

He also gave clarity on government’s stand on new Municipal Act and Panchayat Raj Act. He said the government had increased the responsibility of collectors in the administration of villages, towns and cities.

Emphasising that collectors should correct the lacunae in land revenue records, he said land related records should be perfect and added that reforms were definitely required for this. In 95% of lands, there was no dispute but remaining should be resolved.

Utilisation certificates

The submission of utilisation certificates for the funds sanctioned under Central schemes should be regular, he told the collectors.

The newly appointed additional collectors to assist the collectors should discharge the responsibilities entrusted to them efficiently. Those who monitor local bodies should have all the data ready in their computers. They should determine the charged amount in villages and towns for the mandatory expenditure on salaries, payment of power and other bills, debt servicing. A two-day training should be conducted for additional collectors on development of villages and towns, he said.

Encroachments

Chief Minister suggested measures to be taken in cities for public convenience, particularly for women and instructed construction of public toilets in all cities on government lands and provision of markets for vegetables and meat and poultry. He, however, cautioned that roadside petty vendors, small shop keepers on foot-paths should not be evicted without showing them an alternative place.

He also wanted focus on restoration of forests, development of urban parks and setting up monkey food courts for which adequate budgetary allocation would be made. Government was serious in resolving land disputes between Forest and Revenue departments and issue of Podu lands.

Pattana Pragathi

Chief Minister asked the district collectors to create awareness on the measures to be taken as part of the Pattana Pragathi programme and organise district-level municipal conference by inviting mayors, deputy mayors, chairpersons, corporators, councillors and commissioners. All the stakeholders should be given training, he said.

Ward-level committees should be appointed prior to taking up the implementation of Pattana Pragathi programme, the Chief Minister said. He gave some broad directions to the collectors on development of urban areas.

The Chief Minister wanted cent per cent collection of taxes in urban areas and an extensive campaign about the rules and regulations under the new Municipal Act.

The collectors were given the power to take up works up to ₹5 lakh in the towns.

Land for civic needs

The administration was asked to identify government lands in the cities and towns and utilise them for parking and other civic needs, develop two km walking tracks in parks in all cities and towns.The officials were directed to raise nurseries even in towns.

The officials were asked to take steps to curb pig menace for prevention of encephalitis and other epidemics and for that the pig-rearers must be shown alternative livelihood.

In-charge officer

An officer should be appointed for every ward as in charge for the Pattana Pragathi programme and he or she would have to monitor the progress in the designated ward.

The collectors were directed to give Pattas to those living in huts on the hills and hillocks.

Urging the officials to focus on safety the Chief Minister told them to take steps to remove the power lines hanging on the houses.

Ministers K. T.

223,2020/02/11,"Give top priority to implementation of govt. programmes, CM tells Collectors","Chief Minister K.Chandrasekhar Rao has categorically spelt out that implementation of government policies aimed at people’s welfare and development alone should be the priority of the district administration.

Addressing the conference of District Collectors and Additional Collectors at Pragathi Bhavan here on Tuesday, Mr. Rao spoke at length about government’s vision, priorities and responsibilities. Government would bring in several Acts, formulate programmes, keeping in view the ground realities and after a detailed discussion in the Legislature, debates and intellectual deliberations as well as consultations with experts on the matters.

In a parliamentary democracy, decisions of the government elected by the people should be implemented in right earnest by the administration, he asserted.

The Chief Minister directed the Collectors to organise Panchayat Raj Sammelan in the next 15 days by inviting Sarpanches, village secretaries, MPTCs, MPPS, ZPTCs and explain to them how to develop villages. People’s representatives from ministers to ZP chairmen should be invited as chief guests and Collectors should talk about duties and responsibilities of representatives of local bodies. They should be given 10 days time to show improvement in upkeep of villages and in 25 days, total transformation should be seen under the ‘Palle Pragathi’ programme. It should not be considered as a special drive but as a continuous process, he said.

He said State-wide inspections would be taken up. “Even, I will come for inspections. Action will be taken if any village is not up to the mark. Incentives and awards will be given to those who keep their villages well,” he said. Chief Minister said Collectors were vested with powers to take action against those who neglected their duties and a tribunal was set up to prevent litigation. After all these, if desired change was not witnessed in villages, government would not tolerate apathy. One of the Additional Collectors would totally focus on local bodies.

Mr.Rao disclosed that government would start ‘Pattana Pragathi’ programmes soon on the lines of ‘Palle Pragathi’ and an action plan would be formulated. Like in Panchayat Raj, government would fill all vacancies in the Municipal department, he said and sought a report on number of vacancies to be filled.

He said pollution was becoming a serious issue and proactive measures be taken to protect Hyderabad, which was rated as the best liveable city, from pollution by taking up afforestation around 1.6 lakh acres of land in and around the State capital. He said the State was leading in many aspects but lagging behind in literacy. Every Collector should strive to make his/her district totally literate. The literacy rate should be recorded in the census data.

Recalling the achievements after the formation of Telangana in overcoming power crisis, extending 24x7 power supply, implementing Mission Bhagiratha for drinking water supply to every household, successful progress of work on irrigation projects, implementation of welfare schemes worth ₹40,000 crore annually and reorganisation of districts, divisions, mandals and panchayats for better administration, Mr.Chandrasekhar Rao said now the priority of the government was clean and green villages and cities.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/give-top-priority-to-implementation-of-govt-programmes-cm-tells-collectors/article30794250.ece

225,2020/02/11,Courier service told to pay ham operator ₹ 2 lakh,"A ham radio operator was in for a relief as a consumer forum directed The Professional Couriers to pay ₹ 2 lakh compensation after a radio it delivered was damaged in transit.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad – III was dealing with a complaint filed by D Bharathi, a resident of Saidabad. The complainant had participated in an expedition to Lakshadweep in 2007 along with the National Institute of Amateur Radio. The ham radio was a gift to her from a Japanese participant.

The complainant stated that she wanted the radio to be delivered to one Pradeep M N Kumar in Bengaluru, approached the courier company and paid ₹ 1,600 in June 2018. She instructed the representative to be careful with the package. Despite this, the ham radio that was delivered to the address was damaged. She later demanded a payment of ₹ 2 lakh from the company and even sent a legal notice.

The forum noted that despite receiving notice, the company failed to appear before it.

Taking the evidence placed on record, the forum noted that there has been a deficiency of service on the part of the company.

“It is therefore, proved that the opposite party which has the obligation to deliver the consignment safely was negligent in handing over the consignment and delivered it in a damaged condition at Bangalore. There is therefore, deficiency of service on the part of the opposite party in rendering courier service to the complainant,” the forum said.

Apart from the compensation, the forum directed the company to pay ₹ 5,000 as costs.

Vijaya Bank

The Telangana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission directed Vijaya Bank to pay ₹ 50,000 as compensation to an account holder for rendering the account of a customer inoperable despite him depositing a ₹ 10 lakh cheque which was credited.

Commission President Justice MSK Jaiswal and Member Meena Ramanathan were dealing with an appeal filed by P Narasimha Rathnam, a resident of Qutbullapur. He said that a borrower had given him a cheque of ₹ 10 lakh which was presented to the bank on November 11, 2013 and was credited to his account on November 11, 2013.

He then withdrew ₹ 2.18 lakh. However, 12 days later, the bank sent him a communication stating the account was marked ‘in lien’ as the cheque deposited was dishonoured.

The Commission noted that the bank should have returned the dishonoured cheque to the complainant. Not doing so has deprived the complainant to file a cheque dishonour case under the Negotiable Instruments Act. The lien attributed to the complainant’s account after 12 days has not been properly explained, it stated.

Apart from the compensation, the Commission directed the bank to operate the bank account and transact the over ₹ 7.91 lakh in it. Costs of ₹ 10,000 were also imposed.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/courier-service-told-to-pay-ham-operator-2-lakh/article30793743.ece
226,2020/02/11,‘AAP victory proves performance prevails’,"The huge win registered by Aam Admi Party in Delhi for a second consecutive term proving beyond doubt that giving priority for education, health and decentralisation of power would fetch votes is a historical necessity for the country, said founder of Foundation For Democratic Reforms (FDR) and Lok Satta Jayaprakash Narayan.

The victory of AAP should be viewed in the context of changing electoral politics of the country. Had AAP been defeated then the narrative that if elections were fought honestly without distributing money, liquor, people would not vote would have continued. It would have also reinforced the perception that caste and religion alone would fetch votes than education and health for another 25 years. The victory achieved by AAP solely on the basis of its work and delivery of services to people should become the foundation for improving Indian democracy. The AAP’s success would inspire change in urban areas first, he said.

Addressing a media conference on the Delhi election results here on Tuesday, Dr. Narayan said that the victory of AAP in 2020 was greater than that of its success in 2013 and 2015. This was the first time a political party went to the electorate and said “We worked for health and education and give us vote,” and won the election against the might of BJP that could deploy any resources at its command and control the media.

In the Lok Sabha election, BJP gained 56% of vote share while AAP got 15%t and in a matter of months, AAP regained power with 50% of vote share. This demonstrated that people of Delhi showed maturity in voting differently at national and State elections keeping in mind what was good for them.

Thus, more than provocative issues like CAA, NRC, NPR, Ramjanma Bhoomi and Shaheen Bagh, people in Delhi gave priority for their day to day life, their children’s education, health. Divisive factors like caste and religion would not always prevail was what Delhi elections proved, Dr. Narayan said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/aap-victory-proves-performance-prevails/article30793712.ece
227,2020/02/11,‘Telangana too needs AAP’,"Aam Admi Party Telangana has said that the AAP regained power in Delhi State elections on the basis of its credible work and thanked the people of Delhi for their mandate.

Addressing a media conference here on Tuesday after the Delhi election results were announced, AAP Telangana State convenor Burra Ramu Goud, joint secretary Rasheed Ulfaq and Senior leader R.Venkat Reddy said it was not the victory of AAP alone but also that of 2 crore voters of Delhi.

Recalling the work done by Arvind Kejriwal’s government in the last five years in improving basic amenities and quality of life for people, they said up to 20,000 litres of drinking water, 200 units of power was given free of cost to people a month and lot of work was done to improve education and health sectors. About 25% of State budget was spent on education.

In the health sector, more than 450 mohalla clinics were set up and public were given free medical treatment in hospitals without any limit. Police and armed forces personnel who laid down their lives while discharging their duty were given a compensation of ₹1 crore.

Mr. Ramu Goud said that a party like AAP was very much needed in Telangana which worked for public welfare and asked for votes on the basis of its performance in specific sectors without invoking caste and religion.

230,2020/02/11,Karimnagar murder: police confident of cracking case in 48 hours,"The Karimnagar police have gathered some clues and are probing further to collect scientific evidence in the gruesome murder of an Intermediate girl student in Karimnagar town on Monday. Police said they are confident of cracking the case within 48 hours.

An Intermediate first year student was found dead with her throat slit with a sharp kitchen knife at her house, when she was alone and preparing for her exams. The incident came to light when her parents returned home in the evening and found her lying in a pool of blood.

No sexual assault

According to the police, there was no sexual assault on the girl. Surprisingly, there was no spilling over of blood when her throat was slit and there were no bloodstains on the walls. There were no marks of resistance from the victim when the accused assaulted her with a knife. The victim was polio-affected, and her parents had recently got correction surgeries on her.

Incidentally, her parents have lodged a complaint with the police that there was a theft in the house and ₹99,000 cash and four tolas of gold ornaments were missing from the almirah. The dog squad was pressed into service and the CLUES team has also collected evidence from the crime scene.

Police have formed eight teams, including four technical teams, to collect evidence from cellphones, CCTV footages and fingerprints. Another four teams would coordinate with the investigation officer (IO). Four persons were called for interrogation.

Ramagundam Commissioner of Police and Karimnagar in-charge Commissioner V. Satyanarayana visited the victim’s house at Vidyanagar on Tuesday and inspected the crime scene and surroundings.

232,2020/02/11,"When viral fever’s the problem, Fever Hospital is the solution","Whenever there is an outbreak of infectious diseases or suspected cases in Telangana, the Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, better known as Fever Hospital, comes into prominence.

Last year, when a high number of dengue cases surfaced, the government hospital became the subject of all health discussions. Even in May 2018, a person suspected to be suffering from Nipah virus was admitted there. It shot back to news after January 24 this year when the first nCoV suspected patient admitted at the hospital tested negative for the virus.

For over a century, people showing symptoms of infectious diseases such as chicken pox, measles, swine flu, etc. are quarantined here. In fact, it was earlier known as Quarantine Hospital, colloquially known as Corenti Hospital.

Current superintendent of the Fever Hospital, K. Shankar said the hospital was established in a shed in 1915 by British nurses during a cholera outbreak here. “Back then, it was on the outskirts of Hyderabad,” he said.

Unlike other hospitals, all blocks of the Fever Hospital, barring two, are on the ground floor. The wards are categorised according to disease.

For example, patients suffering from chicken pox and mumps are admitted to two different wards. Each ward is accommodated in a single floor and separated by large spaces so that chances of a disease being spread is cut down. So is the case of isolation ward where nCoV suspected patients are admitted.

“Staff, nurses and doctors at Fever Hospital are well versed with infectious diseases. As they deal with highly contagious diseases every day, they know how to attend a patient, precautions needs to be taken,” Dr Shankar said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-telangana/e0w3t6/article30788793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10HYKSS01-CityMGHJ73MFUJ4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/when-viral-fevers-the-problem-fever-hospital-is-the-solution/article30786902.ece

238,2020/02/11,Farmers stall work at Gouravelli reservoir,"After a gap of almost six months, the farmers of Gudatipally in Husnabad mandal are in the news again. In the latest instance, they stopped the ongoing works of Gouravelli reservoir on Monday, demanding that payments due to them must be cleared by the government before the completion of reservoir works.

Their contention is that the authorities may not listen to them if the reservoir was completed. About 100 farmers from the village arrived at the bund and stopped the JCB and lorries working at the site.

“Our family had about 10 acres of land. My father U Kanaka Reddy sold away five acres of land. I have another five acres of land on my name, which I have not sold to the government because proper compensation was not extended to us. Despite repeated appeals the government has been failing to pay us all the dues,” said U Anil Reddy of Gudatipally.

“Farmers having a total of about 250 acres have already approached the court seeking justice. Some of the farmers who gave consent for houses were not yet paid compensation. The year 2015 was set as cut-off date for identifying 18-year-olds to get compensation and they were promised a compensation of ₹ 2 lakh in 2015. But that amount was also not paid so far. There are as many as 146 persons eligible for this package,” said Gudatipally sarpanch B Raji Reddy.

Capacity extended

Gouravelli reservoir was proposed more than a decade back with a capacity of 1.5 tmcft by late Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy as part of Pranahita- Chevella project and 1,832 acres of land was acquired. However, after coming to power the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) redesigned and enhanced its capacity to 8.4 tmcft. Villagers say that the government has not been offering them houses as the village is not getting submerged.

“The officials will not hear our voice once the work is completed. Hence we have stopped works. We will not allow works till all compensations are paid to us,” Mr. Raji Reddy told The Hindu.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/kcp78w/article30786442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11GUDATIPALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/farmers-stall-work-at-gouravelli-reservoir/article30786443.ece
239,2020/02/11,Padma Shri awardee Manohar Devadoss on what inspires his art,"Artist. Writer. Musician. Scientist. Raconteur — there are multiple facets to Manohar Devadoss. “In fact, the official who called to tell me that I have been awarded the Padma Shri said the awards committee was in a dilemma about which category to put me in, before they settled for ‘Art’!” he chuckles.

At 83 years, with several books and awards behind him, I ask the self-taught artist who gradually lost his vision to Retinitis pigmentosa and a cataract, what the Padma Shri — the fourth highest civilian award in India — means to him. “The affection and love that I enjoy from so many people (my friends from Aravind Eye Hospital, Shankara Nethralaya and institutions like my alma mater — the American College, Madurai and of course, my church in San Thome) are rewards in themselves, now this is an additional one. However, I do miss my dear wife Mahema at this time...” He says he particularly cherishes a letter of commendation from the Prime Minister which reads, “The collective contributions of your late wife and you are indeed a matter of pride…” And what a team they were.

“Just three days after our ninth wedding anniversary in 1972, Mahema became a quadriplegic, in a car accident” recalls Manohar. “Around two years after that, my vision began to fade. But we never gave up. In fact, we grew closer in our trials.”

Overcoming adversity

“During that difficult time, it was the love showered on us by countless people that kept us going,” says Manohar. “Starting with the doctor couple who rescued us from the accident site, the team at JIPMER Pondicherry, the young medicos at CMC Vellore who literally partied in our room, cheering us up through rehabilitation, the steady stream of visitors from Oberlin College, US, where we with our daughter Suja had spent two extremely happy years, the countless well-wishers who rallied around us, to the members of the youth fellowship at CSI St Thomas English Church who visited frequently and even drove us to picnics and movies — it is because of every act of kindness that we triumphed. My mother cared for Mahema as her own daughter, and that inspired me to do the same.”

Age of innocence

I ask him the secret to his ever-cheerful disposition, and he looks back to his happy boyhood in Madurai — captured so well in his book Green Well Years that he started writing when he had almost completely lost his vision in 1983.

“If you hadn’t had cataract, you would not have a book. You would have spent all your time drawing...” Mahema would often say, and this helped him see the brighter side of things. “When my vision was partially restored after surgery, I went on an overdrive, producing so many artworks, that I even had an art exhibition.”

Manohar started sketching trees and everyday objects at the age of five. He transitioned to copying great works of art like Michelangelo’s David and Bertel Thorvaldsen’s Christus from books, experimenting with watercolours.

The first milestone in his artistic journey was the intricate pen-and-ink sketch of the Jubilee Chapel in The American College, during his final year in 1956, as a 19-year-old. “This drawing evoked far greater enthusiasm from the students than even the ones I did of the college beauty, Bhavani,” recalls Manohar in his book Multiple Facets of My Madurai. It was printed on the cover of the college magazine and came to be his signature style.

Manohar and Mahema Devadoss | Photo Credit: special arrangement

But it is love that brought out the artist in him. When he met Mahema through a mutual cousin, Manohar put his talent to good use by illustrating almost every letter he wrote to her.

Mahema, a gold medallist in Fine Arts was the perfect impetus to his artistic genius. “In 1966, we did a greeting card with my oil painting of a 120-ft long country raft on the Buckingham Canal near Pulicat Lake. Many friends wanted it, and so we decided to do more such heritage cards and give the proceeds to charity. I drew, she wrote the text, and it continued even after the accident, for 42 years until 2007, when we sold a record 33,000 cards.”

Speaking about his love for Mahe as he affectionately refers to her, Manohar affirms that theirs was a marriage filled with generous doses of laughter, “We used to tease each other, had nicknames, and could laugh even during the laborious task of having to turn Mahema in bed every three hours (to prevent bed sores).

It was also a relationship of mutual respect — Mahema read to me, even as I sketched with limited vision.”

He on his part, had devised an indigenous contraption above her bed, so that she could see his drawings. “Even on the night she entered eternal sleep in 2008, Mahema asked to see the drawing I was making of the Clock Tower at the Madras University and was pleased with it.”

Manohar looks forward to two new publications this year — Madras Inked — a profusely illustrated book on landmarks in Chennai, co-authored with Sujatha Shankar and Challenges, Resilience & Triumph, on his life with Mahema. “Though my last artwork was in 2009, I could draw simple, semi-abstract sketches with help, even until six months ago.

240,2020/02/11,Following Seismic Movements at the Dhaka Art Summit,"It is the weekend in Dhaka and the traffic is bumper to bumper. It helps, however, that many are going in my direction: to the Shilpakala Academy in the city’s University belt, where the Dhaka Art Summit (DAS) has just opened. It is the fifth edition of what has become one of the main cultural highlights of the local calendar. But it is also a first of sorts — the first time the nine-day exhibition has been curated with an overarching theme.

“Each edition has been different, responding to the time and place we are in. The first [in 2012] focussed on Bangladesh; the second on Bangladesh via South Asia; the third looked at international artists transformed by South Asia [like Linda Benglis, who has a studio in Ahmedabad]; the fourth, around the time of the Rohingya crisis, looked at the cross-sections between South Asia and South East Asia,” explains Diana Campbell Betancourt, DAS’ chief curator.

However, it soon struck the 35-year-old that “the word South Asia is a hangover of British colonial era, and South East Asia of cold war politics”. So, why not define things with another term that is not nationalistic? “This is also a time of intense protests, so Seismic Movements seemed apt [for 2020],” she adds.

Haroon Mirza’s Lectures in Theology, a sound and light installation, takes inspiration from architect Muzharul Islam’s blueprints

Storeys and stories

Two art works at the summit crystallise these ideas. The first is Seismography of Struggles, a video and sound installation depicting montages of non-European journals produced in the wake of the revolutionary movements of the late 18th century, and leading up to 1989, when the world was dominated by two blocs. “I first saw this work [a multilingual research exercise conducted at France’s National Institute of Art History] in Senegal and I was blown away. You could see how the struggles of a slave in Haiti could be similar to that of a peasant farmer in Bengal,” says Betancourt, as I catch her in the middle of ensuring that the audio-visual system was glitch-free and the lighting of the art works was “just right”.

The second work is Adrián Villar Rojas’ immersive floor-based installation, Raw Mutants, a marble floor encrusted with 400 million-year-old fossils. It is also the first piece visitors see — or walk over — as they enter the venue. “These extinct species are from before the Pangea shift, when the world was one super ocean. So, somehow, when these two came together, the rest of the show came into place.”

Dhaka-based artist Kamruzzaman Shadhin’s The Fibrous Souls

Spanning four floors of Shilpakala, the summit brings together artists and collectives from around the world, grouping their works under distinct labels: Geological Movements, Colonial Movements, Feminist Futures and the like. But there is a conscious effort to not dwell on origin, to intentionally keep national identity secondary. “I have no idea how many countries or artists there are,” laughs Betancourt. “I’ve also stripped the countries from the catalogues because… why box them in? We have artists who were born in British India, educated in East Pakistan, had their first child in Bangladesh, and all without ever moving out of their house! This country has changed names many times in someone’s lifetime and it could change again. So, it is more about where you are from as a locality.”

Héctor Zamora’s Existence Emitting Movements

Fire, water and a tea party

Each day is peppered with performances, workshops, discussions and, of course, interactive installations. On the opening day, artist Héctor Zamora’s Existence Emitting Movements had everyone captivated. We had all noticed raw clay vessels grouped around a large pillar on the first floor as we made our way through the many exhibits, but its meaning had escaped us, until several young women began to wend their way through them, smashing the urns under their feet. It was a show of rebellion, a disruption of the order of things. In India, Bangladesh and the artist’s native Mexico, a woman carrying a jug on her head denotes the “domestic labour women are weighed down with”. By inverting the equation and placing the jugs under women’s feet, the atrium became a shared space of liberation for us all.

Zurich-based artist Raphael Hefti’s Quick Fix Remix

Later that day, another powerful installation played with fire. Literally. At 5 pm, under a cloudy sky, ominous metal cauldrons spewed lava-like liquid that moved slowly down incisions carved into a hillock of dirt. Zurich-based artist Raphael Hefti then wielded water to cool the glowing hot metal down, creating free-form sculptures — his way of exploring ‘artistic alchemy’ to study the industrial practices that form our machine-made landscapes.

In the days to come, check out Montage, my beautiful tool, a selection of films by Lebanese filmmaker Rania Stephan, a printmaking workshop by collectives Grafis Huru Hara, Indonesia, and Pangrok Sulap, Malaysia, and a panel on Combatting Islamophobia and Stereotypes through Art. When you have the time, stop by Yasmin Jahan Nupur’s Let me get you a nice cup of tea, a performative piece that explores human relationships, where visitors can sit down for tea with the Dhaka-based artist (all day, till February 12). And don’t miss the talks, where artists and curators discuss everything from ‘Collective Practice and Economy’ (at the Collectives Hub) to ‘Film Societies: Sites for Seeing’ (February 12, 6-8 pm).

241,2020/02/11,Man dies in police custody in Kolkata,"A man detained in a north Kolkata police station was found dead in custody, officials said on Tuesday.

Rajkumar Shaw (53), detained on suspicion of theft, was found dead at the Sinthi police station in north Kolkata. His family members alleged that he died because of “police torture”. An inquiry has been launched against two sub-inspectors and a sergeant, the officials said.

Appearing for the State government, Additional Advocate General Abhratosh Majumder told the High Court that “a specific case” has been started regarding the death. Officials were tight-lipped about the charges pressed against the policemen.

The BJP claimed that Shaw was a party member. He was detained on the basis of information provided by a woman who was in police custody in the case. She said she had sold the stolen items to Shaw, police sources said.

A Bench comprising Chief Justice T.B.N. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Banerjee directed the government to submit action-taken and the post-mortem reports on February 25, the next date of hearing of the case.

242,2020/02/11,Mamata hails Kejriwal’s big win in Delhi polls,"West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday called Delhi Chief Minister and national convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Arvind Kejriwal and congratulated him for his party’s outstanding show in the Delhi Assembly elections.

She also took the opportunity to target the BJP, saying those “playing on faith through hate speech and divisive politics should take a cue” from the poll results.

“Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal as #DelhiResults show @AamAadmiParty all set to win #DelhiElection2020 with a thumping majority yet again. Leaders playing on faith through hate speech & divisive politics should take a cue, as only those who deliver on their promises are rewarded,” she tweeted.

Speaking to journalists in Kolkata before leaving for Bankura, the Chief Minister said she maintained good relations with Mr. Kejriwal. “Despite much religious fanaticism and narrow hatred politics, it is a victory of the people. The Centre with all its agencies and brute force could not do what it wanted to do. The BJP is losing in all places where elections are being conducted as people are rejecting its narrow, divisive politics. People want jobs, people want roti, kapda, makaan [food, clothing and shelter], people want development,” she said.

Ms. Banerjee described the Delhi poll results as a “victory of democracy” and said that politics should be for peace, development and welfare of the country.

‘Drop CAA, NRC’

Later in the day, addressing a public rally at Bankura, Ms. Banerjee said the BJP is now gradually becoming “a stateless entity” and added that in 2021, Bengal will drive the last nail into its coffin.

She urged the BJP to withdraw the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “The BJP should now rollback the CAA and drop plans for carrying out a nationwide NRC,” she said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/eyn0uq/article30795457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE12MAMATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mamata-hails-kejriwals-big-win-in-delhi-polls/article30795458.ece
243,2020/02/11,Ministry of Earth Sciences may go in for decadal forecast system,"The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is planning a ‘decadal forecast’ system along the lines of the United Kingdom’s Met Office to ensure better predictability in the climate time scale, said Dr. M. Rajeevan, Secretary, MoES recently.

Speaking on the sidelines of the 6th International Conference on Climate Services being held at the Pune-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Dr. Rajeevan said the system, based on a coupled climate model, would first be taking shape in the form of a research programme and would be operational only after its merits had been evaluated.

“This is a new idea with more relevance to present climate forecasting needs. So, given the need for longer-range prediction for 10 or 20 years, we will be starting a new programme in the country using a coupled climate model by utilising signals emanating from deep oceans to predict decadal climate changes,” he said.

Refusing to elaborate on the operational aspects of the programme, Dr. Rajeevan said the system would be explored as a research programme to be taken up by IITM along with collaboration from the India Meteorological Department and other entities.

“The operational part will be discussed later. First, we will have to conduct significant research and determine the system’s effectiveness,” he said.

The World Meteorological Organization has set up global producing centres, coordinated by the U.K. Met Office, for annual to decadal projections that are already providing global-scale information.

“As there is a lot fundamental work [on the decadal forecasting system] that has already been done, we feel India should not lag behind,” Dr. Rajeevan said.

Once the system was established, it would initially function for long-range forecasting at the national level and the model, if successful, would later be downscaled to the state or even district-level, he said.

Dr. Rajeevan said there were a number of gaps in the understanding of regional climate variability and its connections to global phenomena like Indian Ocean Dipole. Indian forecasters, he said, faced a challenge in maintaining the quality of climate observations, and there is a need on the part of researchers to develop applications for specific sectors based on the available climate forecast.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ministry-of-earth-sciences-may-go-in-for-decadal-forecast-system/article30795350.ece

Chetram, 45, was shot dead by his daughter when he tried to fire at his son after an argument with his wife late on Monday night in Mitthauli village, they said.

“While Chetram, a retired soldier, died on the spot, his wife Rajkumari (38) and daughter Alka (19) are battling for their lives at a hospital,” SSP Shalabh Mathur said.

Ms. Alka told police that her father had shot at her mother with a pistol at around 11 p.m. on Monday. She was also shot at when she intervened, he said.

Then Chetram tried to shoot his 13-year-old son, Adarsh, but Ms. Alka snatched the pistol from him and shot him dead, he said.

245,2020/02/11,Row over inclusion of 2G accused in Maharashtra government panel,"The Maharashtra government has sparked off a controversy by including real estate developers Shahid Balwa and Vinod Goenka — both were accused and later acquitted in the 2G spectrum scam — in a steering committee to review issues concerning the real estate sector.

However, this is not the first time the duo have been part of government consultation and at least one of them was on the 20-member consultative committee formed by the BJP to formulate a housing policy for the State in 2015.

The committee comprising senior officials and industry representatives was set up following a meeting of industry representatives with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The MVA government later denied having included the two on the panel.

The committee includes Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, Transport Minister Anil Parab, senior officials besides leading developers such as Niranjan Hiranandani, Rajan Bandlekar, Nayan Shah, Shahid Balwa, Boman Irani, Ajay Ashar, Vinod Goenka, Dominic Rommel and Dilip Thakkar. The announcement of names on committee was made by the Chief Minister's Office (CMO).

Both Mr Balwa and Mr Goenka were accused in the 2G scam but were later acquitted by a Delhi court.

''The news circulated on social media is not factual and unrealistic @OfficeofUT (Uddhav Thackeray) has asked me and @mieknathshinde (Eknath Shinde) to be the members plus some secretaries of housing Industry will be on the committee,'' the minister tweeted.

Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad tweeted that reports of their appointment were politically motivated.

In the meeting on Monday, the developers’ lobby had sought concessions for the sector in the Budget, including a 50% cut in stamp duty, which would bring relief to home buyers and help push sales.

A delegation comprising members of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) and Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) met Chief Minister Thackeray to demand relief for the struggling construction sector.

246,2020/02/11,Rohingya can’t be kept in jail after serving term: Calcutta High Court,"Once Rohingya refugees complete their jail term after being caught as illegal immigrants, they cannot be kept in prison, said Calcutta High Court. The refugees will have to be taken to a safe place, said the lawyer of four Rohingya petitioners who have completed their jail term in 2018.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice T.B. Radhakrishnan and Justice Arijit Bandopadhyay said once the jail term of a convicted person was over, he could not be kept in the prison. The government could shift them to a safe place and continue to monitor but jail was not the place to lodge them, Sudip Ghosh Chowdhury, counsel of the Rohingya refugees, said quoting from the court’s observation.

Mr. Ghosh Chowdhury had moved the court on behalf of an organisation that filed a habeas corpus petition to produce the arrested Rohingya refugees. The petition said the refugees, who were arrested in 2016, completed their jail term in the summer of 2018. However, even nearly two years after their term completion, the four refugees were still lodged in the Dum Dum Correctional Home which was unacceptable, the court said.

Shubanso (20), who was studying at a university in the U.K, was found dead at his apartment in Brighton in Sussex, they said. He was the son of Mr. Pul with his first wife Dangwimsai Pul.

The Pul family is trying to get in touch with the Indian High Commission in the U.K. to bring back Shubanso’s body. With the support of a few elected members of the Congress and the BJP, Mr. Pul became the Chief Minister for a brief period in 2016.

Mr. Pul allegedly hanged himself at his official residence in Niti Vihar in Itanagar on August 9, 2016.

248,2020/02/11,"Arunachal Pradesh has potential to generate 50,000 MW of hydropower: Pema Khandu","Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu on Tuesday said the State has the potential to generate 50,000 MW of hydropower.

Mr. Khandu said that despite being the richest State in the country in terms of hydropower resources that could overhaul its economy, Arunachal Pradesh still has to depend upon the Centre for its sustenance.

He said the State was now producing only 2% of its hydropower potential.

Addressing a seminar on ‘Prosperity of Arunachal Pradesh through accelerated Hydropower development’ in Itanagar, the Chief Minister said hydropower was the future of the State.

“Time has come to shed the dependency syndrome and we should find ways to generate states own resources from the abundant hydropower resources,” Mr. Khandu said.

“For the last 10-15 years, we have been told that Arunachal Pradesh is the powerhouse of India. Where is this powerhouse?”, he asked.

The Chief Minister asked the hydropower development department to prioritise 10 power projects that could be taken up during the next five year period.

“There is no point taking up projects at random. Let us focus on 10 feasible and beneficial projects and we will take these up on mission mode,” he said.

Mr. Khandu, however, advocated that mini and micro hydel projects should also be implemented side by side at places that do not have grid connectivity.

The Chief Minister said that the State revenue which stood at about ₹900 crore when he took over as Chief Minister in 2016, has increased to about ₹2,000 crore in 2018-19.

“As has been projected, think how much will be our revenue when we start earning ₹15,000 crore per year only from hydropower projects if implemented?”, he wondered.

The Chief Minister blamed ‘petty politics’ played by some vested interests in putting hurdles or stalling power projects in the State.

“As the government is stable with AN absolute majority, detractors have nothing to do but play ‘petty politics’ and hamper developmental projects just to harass the ruling government.

“In my opinion those who put hurdles in developmental projects just for the heck of it are anti-nationals. I call upon all, even those in the Opposition, to shed our politics and join hands with the government to bring in investments and successfully complete all developmental projects including hydropower,” he said.

Mr. Khandu warned government officials from the top to the lowest level to refrain from conniving with vested interests and indulging in acts hampering projects.

“I have directed the Chief Secretary to take to task any official found to be misleading the people and hampering implementation of projects,” he said.

Mr. Khandu said that Chinas opposition had deprived Arunachal Pradesh from getting fund from lenders such as World Bank, Asian Development Bank and JICA, but despite such challenges, the State cannot sit idle and should work on modalities for earning revenue from hydropower sector.

Referring to the 2880 MW Dibang multi-purpose project in the State, the Chief Minister informed that during his recent visit to the area, he convinced the project affected people who agreed to withdraw the case filed in the court, to pave way for early execution of the project.

Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein, who also holds the Hydropower portfolio, said that the State has been ‘crying’ for lack of resources when the ‘resources’ are right at the doorstep.

Urging all not to look further, he called for united efforts to harness the hydropower potential which is abundant in the State. Mr. Mein said the State government would set up a system where clearances are given in a timely manner and developers are made to feel secure for investment.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/d67eln/article29356876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI12282018000227B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/arunachal-pradesh-has-potential-to-generate-50000-mw-of-hydropower-pema-khandu/article30793037.ece
249,2020/02/11,BJP moves motion in Rajasthan Assembly against notification allowing commercial activities in Sambhar Lake area,"The Opposition BJP moved an adjournment motion in the Rajasthan Assembly against a notification issued by the State government to carry out commercial activities in the Sambhar Salt Lake catchment area.

While moving the motion, Deputy Leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore alleged that tenders were invited despite the authorities issuing a notice to stop commercial activities in the catchment area of the lake.

He also alleged that over 2,000 units were involved in illegal salt mining in the catchment area, where tubewells had been dug and brine water was being stolen.

He also highlighted the death of migratory birds in the lake area in November last year, saying it brought a bad repute to the State and the Rajasthan government could not “shy away from its responsibility”.

Chomu BJP MLA Ramlal Sharma sought the government’s response on the death of migratory birds and said it should be investigated whether the deaths occurred due to pollution, lack of oxygen or excessive mining.

In reply to the adjournment motion, Forest and Environment Minister Sukhram Bishnoi said 22,976 birds died due to botulism, a disease common in Europe and North Africa.

“Action is being taken to shut down the illegal tubewells and hotels being run for the past five years in the Sambhar Lake area,” the Minister said, adding that the previous government had permitted a hotel to run without an NOC from the Forest and Environment Department.

To this, Mr. Rathore said the State government should then shut down the hotel and it could not allow other private parties to carry out commercial activities on this pretext.

The Minister also said a wetland authority and a standing committee had been constituted for the management of the lake and look into all aspects of activities being run in its catchment area.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rpmfe6/article28216203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE28-RATHORE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-moves-motion-in-rajasthan-assembly-against-notification-allowing-commercial-activities-in-sambhar-lake-area/article30792924.ece

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said in Lok Sabha that 5,300 more families initially registered with Jammu and Kashmir but subsequently moved to other parts of the country.

Further, during the Indo-Pak wars of 1965 and 1971, a total of 10,065 families registered as displaced families from Chhamb Niabat from across the border, he said in a written reply to a question.

Mr. Reddy said both the Centre and the government of Jammu and Kashmir have been providing several relief and rehabilitation packages from time to time to the displaced families of POJK and Chhamb.

For the displaced families of 1947 which stayed in Jammu and Kashmir, the government of Jammu and Kashmir had allotted agricultural land ranging from 4-8 acres per family.

Those who settled in urban areas were provided plots/quarters besides cash ex-gratia of ₹3,500 per family. For those families which did not get land allotted according to prescribed scales, cash compensation was sanctioned by government of India against land deficiency.

The Minister said others were allotted land/plot/quarter as per fixed scale for their rehabilitation. The displaced families which did not settle in Jammu and Kashmir were paid an ex-gratia of ₹3,500 per family at the time of their registration.

For the displaced families of 1965 and 1971, agricultural land at the rate of 4 acres (irrigated) or 6 acres (un-irrigated) was allotted.

A cash compensation of ₹3,000 per family for displaced families of 1965 and ₹7,500 per family for 1971 was also paid.

The families of 1965 which did not settle in camps set up by the government, were also paid ₹25,000 per family as ex-gratia later on.

The statue was removed on Monday, a day after it was installed on the occasion of Sant Ravidas Jayanti, said an official of Khatoli police station, under whose jurisdiction the village falls.

254,2020/02/11,No restrictions on visit of any Indian citizen to J&K: Home Ministry,"There are no restrictions on visit of any Indian citizen to the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, the government informed Parliament on Tuesday.

In response to a question seeking to know the time by which the government proposes to allow Indian delegates to visit Jammu and Kashmir, Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy told the Lok Sabha that there are no restrictions on any Indian citizen to visit the Union Territory.

On the question of visit of foreign ambassadors there, the minister said a visit of heads of 15 Missions to Jammu and Kashmir was organised on January 9-10 “in view of requests received from foreign Missions based in Delhi with a view to have better understanding of the situation in the UT.”

As per report, a group of resident Heads of Missions (HoMs) from 15 countries — Argentina, Bangladesh, Fiji, Guyana, Maldives, Morocco, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Peru, South Korea, Togo, the United States and Vietnam — visited Jammu and Kashmir, Mr. Reddy said.

They met civil administration, political leaders, representatives of the civil society including youth from different ethnic, religious and socio-economic communities, representatives of mainstream media from Kashmir, and the displaced Kashmiri Pandit community, he said.

“During their visit, the HoMs interacted freely, met different people and could see the prevailing normalcy in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir. The HoMs welcomed the organisation of the visit and acknowledged the prevailing normalcy in UT of Jammu and Kashmir,” Reddy said.

The minister said a select group of countries representing different geographical regions were invited for the visit to the UT in order to maintain the group size manageable and broad-based.

“The HoMs of some of the European Union countries welcomed the initiative but regretted that they won’t be able to visit the UT due to short notice. They, however, expressed interest to visit Jammu and Kashmir at a later date,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8eeo0/article30792454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DELEGATESANDKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/no-restrictions-on-visit-of-any-indian-citizen-to-jk-home-ministry/article30792455.ece
255,2020/02/11,"AAP’s thumping victory: BJP’s losing streak will continue, says Sharad Pawar","With the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) achieving a thumping victory over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Delhi Assembly election, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday hurled barbs at the saffron party while urging regional parties to present a united front to keep the BJP out of power in Assembly and general elections.

Lauding the AAP’s emphatic performance, Mr. Pawar accused the BJP of polarisation and said the people of Delhi had rejected the saffron party’s divisive policies.

“The results indicate that winds of change are blowing in the country. I am not surprised by the results. The BJP, as was expected, played their communal card to polarise voters but failed comprehensively,” said the NCP supremo, remarking that the saffron party’s arrogance had proved to be its undoing.

The regional parties must come together to keep the BJP out of power. The Delhi results were not merely limited to the capital alone as people from all States resided there, he said.

Mr. Pawar, himself the prime architect of the unlikely coalition of the Shiv Sena, the NCP and the Congress in Maharashtra, said the regional parties must come together under a “common minimum programme” and provide a stable government to keep the BJP out of power.

“As there is a climate of change in their own respective States, this is what people have expressed while exercising their franchise in Delhi.”

“One has seen what happened [to the BJP] in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. I do not think this sequence of electoral defeats will stop now,” he said.

Earlier, the NCP chief congratulated Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Twitter following the latter’s success.

“Congratulations to Shri Arvind Kejariwalji and Aam Admi Party workers for achieving a ‘Sweeping Victory’ in the Delhi Assembly Polls!” he tweeted.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9yeyp6/article30792277.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SharadPawar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aaps-thumping-victory-bjps-losing-streak-will-continue-says-sharad-pawar/article30792283.ece
256,2020/02/11,Opposition boycotts Question Hour in Rajasthan Assembly over Deepika’s ‘Chhapaak’,"Opposition members boycotted the Question Hour in Rajasthan Assembly on Tuesday after the Speaker expunged a question by a BJP member on Chhapaak actor Deepika Padukone.

BJP legislator Shankar Singh Rawat first questioned the government about the revenue loss after the movie was declared tax-free in Rajasthan on January 10.

Replying to the question, Parliamentary Affair Minister Shanti Dhariwal told the House that the tax calculation can be done only by February 20. But Speaker CP Joshi did not allow a supplementary question about the actor, triggering an uproar from the opposition benches.

The movie Chhapaak faced the wrath of a section of people after Padukone visited the Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi to express solidarity with the students attacked by a masked mob on the campus on January 5.

After the uproar in the House, during which opposition members entered the well, Leader of Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria tried to speak on the issue but the Speaker did not allow, saying the supplementary question was related to the Department of Culture.

But opposition members continued their protest, urging the Speaker to protect their right to ask questions and later boycotted the Question Hour.

“It is the right of members of the House to ask supplementary questions but the Speaker did not allow us and therefore we boycotted the Question Hour,” Deputy Leader of Opposition in the House Rajendra Rathore told reporters outside the assembly.

The Speaker, however, continued the proceedings and ministers replied to questions asked in absence of the members who raised them.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/26q39k/article30791000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHHAPAAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/opposition-boycotts-question-hour-in-rajasthan-assembly-over-deepikas-chhapaak/article30791001.ece
257,2020/02/11,J&K Congress leader produces himself before NIA for questioning,"Senior Congress leader and former minister G.M. Saroori on Tuesday produced himself before the National Investigation Agency here for questioning in connection with a series of terrorist attacks in Kishtwar district.

Saroori, 67, who is Jammu and Kashmir Congress vice-president and three-time legislator from Inderwal constituency, was served a notice under Section 160 CrPC by the probe agency, asking him to appear before it to answer “certain questions” relating to a case registered by NIA in the district in 2018.

“I don’t know why I was summoned under section 160 CrPC... Do you think I have any connection with Hizbul Mujahideen or Osama (a slain terrorist),” Saroori told reporters outside the NIA office.

The communally sensitive Kishtwar had been rocked by a series of terror incidents since November 2018 after the hilly district was declared terrorism-free over a decade ago.

Terrorists shot dead senior BJP leader Anil Parihar and his brother Ajit Parihar on November 1, 2018, while RSS functionary Chanderkant Sharma and his PSO were assassinated on April 9, 2019.

They also snatched the service rifle of the deputy commissioner’s PSO on March 8, 2019, and the rifle of the PSO of People’s Democratic Party district president on September 13 last year.

The NIA is investigating the terror cases.

The first major success against terrorists in the district was registered on September 28 last year when security forces killed three ultras, including the mastermind behind the killings Osama Bin Javed, in Ramban district.

In September last year, Saroori’s brother Mohammad Shafi was among a dozen persons booked in two separate FIRs for their alleged links with Hizbul Mujahideen but was not arrested.

Shafi refuted having any links with the group and said the allegations against him were “politically motivated”.

Eleven others, including passersby, were also injured in the accident which took place near Pawan Dham on Bhilwara-Kota state highway late on Monday night. The family was returning home to Sandhara village in Madhya Pradesh’s Mandsaur district after attending a function, they said.

Nahid Zaidi, 40, who teaches English and Social Sciences at Asha Modern School, told PTI she was also suspended from the school after she visited Shaheen Bagh on January 19 and answered a few questions of the media there.

“The video found its way to some people from local right-wing groups who put it on Facebook with derogatory remarks about me,” Ms. Zaidi said.

While the school principal did not respond to calls for a comment, Saharanpur Superintendent of Police Vineet Bhatnagar said the teacher was not suspended. Bhatnagar said a group of people protested against Ms. Zaidi’s comments at Shaheen Bagh, but the situation is peaceful now.

Ms. Zaidi said she did speak about any particular religion and was being “targeted by the right-wing groups at the behest of the local BJP leadership”.

On Monday, around 200 local residents entered the school during recess and raised slogans, she claimed. “Under their pressure, the principal put me under suspension and asked me to resign. Later, in the evening, the suspension was revoked after police and local leaders intervened,” she said.

Among the new schemes introduced, the highest allocation of ₹2,500 crore was made for Bandhu Prakalpa for providing ₹1,000 monthly pension to persons from the SC community above 60 years of age not covered in any other pension scheme. Similarly, the allocation for pension to elderly persons of the ST community titled Jai Johar Prakalpa is ₹500 crore. Under Hasir Alo scheme, no electricity tariff will be charged from customers whose quarterly consumption is less than 75 units and an allocation of ₹200 crore has been made for the same.

266,2020/02/11,Warner hints at quitting T20Is,"Australian big-hitter David Warner says he is likely to quit T20 cricket in the next “few years” to prolong his Test and ODI career and spend more time with his young family, which includes three children.

The 33-year-old won Cricket Australia’s Allan Border Medal for Player-of-the-Year on Monday, completing an emotional turnaround after the ignominy of being suspended for ball tampering in 2018. He broke down after receiving the award, which was his third overall.

He was also named the T20 Player-of-the-Year.

“I think you look at Twenty20 Internationals, we’ve got back-to-back World Cups as well,” Warner was quoted as saying by the Australian Associated Press.

“That’s probably a format that could be one I drop in a few years. It’s going to be very difficult to play all three forms - and good luck to all the guys that want to keep playing - it’s challenging,” he explained.

Warner averages over 40 in both the Test and ODI formats and has a strike rate of over 140 in T20s. The two T20 World Cups are to be held in Australia (this year) and India (next year).

Warner said former India opener Virender Sehwag is among the retired lot that he has spoken with, to understand the fatigue of playing all three formats.

“I speak to guys like A.B. de Villiers, Virender Sehwag, guys who have done that for a long time, it does become challenging. Having three young kids and my wife at home all the time, the constant travelling becomes very difficult,” he said.

The temperamental batsman has endured a tough two years following the ball-tampering scandal but has shown tremendous grit. In November, he smashed his highest Test score with an unbeaten 335.

267,2020/02/11,A battle for pride between Vidarbha and Hyderabad,"Two-time champion Vidarbha and bottom-placed Hyderabad will be engaged in a battle for pride in their last league match of the Ranji Trophy Elite Group at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here from Wednesday.

Vidarbha, which has 18 points from seven matches, must defeat Hyderabad either by an innings or by 10 wickets and then hope for various permutations and combinations to stay in the hunt for a knock-out berth.

On the other hand, Hyderabad faces the ignominy of relegation as it has just six points from seven matches so far, including one win and six losses.

Hyderabad coach N. Arjun Yadav insisted that nothing short of an outright win will save his team from avoiding a major embarrassment.

“We are aware of the scenario, but certainly not down and out,” he said. “Somehow our batting never clicked as a unit though the bowlers have been outstanding. The selectors made some changes for this match, dropping experienced southpaw B. Sandeep, J. Mallikarjun and Himalay Agarwal and brought in exciting young talent Prateek Reddy, who did well in the Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy, and Rakshan Reddy,” Arjun said.

The home team is expecting the return of Mohd. Siraj, back from India-A’s tour to New Zealand, will bolster the bowling attack and complement the leading wicket-taker Ravi Kiran (22).

India U-19 World Cup top order batsman Thakur Tilak Varma is not available.

It has been a forgetful season so far for Hyderabad with captain Tanmay Agarwal, wicketkeeper-batsman K. Sumanth and seasoned opener P. Akshath Reddy, who played a career-saving innings in the last match against Punjab here, coming good in patches. The bowling invariably revolves around the pace trio of Ravi Kiran, Chama Milind and Ravi Teja. Spinners Saaketh Sai Ram and Mehdi Hassan never really threatening to bowl out an opposition.

Meanwhile, Vidarbha coach Chandrakant Pandit insisted that the team wanted to finish the season on a high, though it has not done really well in the last couple of games.

“We are not going to take this game lightly. We will be playing for pride even as we are happy with the way young talent has shaped up this season,” Pandit said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-battle-for-pride-between-vidarbha-and-hyderabad/article30792954.ece
268,2020/02/11,"NZ vs IND ODI | Lacked composure, didn’t deserve to win, says Virat Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli on Tuesday berated his bowlers for their mediocre performance as he tried to explain the team’s first ODI series whitewash in over three decades, saying that the visitors lacked composure all through.

The five-wicket defeat here meant that India lost the series 0-3 to an injury-plagued New Zealand that had been deflated by a 0-5 whitewash of its own in the T20 format just last week. It was India’s first whitewash in 31 years in an ODI series in which all matches have been played.

“The games were not as bad as the scoreline suggests. It boils down to those chances that we didn’t grab. I don’t think it was not enough to win games in international cricket,” Kohli said in the post-match presentation.

“With the ball, we were not able to make breakthroughs, we were not at all good on the field. We haven’t played so badly but when you don’t grab those chances, you don’t deserve to win,” he added.

“Batsmen coming back from tough situations was a positive sign for us, but the way we fielded and bowled, the composure wasn’t enough to win games,” he asserted.

The ineffectiveness of Indian bowlers can be gauged from the fact that the team’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah finished the series without a wicket and the attack couldn’t dismiss the complete rival line-up even once.

Kohli lauded New Zealand for bouncing back after the T20 hammering.

“New Zealand played with lot more intensity. We didn’t deserve to win because we did not show enough composure,” he said.

The batting mainstay is looking forward to the Test series, which begins on February 21, to make amends for the disappointment.

“I think because of the Test Championship, every match has that more importance. We have a really balanced Test team and we feel we can win the series here, but we need to step on to the park with the right kind of mindset,” he said.

His opposite number Kane Williamson, who missed the first two games due to injury, was lavish in his praise for the home team’s grit.

“An outstanding performance, very clinical. India put us under pressure, but the way the guys fought back with the ball and kept them to a par total. The cricket in the second half was outstanding to see,” he said referring to the side’s effortless chase of a 297-run target.

“We know how good they (India) are at all formats but for us the clarity about the roles the guys had was the most important thing. Outstanding effort against a brilliant India side,” he added.

Player of the Match Henry Nicholls, who scored 80 on Tuesday, said his team benefitted from good batting starts during the series.

“To come back and win 3-0 after the T20Is is nice. The way (Martin) Guptill played today allowed us to get ahead. We got a 100-run stand, but we were fortunate enough to get good starts this series,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/9mc85v/article30791594.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ViratKohli,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-odi-series-virat-kohli-on-indias-defeat/article30791595.ece
269,2020/02/11,T20 tri-series final | Indian women eye title in summit clash against Australia,"Their batting woes sorted, India will fancy their chances of claiming the women’s T20 tri-series when they face Australia in the summit clash in Melbourne on Wednesday.

After failing to fire in unison in their first three league matches, India produced a good batting show to record a seven-wicket win over Australia on Saturday, which took the Harmanpreet Kaur-led side into the final.

The two sides are on equal footing having won a match against each other in the double-legged league.

Senior opener Smriti Mandhana continued to be the batting bulwark along with Harmanpreet, but the most heartening thing was that 16-year-old Shafali Verma came good in the last game against Australia.

The home side posted 173 for five, courtesy a 57-ball 93 from Ashleigh Gardner and Meg Lanning’s 22-ball 37, but India overhauled the target in 19.4 overs, largely due to opener Shafali’s 49 off 28 balls and Mandhana’s 55 off 48 balls.

After two failures, Shafali gave India a flying start and her innings contained eight fours and a six. Her senior opening partner Mandhana, on the other hand, anchored the chase with a solid knock that comprised seven boundaries.

Jemimah Rodrigues also contributed with a quickfire 19-ball 30, which was studded with five hits to the fence, while Harmanpreet chipped in with a run-a-ball 20 to help India chase down the target.

The Indian bowlers have been doing well in this tournament with the likes Deepti Sharma and Rajeshwari Gayakwad producing consistent performances. In the penultimate league match against England, the Indian bowlers did well to not allow the opponents an easy win while defending a small total.

Australia got a boost after an easy win over England a day after losing to India. They have a strong batting line-up with opener Berth Mooney among runs and one-down Gardner in tremendous form.

Key players Lanning and Ellyse Perry have also been in good touch. The only struggling batter has been the opener Alyssa Healy.

Gardner had top-scored against India in the second league match between the two sides, while Mooney played a big part in the win against England, which took the home side to the final.

The tournament is a preparatory event for the T20 World Cup beginning in Australia on February 21.

The teams (From):

India Women: Harmanpreet Kaur (capt), Shafali Verma, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Veda Krishnamurthy, Taniya Bhatia, Deepti Sharma, Shikha Pandey, Pooja Vastrakar, Rajeshwari Gayakwad, Radha Yadav, Richa Ghosh, Arundhati Reddy, Harleen Deol, Nuzhat Parween, Poonam Yadav.

The 33-year-old won Cricket Australia’s Allan Border medal for being the player of the year on Monday, completing an emotional turnaround after the ignominy of being suspended for ball tampering in 2018. He broke down after receiving the award, which was his third overall.

He was also named the T20 player of the year.

“I think you look at Twenty20 internationals, we’ve got back-to-back World Cups as well,” Warner was quoted as saying by the ‘Australian Associated Press’.

“That’s probably a format that could be one I drop in a few years. It’s going to be very difficult to play all three forms – and good luck to all the guys that want to keep playing – it’s challenging,” he explained.

Warner averages over 40 in both the Test and ODI formats and has a strike rate of over 140 in T20s. The two T20 World Cups are to be held in Australia (this year) and India (next year).

Warner said former India opener Virender Sehwag is among the retired lot that he has spoken with, to understand the fatigue of playing all three formats.

“I speak to guys like AB de Villiers, Virender Sehwag, guys who have done that for a long time, it does become challenging. Having three young kids and my wife at home all the time, the constant travelling becomes very difficult,” he said.

Warner has three daughters with wife Candice Falzon.

The temperamental batsman has endured a tough two years following the ball-tampering scandal but has shown tremendous grit. In November, he smashed his highest Test score with an unbeaten 335.

“I batted a lot of time in the nets. Three or four days leading into the Brisbane Test, I almost batted for three hours every day,” Warner said.

271,2020/02/11,"Yashasvi Jaiswal, the 18-year-old who has lived for cricket alone","Yashasvi Jaiswal, 18, was declared the Player of the Series at the controversial finish to the ICC Under-19 World Cup in South Africa. Bangladesh carried the trophy, but Jaiswal took the individual honors by scoring 400 runs overall and 88 in the final. Though the unsporting behaviour of both sides has cast a shadow over his personal gain, his mentor, Jwala Singh says that as a teenager, Jaiswal lived for cricket alone.

He speaks about his journey from Bhadohi, 50 km from Varanasi, where as a boy, as young as eight, he’d rise before the sun and practise until it became too dark to spot the ball. His parents, Bhupendra and Kaanchan, earned just enough to feed their four children. Bhupendra sold paint and Kaanchan was a teacher in a private school. Cricket was an expensive game, and Bhadohi was known for its carpet-weaving industry, not cricket coaching. They worried about their son’s future.

Early pickings

One morning, when he was just 13, Jaiswal convinced his father to take him to Mumbai, though Allahabad would have been the logical choice. It was closer and had a history of producing reputed cricketers like Mohammad Kaif, who captained the Under-19 team that won the 2000 World Cup; and Hyder Ali, a Ranji Trophy veteren.

Given the selection challenges at the junior level in Uttar Pradesh, and the fact that Mumbai seemed to offer unbiased attention for someone starting out, Jaiswal decided to hone his skills outside his home state.

The Azad Maidan became his address as he found a ‘home’ in a tent, waking up to the sound of cork on wood. His world revolved around the Maidan, cricket, bat, and ball. In the beginning, he sold street food to make ends meet.

On a pitch where an established club cricketer struggled to put bat to ball, Jaiswal performed with ease, to the extent that his batting caught the attention of Jwala, a club cricketer himself and a self-proclaimed scout. Jwala saw a bit of himself in the young prodigy. “I had come from Gorakhpur at 13 and struggled to make ends meet in Mumbai. I did not want Yashasvi to suffer the same fate.”

When the two met, the boy was on the verge of giving up. “I want to go back,” Jaiswal would repeatedly tell his mentor, adding that he’d faced resistance from the locals who’d called him an outsider. It took a while for Jwala to convince the teenager to stick to his resolve.

Jaiswal found shelter in Jwala’s house. Jwala, who was engaged to be married, told his future wife about the boy, asking her to treat the boy like her own. He became part of the family, with Vandana taking care of nutrition.

Surviving it all

The hardships of surviving almost on the road in the city, gradually waned. Runs flowed and transformed into invitations to play in various tournaments. “Cricket became his driving force,” said Jwala, who became his godfather since Bhupendra had returned to Bhadohi, convinced that his son’s future was in safe hands.

Soon, former India captain, Dilip Vengsarkar took him under his care at Dadar Union, a cricket club. “I found him awesomely gifted. I got him to tour England (four years ago) with my academy (Dilip Vengsarkar Foundation) where he scored runs in almost every match,” he says. Vengsarkar’s friends, knowing that the boy had come from difficult financial circumstances, would give him money, to keep him in the game. “Yashasvi was a very determined player at such a young age (13) and could excel in all conditions,” says Vengsarkar. Then came the IPL windfall — a 2.4 crore contract with Rajasthan Royals and a place in the India under-19 team.

Unfortunately, Jaiswal and his teammates, earned the displeasure of fans on Sunday, when they almost came to blows with the players from Bangladesh. ""Whatever happened wasn't good. Players can get emotional because there is so much at stake,” says the India Under-19 coach Paras Mhambrey, referring to the money, media, and star treatment the young players get.

“Cricket life for these U-19 kids starts now. We are not going to a war front. Let’s all be responsible,” said veteran player Amol Muzumdar, now a cricket coach and commentator. Authorities are now planning to guide players like Jaiswal on finance management and staying focussed on the game. The Bhadohi boy, hailed as the next big player in Indian cricket, would do well with such help.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2e64mw/article30789998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Yashasvi-Jaiswal-bagged-the-Player-of-the-Series-award-the-defeat-in-the-final,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/yashasvi-jaiswal-the-18-year-old-who-has-lived-for-cricket-alone/article30789999.ece
272,2020/02/11,NZ vs IND | New Zealand inflicts first ODI series whitewash on India in 31 years,"An underwhelming India suffered their first ODI whitewash in more than three decades as New Zealand completed a 3-0 sweep with a five-wicket victory in the third match in Mount Maunganui on Tuesday.

It is the first whitewash for India in 31 years in a series in which all matches have been played. They were beaten 5-0 by the West Indies back in 1989 in an away assignments.

Henry Nicholls scored 80 (103 balls) and Martin Guptill made 66 off 46 balls as the Black Caps scored 300 for five in 47.1 overs. Colin de Grandhomme smacked 58 not out off 28 balls at the end to help seal the win with 17 balls to spare.

Earlier, India had scored 296 for seven after being put into bat, thanks to K L Rahul’s (112) fourth ODI hundred.

Chasing a sub-par 297, New Zealand got off to a flying start as Guptill and Nicholls put on 50 off just 40 balls. Overall, they added 106 for the first wicket.

Gupitll smacked six fours and four sixes as the Indian new ball bowlers suffered an onslaught. Shardul Thakur (1-87) and Navdeep Saini (0-68) struggled to find their rhythm and were taken for runs, while Jasprit Bumrah went wicket-less in the entire series.

Yuzvendra Chahal (3-47) provided the breakthrough, bowling Guptill in the 17th over. At the other end, Nicholls scored a half-century off 72 balls and anchored the innings.

He added 53 runs with Kane Williamson (22), but Chahal struck twice more and Ravindra Jadeja (1-45) removed in-form Ross Taylor (12) for cheap. New Zealand were reduced to 189for four in the 33rd over at that stage.

De Grandhomme took centre stage then and smashed a half-century off only 21 balls. His explosive knock included six fours and three sixes, as his fifth wicket partnership with Jimmy Neesham (19) came off only 31 balls.

India’s fielding was lax and failed to build pressure on the Black Caps, an apt representation of their struggles in this series.

This was after Rahul’s first hundred at number five helped anchor the Indian innings.

He hit nine fours and two sixes, and rescued India from a precarious 62 for three.

He put on 100 runs with Shreyas Iyer (62 off 63 balls) for the fourth wicket, and later on another 107 runs with Manish Pandey (42 off 48 balls) for the fifth wicket. Hamish Bennett finished with 4-64 from ten overs.

New Zealand had won the toss and opted to field. The hosts made two changes, with Kane Williamson returning from injury. Spinner Mitchell Santner came in for Tom Blundell. India made one change with Manish Pandey included ahead of Kedar Jadhav.

India made another poor start. Kyle Jamieson (1-53) bowled Mayank Agarwal (1), who has suffered a torrid tour of New Zealand thus far. The big blow came when Virat Kohli (9) was out caught at third man in the seventh over.

Prithvi Shaw provided the initial flourish with 40 off 42 balls, but he was run-out going for a suicidal second run in the 13th over.

Iyer and Rahul then anchored the Indian innings. The former batted steadily and reached his half century off 52 balls, his third 50-plus score in this series.

But Iyer couldn’t carry on, out caught off Jimmy Neesham (1-50).

It was down to Rahul then, who crossed 50 off 66 balls. His partnership with Pandey progressed well as India reached 250 in the 45th over.

Rahul’s hundred came off 104 balls, and he perished in a bid to accelerate. This is where India’s innings fell apart, as Pandey also holed out off Bennett shortly afterwards.

273,2020/02/11,ICC to use front foot no-ball technology during ICC Women’s T20 World Cup,"Front foot no-ball technology will be used in a global tournament for the first time at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in Australia later this month, the International Cricket Council said on Tuesday.

The decision to use this system was made after successful trials conducted recently in both India and the West Indies.

“The third umpire will monitor the front foot landing position after each ball and communicate to the on-field umpire if the delivery was a no ball,” the ICC said in a statement.

“The on-field umpires have been instructed not to call any front foot no balls unless advised to do so by the third umpire, although they will be responsible for calling all other types of no ball on the field.”

The technology was recently trialed across 12 games, during which 4717 balls were bowled and 13 no balls (0.28% of deliveries) were called. All deliveries were judged accurately, the ICC said.

Geoff Allardice, ICC General Manager Cricket said: “Cricket has an excellent track record of introducing technology to support the decision making of our match officials and I’m confident that this technology will reduce the small number of front foot no ball errors at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup.”

“No balls are difficult for umpires to call accurately, and even though percentage of deliveries that are no balls is low, it is important to call them correctly. Since we first trialed this concept in the ODI series between England and Pakistan in 2016 the technology has improved significantly, enabling us to introduce it cost-effectively, and with minimum impact on the flow of the game.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/icc-to-use-front-foot-no-ball-technology-during-icc-womens-t20-world-cup/article30789399.ece
274,2020/02/11,"U-19 WC final: 2 Indians, 3 Bangladeshi players charged by ICC for unsavoury incidents","Two Indians — Akash Singh and Ravi Bishnoi — and three Bangladeshi players have been charged by the ICC for their involvement in the unsavoury incidents just after the U-19 World Cup summit clash in Potchefstroom, South Africa on Sunday.

Akash and Bishnoi and three Bangladeshi players — Md. Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain and Rakibul Hasan — were found guilty of breaching ICC Code of Conduct after a few players from both sides nearly came to blows after Bangladesh beat India by three wickets to win their maiden U-19 World Cup title.

“Five players have been found guilty of a Level 3 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Support Personnel ... (they) were charged with violating Article 2.21 of the code, whilst Bishnoi received a further charge of breaching Article 2.5,” the ICC said in a statement.

“All five players have accepted the sanctions proposed by ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup Match Referee Graeme Labrooy,” it added.

Some of the Bangladeshi players got carried away with their celebration after their historic win over India in the final. While their captain Akbar Ali apologised for the “unfortunate incident”, his Indian counterpart Priyam Garg felt it is something that should not have happened.

The Bangladesh players were overtly aggressive while fielding with their lead pacer Shoriful Islam sledging the Indian batsmen after every delivery. As Bangladesh approached the winning runs, Shoriful was seen swearing multiple times openly on camera. As soon as the match ended, it became tense with Bangladeshi players rushing to the ground and most of them still displaying aggressive body language.

“India’s Akash accepted the charge of breaching Article 2.21 and has received a sanction of eight suspension points, which equates to six demerit points, which will remain on his record for two years,” the ICC said. Compatriot Bishnoi accepted the charge of breaching Article 2.21 and has received a sanction of five suspension points, which equates to five demerit points.

“Bishnoi also accepted a level 1 charge of breaching Article 2.5 for a separate incident during the match, where he used language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batter following the dismissal of Avishek Das in the 23rd over,” said the ICC. “For this he received a further two demerit points meaning seven demerit points will remain on his record for the next two years.”

Bangladesh’s Towhid Hridoy accepted the charge of breaching Article 2.21 and has received a sanction of ten suspension points, which equates to six demerit points, which will remain on his record for two years. Shamim Hossain accepted the charge of breaching Article 2.21 and has received a sanction of eight suspension points, which equates to six demerit points, which will remain on his record for two years. Rakibul Hasan accepted the charge of breaching Article 2.21 and has received a sanction of four suspension points, which equates to five demerit points, which will remain on his record for two years.

All charges were levelled by on-field umpires Sam Nogajski and Adrian Holdstock, third umpire Ravindra Wimalasiri as well as fourth umpire Patrick Bongni Jele. Level 3 breaches carry a minimum penalty of four suspension points and a maximum penalty of 12 suspension points.

The suspension points will be applied to the forthcoming international matches the players are most likely to participate in at either senior or U-19 level. One suspension point equals a player being ineligible for one ODI or T20I, U-19 or A team international match.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hryx41/article30789374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-WC-U19-IND-BAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/u-19-wc-final-2-indians-3-bangladeshi-players-charged-by-icc-for-unsavoury-incidents/article30789376.ece
275,2020/02/11,CEO orders transfer of headmaster accused of sexual harassment,"Chief Educational Officer (CEO) P. Ayyanan on Tuesday ordered the transfer of the headmaster of a panchayat union primary school near Kinathukadavu amid allegations of sexual harassment of students.

Mr. Ayyanan told The Hindu a headmistress was appointed in his place on Tuesday morning. “After inquiry, departmental action will also be initiated against him,” the CEO said.

District Educational Officer of Perur educational district R. Subbulakshmi will conduct the inquiry, according to Mr. Ayyanan.

On Monday, a group of parents staged a protest near Negamam demanding action against the headmaster, who they accused of sexually harassing nearly a dozen students in the school. However, they withdrew the protest after police held talks. No complaint was filed, police said.

Following this, members from All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) and Students' Federation of India (SFI) petitioned Superintendent of Police Sujit Kumar demanding action against the headmaster under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and an inquiry into this incident.

A source in the Department of School Education privy to the development told The Hindu that the parents are allegedly reluctant to submit a written complaint to the police or education officials. “On what basis can we take action if there is no written complaint,” the source said. If the parents approach education officials with a written complaint, action will be taken, according to the source.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ceo-orders-transfer-of-headmaster-accused-of-sexual-harassment/article30795426.ece
276,2020/02/11,Forest officials arrest man for possessing crocodile meat,"The Forest Department on Tuesday arrested a man on charges of catching a crocodile hatchling and skinning it in Periyur in the Sirumugai Forest Range.

E.N. Manoharan, Sirumugai Forest Range Officer (FRO), said the accused was identified as R. Rajan aka Palanisamy (50). A second accused, identified as K. Mariappan (60), fled the spot.

Based on specific information, a team comprising forest guards and anti-poaching watchers nabbed the accused while he was skinning the crocodile, Mr. Mwanoharan said. The hatchling was less than 10 months old and two feet long, he noted.

On interrogation, the accused told the officials that the crocodile hatchling got caught in the fishing net in the Bhavani and they killed it with the intention of cooking the meat, the Sirumugai FRO said. The accused was remanded in judicial custody and efforts are on to nab the second accused.

'Patrol to intensify'

Mr. Manoharan said the Forest Department would intensify patrolling along the Bhavani. The Forest Department will request the Fisheries Department to issue guidelines to the fisherfolk regarding catching of animals other than fish, he said.

“Crocodile meat does not have any medicinal value,” Mr. Manoharan said, adding that the accused was attempting to consume the meat because of the widely prevailing superstition.

277,2020/02/11,Census on problematic Indian gaur-human interaction under way,"For the first time, the Forest Department will study parameters related to problematic human-gaur interactions in the forest ranges surrounding the district’s major towns as part of an annual wildlife census exercise.

The census, which started on Tuesday, will be conducted for five days in all the 11 forest ranges, officials said.

K.Saravanakumar, Assistant Conservator of Forests, Nilgiris division, said movement of wildlife in the forest ranges would be recorded meticulouslyover the first four days. “On the fifth day, in the ranges and beats surrounding major towns, information about the number of Indian gaur, their movement patterns, the habitats they use, as well as any potential injuries they are carrying will be recorded,” he explained.

The initiative is part of an effort to understand and mitigate the causes for problematic human-gaur interactions in the Nilgiris division, which led to the deaths of three persons and injuries to seven others in different incidents in the division last year.

Officials said that more than 60 volunteers would be taking part in the census. Training was given to them on Monday. The volunteers, accompanied by forest staff, will take part in the census across 11 ranges and more than 60 beats.

On the fifth day of the exercise, the population of the State animal, the endangered Nilgiri tahr, spilling over from its predominant range in the Mukurthi National Park to the Nilgiris division will also be studied.

Officials said the animal is seen in six beats in the division, and its numbers seem to be increasing.

278,2020/02/11,Unscheduled power shutdown irks consumers in Coimbatore,"On several days, if the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation had announced shutdown from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.,, power supply is restored one or two hours later. In Seeranaikenpalayam area, though the announced timing for shutdown was from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. last month, the supply was cut at 8 a.m. In one locality in Ukkadam area, power supply was disrupted for nearly two hours in the morning the day immediately after shutdown last month.

Such instances affect the public and industries in the area as they are unable to plan their work, say the residents and industry operators.

Coimbatore Consumer Cause secretary K. Kathirmathiyon said though the power cut was from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. in areas fed by Seeranaikenpalayam sub-station last month, there was no supply from 8 a.m. to much beyond 5 p.m. “This had resulted in a lot of inconvenience to the people who had planned their work accordingly. More particularly, in the morning hours. Tangedco should be a little more sensitive on such issues. It should not take consumers for a ride,” he said.

J. James, president of Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, said when shutdown was announced for an area, the residents planned to finish all the electricity-involved works before 9 a.m. If the supply was not available from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m., the entire planning was rendered futile.

Industries might have an urgent order to complete and they would not be able to do so. On several days, the supply was restored one or two hours later and this too hits industries because the units remained idle for almost the entire day.

A Tangedco official said all the field-level officials had been instructed to finish the maintenance works within the announced timings. When a sub-station is shut down, maintenance works were taken up on the field and at the sub-station. There could be delays and these led to the shutdown getting extended for an hour or so. “We have given necessary instructions so that the public are not affected,” the official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/unscheduled-power-shutdown-irks-consumers-in-coimbatore/article30795412.ece
279,2020/02/11,Industries concerned over stoppage due to accidents,"When a worker dies in an accident at an industrial unit in the State, the entire plant is stopped till the unit takes the required safety measures and this is affecting industrial operations, sources here say.

Until recently, if a fatal accident occurred, only a particular part of operation at the factory will be stopped. For the last two months, the entire unit is served a stoppage notice, the sources say. The unit can resume operation by taking legal recourse and after taking the required safety steps.

Negligence

A source in textile mills said several units across the manufacturing sector in the State were affected by this recent move. Not all accidents are machinery-related. Some happen due to negligence among workers too. For instance, if a worker is cleaning a roof and falls down by accident or dies because of electrocution, the entire unit comes to a standstill now. If only a portion is stopped, that work can be outsourced temporarily.

But, if the entire plant is stopped, production is affected, especially in continuous process sectors.

This norm in implemented only since December and it is an issue facing the industries, the source said.

Another source in the foundry sector here said one of the foundries here had to be closed down because of a fatal accident and was opened after getting relief from the court. Since the court order came early, it did not affect the foundry much.

A source in the Directorate of Industrial Safety and Health here said that if there is a fatal accident, the stoppage order is usually given to a particular operation of the plant.

Stringent measures

However, the norms allow the Government to take stringent measures too. The local officials refer the accident to the Government and the decision is taken by the senior officials, the source said.

According to a source, there are legal provisions to close down the unit in case of a fatal accident.

There are also provisions where the Department issues show cause notice to an industry if there is a fatal accident and take action only at the portion where the accident occurred.

Only the machine/section where the accident occurred is closed, depending on the recommendation of the inspector, as workers in departments not related to the one where the accident happened can go jobless and even without wages if the entire plant is closed.

Multi-pronged approach

What is needed is a multi-pronged approach to tackle this problem. There should be trainings, audits, focus on maintenance, and steps to ensure protective gear are provided so that accidents are minimised, the source added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/industries-concerned-over-stoppage-due-to-accidents/article30795406.ece

282,2020/02/11,Foresters undergo training in operation of drones at STR,"A four-day training programme for forest personnel in operation of drones for monitoring wild animals, water bodies, forest fire and movement of people inside the forest began at the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) here on Monday.

As many as 20 personnel from the Sathyamangalam Forest Division were trained by Krishna Kumar from the Wildlife Institute of India at the forest area. They were explained on the functioning of drone, its capacity to capture images, operation method and technical aspects.

Officials said that with summer expected to set in soon, wild animals keep moving in search of water and sometimes stray into human habitations.

Drones can be used to monitor availability of water, movement of animals and humans inside the forest area and encroachment of forest land. They said that continuous monitoring would prevent human-animal conflicts and help in tackling water shortage inside forests during summer. Trespassing by tourists lead to conflicts in forest areas and drones would help in surveillance, they added.

After the conclusion of the training at Sathyamangalam, forest personnel in Hasanur Forest Division will undergo the same training.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/vllstx/article30795352.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER12DRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/foresters-undergo-training-in-operation-of-drones-at-str/article30795353.ece

286,2020/02/11,Wholesale price of tomato drops to ₹ 6 a kg,"Following heavy arrival of tomato from Talavadi to the Nethaji Wholesale Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market here, the price of the vegetable dropped to ₹ 6 a kg on Tuesday.

The wholesale market at Panneerselvam Park gets vegetables, fruits and flowers from various States and is purchased in bulk quantities by shopkeepers, hoteliers, educational institutions and consumers every day.

Tomatoes arrive from Talavadi and Andhra Pradesh and a box weighing 15 kg is sold for ₹ 100.

Since tomatoes do not have a shelf-life without refrigeration, only a limited quantity can be stored in the godown.

Mani Anand, a wholesaler, said that a box of fine quality tomato is sold for ₹ 100 to ₹ 120, while it is sold for ₹ 10 to ₹ 13 a kg in retail. “Arrival from Talavadi is very high in the last two days leading to drop in price,” he added. On an average, 6,000 to 7,500 boxes arrived in the market in the last two days, which may increase in the coming days leading to further drop in price, he said.

The 90-day crop is cultivated during the months of November - December and harvesting began in Talavadi recently. “The demand is low as there are no marriages or festivals,” said P.P.K. Palanisamy, president, Nethaji Wholesale Daily Vegetable and Fruit Market Association. He said that since harvesting season would continue for the next one and a half months, price of tomatoes would go up by the end of April. “During summer, arrival of tomatoes from Talavadi will stop and the price of a box might reach ₹ 700 or more,” he said.

Water was released last month from Bhavani Sagar reservoir into Lower Bhavani Project (LBP) main canal and sub-canal to benefit 1,03,500 acres. The government order had said that water should be released for 10 days and then stopped for 10 days and the cycle should be followed till April 30.

But farmers who get water through sub-canals said that water was released for less than 10 days and the quantum of water was also less in each cycle. They said that water has not reached many tail-end farmers and they were unable to take up cultivation. They said that farmers in the region were not consulted on reducing the quantum of water release and officials had taken the decision on their own. Farmers in U5, U6 and U7 pasana sabai areas need adequate water to carry out farming and hence urged the PWD to release water as announced by the government.

288,2020/02/11,"Coimbatore goldsmiths get registered, certified","As many as 2,000 traditional goldsmiths, who were so far in the unorganised sector in Coimbatore, have become registered goldsmiths.

“Coimbatore has nearly 50,000 goldsmiths whose family vocation is gold jewellery making. Till the late 1980s, they had a licence issued by the Central Government. When those licences expired, the goldsmiths came under the unorganised sector,” explained S.M. Kamalhasan, Managing Director of Coimatore Goldsmith Jewellery Private Limited.

Now, the Central and State governments are conducting one-day programmes, registering, and issuing certificates to the goldsmiths. The programme in Coimbatore was conducted by the Goldsmith Academy and the Gem and Jewellery Skill Council of India issued the certificate, he said.

The programme is conducted in batches, with each batch having 250 participants. The Academy asks several questions to the participants and when they provide these details, which go into an online database, they get a certificate that they have cleared the assessment for the job role of goldsmith. The certificate mentions the participant’s Aadhaar details. Of the 2,000 participants so far, nearly 300 are women.

Mr. Kamalhasan said the goldsmiths are willing to take part in the programme as the certificate bring several benefits. “There is a recognition given to the goldsmith. Every day goldsmiths make and move jewellery to the traders. If they are caught by the police or any other official, there is a government document to say that the person is a registered goldsmith,” he said.

Further, if a goldsmith goes to a bank for loan, the banker will know that he is a goldsmith and it is easier to get a loan. “There is safety for the products that we make as well,” he added.

The Coimbatore Goldsmith Jewellery Private Limited, which is a special purpose vehicle to implement a cluster project for the sector, will help more goldsmiths get the certificate, said Mr. Kamalhasan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/76230q/article30791315.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11FEBTH--GOLDSMITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-goldsmiths-get-registered-certified/article30791316.ece

292,2020/02/11,Tribal people removed for attempting to take out march for forest rights,"As many as 185 tribal persons, including 94 women and children, were detained and removed by the police on Monday for attempting to take out a 120-km march from Valparai town to Coimbatore Collectorate to press their demand for inherent rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

Those who took part in the march were members of six tribal communities living in the limits of Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR).

The police stopped the march soon after it was started from the Gandhi statue in Valparai town. Those detained were released in the afternoon. The members of Kadar, Malasar, Malaimalasar, Muduvar, Pulayar and Eravalar communities had taken out the march under the leadership of tribal welfare activists.

“Though they have been residing in the limits of ATR for years as indigenous tribes, the Government was yet to accord them various rights ensured under the Forest Rights Act, such as individual rights to homestead and agricultural land, and community rights to collect forest produces other than timber. The aim of the long march was to draw the attention of authorities who are yet to realise inherent rights of these communities,” said tribal rights activist S. Thanaraj, who is also the State Co-ordinator of Ekta Parishad, Tamil Nadu.

Though police had denied permission for the march, people from the six tribal communities, activists, and supporters had assembled at Valparai town on Monday morning. They waited at the place as leaders were informed that the Sub-Collector and District Forest Officer of Pollachi forest division would come to Valparai and talk to them.

As the officials did not come, they started the march after garlanding Gandhi statue. However, the police led by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Valparai, stopped them around 30 metres from the statue.

“We cooperated with the police as we planned a non-violent way of protest based on Gandhian principles,” said Mr. Thanaraj.

One of the main reasons that triggered the long march was the eviction of 23 families of Kallar Kadar settlement from ATR in August last year. They were shifted to an unused and dilapidated quarters of a tea estate at Thaimudi near Valparai on August 20 and forced to live there in the unfamiliar environment outside forest since then.

With the march stopped and participants detained, several shops and establishments in Valparai town remained shut on Monday.

As per old Forest Department records, nearly 6,000 people belonging to the six communities were living in 35 settlements in the limits of ATR.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/9wxxdw/article30786378.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB11TRIBAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tribal-people-removed-for-attempting-to-take-out-march-for-forest-rights/article30786379.ece

Earlier this month, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had announced that the committee would submit its report within six weeks. However, it is learnt that at least one of the two members has refused to take up the responsibility and has asked the State to look for a replacement.

The committee formation is also delayed after the additional chief secretary (Home) requested an opinion from the Director General of Police (DGP), Maharashtra Police, on the modalities of the panel, which consists of additional chief secretary (Home) Shrikant Singh and Joint Commissioner (Intelligence) Amitesh Kumar, officials said.

While announcing the committee, the Home Minister had said that he was in possession of “many complaints from political parties and leaders” about the misuse of phone tapping powers by the previous government. “This abuse of power violates the right to freedom and privacy as enshrined in the Constitution and is a national security threat,” he had said.

The proposal to set up the committee has not even been moved to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, and is stuck at the level of the Home Department, which has now reached out to the DGP, sources said. “There is immense pressure on the government from within the system to stall the setting up of the committee. If nine days have lapsed, it leaves very little time for the officials to complete a probe with such a vast scope. What is stopping the government from issuing merely a formal order on it?” asked a source.

Additional chief secretary (Home) Sanjay Kumar told The Hindu it is a procedural requirement to ask the DGP for an opinion, and once that is received, the file will be moved to the CM for his approval. “There is no question of a delay and we are waiting for the CM’s approval.” he said.

Mr. Deshmukh had said that phones of a number of senior opposition leaders’ were allegedly tapped in the run-up to the Assembly polls. The list included BJP leaders such as Ekanth Khadse, he had said.

“The official go-ahead for the probe has yet not been given. The prospect of probe as well as the possibility of linking it to the State bureaucrats’ visit to Israel has unsettled many. The CM is under pressure to not conduct the probe or to limit its scope.

“Our thali will have wholesome and nutritious food for the poor. While this is not a tit for tat against the Sena’s thali, the idea is to serve the poor who are not included in the State’s welfare schemes or are left out,” a BJP leader said.

While the menu for the BJP thali has not been finalised, the Sena’s meal offers two chapatis, a 100 gm portion of vegetables, 150 gm rice, and 100 gm dessert, during lunch hours. The State is expected to provide a subsidy of ₹40 per plate in urban centres and ₹25 per plate in rural areas.

301,2020/02/11,Hundreds march to Jantar Mantar against citizenship law,"Hundreds of protesters, including students and civil society members, poured onto the streets in central Delhi on Monday to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The protesters, carrying placards and banners, converged at Mandi House around 11 a.m. and started marching towards Jantar Mantar and reached the site around noon via Barakhamba Road and Tolstoy Road.

Walking side by side

A large number of police and paramilitary personnel walked along with them.

The protest call was given by the Welfare Party of India.

“The protesters do not have permission to take out a march, but as long as they maintain peace, we do not have a problem,” a police officer said. The protesters, however, claimed that they had the permission and would march till Jantar Mantar.

Children as young as 10, senior citizens, civil society members and university students took part in the rally.

Mohammad Shareef, who came from Kanpur, said his son Mohammad Rais (30) was shot dead by the police while returning home after offering namaz. “On December 20, Rais was returning home after offering namaz. He used to sell ‘papad’ and also worked in a marriage hall. There was a commotion that day and Rais started running when the police shot him.”

“The people from the locality took him to my house and I rushed him to a hospital. Not a single person has visited my house to ask how we are. The police misbehaved with us,” he added.

The protesters carried the photographs of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad and social reformer Savitribai Phule, and demanded that the government revoke the “black law”.

The mother of another victim, Aftab Alam, said her son did not participate in any protest. “After the death of his father, my son used to work as a mason. He was shot dead by the police when he had gone to offer namaz in Kanpur. The incident took place at Babu Purwa and the bullet had hit the left side of his chest,” she said.

The wife of Kafeel Khan, who was in September acquitted of all negligence and corruption charges in the Gorakhpur BRD Hospital tragedy, and the brother of Sharjeel Imam, arrested on sedition charges, also participated in the march.

Siraj Talib, the national secretary of the Welfare Party of India, said: “We are protesting against the CAA and the NRC. We have permission. I have spoken to the police and we are marching towards Jantar Mantar.”

Riyasat Malik (20), who works in a private organisation, said that he, along with around 80 women, arrived from Sunder Nagri to support the anti-CAA protest.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/88q9el/article30787350.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE11JANTARMANTAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hundreds-march-to-jantar-mantar-against-citizenship-law/article30787351.ece
302,2020/02/11,"Police, protesters clash during march against CAA","Hundreds of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) students and residents of nearby areas were on Monday stopped by the police from taking out a march to Parliament against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), leading to a seven-hour stand off during which scuffles broke out between protesters and security personnel.

The protesters began their march, called by the Jamia Coordination Committee, at noon from the university’s Gate No. 7, which has seen anti-CAA demonstrations since the last two months. The Delhi Police has maintained that the organisers had not been granted permission to carry out the rally.

When the protesters were stopped near Holy Family Hospital, they started climbing over the police barricades. The were, however, swiftly dragged down by the security personnel.

During the seven-hour standoff, protesters kept shouting slogans as security personnel in riot gear tried to contain the situation.

Some protesters held up banners reading: “Where is Komal?”. A reference to the January 5 incident that took place at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) where a masked mob attacked students and faculty members. One of the suspects is named Komal.

The protesters stood their ground despite repeated appeals from authorities, including the JMI Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmad Khan. “The message has been sent. Your protest has been registered. I appeal to the students in the crowd to go back to the university. Respect the law and go back,” Mr. Khan said.

Delhi Police officials, perched on barricades themselves, also appealed to the protesters to return to Gate No. 7, which has been the epicentre of anti-CAA protests in the area.

Towards late afternoon, the situation turned confrontational as security personnel tried to push the protesters back, while resorting to crowd-control measures. During the scuffle, many protesters fell unconscious.

Khurshid, a middle-aged protester who was one of the people that had to be dragged out of the crowd, said: “The police tried to hit me on my legs with lathis. We will continue protesting as we will not show our documents even if we have them. We are not ready to go anywhere.”

Shivangi Bhasin, another protester, said: “I was on my way to Shaheen Bagh but came here after receiving an SOS message. It is really surprising that the police are asking protesters to be peaceful while they are the ones being brutal. It is important for us to be present here in solidarity.”

Devesh Srivastava, Joint CP (Southern Range), said: “Total nine students, including two girls, were detained and released after an hour. It all ended peacefully.”

He added that the police has not used any force on protesters and were “only pushed back” by security forces and prevented from climbing on barricades.

303,2020/02/11,CBI arrests ex-Noida Chief Engineer,"The CBI on Monday arrested former New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) Chief Engineer Yadav Singh for allegedly awarding contracts worth over ₹116 crore to five private companies in lieu of bribes.

The arrest comes after Mr. Singh was recently granted bail in two other cases of alleged corruption. The third case was registered in January 2018.

Among those named in the FIR were Mr. Singh; Javed Ahmed of Gul Engineers; Sai Raju, Manish Kumar and Prem Pradeep of SMP Technology; Kumar Saurav and Prem Pradeep of Abu Infracon; Sanjay Kumar Gupta of Sanjay Electricals and Sanjay Kumar Sharma of Shakambari Projects.

Unknown officials of the Noida Authority and others were also under the scanner for their role in the conspiracy.

The FIR was registered following a preliminary inquiry which revealed that Mr. Singh had allegedly extended undue favours to the companies of his associates and family members by awarding contracts in violation of the tender norms.

Gul Engineers was given 31 contracts of electrical works for ₹37.99 crore during 2007-12. While two contracts were covered in an earlier case, the rest became the subject matter of the 2018 FIR.

The company allegedly did not meet the eligibility criteria in terms of work experience. It was also found involved in cartelisation of bidders, said the FIR. The awarding of contracts had led to a loss of about ₹2.20 crore.

The CBI alleged that the company’s proprietor had bribed Mr. Singh and had also given a vehicle as quid pro quo.

The SMP Technology was given five contracts worth ₹2.19 crore for computerisation of water billing in Noida. The company directors were classmates of Mr. Singh’s son Sunny in an engineering college in Himachal Pradesh.

It is alleged that the SMP Technology had hired the premises of one Kusum Garments, of Mr. Singh’s wife Kusum Lata and son Sunny at an “exorbitant rate” of ₹4.50 lakh per month. A vehicle registered in the company’s name was found at Mr. Singh’s residence.

The Abu Infracon was allotted 16 projects for various works during 2011-14.

The agency came across several suspicious transactions between K.S. Ultratech, another company in the name of Ms. Lata and Sunny, SMP Technology and Abu Infracon.

According to the FIR, Sanjay Electricals was awarded 37 projects worth ₹76 crore from 2007 to 2012, while Shakambari Projects was given one work in 2014.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cbi-arrests-ex-noida-chief-engineer/article30787295.ece

306,2020/02/11,Uzbekistan craftsmen impress all at Surajkund fair,"Uzbekistan has participated in the ongoing 34th edition of the Surajkund International Crafts Mela here as the ‘partner nation’ in a big way. A number of artisans, craftspersons and performers have come to this mega event from this country and presented a bouquet of their art and craft.

Uzbekistan has a unique position in the world of handicrafts, as the Uzbeks themselves say that their crafts are the soul of their identity and culture. Artistic crafts occupy a special place in Uzbekistan’s cultural heritage. After meeting a few craftspersons one gets a feeling as to how these artisans have passed down the age old secrets of their art through generations. From wood work to decorative items, the ethnic patterns have been carefully preserved by these masters of art.

The artisans have brought ceramics which can easily be considered one of the best applied arts from this central Asian country.

The Oriental and Persian styled designs and bright turquoise colours reflect an infinite beauty which these ceramic decorations hold. The often used blue and white colour represent sky and water and are believed to bring happiness and prosperity.

What’s on display?

Nigmatov Mirsaid from Uzbekistan is displaying his intricately designed wood work in the form of pencil boxes that secretly turn into a vanity box with its hidden features. Many other wood crafted items are painted with scenes of everyday life, quotes from famous poets and Islamic inscriptions often appear in their art work. Their cheerful colours, fine lines and delicate forms are highly impressive.

Clay toys depict life of the countryside in Uzbekistan and often illustrate the simplicity and happiness. Each region in Uzbeskistan produces its own range of toys with original motifs.

Carpet making is an age-old craft in Uzbekistan and many craftspersons have brought these masterpieces for the tourists at the Surajkund Mela. The high level of weaving technique, fabulous natural dyes and ethnic patterns make these Uzbekistan carpets very popular among visitors at the mela.

Seller’s pride

The ancient traditions of Uzbek weavers are embodied in carpets, each of which is a real piece of art. A pride for its seller who claims that once bought, it will prove to be an indispensable piece of art for any home décor.

Akbarov Zafar specialises in fabric handicraft and is offering a number of hand woven fabrics and dress materials from his native land. The fashion show — ‘Ferghana Fantasy’ — directed by Ritu Beri showcased dresses made out of the same fabric that Akbarov is displaying in the mela.

One of the most intriguing displays at the stalls is the ‘Shakhmat’ or the chess board. A wooden handicraft, where each piece on the board is a tiny figurine depicting various titles of a typical chess game.

Handmade jewellery has always been important part of this country’s culture and reflects the lifestyle of the Uzbek people. Traditional jewellery include head wear “Tilla Kosh”, chest jewellery and earrings of a leaf type and many others.

The souvenirs and decorative items here come in the form of plates, wall hangings, paintings, caps, chess boards, book stands and much more.

311,2020/02/11,Teachers write to police over inaction in JNU violence case,"The Jawaharlal Nehru University Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) on Monday wrote to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik over inaction regarding the January 5 incident where students and teachers of the university were attacked by a masked mob.

Democratic rights

Stating that apart from the initial press conference held by the police, there was no further information on the investigation, the JNUTA wrote: “It appears to be a part of a larger pattern where the police is more proactive in restraining the exercise of democratic rights by citizens in the name of maintaining law and order than it is in protecting these rights from being threatened by lawless mobs. The targeting of teachers is significant because it seriously calls into question the legitimacy of the attempts by the JNU administration to link the mob violence to incidents that took place earlier.”

The JNUTA reiterated that on January 5, several teachers were assaulted and attacked by the mob.

“All of these have been brought to the knowledge of the police in the form of several complaints by teachers,” the letter read.

Stating that a “mood of insecurity continues to prevail at JNU,”it said: “It is up to the Delhi Police to allay these suspicions of JNU’s teachers by taking swift action on the complaints lodged with them, convert them into FIRs and bringing the perpetrators of the mob violence and those who assisted them, to book.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/52j98d/article30524844.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jnu-violence,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/teachers-write-to-police-over-inaction-in-jnu-violence-case/article30786995.ece

313,2020/02/11,"Gargi College harassers were ‘outsiders’, HRD Minister tells LS","The culprits in the alleged sexual harassment of students at Gargi College were “outsiders”, Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Nishank Pokhriyal told the Lok Sabha on Monday. He said the college administration has been told to take action.

All India Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev pulled up Mr. Pokhriyal for “inaction” with regard to violence in educational institutions, noting that it was not enough to say that outsiders were involved as the ones behind the attacks are those with right-wing ideology.

‘Painful episode’

Mr. Pokhriyal made his statement on the incident in response to a supplementary question from Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi during the Lok Sabha Question Hour. Mr. Gogoi noted that one of the reasons for high-levels of stress in educational institutions is cases of sexual harassment and bullying, and referred specifically to the “painful episode” of men entering a women’s college festival and harassing them.

“What instructions the Ministry has given to institutions of higher education with respect to monitoring, supervision and resolution of sexual harassment and bullying cases? What steps will the Ministry take so that the girls of Gargi College feel safe and reassured?” asked Mr. Gogoi.

The Minister responded, saying that the alleged harassment was being investigated. “The incident has been carried out by outsiders, not students. But it is not a good thing. The college administration has been asked to take note of it and instructions have been given to take action against the culprits,” he said. In a letter addressed to the Minister, Ms. Dev said the HRD Ministry has only responded with silence or mere lip service. “It is not enough to say attackers came from outside. Evidence has also come to light that the people responsible for this attack are from a particular ideology which points to a right-wing mindset but no action has been forthcoming to prevent these incidents or take action against the administration or the authorities, which not only disheartens us but also casts serious aspersions on the independence of the functioning of your Ministry,” she wrote.

She noted that the college administration had blamed the victims for being unable to ensure their own safety, while the police and security watched as goons barged into the college and molested the students. Ms. Dev also pointed to the recent attacks against students and teachers of the Jawaharlal Nehru University as another instance of police and government inaction although there is “insurmountable evidence” showing who is to blame.

The All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), a Left-affiliated group, also criticised the attitude of authorities to the harassment at Gargi College, allegedly by “a group of pro CAA protesters...who were drunk and shouted Jai Shri Ram slogans.”

“AIDWA is appalled to learn that the college authorities to no notice of the complaints of the girls. AIDWA demands that the police takes cognisance of the incident and immediately bring the culprits to book. It also demands that the university look into the insensitive and irresponsible behaviour of the Gargi college authorities,” it added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/nzvglg/article30786986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ramesh-Nishank-Pokhriyalcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gargi-college-harassers-were-outsiders-hrd-minister-tells-ls/article30786987.ece

315,2020/02/11,Skywalk at Uppal junction on pilot basis,"Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) is all set to take up construction of a skywalk at Uppal junction on pilot basis.

The design is ready and administrative sanctions are awaited after submission of the proposal to government, officials informed.

As per the design, the skywalk will be of 800 to 900 metres’ running length, with oval-shaped circulation of passenger traffic from under the already existing Metro Rail structure. The construction is estimated to cost about ₹40 crore, HMDA officials informed.

Apart from 52 foot over-bridges, a total of eight skywalks have been planned by the State government near major junctions of the city to facilitate pedestrian crossings and reduce accidents. The structures will be built circumnavigating around the junction, with elevators and escalators.

The Uppal junction and Mehdipatnam junction have been chosen for construction of the skywalks on pilot basis, based on the pedestrian turnout and accident numbers. However, the design for the Mehdipatnam skywalk — where it was planned from the Mehdipatnam Rythu Bazaar towards the military area from underneath the express highway — ran into trouble owing to the PVNR Expressway, an official informed.

“It needs two-metre vertical clearance from the express highway above, and if we take the clearance, the ground clearance will be too less, which could hinder vehicular traffic below,” the official informed.

An alternative is being explored through widening of the median, and provision of ramps, but it could reduce the road space available for vehicles by a lane, he said. “We need concurrence from the Traffic Police for the alternative design, and wish to conduct a meeting with them over this proposal,” the official said.

Skywalks have been mooted also at other prominent locations such as Koti Women’s College, Secunderabad Railway Station, Khairatabad Junction, Madina Junction, and Dilsukhnagar, but they have not yet been finalised, officials informed.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/skywalk-at-uppal-junction-on-pilot-basis/article30795394.ece
316,2020/02/11,Metro rail gets closer to 5-lakh ridership mark,"Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) authorities have been running four trains between the newly-opened Corridor Two — Jubilee Bus Station (JBS) to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS) from 6.30 a.m. to 11.30 p.m. for the past three days and the daily passenger count has been about 34,000 as observed on Monday.

With this, the daily ridership across the three corridors, including Corridor One (Red Line) L.B.Nagar-Miyapur and Corridor Two (Blue Line) Nagole-Raidurg along with the Green Line has touched 4.75 lakh, according to HMR managing director N.V.S. Reddy on Tuesday.

In the lead

Ameerpet interchange station between Corridor One and Corridor Three continues to be in the top spot with 26,000 passenger count daily followed by L.B. Nagar at 24,000; Raidurg at 22,000; Miyapur at 19,000; KPHB at 17,000 and Secunderabad East at 15,000.

Green Corridor’s JBS-Parade Grounds saw 14,894 passengers, followed by MGBS (8,330), RTC Crossroads (2,015), Narayanagaguda (1,781), Chikkadpally (1,628), Gandhi Hospital (1,418), Secunderabad West (1,396), Musheerabad (1,287) and Sultan Bazar (1,144).

After Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao launched the final metro rail stretch of 11 km last Friday, passengers have been making use of the facility from Saturday to reach either of the two main bus stations or as a connecting service to hop onto metro trains towards Raidurg-HiTec City from JBS-Parade Grounds joint stations or the interchange station of MGBS to reach L.B. Nagar and Miyapur.

“It’s still too early for us to estimate the passenger patronage but considering the dense residential and commercial areas the line covers on a straight line, we expect the numbers to pick up in a month or so,” he said. Nine three-set trains have been exclusively earmarked for Corridor Two of the total 57 train sets of three coaches each with carrying capacity of about 900 passengers.

The remaining trains are to be pressed into service once the passenger count rises and the frequency goes up from the current nine minutes a train to four-six minutes as it happens in other sections during the peak hours especially, senior officials said.

Street-level infra

For now, metro rail authorities are using platform no.1 of JBS station for both entry and exit with the train moving from the same platform in both directions.

318,2020/02/11,Shifting Spices Board regional office opposed,"The Warangal Chamber of Commerce and Industry office-bearers and the local traders have opposed the reported decision to shift Spices Board regional office located in Warangal to Nizamabad.

The traders and businessmen in Warangal are feeling that shifting the regional office to Nizamabad would harm the interests of the farming community in the region. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Diddi Kumara Swamy and General Secretary Thota Narsimha Rao said shifting the regional office to Nizamabad was inappropriate.

They noted that the news of shifting Spices Board regional office has caused quite a disquiet in the past adding, “The then Union Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar assured that the office would not be shifted”. Telangana State produces nearly 58 % of the total chilli in the country. In view of this the Spices Board Regional Office was shifted to Warangal from Hyderabad in the year 2009 to help the local chilli farmers, they pointed out.

The Regional Office helps chilli farmers in getting subsidies and marketing links. Hence the proposal to shift the office has to be withdrawn, they said, adding that they would call on Union Minister for Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal to urge him not to shift office from Warangal.

Further, Kumara Swamy and Narsimha Rao pointed out that the local farmers have been facing problems due to lack of a laboratory in the region. The farmers had to get lab reports of chilli and turmeric samples from the Spice Board in Guntur.

“The government has to set up a lab in Warangal to help the farmers,” they demanded. Chamber of Commerce members Sadula Damodar, Sriram Ravi, Kotha Kishore Kumar and Telangana Cotton Association President B Ravinder Reddy were among others present.

Meanwhile, president of the Abhyudaya Seva Samithi Mandala Parashuramulu in a letter to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry appealed to drop the idea of shifting the office as it would cause huge loss to chilli farmers in Warangal.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/shifting-spices-board-regional-office-opposed/article30795349.ece

Mr. Reddy met the Minister in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum saying the Telangana government was planning to establish Pharma City in 3,000 acres in the name of employment, but that would contaminate water, land and air in the area.

The government is trying to increase the Pharma City to 19,333 acres. The land being acquired is essentially fertile land and it would not only destroy land meant for agriculture but also thousands of acres in and around the place due to pollution. Mr. Reddy alleged that land acquisition for the project was nothing but a land scam as the farmers are being paid a paltry sum of ₹8 lakh per acre while it is being sold to companies at ₹1.50 crore per acre. There is a real estate mafia behind the project, he alleged and demanded that all the permissions be withdrawn immediately.

Union Coal Secretary Anil Kumar Jain, addressing the conclave, focussed on how energy efficiency now was well adopted in India’s energy strategy. Energy efficiency remained an important aspect even in the backdrop of growing emphasis of India on harnessing renewable energy.

The senior official also underscored the need for more information sharing with regard to energy efficiency initiatives in the industrial sphere. While data was available on the opportunities available and the work undertaken in other segments on the energy efficiency front, there was little data available in the public domain with regard to the work in the industrial space.

321,2020/02/11,Gandhi doctor threatens self-immolation,"A doctor threatened to end life by self-immolation at the Gandhi Hospital on Tuesday afternoon. Civil Assistant Surgeon (CAS) Dr G Vasant Kumar stuffed bottles filled with petrol inside his shirt and threatened to end life. Police and Fire Safety department personnel rescued him before he resorted to the rash act.

The CAS, who is employed under Director of Public Health (Telangana), was posted as a Casualty Medical Officer (CMO) at the hospital. On Saturday, he was surrendered (sent back) to DPH due to alleged misconduct. Dr Kumar alleged that action was taken against him for raising queries on irregularities at Gandhi Hospital.

There are several units under Telangana Health department, including DPH and Director of Medical Education (DME). Gandhi Hospital comes under DME’s jurisdiction. Dr Kumar has been working as CMO at the hospital for close to five years.

Dr K Ramesh Reddy, DME, said the hospital superintendent surrendered Dr Kumar to DPH as he barged into the superintendent’s chamber during a meeting on Novel Coronavirus on February 7, used harsh words against Resident Medical Officer (RMO)-1 and others. The RMO-1 and others lodged a complaint with the superintendent on the issue.

On Tuesday, Dr Kumar stuffed bottles filled with petrol inside his shirt and stood outside the main building of Gandhi Hospital with a lighter in hand. Dr Kumar alleged that there were no emergency medicines and the hospital was not maintaining proper sanitation.

“Action has been taken against me since I raised questions about these issues. The scam in sanitation and security is larger than the ESI scam (related to purchase of medicines),” Dr Kumar alleged. He pulled out a bunch of papers and said that some house surgeons were absconding during duty hours.

When media and police engaged him in talks, Chilkaguda Inspector AC Balagangi Reddy pounced on him and pinned him down. Other police personnel swiftly removed the petrol bottles stuffed inside his shirt. Telangana State Disaster Response and Fire Services department personnel sprayed foam as a precautionary measures. Dr Kumar was taken away from the spot and counselled.

The DME said that they will conduct an inquiry into allegations of corruptions levelled by Dr Kumar. He also said that there allegations of corruption against Dr Kumar also.

“He collected money from medical shops and other establishments. We warned him to mend his ways when it came to our notice,” Dr Reddy said.

The DME asked why Dr Kumar did not lodge a complaint regarding the alleged corruption at the hospital with the superintendent, DME or any other higher officials. “Why did he keep all documents with him?,” Dr Reddy asked .

The DME said that they have written to the government and DPH to conduct an inquiry into allegations of corruption against Dr Kumar,and punish the CAS for his bid to end life.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gandhi-doctor-threatens-self-immolation/article30795014.ece
322,2020/02/11,"HC moved on election of Thukkuguda, Adibatla municipal chairpersons","The writ petition seeking setting aside of the vote cast by ruling TRS MP K. Keshav Rao in the election of Tukkuguda municipal chairman and vice-chairman was posted for Thursday.

The matter came up for hearing before Justice P. Keshava Rao of the Telangana High Court on Tuesday. The judge adjourned the petition to Thursday, so that State Election Commission’s counsel could get instructions on the matter.

Nine councillors, who won on BJP ticket, filed the petition, alleging that the Election Officer had allowed the MP to cast vote as ex-officio member, facilitating victory of the TRS candidates as chairman and vice-chairman. Their contention was that Mr. Rao was not a Rajya Sabha member from Telangana but yet the Election Officer had permitted him to cast vote in the election of chairman and vice-chairman.

The judge observed that the matter should be heard by an election tribunal since it was a matter related to election. Petitioner’s counsel, however, said the court could hear the matter since the election tribunal was not yet constituted.

In another case, the judge instructed the State government and the SEC to file counter-affidavit in a writ petition filed by Congress councillor, praying that the election of Kotha Harthika as Adibatla municipal chairperson be declared illegal. Ms. Harthika got elected councillor on the Congress ticket but switched to ruling TRS before becoming municipal chairperson.

Petitioner G. Balraj Goud stated that he and seven other councillors (including Ms. Harthika) got elected Congress nominees. By virtue of being Congress whip in the municipality, he had issued whip instructing all Congress councillors to vote for Marri Niranjan Reddy as chairman.

However, Ms. Harthika joined the TRS on the day of election of municipal chairperson. She won as chairperson having cast her vote for herself with the support of other TRS councillors. The petitioner charged that she violated the whip and hence her election should be disqualified.

The petitioner stated that he had approached the Election Officer, stating that Ms. Harthika violated the direction to vote for Mr. Reddy. Ms. Harthika gave an explanation to the Election Officer through a letter. The latter eventually held that the whip issued by the Congress prima facie was defective and hence null and void.

The petitioner challenged the Election Officer’s declaration of the Congress whip as defective. The petition was posted for Monday.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hc-moved-on-election-of-thukkuguda-adibatla-municipal-chairpersons/article30794953.ece

In this regard, a memorandum to the Prime Minister was submitted by United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU) delegation, led by its convener for Andhra Pradesh and Telangana R.Sriram, to Telangana Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan.

During their meeting with the Governor on Monday, the delegation sought to highlight how the wage revision is due from November 2017. The negotiations commenced in May 2017 with IBA making an offer of 2% increase. “After discussions in the last 30 months, the IBA has improved its offer only to a hike of 12.25%, while even in the last settlement, the government cleared a hike of 15%,” the memorandum said.

It also cited how workload of the banking workforce has increased. “Bank employees and officers are nowadays handling all schemes of the government and there is a lot of pressure on them in handling these schemes and dealing with multitudes of the people. Hence, bank staff expect a fair and reasonable hike in wages in the current settlement,” the memorandum said.

The UFBU had recently launched an agitation programme in support of the demands, as part of which a two-day bank strike was organised from January 31 impacting the operations. Lunch hour protests are being held once a week and it has called for a three-day strike from March 11. An indefinite bank strike has also been proposed from April 1.

The Golconda Fort is a national protected monument.

Earlier, a government school used to function from the location. “I have visited the site and the people building the hotel said they will not do any construction activity to change the character of the place,” said Milan Kumar Chauley, Superintending Archaeologist of the Archaeological Survey of India in Hyderabad. “The people developing the site told me it will be sit-down dining place and they are not planning to construct a roof,” informed Mr. Chauley when asked about the development.

The site is part of a quadrangle that is topped by small minarets. While small portion with two minarets is used as an Ashoorkhana (house of mourning during Muharram), the larger part of the area is where the restaurant is being developed. This reporter has not been allowed inside.

Yards away from the site is the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ward office, tasked with food safety and civic order. “You can start a hotel anywhere in this area. If there is a hurdle we will clear it,” said a GHMC staffer who has been working at the location for the past 20 years.

Carried 2 lakh devotees

In view of the four-day jatara from February 5 to 8, TSRTC-Karimnagar Region operated 600 special buses (4,971 trips) from February 2 from Karimnagar, Godavarikhani, Huzurabad, Peddapalli, Vemulawada, Sircilla, Jagtial, Metpally and Manthani among other places. With this, it catered to 2.01 lakh passengers to the tribal fair.

The profits this time have touched ₹5.47 crore as compared to ₹4.35 crore during the 2018 jatara when it had plied 531 buses (4,904 trips) and ferried 1.85 lakh passengers to Medaram.

A break-up of depot-wise revenue stands as such — Godavarikhani (₹92.84 lakh), Jagtial (₹78.20 lakh), Karimnagar 2 (₹63.62 lakh), Manthani (₹55.79 lakh), Karimnagar 1 (₹54.64 lakh), Huzurabad (₹54.08 lakh), Sircilla (₹47.19 lakh), Vemulawada (₹28.74 lakh) and Metpally (₹27.14 lakh).

A majority of Medaram-bound devotees preferred RTC buses for safety reasons as also because of the fact that they could get down very close to the gaddelu (altar) where the deities were placed. For private modes of transport, their vehicles were stopped almost 8 km from the jatara epicentre.

The RTC has received appreciation for its prompt services and round-the-clock operation of buses during the jatara period by setting up special ticket counters, medical camps, drinking water facilities etc. Incidentally, RTC authorities ensured that the buses plied as soon as the total occupancy ratio was reached.

Safety ensured

Regional Manager Jeevan Prasad said that they had operated the special buses to the “utmost satisfaction of commuters”. “The safety and security of the passengers travelling in RTC buses was taken care of and there was not a single accident during the jatara,” he stated, showering praise on the conductors and drivers and also other RTC officials for the systematic operation of buses.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2adlum/article30786757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY10-SAMMAKKASARAKKAJATARA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/medaram-jatara-fills-tsrtc-coffers/article30786751.ece
329,2020/02/11,"State nCoV-free so far, but no time for Health officials to rest","For the past few years, one of the priorities for Health Department officials every January is to keep a tab on swine flu cases. It wasn’t any different this year either — till mid-January. Their priority changed after they were asked to trace and isolate an MBBS student who had returned to Hyderabad from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) epidemic.

However, the student’s admission at the Fever Hospital, Nallakunta, was kept a closely-guarded secret until the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced on January 24 about four samples, including one from Hyderabad, testing negative for nCoV.

Daily monitoring

Health officials heaved a sigh of relief after results of the samples collected from the suspected patient came in. However, more people with recent travel history to China and Hong Kong started to show symptoms of nCoV such as fever and cold. Such was the situation that the Health officials held back-to-back meetings on a daily basis, something unheard of in recent times.

From the third week of January, every day, Special Chief Secretary of the State Health department A. Santhi Kumari has been holding meetings with the heads of different wings of the department and apprised Health Minister Eatala Rajender of the situation. The daily meetings continue to this day. Doctors, nurses and Class-IV employees are completely involved in preparedness. By brainstorming strategies and ideas to researching literature on the new virus and guidelines issued by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, officials charted a series of steps to be taken. Their agenda was to prevent the spread of nCoV in the State, if there were to be a positive case.

Screening at airport

And the first step to achieve this was to check passengers arriving at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad. They were and continue to be screened using thermal scanners and thermal guns. If the passengers have high body temperature, they are asked for travel history, symptoms and if they were in contact with anyone with nCoV.

The next task was isolating nCoV suspects. Symptomatic patients were admitted in isolation wards of Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases (Fever Hospital), Gandhi Hospital and Government General and Chest Hospital. Instead of sending samples to the National Institute of Virology(NIV)-Pune, the virology laboratory at Gandhi Hospital was chosen to test samples collected from the two Telugu States.

Till Monday, there were no positive cases of nCoV — 73 samples from the State have been tested so far. The results of two more are awaited.

However, officials remain on high alert. “We are well prepared for any circumstances. Even if there is to be a positive case, we are prepared to handle the situation,” Fever Hospital superintendent K. Shankar said.

Director of Public Health G. Srinivas Rao said they are even prepared to tackle multiple positive cases. “We have set up isolation wards in erstwhile district hospitals as well as teaching hospitals. We are procuring additional masks, personal protection equipment and sanitisers. Sufficient number of mechanical ventilators are kept ready at teaching hospitals,” Dr Rao said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/36t054/article30786739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/City-Matters-logo,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/state-ncov-free-so-far-but-no-time-for-health-officials-to-rest/article30786660.ece

Prime Minister of Greece Kyriakos Mitsotakis laid the foundation stone for the airport, marking the beginning of the project. GAL along with its Greek partner GEK TERNA signed the concession agreement in February 2019 for establishment of the international airport.

The concession period for the project is 35 years, including phase one construction of five years. The consortium intends to invest over 500 million Euros for development of the new airport. The project is funded through support of government grant and would not require any debt. It will be funded through a mix of equity, accruals from the existing airport, and financial grant being provided by the Government of Greece.

Greece is one of the leading international tourist destinations, attracting nearly 33 million tourists per annum. Crete is the largest and most visited island in Greece. Heraklion airport, located in Crete, is the second largest airport in Greece and has registered a traffic growth of 10% CAGR over the past three years. The current airport is facing a severe capacity constraint and will be replaced by the new airport at Kastelli.

“GMR is the first Indian airport operator to win the bid to operate a European airport and it is also our first foray into the EU region. It is a matter of great pride for us to work on this prestigious project. Along with our partner GEK Terna, we aim to deliver an airport of global standards which would be a matter of pride for Greece,” said chairman-Eenergy and International Airports, GMR Group, Srinivas Bommidala.

331,2020/02/11,Zaheerabad railway station shows the sewage treatment way,"Zaheerabad is a parliamentary constituency and has a medium-sized railway station in Secunderabad division of the South Central Railway (SCR) with 26 trains bound towards Aurangabad, Pune, Shirdi, Nagarsole and others making their halts here.

This relatively unknown station got recognition through its unique eco-friendly initiative, first of its kind in Indian Railways, of recycling the city sewage to serve water needs for itself with the help of a simple Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) which now other railway divisions across country and even the State government wants to replicate.

Set up at a cost of ₹8.5 lakh, the STP is treating 30,000 litres of sewage everyday, and after filtering, water is being used for the needs of station upkeep, including watering plants around with maintenance costs of ₹3.34 per litre. The station was actually facing a crises of sorts with sewage from the town drains and also from railway quarters has been passing nearby.

The ground water table was deep and to meet the station requirements, the railway officials were forced to dig borewells for up to 800-1,100 ft depth with depletions happening every year while water tankers were being requisitioned during summer.

All that is likely to change this summer with the treatment plant commissioned recently by General Manager Gajanan Mallya.

The plant, which bagged the best innovation award in the division, consists of sedimentation tanks, natural filters using bricks and sand, carbon resins, aeration tank, PVC screen filters and others. “Water released from the ETP is odour free and has balanced PH levels so it can be directly connected to the drip irrigation system. Treated sewage water is now being used to water about 2,000 plants and two acres of garden in circulating area with help of drip irrigation system,” say railway officers Anand Bhatia and Subash, responsible for conceiving the plant.

The low operating cost of the plant will also help railways achieve carbon footprint reduction of about 14.30 metric tonnes of atmospheric carbon every year, says Chief Public Relations Officer Ch. Rakesh. Mighty pleased with what he saw, the General Manager called for similar units to be replicated at other stations too. The simple, low cost yet effective treatment plant has apparently caught the attention of State Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar and he sought details to check if it can be replicated in other towns too.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/lhizr1/article30786577.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy10Plant,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/zaheerabad-railway-station-shows-the-sewage-treatment-way/article30786578.ece

333,2020/02/11,City school goes the solar way,"Hyderabad Public School has become solar-powered with the commissioning of the 120 kW rooftop solar plant here on Monday.

Chairman of The Hyderabad Race Club and former MP R. Surender Reddy inaugurated the plant in the presence of HPS Society members, Principal Skand Bali and other dignitaries.

The solar plant has been designed and installed by Freyr Energy, a city-based solar rooftop company and is expected to generate 1,75,000 units of power every year taking care of 40% to 50% of the school’s power requirement and save more than ₹1 lakh in electricity bills every year. It will also help the school eliminate 171 tonnes of greenhouse emissions and plant an equivalent of 1,950 trees annually.

Co-founder and Managing Director of Freyr Energy Saurabh Marda said a rooftop solar combined with net-metering is an ideal way to reduce electricity bills for an educational institution as unused power generated exported back to the grid will be credited to the institution.

“It is an epitome solution for most schools who only operate 80% of the year while the solar system continues to generate power throughout the year,” he said.

Prompt intervention by personnel of the Fire and Rescue Service, including those from BPCL, helped put out the fire and prevent it from spreading to a nearby house and plywood factory. The personnel fought the fire for over five hours to finally douse it. Foam sprayed from a fire tender of the BPCL played a major role in putting out the fire.

Eight fire tenders reached the spot. In the evening, a unit from Pattimattom had to return to the spot after the threat of fire from the debris comprising largely of scrap rubber waste.

336,2020/02/11,IPS officer dons role of historian,"An IPS officer hailing from a humble background lit up the Knowledge Festival part of the ongoing Krithi International Book Fair when he spoke on ‘Re-reading of Kerala History and Genetics’.

K. Sethuraman, son of an estate worker in Munnar, who has authored the book Malayali Oru Janithaka Vayana (Malayali, a genetic reading), donned the role of a historian to put across some of his postulations.

“The history of Kerala is one of migration of different racial groups into Kerala at different points of time. Kerala Gazetteer categorises different caste groups into various races. Adivasis belong to the Negroid race. Ezhavas, thiyyas, constitute the migrants from Ezham and Theev in Sri Lanka. Nairs are said to be Nagas from the Newar people. Sanskrit speaking Arya Brahmanas from North India migrated and settled in 32 villages,” he outlined in his talk.

Caste groups

“These different streams of racial migration show that different caste groups in Kerala have no genetic link with each other. However, recent genetic studies indicate that irrespective of the caste ranks, all people in Kerala share a recent common ancestor. It means that the present history of Kerala has to be reinterpreted.

“My book is an attempt to study the social formation of Kerala in the light of new genetic studies,” said Mr. Sethuraman, who is at present Deputy Inspector General of Police (Kannur Range).",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/k6zeoo/article30787392.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-KI-KRITHIjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ips-officer-dons-role-of-historian/article30787393.ece

338,2020/02/11,Bhavans schools win junior and senior titles of The Hindu Young World Quiz,"Students from Bhavans schools stole the show at the Kochi regional round of the 20th edition of The Hindu Young World Quiz that was held at the Ernakulam Town Hall on Monday, with teams from Bhavans Vidya Mandir, Girinagar, walking away with the winner’s trophy in both the junior and senior categories.

The winning team in the junior category comprised Kiran Thomas Tyson and Arjun Vivek, while the senior team comprised Hrishikesh Varma and Neeraj B. Nair.

Coincidentally, Bhavans teams dominated as finalists too, comprising nine of the 12 teams in the two categories.

Speaking about the success saga of the two teams from BVM, Girinagar, Meena K., the teacher in charge of the school’s quiz group and special education, said that the credit should go to the enthusiastic students who stayed back after school hours and regularly attended coaching sessions in quiz.

“Moreover, a quiz master used to come and teach them. They also visit the library during free periods and update their general knowledge of different subjects.

“They clarify doubts through a WhatsApp group between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m., after studies. Parents too are very supportive,” Ms Meena said. She was given a pair of special mementos for having groomed the quizards.

Among the juniors, a team comprising Ameya Madhavan and Advaith T.S. from Bhavans Vidya Mandir, Poochatty, were the runners-up, while Aman B.

‘Quizzing a passion’

Prasanth Nair, MD of Kerala Shipping and Inland Navigation Corporation (KSINC), who came to be known popularly as “Collector Bro” during his tenure as the District Collector of Kozhikode, was the chief guest.

He spoke of how quizzing was a passion for him during his school days and exhorted students to keep their eyes and ears open to learn better. “Preparing for examinations alone is not enough. One has to be a better human being, learn to connect the points and fix problems. It is heartening that children are still passionate about quiz, despite proliferation of gadgets like cell phones,” Mr. Nair said.

The quiz was presented by Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India, while Amrita School of Engineering, Kollam, was the education partner.

339,2020/02/11,Tanker lorries drawing contaminated water,"Operation Pure Water, a drive to provide clean drinking water to all, has turned out to be a non-starter as tanker lorry operators continue to supply drinking water drawn from unidentified and untested wells.

This happens at a time when the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has set up 45 hydrants across the district. And, most of them are lying idle, according to KWA officials.

Though the district administration had recently convened a meeting on the capacity of the KWA to provide the required amount of water to tanker lorries, no concrete decision was taken, leaving tanker operators free to draw water from contaminated wells.

For the record, the Assembly Committee on Petitions chaired by K.B. Ganesh Kumar, MLA, had directed the district administration to ensure that drinking water should be sourced only from KWA vending points.

However, in spite of the facilities available at KWA treatment plants at Aluva, Maradu, Chowara, and Perumannoor, among others, the offtake from them is only 5% of the demand, according to District Tanker Lorry Owners’ Welfare Association.

Meanwhile, KWA officials told The Hindu that tanker operators had never given a clear-cut account of the quantity of water they supplied on a given day. At the same time, the KWA is ready to meet the demand through its hydrants, they said.

For instance, the offtake of water from the Aluva plant was only around 23 million litres for the entire month of January. Except for five days in the middle of the month, when the average collection was 25 lakh litres with around 300 tankers reaching the facility, there was a fall in the offtake during the rest of the month. An average of 25 tankers arrived at the plant on most other days. The earnings of the KWA during the month from vending amounted to ₹13.73 lakh.

Incidentally, the district administration too had allowed tankers to use private wells, holding that the KWA was not capable of providing sufficient quantity of water. Even after the Pollution Control Board (PCB) had said that most wells were found contaminated with e.coli and coliform bacteria above the permissible levels, water drawn from them is still being supplied to users.

The capacity of water tankers varies from 6,000 litres to 42,000 litres. Considering that the average offtake is 25,000 litres per load, a minimum of three tankers can be filled from one hydrant in an hour as it takes only 15 minutes to fill a large tanker, said KWA officials.

Since the facilities are open round-the-clock, up to 72 vehicles can be filled from one hydrant alone.

With 10 hydrants, a total of 18 million litres of water can be provided in a day. Going by the “incongruent” demand from tanker operators, they would require 15 million litres of water a day, said KWA officials.

According to KWA officials, in spite of its full preparedness to vend water, few tankers reach the Aluva plant of the authority.

There are, however, more takers from the Maradu plant. On an average, around 120 tankers reach the facility a day. However, only one-third of its capacity is being utilised, according to KWA officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gte9bs/article30786955.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07-KI-KWA-HYDRANTS-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/tanker-lorries-drawing-contaminated-water/article30786956.ece
340,2020/02/11,Kochi bus operators complain of raw deal in budget,"Even as the State government has made a slew of announcements to usher in green mobility, private bus operators are complaining that they have been kept out of the loop.

Already, the number of private buses in Kerala is down from 35,000 over 15 years ago to around 12,500 now. This is mainly due to the steep rise in operational expenses, including fuel, spare parts, tyres, road tax or insurance. “We were resting hope on the State and Central governments to avail subsidy to purchase electric buses and to retrofit CNG kits in diesel-run buses. Sadly, we have been left in the lurch,” said K.B. Suneer, general secretary of Ernakulam District Private Bus Operators’ Association.

CNG kits

Retrofitting CNG kits, as was done recently in a private bus in the city, is a cost-effective option, since it costs ₹4 lakh. There is a price difference of ₹15 between the cost of one-litre of diesel and one-kg of CNG. The installation cost can be recouped in just over a year. However, the long-term and sustainable option is electric buses, which cost over ₹1 crore apiece, he said, adding that government help was vital since private players could not afford to bear the entire expense of owning such buses. Government sops for e-vehicles were very low in Kerala as compared with other States, he said.

A public limited company mooted by private bus operators on the lines of the Cochin International Airport Limited to help avail of government subsidy too is nowhere near realisation.

Congestion on roads

Bus operators have been critical of the government limiting incentives to roll out electric-powered cars, and two and three-wheelers. They expressed the fear that this would worsen congestion on roads and further reduce the number of public transport buses in the State.

Referring to the mention of subsidies for e-autos, electric/CNG transport buses and KSEB charging stations in the State budget, Mr. Suneer expressed concern at there being no mention of private buses. “Bus operators have been meted out a raw deal. The 10% lowering of tax is a pittance and it will not exceed ₹15,000 a year even for big busees,” he said.

Responding to the zero tax for e-autos for five years and limiting of tax for electric cars and two-wheelers to 5 per cent, Rajwanth Ben, who co-owns a dealership in the city for cars, said States such as Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka had announced major sops to encourage customers to shift to electric vehicles. “After all, electric vehicles, including cars, have less than 5% of the market share of vehicles. The government would not incur any loss, considering social benefits such as fall in the pollution levels when people shift from fossil fuels,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ald0ss/article30786927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10KI-Busescol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kochi-bus-operators-complain-of-raw-deal-in-budget/article30786928.ece

A meeting of members of the community organised by the District Legal Services Authority in Kozhikode on Tuesday attempted to educate them about their rights and the facilities they can avail from the State.

“The transgender identity card issued by the State is important to avail any of the services offered. But less than 600 people in the State, out of the around 25,000 registered transpeople, have applied for one,” said Sisily George, president of the Punarjani Cultural Society for transgenders in Kozhikode. “Only around 40 people have applied for the ID card in Kozhikode district,” she added.

P. Parameshwaran, Superintendent at Social Justice Department, Kozhikode, explained the various schemes while DLSA Secretary and District Sub Judge A.V. Unnikrishnan cleared doubts during an interactive session.

Mr. Parameshwaran explained how transgender persons could procure the ID card and get funding for self-employment, the Samanvaya scheme for continuing education and details of the 24x7 helpline.

He said the State was giving ₹2-lakh aid for anyone undergoing sex reassignment surgery and ₹3,000 for three months to complete treatment. A transgender couple, both of who have undergone surgery, gets ₹35,000 as a gift from the State.

346,2020/02/11,District gears up for kerchief revolution,"Kozhikode is getting ready for a ‘kerchief revolution’ in the coming academic year.

The Kerala Tuberculosis Elimination and Awareness Wing under the District TB Cell has launched an awareness campaign, especially in schools, on the necessity of using the handkerchief for one’s own safety and that of others’ too.

“There are a lot of air-borne diseases these days. It is not just deadly diseases like coronavirus, but even tuberculosis and H1N1 spread through air. The use of handkerchief by those having cough or cold can prevent the diseases from spreading,” said P.P. Pramod Kumar, District TB Officer.

The District TB Office had launched a campaign named ‘Thoovala Viplavam’ in 2018 when the district was battling the Nipah virus. When the entire district was shut down for fear of the disease, the TB Centre advised people to use handkerchiefs to stop germs from spreading. However, the movement did not get much mileage.

Now, the authorities have made a renewed attempt in the form of a short film titled Thoovala. Interestingly, the handkerchief is the narrator in the film, explaining how it was a fashion symbol once upon a time but went out of reverie after the arrival of tissue papers.

“People do not carry handkerchiefs these days because they can make do with tissues,” Dr. Pramod Kumar said.

The film incites the inner human in everyone who does not want to be the reason for another person contracting a disease.

The number of fatal accidents in these districts that was 1,102 in 2016 had come down to 661 fatalities in 2018. Defective road designs, mixing of slow moving vehicles from village roads into highways and lack of concentration by drivers were some of the causes for accidents, he said.

Stating that besides taking up road engineering works, black spots on roads in both the districts had been removed, he said use of road safety features like blinkers and barricades, and enforcement of road rules had led to reduction in accidents.

Traffic rule violators were fined and their licences suspended for three months, Mr. Jawahar said. If they continued to violate the rules after suspension of licences for three times, their licences were cancelled, he added.

Mr. Jawahar said electronic driving testing track had been set up in Karur district and 12 more such tracks were being planned across the State.

352,2020/02/11,‘Joint inspection of accident spots by officials must to stop recurrence’,"MADURAI

Transport Commissioner Tenkasi S. Jawahar on Tuesday instructed officials from the Departments of Police, Transport and Highways to conduct joint inspection of accident spots where fatalities are reported.

Addressing a road safety review meeting with officials of various departments from Madurai and Virudhunagar districts here, Mr. Jawahar said only when officials made a joint inspection they could find various factors that caused fatalities and take remedial steps to prevent recurrence.

He was responding to the presentations made by the Collectors T.G. Vinay (Madurai) and R. Kannan (Virudhunagar), in which it was revealed that the officials had made joint inspections only in 11 of the 438 fatal road accidents in Madurai district. In Virudhunagar, the joint inspection was conducted only in one case.

When S. Davidson Devasirvatham, Commissioner of Police, Madurai City, listed a number of road and junction improvement works to prevent accidents, Mr. Jawahar asked the officials from Madurai Corporation and State Highways to send their plan of action on this issue so that he could get required funds for the works.

The Transport Commissioner said concerted efforts taken by various departments had helped bring down the number of fatalities in the State from 17,218 in 2016 to 9,797 in 2019. “We have saved the lives of not just 7,421 persons, but the the lives of bread winners of as many families,” he said.

The State had targeted to achieve “zero-accident” by 2030 by making 2 lakh km of various types of roads, on which 2.80 crore vehicles were plying, safer. “At least 2% of the GDP was being lost because of accidents,” he said.

Pramod Kumar, Inspector General of Police (Traffic and Road Safety), said Tamil Nadu had won an award from the Centre for reducing most number of accidents in 2019. “Despite that a lot of lives in the productive age group were being lost in accidents,” he said.

Two-wheelers-related accidents accounted for the highest number of fatalities, he said, adding wearing of helmets by two-wheeler riders had 80% chance of saving lives. Besides undertaking road engineering and enforcing safety measures, reducing response time for ambulances to reach accident spots to 14 minutes too had helped in saving a lot of lives, he added.

Mr. Pramod Kumar said the Collectors should make periodical road safety audit to arrive at short-term, mid-term and long-term solutions for making the roads safer.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/joint-inspection-of-accident-spots-by-officials-must-to-stop-recurrence-madurai/article30794995.ece
353,2020/02/11,‘Thrust on child rights education required’,"MADURAI

Every month, members of District Child Protection Office, Childline and Child Welfare Committee conduct awareness programmes for children on safe and unsafe touches.

S. Thulir, a government school teacher from Tirupparankundram, says during these programmes, the conversation flows as if one is reading out from a textbook. The scope for discussion on child rights is limited to a long discourse as children never ask questions.

Although awareness campaigns over the years have been instrumental in elaborating on the rights of children, lack of reiteration through textbook materials in school curriculum remains a major issue, he says.

Chief Education Officer R. Swaminathan says apart from regular awareness programmes, school students are encouraged to reach out to officials of the district administration. Activists, however, say this will not do.

Child Welfare Committee Chairperson M. Vijayasaravanan says the rise in the number of offences, including sexual exploitation and enrolling children as labourers, is a telling reminder of the need for empowering children with rights. He says the Committee regularly encounters cases where children and young women are unsure of whom to approach during crisis.

He adds that several youngsters fall prey to drugs and drug dealers. “It is at this point that we realise that even if there is no 10-page lesson on child rights, a two-page crisis manual for children in their books will be useful,” he says.

Mr. Thulir says only in the academic year 2019-2020 have teachers got training from School Education department with regard to Childline number, Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and the Child Protection Act. “Though it is appreciable that we have got training now, a mention of these aspects in the form of a lesson would greatly benefit students,” he says.

With participatory learning techniques and simulation, child rights activist C. Jim Jesudas says, children will be able to intimate teachers, parents or trusted guardians about the problems they face. There have been several instances of students calling up Childline number to stop marriages of friends and rescue bonded labourers.

Mr. Thulir says such education must also be provided to parents so that they will take complaints and rights of children seriously. “While accommodating child rights in the form of lessons in the syllabus is only the basic, the stakeholders must allow children to question and learn,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/thrust-on-child-rights-education-required-madurai/article30794642.ece
354,2020/02/11,Stalemate in annexing some villages with a panchayat union,"The second phase of public hearing held on Tuesday on annexing some of revenue villages now with Maanur and Paapaakudi panchayat unions with the newly carved out Tenkasi district or continue to be with Tirunelveli district concluded inconclusively.

When Tenkasi district was carved out of Tirunelveli district which had 10 Assembly segments with 16 taluks, the new district was created with five Assembly constituencies housing eight taluks.

Since the final decision of annexing some of the villages in Maanur and Paapaakudi panchayat unions with Tenkasi district or Tirunelveli district is yet to be taken, the second phase of the public hearing was held on Tuesday. When the first public hearing was held last month, participants, mostly public representatives, opposed the move to annex some of the villages with Paapaakudi union, saying that the move would torment the public a lot in reaching their union office.

As the second phase of the public hearing was conducted on Tuesday with Tirunelveli Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish in chair and in the presence of Tenkasi Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan, the participants opposed the move to annex 14 village panchayats now with Maanur union to Paapaakudi union.

Raising this issue, DMK’s Tirunelveli central district secretary Abdul Wahab and former chairman of Maanur panchayat union ‘Kallur’ Velayutham of AIADMK said the annexing of the village panchayats now with Maanur union with Paapaakudi union would badly hit delimitation of Assembly segments.

“If these village panchayats are attached to Paapaakudi union, these village panchayats will either come under Alangulam Assembly constituency or with Ambasamudram Assembly segment instead of being with Tirunelveli constituency. Instead of being with nearby Tirunelveli Revenue Division, it will go under the Cheranmahadevi Revenue Division. So it will cause chaos in the revenue system. The people of these village panchayats, who can easily reach Maanur union office by travelling for about 10 km will have to travel for about 30 km to reach Paapaakudi union office,” said Mr. Wahab and Mr. Velayutham.

They, instead, favoured the creation of new panchayat union with Suththamalli or Kallur as its headquarters, which was instantly rejected by the officials, who said annexing of some of the revenue villages now with Maanur union with Paapaakudi union was inevitable. They suggested that Suththamalli, Pazhavoor, Kodaganallur, Melakallur and Sanganthiradu village panchayats be with Paapaakudi union, which was not accepted by the participants. So, the meeting ended on inconclusive note.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/stalemate-in-annexing-some-villages-with-a-panchayat-union/article30794264.ece

358,2020/02/11,"Madurai Matters...‘Goripalayam needs not a flyover, but traffic improvement works’","A flyover at Goripalayam junction to decongest traffic has been in discussion among various government agencies for several years. A proposal to construct a flyover that was approved years back by the then Jayalalithaa government after a prolonged delay has now taken the shape of an elevated highway between Periyar statue junction in Tallakulam and Albert Victor Bridge. The ₹200-crore project includes construction of an additional bridge across Vaigai river close to A.V. Bridge.

However, O.B. Balaji, a social worker who is passionate about improving city traffic, is opposed to the very idea of constructing the elevated highway. “The idea of constructing a flyover at Goripalayam junction per se is not necessary. Then where does the new proposal for an elevated highway come from?” he asks.

Mr. Balaji claims that a major portion of the traffic flow at Goripalayam junction is the heavy volume of vehicles that go to A.V. Bridge from Alagarkoil Road. Traffic on the other two branches at the junction – from Palam Station Road (Sellur) to Panagal Road and from Panagal Road to Alagarkoil Road – is very meagre, he says.

His claim is that only because of blocking of traffic due to the signal, vehicles get piled up on these roads.

Even this bottleneck would get eased when widening of Vaigai Bank Roads get over.

Madurai Corporation and National Highways have started widening the existing roads on both banks of the Vaigai and extending them on both sides. This project will provide a seamless road connectivity between Ring Road and Dindigul Bypass Road.

These roads are likely to become bypass roads running very much across the city.

“When these roads are completed, a major chunk of vehicles that usually enter the city from various sides – Dindigul Road, Sivaganga Road and Ramanathapuram Road – would stick on only to Vaigai North Bank Road and Vaigai South Bank Road,” says a Corporation engineer.

Vehicles from all these three districts now invariably pass through Goripalayam junction to reach the east side of the city or the west side. Once the work gets over, these vehicles will not come to Goripalayam junction at all, he says.

With several bridges and causeways available across the Vaigai, the two widened roads would even help city residents take these two roads at different points and cross the river, without having to come to Goripalayam junction, says a National Highways engineer.

The two-way roads on either banks would come up with medians and pedestrian pathways. Besides, a new road overbridge on South Bank Road (parallel to Sellur ROB on North Bank Road) has also been proposed to make both the roads give a seamless connectivity between Dindigul Bypass Road and Ring Road within two years.

Instead of vehicles from all three roads cutting across one another at the junction, Mr. Balaji suggests a major change in traffic pattern. Vehicles from Alagarkoil Road going to A.V. Bridge, should take a free left turn at the junction to go to Panagal Road.

“After going for some 100 metres, these vehicles can make a U-turn on Panagal Road and proceed towards A.V. Bridge. Let the vehicles from Palam Station Road also join this flow of traffic a bit slowly and proceed further to Panagal Road,” he says.

He claims accidents are inevitable when vehicles from two directions cut across each other at the junction. In the proposed traffic pattern, vehicles from both directions will go in the same direction. “Since vehicles from both roads will go in the same direction the possibility of accidents will become almost nil,” he says.

He points out that similar pattern of traffic movement where vehicles from two roads get mingled at a particular point before taking two different roads are very much available at more than one spot in the city.

Vehicles from Nelpettai and A.V. Bridge mingle between Anna Statue junction and Yanaikal junction and they proceed in opposite directions – to Simmakkal and to Kalpalam.

Similarly, vehicles from Alagarkoil Road and Gokhale Road mingle between Ambedkar Statue and Periyar statue and proceed in different directions – towards Goripalayam and towards K.K. Nagar.

He suggests that this could be possible with widening of Alagarkoil Road-Panagal Road left curve. “The Corporation has a huge ground there for widening that would allow more space for the vehicles to move around,” he adds.

Besides, a major junction improvement work could be taken up to suit the proposal.

However, Madurai Collector T.G. Vinay says this proposal of Mr. Balaji has not been agreed upon by Highways officials. Besides, the elevated highway proposal is at an advanced stage. “But for some issues, the bridge work could have started by now,” he adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ou4ynn/article30797982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA12MDUSOUTHBANKROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/goripalayam-needs-not-a-flyover-but-traffic-improvement-works-madurai/article30793050.ece

360,2020/02/11,"LPG delivery men seek disbursal of better pay, insurance cover","Workers from Tamil Nadu LPG Cylinder Delivery Mans’ Union submitted a petition to Collector T.G. Vinay here on Monday, seeking disbursal of benefits, including contribution to provident fund (PF) and Employees' State Insurance (ESI), here on Monday.

Speaking to media persons, the union’s State president R. Ganesh said that the government-owned Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) had asked customers not to pay tips to the delivery persons.

“Considering our poor working conditions and the physical strain on all our employees, the minimum one can do is pay us a meagre tips. We have no other benefits, including insurance cover. There were instances when our workers injured themselves when cylinders had fallen on their hands and legs. With no medical cover, they have to bear the hospital expenses themselves,” he said.

Their salary ranges between ₹500 and ₹5,000. Though each worker was supposed to receive ₹27 for the delivery of every cylinder, Mr. Ganesh alleged that the payment directly goes to his employer.

“With the advent of online transactions, we barely know how much we are missing. Only during delivery do we realise that we have been robbed. It is both concerning and frightening that both corporates and gas agency workers treat us like we are mules. This needs to change,” he said.

He said the workers must either be paid better salaries or allowed to receive tips.

The body of the deceased, identified as P. Ganesan (40) of Karadikkal, was charred beyond recognition.

M. Asaithambi (60), R. Vijayakumar (35), A. Karthik (24) and V. Arumugam (60) were injured in the accident, police said.

“The condition of three persons is very critical. Asaithambi has suffered 90% burns and Vijayakumar sustained 80% burns,” Sangumani, Dean, Government Rajaji Hospital, said.

A police source said that Asaithambi had put up a temporary shed on Chokkanathapatti Road close to Madurai-Kappalur Ring Road and had been stocking petrol and diesel that had been reportedly pilfered from oil tankers. “Sparks that came out while cooking could have caused the fire and the fuel stocked in barrels and cans went up in flames,” said Sivasakthi, Inspector of Police, Tirumangalam Town.

The victims were playing carrom inside the shed when the fire broke out around 12:30 p.m. “As the fuel-filled cans were placed close to the exit, they could have got trapped inside,” a police source said.

An eye-witness said following the fire, an explosion was witnessed and the tin-roof was blown apart. Parts of the tin sheets were found dangling in a nearby thorny tree. Two motorbikes that were parked outside the shed were completely destroyed. The flames had gone so high that parts of the thorny tree and another tree in the vicinity were partially burnt.

A cooking gas cylinder had exploded inside the shed.

A team of forensic experts, led by Baskaran, Assistant Director, found the completely mangled portion of the cylinder a few metres away from the shed.

Another shed put up in the vicinity to stock construction materials was also damaged in the inferno. Two fire tenders were pressed into service to put out the flames.

362,2020/02/11,‘Smart road’ work tests the patience of vehicle users,"Traffic snarls have become a common sight on the already congested four Masi Streets around Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple, where the Madurai Corporation is laying ‘smart roads.’

Improper planning and slower pace of execution of work is causing inconvenience to road users. They demand faster execution of work and alternative measures for the ease of road users during this period.

The Masi streets, which run for around 4.6 km, are being renovated at a cost of ₹47 crore under the Smart Cities Mission. These roads fall under the Area-Based Development Zone (ABDZ) of the Corporation.

Each of these roads will have three underground ducts that are separated by concrete. The first underground duct will have electrical cables, the second will have communication cables and the last one will be used as storm water drains. To ensure longer durability, finally, the roads would be laid completely with concrete.

According to a Corporation engineer, currently, underground duct work has been completed at around 700 metres on the four Masi streets. A good part of work has been completed on West Masi Street.

With the ongoing work, which has reduced the carriageway by half, traffic congestion has worsened on East Masi Street, complained P. Thangamani, a shopkeeper. “Every day hundreds of lorries cross the stretch from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. During peak hours, it takes around 15 minutes for vehicle users to pass through this stretch,” he said.

P. Selvakumar, another shopkeeper, complained that the contract workers dumped construction debris on streets. “Many shops remained closed due to the construction work as debris were dumped in front of their shops. We welcome this development project. But the officials must execute the project properly as this is the main commercial hub of the city,” he said.

The workers have not paved the portions of road where the work has been completed.“As a result, many lorries get stuck in wet soil, which further worsens the congestion,” he added.

On Monday, Corporation men pumped out water which has leaked from broken pipelines due to construction work and let them onto South Masi Street. “Movement on one portion of the road was restricted due to construction work and on the other side pedestrians are suffering as they have to wade through puddles of water,” said an autorickshaw driver.

Many shopkeepers also complained that water pipelines got damaged due to construction work and caused inconvenience to them. “Had they informed earlier, we would have at least arranged for other alternatives,” said Lakshman, a shopkeeper on South Masi Street.

With the ongoing construction work, the dust pollution has worsened, complained a police official. “It will be better if officials carry out the work in a phased manner,” said the official.

A Corporation official said that water that was stagnant due to the leakage from damaged pipelines caused the delay in completion of the project.

“Before the commencement of Chithirai festival, work will be completed at portions of road which are dug up now. No new portions of road will be dug up,” said the official.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/qvzahe/article30789256.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11MACITY-SOUTHMASISTREET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/smart-roads-test-the-patience-of-road-users/article30789257.ece
363,2020/02/11,Deputy CM promises to resolve issue of pending stipend of house surgeons,"Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education and Medical Education C.N. Ashwath Narayan has assured house surgeons at Government Wenlock and Lady Goschen Hospitals of resolving the issue of non-payment of their stipend at the earliest.

“It’s an issue of priority for me. We will ask the institution to pay the amount. We need to go tough on this. The issue will be resolved shortly,” he told reporters here recently.

As many as 54 house surgeons, who have studied MBBS in the Kasturba Medical College (KMC) under government quota, are serving at the two government hospitals. They have to get ₹ 20,000 per month as stipend during their one year of internship. The house surgeons have not received stipend in the last 11 months.

This is the third year in succession that the house surgeons are fighting for their stipend. The Directorate of Medical Education paid stipend till 2018 and asked the Department of Health and Family Welfare, under which the two government hospitals come, to pay stipend from 2019-20.

Mr. Narayan said that there was audit objection for payment of stipend to KMC house surgeons serving in the government hospital. The same was the case of the house surgeons of JJM Medical College, Davangere, serving in the government hospital.

On the delay in resolving the issue, Mr. Narayan said: “The government was paying stipend all the while. It comes to around ₹ 2 crore. Institutions resist from paying stipend,” he said and added that the government was committed to resolving the long-pending issue.

367,2020/02/11,ZP looking for agency to dispose of multilayer plastic,"Stating that the disposal of multilayer plastics particularly biscuit and chips packets was a matter of concern, Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer R. Selvamani on Monday said the ZP was yet to find agency that can process such plastic.

During the discussion on solid waste management at the ZP general meeting here, Mr. Selvamani said plastics, except for multilayer plastics, are taken by scrap dealers. In North Karnataka, multilayer plastics are taken by cement factories and burnt. In Dakshina Kannada, he said, the multilayer plastic cannot be used by thermal power plant as its burning will lead to emission of harmful gases.

Mr. Selvamani said ZP was looking for agencies to process multilayer plastics. “Several agencies have evinced interest, but none have come forward so far,” he said and that added a few days ago, an Aurangabad-based agency evinced interest. The agency has sought a certain quantity of multilayer plastics every day for its processing unit.

Member P. Dharanendra expressed the need for the policy statement for each panchayat about solid waste management and disposal. Another member Sucharitha Shetty said panchayats should make use of space in government schools and other government buildings for stocking plastic waste.

Several members raised their voice against reported slacking in the work of Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd. in setting up drinking water dispensing units in villages. Of the 47 works allotted, the KRIDL has completed only 37 and there were lacunae in the remaining 10 works. “When such is the slack, why should the government allot works related flood relief to this agency,” questioned ZP member M.S. Mohammed.

President Meenakshi Shanthigodu presided over the meeting.

Do political parties fund development?

Objecting to party hoardings and banners for development works, ZP member K.K. Shahul Hameed on Monday sought to know whether political parties granted funds for development works.

“Of late, I find banners of political parties for programmes laying foundation stones (for development works). Do BJP, Congress and JD(S) provide funds for development,” Mr. Hameed asked ZP CEO R. Selvamani. “I have photographs of several such programmes held recently,” he added.

Countering Mr. Hameed, ZP member from BJP Koragappa Naik said there was nothing wrong for party supporters to have banners. “You do not have party banners on the stage. Party supporters can have banners outside,” he said.

Another BJP member said they were following what Congress had done in the earlier term.

Puttaswamy on Monday said that a detailed project report for a two-lane concrete fisheries road between Talapady on Karnataka-Kerala border to Karwar was submitted to the State government through the Coastal Development Authority (CDA).

Speaking to reporters here, Mr. Puttaswamy said that the proposed road, running parallel to National Highway 66 and estimated to cost ₹ 780 crore, would benefit thousands of fishermen families residing on the coast. Existing stretches of bitumen roads are neither in good condition nor they offer seamless connectivity, he said.

Mr. Puttaswamy said that the CDA has also proposed to widen the Bajpe-Athradi-Udupi road into a four-lane highway at a cost of ₹ 580 crore for which a detailed project report has been sent to the government.

The project would offer easy connectivity between Udupi and Mangaluru International Airport, he said. Also, a detailed project report was prepared to provide drinking water to 25 villages in Dakshina Kannada and 26 in Udupi district under the multi-village drinking water schemes.

The Deputy Chairman said that he would strive to get sufficient funds in the forthcoming budget to fully develop Belikeri and Tadadi ports in Uttara Kannada and enable rail connectivity to these ports.

Of the 200 works taken up during 2019-20, including continued works of the previous financial year, 92 works are completed. The authority had ₹ 404 lakh carried forward balance at the beginning of the year and got ₹ 663 lakh funding so far. So far, it has spent ₹ 709 lakh, Mr. Puttaswamy said. The authority comes under the Department of Planning, Programme Implementation and Statistics.

369,2020/02/11,"States given ₹81,043 cr. as GST compensation for April-Sept. : Anurag Thakur","The Centre has released ₹81,043 crore as GST compensation to States for April-September 2019, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur said on Tuesday.

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, he said GST compensation cess collection had shown an upward trend since October 2019.

GST compensation cess of ₹7,607 crore was collected in October, ₹7,727 crore in November, ₹8,331 crore in December and ₹8,637 crore in January.

For 2019-20, the amount targeted to be collected from cess in GST was ₹1.09 lakh crore. Of this, ₹70,534 crore has been collected between April-December 2019.

The amount of GST compensation released to States for April-September 2019 stood at ₹81,043 crore, Mr. Thakur said.

For 2018-19 fiscal, the net collection of GST compensation cess stood at ₹95,081 crore as against the target of ₹90,000 crore. For full fiscal, the government had released ₹81,141 crore to states as compensation.

For 2017-18, the net collection from cess stood at ₹62,612 crore, as against the target of ₹61,331 crore. The compensation amount released to states was ₹48,785 crore.

Under GST law, States were guaranteed to be paid for any loss of revenue in the first five years of GST implementation, which came into force on July 1, 2017.

The shortfall is calculated assuming a 14% annual growth in GST collections by States over the base year of 2015-16.

“For providing such compensation to States, compensation cess is being levied on certain luxury and demerit goods as per provisions in Section 8 of the GST (Compensation to States) Act, 2017, and compensation cess is being credited into a non-lapsable Fund known as Goods and Services Tax Compensation Fund which forms part of the Public Account of India,” Mr. Thakur said.

Fraudulent claims

As many as 634 cases of fraudulent GST refund claim by exporters amounting ₹1,912 crore had been detected by the central tax authorities between July 2017 and January 2020, Parliament was informed on Tuesday.

In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Mr. Thakur said of this, ₹238.97 crore had been recovered by the Central GST authorities from the entities which claimed the fraudulent refunds.

A total of 35 persons had been arrested by the CGST authorities, he added.

370,2020/02/11,"Economy not in trouble, asserts Finance Minister","The economy is not in trouble, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Lok Sabha in her response to the debate on the Union Budget on Tuesday, highlighting seven macro-economic indicators as signs of revival.

These ‘green shoots’ included higher foreign investment, improvement in industrial output and GST collections, all-time high forex reserves and an upbeat stock market.

Defending her government’s handling of the economy, Ms. Sitharaman lashed out at former finance minister and Congress MP P. Chidambaram, saying she had nothing to learn from the ‘competent doctors’ who gave ‘faulty remedies’, resulting in a mountain of non-performing assets (NPAs) and double-digit inflation.

In both Houses of Parliament, the Finance Minister cited data to show improvements in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows and net foreign portfolio investment (FPI), growth registered by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) after several months of contraction, healthy forex reserves, a rise in gross GST collections and a 5% growth in market cap of the BSE Sensex.

In the Lok Sabha, she also outlined details of the government’s initiatives to drive the four engines of growth, public and private investment, public consumption, and exports.

In the Rajya Sabha, however, she embarked on a stinging attack against Mr. Chidambaram and the UPA government’s economic record.

“I heard former Finance Minister’s speech with great intent and keenness. There was more sarcasm than content,” she said, adding that her government would not “repeat the faulty remedies” prescribed by UPA government during the economic crisis of 2008-09 .

She said the UPA government’s actions then had led to the twin balance sheet crisis faced by banks, mounting non-performing assets and fleeing defaulters. There was a flight of capital and foreign investment in 2012-13, she said.

Rebutting charges of fudging accounts, she instead accused the UPA of shifting the burden of oil bonds onto the books of oil marketing companies.

Ms. Sitharaman, however, refused to answer a question by Congress leader Anand Sharma. “The hon’ble minister said that in 2019-20 fiscal deficit was 3.8% (of GDP) and revenue deficit was 2.4%. Out of the borrowed money, the capital expenditure was 1.4%. This time, she has reduced the fiscal deficit to 3.5%. The revenue deficit is pegged at 2.8%. That leaves only 0.9% for the capital expenditure. Can you clarify,” Mr. Sharma asked.

Reacting to Ms. Sitharaman’s speech, Mr. Chidambaram said that her unwillingness, or inability, to answer a straightforward question spoke volumes about the FM as well as the government.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/ys7470/article30794638.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12BUNIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/economy-not-in-trouble-asserts-finance-minister/article30794639.ece

“There are seven important indicators which show that there are green shoots in the economy...economy is not in trouble,” she said while replying to a debate on the Union Budget in Lok Sabha.

Referring to visible indicators of green shoots, the Finance Minister said the forex reserve is at an all time high and the stock market is upbeat.

She said the government’s focus is on four engines of growth which include private investment, exports, private and public consumption.

With regard to public investment, she said, the government in December announced a National Infrastructure Pipeline.

It envisages investment of ₹1.03 lakh crore for infrastructure development across the country in the next four years (till 2024-25), she said.

To boost consumption, the government has increased the Minimum Support Price of all mandated Rabi and Kharif crops for 2019-20.

She further said the fiscal deficit was higher during the UPA regime “when the economy was managed by competent doctors“.

374,2020/02/11,Prepared for the coronavirus,"Declared by the World Health Organization as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern, the novel coronavirus (nCoV) has infected more than 37,000 people and killed more than 800. The Indian government and health authorities have responded in a robust manner to contain the epidemic in various ways on the basis of available knowledge, but there are no grounds for complacency. While logistical challenges have been overcome by the Ministries, States, the military and civilians together, Indian scientists have shown their eagerness to attain world-class skills by rapidly developing diagnostics and treatment protocols.

A swift response

Swift diplomacy was at work during the Wuhan airlift. The External Affairs Ministry obtained permission and ground support from its Chinese counterparts and coordinated with Air India through the Civil Aviation Ministry. The Health and Family Welfare Ministry provided the team of medical personnel to accompany the students home, and arranged for their health check-ups and quarantine at special camps organised by the Armed Forces Medical Services in Manesar and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police facility in Delhi. Temporary visa restrictions have been put in place. All the 645 evacuees have tested negative for nCoV. They are being monitored on a regular basis and will be tested again.

India issued its first advisory on January 17. The Emergency Medical Response Unit in the Health Ministry was activated, the National Centre for Disease Control opened a 24X7 helpline, and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) worked to quickly put in place a testing facility at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. The Joint Monitoring Group under the Chairmanship of the Directorate General of Health Services was activated to continuously assess the risk and review the preparedness to manage any case that might get imported to India.

Thermal entry screening of passengers from China is taking place in 21 airports. Universal screening at earmarked aerobridges for all flights from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand is carried out. There are inflight announcements and self-declaration forms in international flights, so that passengers with any symptoms can volunteer for screening. Screening at international seaports by the Shipping Ministry and border crossings by the Home Ministry is in place. Hospitals with isolation facilities near all international airports are prepared to meet any emergency requirements.

In Kerala, where the three people with nCoV are quarantined, the health authorities have responded in a stellar manner. Kerala has not only traced hundreds of contacts of the confirmed cases and notified them to the Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme for monitoring, but also used unique community-based isolation methods, innovated while dealing with the Nipah virus outbreaks. Its model of monitoring, with the District Collector as the administrative unit, has been shared as a best practice with all States. All the States have put together a robust system of contact tracing, community surveillance with community engagement, earmarking isolation facilities, sharing information, updating surveillance data, issuing daily health bulletins, skilling health workers with new guidelines, etc. The States bordering Nepal have even held special gram sabhas to empower people with information.

Treatment

Till date no antiviral treatment for the coronavirus infection has been effective but studies among SARS-CoV patients show that the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was associated with possible clinical benefit. Based on this research as well its own docking studies, ICMR has obtained approval to use this combination therapy as part of a public health emergency within a research framework and restricted use. On the diagnostics front, the NIV has leveraged its considerable expertise in real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing to develop assays for in-vitro qualitative detection of nCoV, using primer and probe sequences of the virus provided by the WHO. Scientists at NIV are also carrying out genomic sequencing of nCoV and attempting to isolate the virus in order to replicate it for further research. Fourteen Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories have been upgraded to carry out nCoV testing.

India has also offered help to other countries in the South Asia region as part of its Neighbourhood First policy. It evacuated seven Maldivian nationals from Wuhan. It has extended technical assistance to several countries to set up testing laboratories.

The public too has helped deal with the crisis, particularly by preventing the dissemination of wrong information. We should all observe good hygiene and sanitation practices to prevent infection, avoid crowding in public places and perhaps even replace the handshake with the traditional Namaste.

375,2020/02/11,Facing up to realities,"As India entered the 21st century, the Net National Income of the average Indian was ₹20,000. While this figure is not the actual earnings of an individual, it is a good proxy for the average Indian’s annual income. By 2015, it had grown to ₹90,000. Had it continued on the same trajectory, it should have been ₹1,65,000 today. Instead, as the recent Economic Survey shows, the Net National Income for the average Indian is ₹1,35,000. In other words, the average Indian has potentially lost ₹30,000 in net annual income. For most Indians, ₹30,000 a year is a very big amount. This is the cost of economic under-performance for the average Indian.

The POW trinity

It is well accepted by most political economists that India’s economic performance is largely shaped by the ‘POW’ trinity — politics, oil and world economy. Political leadership and stability are critical determinants of domestic and foreign investment in India. Global oil prices play an inordinately large role in shaping India’s macroeconomy. World trade and global GDP drive India’s exports and industry.

In 2014, India gleamed with hope. For the first time in nearly half a century, the ‘POW’ trinity was perfectly aligned. Indians handed a parliamentary majority to a supposedly strong, decisive leader with a promise of economic development.

Beginning in 2014, global crude oil prices dropped precipitously from more than $100 a barrel to $40. It was estimated then that the steep fall in oil prices alone would add two extra percentage points to India’s GDP growth rate, besides taming inflation. The global economy was also on an upward trend from 2014, recovering robustly from the devastation of the 2008 economic crisis. The period from 2014 to 2019 was among the best five years for world economic growth in the 21st century.

So, in the summer of 2014, a billion Indians glimmered in hope and excitement at the prospect of rapidly rising income levels and prosperity under a perfectly aligned ‘POW’. Six years later, not only has the average Indian’s income levels not grown faster than before, it is actually ₹30,000 short of what it should have been.

Why did things go so wrong? The ongoing health catastrophe caused by the novel coronavirus in Hubei province of China offers meaningful parallels and lessons for India’s economic policy climate.

The coronavirus parallel

In a recent article, The New York Times reconstructed the events leading up to the novel coronavirus crisis. In early December, several shopkeepers in an open meat market in Wuhan started falling ill. Doctors in the hospital treating these patients raised alarms about a mysterious illness.

The Mayor of Wuhan, however, did not want any negative news about his city. He issued summons to the doctors who raised alarm about the illness and forced them to sign statements that their warnings were unfounded. Further, Wuhan’s healthcare authorities placed restrictions on discussing the illness in public. They assured the public that the disease was “entirely preventable and curable” and issued statements claiming that all was well. Ironically, at this time, the Mayor even held a “Health Expo” event to showcase Wuhan as a top healthcare destination.

Within days, there were hundreds of deaths and all hell had broken loose. It was no longer possible for the government to suppress this bad news. Within a span of seven weeks from the doctors raising an alarm about a mysterious disease, the novel coronavirus became a global epidemic.

It is both tempting and natural to ponder about the counterfactual. Could China have been saved from the novel coronavirus epidemic had the doctors’ alarms not been suppressed? What could the situation have been had the government not stifled factual reporting? Could doctors and scientists have discovered the virus sooner and ring-fenced it, had the Mayor not intimidated the doctors into silence? One will never know. But it is indisputable that drawing a veil over the ugly truth and facts made it much worse and the consequences more dire than what could have been.

The parallel with India’s unfolding economic crisis is striking. India’s government had dismissed, ignored, silenced or shunted all negative data, indicators, views and opinions about the economy. From the initial signs in 2015 of a banking stress to falling private investment to collapsing consumption demand to dormant exports and rising unemployment, there were ample signs and metrics of the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy. But these were either quickly buried or altered. Sure enough, India’s economic growth has collapsed to a six-year low. Similar to the Wuhan situation, one is left to wonder about what could have been India’s economic situation today had early alarm bells been heard and acted upon, warnings not suppressed and expert advice not dismissed. The average Indian is paying the price for this severe folly – ₹30,000 a year.

However, there is now one major difference in the way the Wuhan novel coronavirus crisis is being handled vis-a-vis the Indian economic crisis. The Chinese government has acknowledged the enormity of the Wuhan crisis and is acting at lightening speed to salvage the situation. It built a brand new 1,000-bed hospital in just 10 days to accommodate patients and contain the virus. It is building two more hospitals. Experts from across the country are being sent to Wuhan. There is an all-out effort by the government to help China recover from this crisis.

Nonchalant Central government

On the other hand, India’s Finance Minister, in delivering the longest Budget speech in history recently, did not even seem to acknowledge the enormity of the economic crisis, much less outline concrete steps to revive the economy. Beyond the numbers about fiscal deficit, taxation and expenditure, the most worrying and important takeaway from the recent Budget exercise was the government’s seeming nonchalance towards the gravity of the crisis the Indian economy is facing. Any amount of analysis of the intricate details of the Budget numbers or schemes is moot unless there is confidence and trust built among economic participants that the government is seized of the gravity of the situation and is taking concrete steps to resolve it. At present, this is conspicuously missing.

Health pandemics and economic crises cannot be draped and masked for too long. India’s $3 trillion market economy cannot be dictated and bullied into appropriate behaviour. It needs careful treatment by experts. It may be a cliché that desperate times call for desperate measures but worth repeating. While the run-up to India’s economic crisis was eerily similar to the way China ignored warning calls on coronavirus, one hopes, for the sake of a billion Indians and the world, that the Indian government emulates the Chinese government in handling its crisis.

Several statues of Godse have been erected, beginning with the one installed at the Hindu Mahasabha office in Meerut on Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday on October 2, 2016.

The most recent incident of calumny against the Mahatma was former Union Minister and current BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde’s statement on February 1 claiming that the freedom movement led by Gandhi was a “drama” that was “staged with the consent and support of the British”. He went on to say that it is not that “India got independence because of the fast unto death and satyagraha... Britishers gave independence out of frustration. My blood boils when I read history. Such people become Mahatma in our country.” Despite Mr. Hegde’s attempt to wriggle out of the controversy caused by his statement, it cannot be denied that his remarks were an attempt to bring Gandhi and his unparalleled contribution to the freedom movement into disrepute.

Disagreements with Ambedkar

No political leader, not even the tallest among them, should be immune from criticism. This applies to Gandhi as well. His ideas and actions were open to legitimate criticism even during his lifetime. For example, B.R. Ambedkar criticised Gandhi for letting down Dalits by going on a fast unto death against the separate electorate granted to them in 1932. This led to Ambedkar dropping his demand in exchange for greater representation for Dalits elected by the general Hindu electorate. Ambedkar later came to regret the decision.

Similarly, Subhas Chandra Bose was critical of Gandhi’s reliance solely on non-violence to gain India’s independence and the Mahatma’s aversion to industrialisation. Nonetheless, the two respected, even admired, each other. In 1942, after Bose had formed the Indian National Army and despite Gandhi’s aversion to violence, he called Bose a “patriot of patriots”. Bose referred to Gandhi as the “father of the nation” in a broadcast from Rangoon in 1944.

Gandhi’s economic ideas were criticised by the left because of his theory of trusteeship by which the wealthy would hold India’s wealth in trust for the people. The socialist and communist left argued that this theory was anti-poor because it justified the concentration of wealth among landlords, feudal princes and capitalists. Those, including Jawaharlal Nehru, committed to making India a strong modern state and an industrialised nation, were critical of Gandhi’s aversion to industrialisation and his belief that self-governing villages should constitute the basis of Indian polity.

Fabrication

These criticisms were based on genuine differences of opinion. Calumny is a different matter, especially since it is based on falsehood. The prime example of such fabrication is that Gandhi was responsible for Partition when the truth is absolutely the opposite. Gandhi remained a firm opponent of Partition until the very end. The Congress Working Committee accepted the Partition plan, knowing that this was the case. This is the main reason why Gandhi disassociated himself from the celebrations accompanying Indian Independence and left Delhi for Bengal to heal the wounds of communal riots. Unfortunately, slander has now become a fine art in India and electronic and social media have become the principal conduits for its propagation.

377,2020/02/11,A mix Indian health care can do without,"The United States has one of the most prodigal health systems, but this does not help the U.S. with the well-known reality that it is infamously poor-performing. And so does the fact that it is also one of the most intricate of health systems across the globe.

Over a century, U.S. health care has seen numerous elaborate arrangements, from organisational and regulatory structures to payment mechanisms emerge, be dismantled, and reincarnate with even greater degrees of complexity. Health care has repeatedly topped the political agenda; been an area of passionate contention among an unexampled plethora of diverse interest groups; and scarcely ever been an unpopular topic of national discourse. However, fervent attempts to reconcile its health care with traditional American values of individual freedom and consumerism have not sat well with the ideals of equity and social justice.

Piggyback route

In India, multiple policy pronouncements over the last few years have expressed an implicit intent to emulate certain features of the U.S. health system, enhance private initiative, and uphold the insurance route as the way to go for health care. These are being largely envisaged while riding on the back of the Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Scheme (AB-NHPS), which aims to provide insurance cover to nearly 50 crore poor Indians. With the great razzmatazz that characterised its launch, the AB-NHPS affirmed strong mechanisms to check insurance fraud which was commonplace in its precursor programme, the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY). In the scramble to succeed at this, deleterious emulation of the U.S. example appears to have already set in.

Recently, 171 hospitals were reported to have been de-empanelled from the AB-NHPS on charges of fraud, which also included the issuance of fake e-cards and the manipulation of claims. A first information report was lodged against a few hospitals and multiple show cause notices were issued. This was almost within a year of the programme being launched with the promise of offering a religious check on fraudulent practices.

The response to these has been envisaged through an unprecedented bolstering of administratively-heavy and technology-driven mechanisms. Already, national- and state anti-fraud units have been established and partnerships with fraud control companies conceived. One would ask this question: what is wrong in all of this?

Let us return to the U.S. once again. Multiple layers of complex arrangements and concomitant complex regulatory provisions have ensured that health care in the U.S. is one of the most administratively and technologically intensive systems in the world. More than 50% of health-care spending in the U.S. in 2010 went into health worker’s wages, with a large chunk of the growth in health-care labour taking place in the form of non-clinical workers. What this entails is that for every penny spent on health care, very little goes into actually improving health.

Range of concerns

In India, the path of the AB-NHPS appears indistinguishable from the former, though only more menacing. It necessitates a battery of new structures, personnel cadres, data systems, and working arrangements only in order to sub-satisfactorily operate an insurance scheme that would cover less than half the population. Disregarding the death spiral that policy-driven over reliance on private health care could lead to — given India’s feeble regulatory architecture — this would entail considerable costs which would not primarily contribute to, or be indispensable for, improving health outcomes. And this is set in a context where public health spending fails to exceed a single per cent of GDP (antipodal to the U.S.) and where each rupee spent on health is highly precious. While a besottedness with cutting-edge technology and state-of-the-art systems can help garner eyes and promote businesses, each unnecessary penny incurred this way raises significant ethical concerns when basic health needs remain unmet and abject shortages of fundamental health resources and infrastructure stare square in the eye.

Gupta and Roy have shown how the allocation for the AB-NHPS for 2019-20 would have covered less than a quarter of the targeted beneficiaries. For 2020-21, there has been a paltry increase in health-care sector allocation (5.7% above 2019-20 RE), while the allocation for the AB-NHPS is unchanged. It is very possible that the AB-NHPS continues to remain insufficiently funded and incapable of extending considerable financial risk protection to the poor. However, more investment is not necessarily merrier in this context. Embracing the complexities associated with robust regulation of the insurance programme and making the requisite technological and administrative investments appear attractive and commendable on the face. However, they entail diverting highly limited resources towards wasteful and dispensable high-end areas, which could have been set aside for much more pressing and productive domains, such as public hospitals and health centres. Improvements in these areas would have strongly reflected in terms of tangibly better health outcomes. Rather, the AB-NHPS appears attuned to reinforcing a stark contradiction wherein trailblazing but unproductive high-end structures thrive alongside decrepit but potentially fructuous basic structures. In line with the suggestions of experts and critics, it becomes essential to take a fresh, hard look at the larger question of whether adopting the insurance mode for achieving universal health coverage is a felicitous path for India.

The grandiloquent fanfare with which the AB-NHPS has been rolled out and the global hype it has generated can readily adumbrate the pressing concerns that lie underneath, while floating the mistaken impression that much is being done for health care in the country. One persistent habit that has characterised Indian health care since inception is of leaping onto the next, more aspirational position or endeavour before doing sufficient justice with the previous one, thus leaving the basics unattended. The AB-NHPS, in the presence of this vice, can only be another precarious rung in the ladder.

378,2020/02/11,Reservation as right: on Supreme Court judgment,"It is quite understandable that a recent Supreme Court judgment, that there is no fundamental right to claim reservation in promotions, has caused some political alarm. The received wisdom in affirmative action jurisprudence is that a series of Constitution amendments and judgments have created a sound legal framework for reservation in public employment, subject to the fulfilment of certain constitutional requirements. And that it has solidified into an entitlement for the backward classes, including the SCs and STs. However, the latest judgment is a reminder that affirmative action programmes allowed in the Constitution flow from “enabling provisions” and are not rights as such. This legal position is not new. Major judgments — these include those by Constitution Benches — note that Article 16(4), on reservation in posts, is enabling in nature. In other words, the state is not bound to provide reservations, but if it does so, it must be in favour of sections that are backward and inadequately represented in the services based on quantifiable data. Thus, the Court is not wrong in setting aside an Uttarakhand High Court order directing data collection on the adequacy or inadequacy of representation of SC/ST candidates in the State’s services. Its reasoning is that once there is a decision not to extend reservation — in this case, in promotions — to the section, the question whether its representation in the services is inadequate is irrelevant.

The root of the current issue lies in the then Congress government’s decision to give up SC/ST quotas in promotions in Uttarakhand. The present BJP regime also shares responsibility as it argued in the Court that there is neither a basic right to reservations nor a duty by the State government to provide it. The idea that reservation is not a right may be in consonance with the Constitution allowing it as an option, but a larger question looms: Is there no government obligation to continue with affirmative action if the social situation that keeps some sections backward and at the receiving end of discrimination persists? Reservation is no more seen by the Supreme Court as an exception to the equality rule; rather, it is a facet of equality. The terms “proportionate equality” and “substantive equality” have been used to show that the equality norm acquires completion only when the marginalised are given a legal leg-up. Some may even read into this an inescapable state obligation to extend reservation to those who need it, lest its absence render the entire system unequal. For instance, if no quotas are implemented and no study on backwardness and extent of representation is done, it may result in a perceptible imbalance in social representation in public services. Will the courts still say a direction cannot be given to gather data and provide quotas to those with inadequate representation?",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/reservation-as-right/article30785768.ece
379,2020/02/11,Safeguarding the delta: on T.N.'s Protected Special Agriculture Zone,"By announcing that the Cauvery delta region, Tamil Nadu’s rice bowl comprising eight districts, will be declared as ‘Protected Special Agricultural Zone’ (PSAZ), State Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has recognised farmer concerns about hydrocarbon exploration and accorded primacy to food security. In political messaging, he also sought to deflect the perception that the AIADMK government, after Jayalalithaa’s death, is subservient to the BJP-led central government and is complicit in allowing “anti-people” projects. His decision comes weeks after he protested the Centre’s unilateral amendment of the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006, exempting prior environmental clearance and public consultations for oil and gas exploration. The delta, which produces 33 lakh tonnes of grains in 28 lakh acres, has seen multiple protests for a decade over methane, hydrocarbon, oil and natural gas projects, which required acquisition of fertile lands and well drilling — proposals which triggered fears of groundwater contamination. Neduvasal in Pudukottai and Kadiramangalam in Thanjavur have been the nerve centres of these resolute protests, led by agriculturists and backed by mainstream political parties. In July 2013, in response to sustained protests, then Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ordered suspension on coalbed methane exploration and production in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur and followed it up with a ban in 2015. But in 2017, the Centre signed contracts for hydrocarbon extraction from 31 areas of discovered small fields including from Neduvasal. Two years later it allowed Vedanta Limited to conduct tests for 274 hydrocarbon wells in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.

Mr. Palaniswami has rightly sensed that the farmers’ emotive and intense opposition can be ignored only at a political cost. Agricultural scientists such as M.S. Swaminathan have for long mooted such zones similar to special economic zones; Uttarakhand and Kerala have them. Tamil Nadu now has to enact legislation to protect a vast region, largely in the coastal area, from industries that would affect farming. The State has its challenges. In 2017, a government notification delineated 45 villages covering about 23,000 hectares in Cuddalore and Nagapattinam districts in the delta, as a Petroleum, Chemical and Petrochemical Investment Region, with an eye on over ₹90,000 crore in investments. The proposed PSAZ raises a question mark on this ambitious scheme. The government may have to brave central pressure and litigation from companies which pumped in money for exploration. The latest decision may have implications for the State’s investment climate, what with the closure of the Sterlite Copper plant still fresh in memory. But the intent to prioritise farmer interests and food security is beyond reproach.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/safeguarding-the-delta/article30785780.ece
380,2020/02/11,"Whether Wednesday is my last match in India or Sunday, the music will slow down one day: Leander Paes","Among the top draws at the Karnataka State Lawn Tennis Association are its ‘Walls of Fame’ that are steeped in the sport’s history. From Rod Laver to Martina Navratilova to John McEnroe to Ramanathan Krishnan, there is an exquisitely framed photograph of nearly every tennis great.

Needless to say, there is one of Leander Paes too, to which the legend has lent a personal touch with his autograph. It’s the chance to relive this history, savour the tennis culture and experience the connect with the fans for one last time that has drawn Paes to the ATP Bengaluru Open.

“If you look around the stadium, the posters themselves speak a million words,” Paes said on Tuesday. “For me, playing in Bangalore is an emotion. It’s one of those few pockets [in India] that plays a lot of tennis, has a rich heritage, and the fans are very educated. This is one of my favourite hunting grounds and the Davis Cup doubles win against Serbia (2014) where we came back from two sets to love down is one of my most memorable ones.”

From the Australia Open to the Tata Open Maharashtra in Pune and now Bengaluru, the 46-year-old is on a thanksgiving journey. But Paes insisted that it hasn’t distracted from what he considers his primary responsibility — to achieve on-court excellence.

“I still put my time into it,” Paes said. “I do my gym work, I do my training. I want to make sure that I keep playing to the level I’m used to. With my physicality and attitude, if I wanted to play for another two or three years I could. The body is really fit and the mind still fresh.”

“But being on the professional circuit, travelling week in week out, 30 weeks a year is very hard. My team also has kind of disintegrated. My travelling coach and tennis coach are back home. So travelling alone is no fun, after 30 years of doing it.”

On Wednesday, however, he is sure to be in a happy place, between the lines of a tennis court where he has felt most at home, as he is set to usher in the night session matches on Centre Court in the company of Matthew Ebden, his partner from Australia.

“Whether Wednesday is my last match in India or Sunday, the music will slow down one day, go silent. But just as in music, there are many different songs in an album. There are many different albums in a musician’s career. And it’s those albums that I look forward to.

381,2020/02/11,Exports not so rosy ahead of Valentine’s Day,"Bengaluru, one of the major exporters of roses, caters to the huge demand for the flower in many European and West Asian countries ahead of Valentine’s Day on February 14. But, this year, the business is dull owing to a dip in production as well as restrictions on airlines in the wake of the coronavirus scare.

The curbs on airlines has led to an increase in freight charges, and many carriers are less inclined to take perishable cargo, said V.H. Prasad, one of the directors of the International Flower Auction Bangalore Ltd (IFAB). Moreover, the production of roses has been badly affected because of the downy mildew disease.

The two major varieties of red roses that are being exported this year are Taj Mahal and Brilliant. “Roses are produced in Bengaluru Rural, Doddaballapur, Chikkaballapur, Kolar, Tumakuru, Ballari, Hassan, Hosur and Anantapur. Downy mildew disease affected rose plantations in Bengaluru and Hosur,” he said.

T.M. Aravind, director of the South India Floriculture Association (SIFA), said another setback was the early production of roses in Hosur. Mr. Prasad said the best window for production for exports ahead of Valentine’s Day is between January 27 and February 13. “However, roses were ready in Hosur by January 20. The shelf life is not more than 15 to 20 days,” said Mr. Prasad.

Good demand in local market

The saving grace for rose growers is the demand in the local markets owing to the ongoing wedding season. A.S. Mithun, Business Development Manager, IFAB, said every day, more than five lakh stems of roses are being auctioned at the centre. With reduced production, the demand is high, and this is fetching growers a good price.

On Tuesday, the highest price for one stem of Taj Mahal (red rose variety) was ₹22.95. “On February 12, the prices of all varieties of roses may peak. The cost per stem may go up to anywhere between ₹25 and ₹30,” said Mr. Mithun.

Sellers are hoping that the wedding season, which extends till mid-March, will continue to boost demand. “In Delhi, which is one of the major local markets, a bunch of 20 stems is being sold at ₹400. The local market here will sustain for another month,” said Mr. Prasad.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/on4cag/article30794885.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/00BGROSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/exports-not-so-rosy-ahead-of-valentines-day/article30794886.ece
382,2020/02/11,Nalapad was driving car that rammed into vehicles: Police,"A Bentley car that rammed into two vehicles and injured four people, including a six-year-old boy near Mekhri Circle on Sunday, was allegedly being driven by Mohammed Nalapad Haris, the son of Shantinagar Congress MLA N.A. Haris.

Soon after the accident, the driver abandoned the car, and another person surrendered to the police. However, the Bengaluru Traffic Police said on Tuesday that they had strong evidence to show that it was Nalapad who was behind the wheel. The MLA’s son is currently out on bail after he reportedly beat up a patron at a restaurant in 2018.

Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Ravikanthe Gowda, Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic), said their initial investigations have confirmed the identity of the driver. “However, some other person came and surrendered to the police claiming that he was the one who rammed into vehicles. We will soon issue a notice to Mohammed Nalapad to appear before us for further investigations,” said Mr. Gowda.

Incidentally, Nalapad’s name is not mentioned in the FIR, which the police filed on Sunday, against an unnamed male driver of the Bentley. The accused has been booked for rash and negligent driving, endangering the life of others and also under sections of the of Motor Vehicles Act.

The incident occurred on Sunday around 2.30 p.m. when the speeding luxury car, coming towards P.G. Halli from Hebbal, rammed into a motorcycle and then hit the rear of an autorickshaw under the Mekhri Circle underpass, near the CTO Junction on Ballari Road.

Four people were injured: the autorickshaw driver Suhel, 31, and two passengers, Sabiha, 28, and her six-year-old son, as well as the motorcycle driver. “The motorcycle rider, suffered a fracture on his left leg and sustained other minor injuries,” a police official said.

The traffic police have seized the car. The injured were taken to a private hospital for treatment.

In February 2018, Nalapad and his friends allegedly attacked a patron at a well-known restaurant in the Central Business District. As many as 11 charges, under the Indian Penal Code, including sections related to attempt to murder, voluntarily causing grievous hurt with deadly weapon or means, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace, were invoked against him in the charge sheet filed by the Central Crime Branch.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/nalapad-was-driving-car-that-rammed-into-vehicles-police/article30794241.ece

384,2020/02/11,Copy of CRZ clearance for KPL railway line doubling provided to residents last week,"Work on doubling of an existing railway line on the Ennore Creek by the Kamarajar Port (KPL) began with CRZ clearance and a copy of the CRZ clearance was provided to local residents late last week by the Superintendent of Police after they protested against the work being started by KPL, newly available information showed.

The CRZ clearance has laid down a number of conditions to be met by KPL including non-alteration or dressing of the sand dunes present in the vicinity or alteration of the natural features including landscape changes for beautification, recreation or any other such purpose. KPL was also directed to get ‘Consent To Establish’ from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board under the provisions of the Air and Water Acts.

Activists had earlier claimed work had begun without Environmental Clearance for the project as the information had not been made public on the website of the Ministry of Environment. Following this, when locals protested against the work beginning without clearance, a copy of the Clearance was provided by the SP, they said.

“It was earlier not clear if they had obtained EC/CRZ as the same was not made public as is mandated. After local people approached the SP, the clearance copy dated January 7 was shown. Although the clearance and the recommendation of the TNSCZMA prohibits encroaching into the tidal channel and dumping of excavated material into water bodies, these are being violated,” Pooja Kumar of Coastal Resource Centre said.

Environmental activists also said that it was mandatory to obtain Consent to Establish (CTE) under the Water and Air Acts before construction begins, and it was unclear if KPL had a valid CTE. Locals also said that the wetlands outside the CRZ were also being built upon.

According to Ms. Pooja, on both sides of the railway line, for which a bridge is being built, are inter-tidal salt pans and wetlands. Dumping concrete and construction debris will destroy the creek’s ecosystem, she said, adding that KPL had cut down full-grown mangroves for building the bridge. She pointed out that in November 2019, the EAC had only recommended the project for CRZ clearance with conditions that no excavated material during construction will be dumped in the waterbodies or adjacent area and the area needs to be restored to its original condition after construction. The EAC had also recommended planting of mangroves five times the number of mangroves cut down for the project.

385,2020/02/11,"Chennai airport sees a huge spike in gold seizures, recovers 355 kg in 2019","A whopping 355 kg of gold worth ₹123 crore was seized from hundreds of passengers at Chennai airport last year. The airport witnessed a huge increase of 53% in its seizures, when compared to the previous year.

Data accessed by The Hindu shows, in 2018, 232 kg of gold worth ₹72 crore was seized as against 355 kg in 2019.

Speaking to The Hindu, Rajan Chaudhary, Commissioner of Customs, Chennai International Airport, says most of these passengers come from destinations like Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. “Earlier, we used to find most passengers coming from the Middle East conceal gold in various forms and come to the city. But these days, it is predominantly from Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. We have stepped up vigilance substantially and that’s one of the major reasons we have been able to seize the gold. Apart from intelligence inputs, we also carefully check passengers and that has helped,” he says.

From concealing the precious metal in MP3 players to skateboards and even door latches, passengers have found innumerable ways to hide gold. But most of them conceal gold inside their rectum. The biggest case in 2019 however, was when two Korean passengers from Hongkong concealed 24 kg of gold worth ₹8 crore inside their shorts.

This apart, Chennai Customs has also seized foreign currencies of various countries worth ₹10 crore carried by passengers. In one case, diamonds weighing 2,996 carat worth ₹2.25 crore was also seized by officials last year. A Malaysian passenger who came from Kuala Lumpur had concealed them in his inner wear and also at the bottom of a multi-purpose cooker in his check-in baggage.

What happens to this gold and foreign currencies seized?

“After a certain period of time, the gold and foreign currencies seized are sent to the Reserve Bank of India. If a passenger carries gold that is valued at above ₹20 lakhs, then he is arrested and the gold is seized,” he says.

He noted that, in 2019, there were also four different attempts to smuggle in saffron. Officials seized 65 kg worth ₹1.4 crore in 2019 when compared to 33 kg in 2018.

Wildlife smuggling

Importantly, the number of people attempting to smuggle in various species of wildlife has also gone up, he says. There were 14 cases where passengers tried to bring in exotic species in 2019 as against three the previous year. From kangaroo rats to meerkats, passengers have been found to conceal several such species inside their baggage. “When we asked, we found they bring in these species to sell them here; many want to keep them as pets at home,” he adds.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/lpe65c/article30791714.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11FEBTH-GOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-airport-sees-a-huge-spike-in-gold-seizures-recovers-355-kg-in-2019/article30791715.ece
386,2020/02/11,Chennai Corporation launches framework for city’s streets,"The Greater Chennai Corporation should significantly add to its urban planning capacity and come out with a vision and area development plans, said Vikram Kapur, chairman, Tangedco.

“Needs such as electricity, water, parking and others need to be upgraded frequently. Streets should be designed in such a manner that they are amenable to future upgradation and not dug up. We can have specialised ducts or a tree line/area in the streets where all these utilities can go,” he said adding that this can happen only if it is planned well.

Mr. Kapur was speaking on the topic ‘Seamless inter-departmental coordination in urbanscape projects’, at the launch of Greater Chennai Corporation’s Chennai Mega Streets and Adoption of Complete Streets Framework, on Tuesday.

Appreciating the Mega Streets plan, he said that it should be given statutory teeth. “We have to incorporate this into the development regulation of Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA). There are rules for building and lay outs, but there are none for streets. Street designs should be incorporated into development regulations,” he added.

S. P. Velumani, Minister for Municipal Administration, Rural Development and Implementation of Special Projects, launched the Chennai Mega Streets and Adoption of Complete Streets Framework and explained its salient features.

He said that the project is proposed for 426 sq km in Chennai city, with 600 km of Greater Chennai Corporation streets for redevelopment and 286 km of urban roads under other departments within Corporation limits.

Phase 1 of the project focuses on a core area of 70 sq km of the North, Central and South Chennai areas: transforming 110 km of arterial and sub-arterial streets in the neighbourhoods of Anna Nagar, Tondiarpet, Nungambakkam, Mylapore,Velachery and Adyar.

Some of the major roads to be redeveloped in this core area are: R. K. Salai, Cathedral Road, Gandhi Mandapam Road, Sardar Patel Road, LB Road, Thiruvotriyur High Road, New Avadi Road, Royapettah High Road, Kutchery Road and Greenways Road among others.

“This will ensure safety for pedestrians, cyclists, women, children, elderly and differently-abled. There will be no road cutting for the next 30 years,” he said.

388,2020/02/11,Years of bad road conditions leave residents of Kolathur village frustrated,"The residents of Kolathur, a village located in Thiruporur taluk, have been complaining of poor road facilities.

The village located next to Mambakkam, has no black-topped road and the one road which has some semblance of black topping is in bad condition, making motoring on the road a miserable experience, they said.

Residents of the village rued that for a long time, they have put up with the un-motorable condition of Selliammam Koil Street which branches off from Kolathur Main Road and is the only access road connecting to the Kelambakkam-Vandalur Road.

R. Dillibabu, a resident of Sannathi Street, said there is a government school on Selliamman road which is also the main thoroughfare for private vans and the public buses. Despite the road being in a battered condition for several years the local authorities have not taken any steps to re- lay the road.

While the main road is in battered condition, the interior roads are even worse, with most of them remaining mere mud tracks.

390,2020/02/11,"Draft national policy on rare diseases published, Centre tells Madras HC","After being directed by the Madras High Court, on January 6, to consider the issue of providing medical care to those suffering from the rare Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSD) as a “national emergency”, the Centre on Monday informed the court of having notified a draft national policy on rare diseases.

The First Bench of Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad were told by Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan that the government had called for public opinion on the draft policy till February 15, and that it would be finalised only after considering the views of all stakeholders.

PIL petition

The submission was made during the hearing of a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) petition filed by Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society of India, based in New Delhi, in 2017. The petitioner’s counsel V. Ramesh said the draft policy envisages provision of ₹15 lakh to those suffering from certain LSDs.

He pointed out that the draft policy had categorised rare disorders amenable to one-time curative treatment such as Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT) and disorders that were amenable to organ transplantation into one group, and states that they could be provided with financial support.

It further added that a maximum of ₹15 lakh could be provided to each patient under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arokya Nidhi and that the beneficiaries would not be limited to families below the poverty line. Instead, support would be extended to 40% of population in accordance with the norms of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.

‘Deliberate further’

After hearing the counsel, the Judges expressed their reservations over the sufficiency of allocating just ₹15 lakh and impressed upon the Centre as well as the State government to deliberate further after taking note of efforts being made globally to address the medical needs of those suffering from rare diseases.

The Judges also referred to a research paper titled ‘Rare Diseases in Latin America: Challenges and opportunities for the equitable attention and proposal of patients organisations’ by Angela P. Chaves and Migdalia Denis, and another paper titled ‘Review of 11 national policies for rare diseases in the context of key patient needs’ by Safiyya Dharssi and others.

Apart from these, there were also two judgments of the Delhi High Court on the right to medical care at State cost and the legal obligation of the government to ensure access to life-saving drugs. The Judges insisted that these also be taken note of before finalising the national policy, and granted time till March 2 for the Centre to report back.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/draft-national-policy-on-rare-diseases-published-centre-tells-madras-hc/article30788174.ece

393,2020/02/11,Police warning against dealing with cryptocurrency,"The Economic Offences Wing has warned public not to deal with cryptocurrencies including Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple and more.

“A few cases of investors of cryptocurrencies being cheated have been reported in Tamil Nadu. Cases have been registered and accused were arrested. The public is hereby advised not to deal with cryptocurrencies including Bitcoins, Ethereum, Ripple and more. Those trading in virtual currencies were doing so at their own risk, given that the Central bank has not given a licence or authorisation to any company to deal in such cryptocurrencies,” the warning said.

In a press release, the special unit of police also said cryptocurrency is neither a currency as per the definition of currency in India nor a derivative as well. It is a virtual currency akin to goods such as gold or precious metals which behaves more like assets. Most cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, ripple, litecoin and ethereum are not backed by a sovereign guarantee, and therefore are not considered as legal tender. Further, unlike other investment avenues, cryptocurrencies are not regulated by the government entities nor does a regulatory body watch over it. Investors have no official authority to redress their grievances. The government does not recognize cryptocurrencies as legal tender.

The Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly cautioned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies, including Bitcoins, regarding various risks associated in dealing with such virtual currencies such as money laundering, consumer protection and market integrity. In view of the associated risks, entities regulated by RBI were prohibited from dealing with or providing services to any individual or business entities dealing with or settling virtual currencies. A draft bill has also been proposed to ban cryptocurrencies in the country and provide for an official digital currency, the release added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-warning-against-dealing-with-cryptocurrency/article30787325.ece

395,2020/02/11,Pothole fixer to patch up roads,"The Highways Department has recently procured six machines, including a pothole fixer, to be used on city roads. The pothole fixer will carry blue metal and bitumen, mix them and lay the mixture.

“The spot on the road to be repaired has to be cleaned, after which, the machine, as directed by the operator, will pour liquid bitumen emulsion on the area to be patched up. Then the bitumen and blue metal that has been mixed in the machine would be poured into the pothole. A roller would then flatten the surface. Usually, we need the bitumen to be heated and macadam mix to be made at the central asphalt plant. But this is a mobile plant and it can do the job very quickly,” explained an official source in the department.

“Contractors would not want to repair small patches. Here, we have blue metal and macadam and need not have to depend on the asphalt plant that does not operate at all times leading to various departments having to wait for the macadam mix,” the official said.

The machine would be used to restore road cuts made by other agencies for undertaking repairs to waterlines, powerlines, internet cables and telephone lines. The machine has been procured at a cost of ₹72.55 lakh and can cover 100 sq m per day. The machine has been put to use in areas in the south and work is taken up at night.

More equipment

The city roads division, which maintains around 250 km of roads in and around Chennai, has also procured two road sweeping machines at a cost of ₹100 lakh. “Four more sweepers have been purchased for use in other corporations in the State.

398,2020/02/11,Students beat up MTC driver for objecting to footboard travel,"A driver of Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) was beaten up by school students in K.K.Nagar on Monday when he objected to travelling on footboard.

The victim, T.Manohar, 49, was driving the bus 12- G from K.K.Nagar bus terminus towards Anna Square with his colleague Kulaindasamy in the conductor seat.

At 8.30 a.m, a group of school students boarded the bus at Sivan Park and insisted on standing on the footboard.

The driver asked them to get inside so that he could close the door. They ignored the repeated warnings of the crew and other commuters.

Rajan, one of the passengers, said, “After another group of students boarded the bus at Kamarajar Salai, the driver managed to close the door. The boys then travelled by holding on to the iron pole outside the door and some of them clung to the windows. They continued to travel dangerously despite our warnings.”

Caught unawares

When the bus reached the next bus stop, the number of students was more than other passengers. They continued to hang from the door and windows.

Irritated at their behaviour, the driver got down from his seat and tried to chase the students away. The students encircled him and beat him up.

Since the doors were closed, the other passengers and the conductor could not come out to rescue him. Two college students joined the group that attacked the driver.

Even as the passersby came to his rescue, the students escaped from the spot. Manohar was taken to the nearby ESI Hospital for treatment. The K.K.Nagar police inspector said, “Based on a complaint from the driver, we enquired into the incident.”

Though the city police has curbed the menace of route thala and bus day celebrations, schoolboys travelling on footboards of buses are still a common sight on city roads.

“We are facing this menace everyday. Around half the bus services have been cut in this area and there is shortage of bus services to cater to the need during school hours in the morning. Transport department should increase the number of services in commensurate with population of students. Police personnel also increase patrol to monitor them during peak hour,” said P.Balakrishnan, district secretary of CITU south Chennai unit.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7ob667/article30787140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THDRIVER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/students-beat-up-mtc-driver-for-objecting-to-footboard-travel/article30787141.ece

The offender has been identified as Shankar Rao, 48, a resident of Railway quarters in Tiruvottiyur. He was dismissed from service as he was irregular to work.

Police sources said the girl was under the care of her grandparents in Visakhapatnam.

Three months ago, she and her grandmother had gone to a temple near their house. While they were waiting at bus stand in Visakhapatnam, she wandered off.

Shankar Rao spotted her in the bus stand in Visakhapatnam. He lured the girl with the promise of getting her a job in Chennai and kidnapped her.

The grandmother lodged a complaint with the local police seeking to trace her grand daughter.

Shankar Rao brought her to Chennai and kept her in illegal confinement in the railway quarters. He sexually assaulted her for over three months and impregnated her, the police said.

400,2020/02/11,Family members should ensure health of women: Mallika Mohandas,"To discuss various health issues related to women and to send across the message that their well-being should be prioritised, MIOT International organised a programme —Women at the centre of our universe — on Monday.

About 100 delegates from across the world took part in the programme.

It included sessions on polycystic ovarian disease, women and anaemia, recent advances in osteoporosis, women and diabetes, cervix cancer, thyroid disorders and management, women and heart, women and mental health and menopause. There were also panel discussions on master health check-ups, violence against women and time, work and family.

Mallika Mohandas, chairman, MIOT International, said women tend to neglect their health, and other members of the family should ensure that she is healthy — both physically and mentally. Early detection of any disease was important.

“Now, because of education, women are more empowered and the health seeking behaviour has improved,” she told reporters. She added that the event was organised in line with the hospital’s Founder’s Day.

Rosy Akbar, Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts, Fiji, said women constitute half of the world’s population, but were still struggling to find their voice and fight for equal rights.

“Women continue to face discrimination and domestic violence. Education is the way forward,” she said. She added that education and health should be the priority, and mindsets should change to put women in the front.

401,2020/02/11,Corporation plans urban forests on OSR lands,"Chennai Corporation has planned to stop converting large OSR (Open Space Reserve) lands into conventional parks in the city to reduce capital and maintenance expenditure. Instead, the civic body will develop dense urban forests on the OSR lands by Japanese Miyawaki method.

The work on the first OSR land to be converted in to a dense urban forest is likely to be taken up in Anna Nagar zone near Koyambedu grade separator.

Corporation Commissioner G.Prakash has instructed the officials of Anna Nagar zone to develop the OSR land measuring 4.08 acres in Koyambedu near V.R.Mall into a dense urban forest. “More than 48,000 trees are likely to be planted in the dense urban forest near V.R.Mall. The OSR land was handed over by Ozone projects to meet the OSR land requirements,” said an official.

The OSR land was handed over to Ozone projects for a period of one year for development of a park on May 8, 2018. After inspecting the area recently, Chennai Corporation officials found that the time period for creation and maintenance of a park had lapsed for the developer. As a result, Corporation Commissioner instructed the zonal officials not to renew the permission given earlier to the developer for maintenance of a park.

The commissioner has also instructed the officials to make the dense urban forest in each area unique, with the selection of indigenous species. ""In five years, the OSR lands will become dense urban forests in each neighbourhood. This will reduce pollution in the area,"" said an official. Residents will not be able to walk inside the dense urban forest. So, residents have requested the civic officials to lay a wide pathway around the dense urban forests to facilitate walking.

The developers of projects, who have been requesting the Chennai Corporation for permission to develop OSR lands, will get permission to maintain the OSR land only after the planting of the saplings for the dense urban forest by Miyawaki method.

Chennai Corporation has been maintaining at least 700 OSR lands in the city, developing conventional parks in these areas. Every year, at least 100 large OSR lands are expected to be handed over to the civic body by huge developers in the 15 zones of the city. These lands will soon be developed as dense urban forests, officials said.

Residents’ association members said the OSR lands should be used for the purpose of offering open space to residents during disasters. “Residents should get open space for gathering during disasters like earthquake. That is why urban planning rules stipulate handing over of 10% space towards OSR lands,” said a resident.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/67yw0/article30787112.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/corporation-plans-urban-forests-on-osr-lands/article30787113.ece
402,2020/02/11,"Kamarajar Port resumed work on doubling railway line without permission, alleges activist","Kamarajar Port Ltd (KPL), which was fined over ₹8 crore for polluting the Ennore Creek and failing to clear up the pollution by the National Green Tribunal recently, has begun work on doubling the existing railway line and levelling the area without permission, environmental activists said.

“In 2019, KPL began work illegally and was stopped after the State Coastal Zone Management Authority (SCZMA) undertook an inspection and ordered the work to be stopped. The Environment Ministry has not granted clearance for the project. But they have begun work on it without permission,” Pooja Kumar of the Coastal Resource Centre said.

According to Ms. Pooja, on both sides of the railway line for which a bridge is being built are inter-tidal salt pans and wetlands. Dumping concrete and construction debris will destroy the creek’s ecosystem, she said, adding that KPL had cut down full grown mangroves for building the bridge. She pointed out that in November 2019, the EAC had only recommended the project for CRZ clearance with conditions that no excavated material during construction will be dumped in the waterbodies or adjacent area and the area needs to be restored to its original condition after construction. The EAC had also recommended planting of mangroves five times the number of mangroves cut down for the project.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/b3gfr0/article30787102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11THENNORECREEK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kamarajar-port-resumed-work-on-doubling-railway-line-without-permission-alleges-activist/article30787103.ece
403,2020/02/11,Call for action against illegal fuel tankers,"The Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO) has requested district authorities in the State to confiscate illegal bowsers that carry large quantities of fuel to client locations. Action on such illegal tankers had been a long-pending demand of petroleum dealers.

Bowsers are tankers that can carry up to 12 kilolitre of fuel and are operated by a section of fuel pump operators to supply fuel to industries and companies that require large quantities of fuel. These do not have any legal sanction and do not confirm to safety norms and have been in existence for over 10 years now.

“They take away a portion of sale of some bunks. They manage to survive by giving discounts and credit to the buyers. But with vehicles costing ₹20 lakh, the salary for the driver and the low commission that dealers get, most times the buyers do not get the proper quantity that they pay for. In the long-term they end up losing to such bowsers,” said a dealer, who preferred to be anonymous.

Another dealer said that oil companies, the police, RTO and even staff in the buyer’s establishments were the reason for the survival of such illegal bowsers. “Last year, the Oil Ministry had officially granted permission for legal bowsers that carry fuel to buyers. Those adhere to fire safety norms and have all the required legal documents. They operate within a certain radius and do not take away the sales volume of other fuel outlets,” he explained.

Fiat to oil companies

Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association president K.P. Murali said that the State office of the PESO, in its order, has advised oil companies to ensure that illegal bowsers are not filled at retail outlets and compliance of petroleum rules are strictly adhered to in respect of loading of bowsers at the retail outlets.

The deputy chief controller of explosives in neighbouring States have also been asked to issue similar letters to district authorities, police and oil majors. “This is a good order and we hope necessary orders would be taken. Since PESO does not have the necessary manpower, the district administration should take steps. It would help regulate the trade,” Mr. Murali added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/call-for-action-against-illegal-fuel-tankers/article30787069.ece

405,2020/02/11,Liberty at the government’s whim,"Fundamental rights, we have been repeatedly been told, do not exist in silos. The values inherent in the rights to equality, freedom of expression and association, and to life and personal liberty are deeply intertwined, with each right deriving meaning from the other. Under this conception, our right to be treated with equal concern demands that we are allowed to speak freely, that our movement is unrestrained, and that any limitation placed on our personal liberty is founded on laws that are just, fair, and reasonable. But, despite the theoretical affirmation of this idea, judicial practice is permeated by cases where some laws are seen as special, as untouched by the rigours of due process. Prime among them, as a recent judgment of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court in Mian Abdul Qayoom v. State of J&K shows us, are laws providing for preventive detention — in this case, the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act of 1978 [PSA].

The background

The petitioner before the court was the 76-year-old Mian Abdul Qayoom, who is the president of the High Court’s Bar Association at Srinagar. He was arrested originally in the lead-up to the Union government’s decision on Article 370 of the Constitution and has since been detained for more than six months in a jail at Agra, with a view, the government says, to “preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order”.

Mr. Qayoom submitted in court that the grounds for his detention were not only indistinct and arbitrary but that the government’s order invoked a brace of first information reports lodged way back in 2008 and 2010, for which he had already faced detention. According to him, the order also made vague references to his purported advocacy of secessionist ideology, without, in fact, specifying clearly whether there was at all any criminal charges placed against him. What is more, the detention, he submitted, did not take into account his rapidly deteriorating health: according to his family, as a report in the Hindustan Times states, Mr. Qayoom not only ails from diabetes and heart problems — with a doctor having advised an open heart surgery just before his detention — but he is also surviving on only one kidney.

The High Court, in its judgment, opened with the now customary panegyric on freedom. The right to personal liberty, wrote Justice Tashi Rabstan, is a “most precious right”. It has been held, he added, to be “transcendental, inalienable and available to a person independent of the Constitution”. And the right is not to be denied “except in accordance with procedures established under law” and that procedure, as held in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India, had to be “just and fair”.

A ‘standalone’ law

A person unacquainted with the workings of our judiciary would hardly be mistaken in thinking that the court, having appealed to the powers of liberty, would then render its findings on whether the detention in question was justified as a matter of both law and fact. But the court here, in what has become an increasingly familiar routine, did no such thing. It instead held that preventive detention laws stand alone, that they are compelled by a “primordial” requirement to maintain order in society. In their absence, the court said, the right to personal liberty would lose all its meaning. And the need for such laws, the judgment added, is so intensely felt that the political executive ought to enjoy complete immunity in deciding when to invoke these powers. “The Court cannot substitute its own satisfaction for that of the authority concerned and decide whether its satisfaction was reasonable or proper,” wrote Justice Rabstan, “or whether in the circumstances of the matter, the person concerned should have been detained or not.” All that judges could do, he said, was to see whether the stated grounds — regardless of whether they are, in fact, credible or not — bear some nexus with the objective of the law.

Guarantees reduced to a trifle

Effectively, therefore, the judgment places liberty at the pleasure of government. It reduces the Constitution’s core guarantees to a trifle. Yet, extraordinary as the verdict appears, a study of the history of the law of preventive detention in India, especially as applied in the State of J&K, would show us that we ought to have little to be surprised about. The ruling, in recognising boundless executive pre-eminence, only gives effect to a long-standing jurisprudence.

In the litany of precedents that the judgment has cited, pride of place is occupied by India’s first big constitutional case, A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras. There, the Supreme Court of India found that Article 21, which guarantees a right to life and personal liberty, does not require the state to follow due process. It was therefore, in the court’s belief, that Article 22 had been incorporated, stipulating a set of procedural parameters for preventive detention laws. And such laws, according to the court, were immunised from the limitations placed on the legislature by other fundamental rights.

The verdict in Gopalan has since been overruled. Not only has the Supreme Court held that the fundamental rights chapter comprises a network of mutually dependant promises but it has also ruled that Article 21 implicitly includes within it a guarantee of substantive due process. In other words, the clause demands that any action or law that limits liberty ought to fair, just, and reasonable, untouched by the caprices of the state.

Executive knows best

In overruling Gopalan, the court’s rationale was simple: the absence of a substantive promise of due process would mean that the political executive is free to use the most whimsical of motives to restrict freedom. Under such a notion, something as arbitrary as a coin toss can act as a substitute for a trial. But yet the apparent burying of the verdict in Gopalan has had little practical consequence. The PSA, which was introduced by the former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Chief Minister Sheikh Abdullah’s government to purportedly keep timber smugglers “out of circulation” allows for detention of up to two years without trial, with extensions made available for the asking.

As Haley Duschinski and Shrimoyee Nandini Ghosh have noted, in permitting detentions based on postulations that are protected from review by courts, the law “establishes a broad jurisdiction of suspicion”. Even the Supreme Court, in Jaya Mala v. Home Secretary, Government of J&K (1982) described the legislation as a “lawless law” and warned of a looming danger in which normal criminal trials would be replaced by regimes of detention. But ever since its enactment, the PSA has served precisely this purpose. It has been used by successive governments to quell even the slightest hint of dissent. And when review of the orders is sought, courts have invariably followed the model that has now been adopted in Mr. Qayoom’s case: an assumption that the executive knows best and that any decision made by it is beyond the scope of judicial enquiry.

The only thing transcendental about this approach is the omnipotent supremacy of the executive. In reducing judicial review to an irrelevance, the judgment, therefore, stands as an antithesis of the Constitution’s basic function. To understand the dangers inherent in vesting unbridled power of this kind, we do not need to see J&K as exemplifying a state of exception. Nor do we need to apprehend that the model employed will likely be adopted in other States. For, as Gopalan’s lawyer, M.K. Nambyar, told the Supreme Court all those years ago: no amount of fine phrasing can disguise the fact that detention without trial is repugnant to the “universal conscience of civilized mankind”.

406,2020/02/11,Bringing cheetahs back,"To truly revive the Indian cheetah population, India should swap a few Asiatic Gir lions for Asiatic Iranian cheetahs. Iran had native wild Asiatic lions in the past before they became extinct locally. It could be a win-win situation for both India and Iran to reclaim a lost animal. This idea was conceived in the past but was not carried out. If all goes well we may see the world’s fastest land animal prowling again on India’s grasslands.

It will be a test case for Madhya Pradesh, which has one of the largest tiger populations; it also has a white tiger safari. Before any cheetah introduction, the prey base has to be reviewed. Importantly, there must be social and environmental impact assessment. Introduction of the cheetah is bound to increase a tourism-based economy.

407,2020/02/11,The dazzlers,"No one would have predicted that Bangladesh, considered minnows, would be roaring all the way to take the U-19 World Cup cricket title, steamrolling superior teams (‘Sport page, “Sensational Tiger Cubs conquer the world”, February 10). It is also gratifying that the victorious Bangladeshi captain not only gracefully congratulated the Indian team but was also bold enough to admit with regret the uncalled for aggressive postures by his team. Such an admission, even a captain of a senior team would hate to make. Maturity of thought at an young age deserves appreciation. Bangladesh should not let go of the victory as a flash in the pan but capitalise on it to build up its senior team. India fought hard to defend a below par score. What ultimately made the difference was India giving away 33 extras, most of them wides, with pacers wayward many times.

And, ironically, instead of winning the confidence and goodwill of the people, the government is striving to assure businessmen of freedoms. Opening Kashmir to investors will no doubt usher in job and industrial opportunities. But there will also be a mad rush to exploit the natural wealth of Kashmir. It is doubtful if the pristine beauty of the area would survive such an onslaught (Page 1, “J&K administration offers investors ‘uninterrupted’ Internet, WiFi access”, February 10).

409,2020/02/11,Make way for India’s first amateur women’s football league,"On a chilly Friday evening, a group of women between 13 and 40 warm up, dribble, and chase a ball to score, at Conscient sports arena in Vasant Kunj. Most of the players are working professionals, students, or homemakers, and are practising for the Kica Women’s Football League, which is the first for amateur women players in India.

“Football was a big part of my life in Vasant Valley school,” says Aneesha Labroo, 28, who started Kica as a sportswear brand exclusively for women three years ago. Aneesha, who started playing football as a 10-year-old, adds that she was a part of the first Delhi state team, going on to play the nationals twice. Later, she went to the U.S. for a university degree, after which she worked in advertising in New York, for four years, losing touch with the sport.

About 10 months ago, Aneesha took up football again. “From playing among just four friends to actually becoming a massive group through social media was an encouragement for us. Gradually, we would play a game every Tuesday and Thursday,” she says.

Prompted by an event she organised that brought beginners and long-time players together, and a football-loving father, she thought of a women’s league. The aim: to ignite the passion to play football, raise fitness and confidence levels, and build team spirit.

Coaching two teams in the Kica league — Pure Fire FC and the Lalit Lionesses — is Swati Rawat, 27, a former India team player and currently a physical education teacher at DPS R. K. Puram. She says women’s football has come a long way since her playing days. “As a 14-year-old, I was the only girl and people used to say ‘girls don’t play football’; the coaches were least interested in coaching a girl.”

It was only coach Naveen Kanwal who paid attention to her talent and coached her individually, leading her to eventually get picked for the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Under-19 championship. Then there were just three girls football teams in Delhi; today, there are 40.

Swati also plays for the Pure Fire FC , while Aneesha plays for Paper Pipe Pirates. “It’s all in the spirit of spreading the popularity of the game,” says Swati. She has a larger pool from which to pick players today, with a number of women’s colleges having their own football teams: Jesus & Mary College (for which she used to play), Lady Shri Ram, Bharati, and Janki Devi Memorial, to name a few.

One of the players in the league’s HFW Warriors, Dana Smith, 16, also plays centre forward in her school’s football team. Originally from England, Dana has been in India for 12 years now, and says the sport has taught her togetherness and has given her the ability to socialise with different age groups. “The love and passion for the sport is amazing to see,” she says .

It’s still an uphill task to convince parents, whose reasons for not encouraging girls to play the sport range from getting ‘tanned’, scarring bruising, to studies ‘suffering’ and bones breaking. Swati tries to overcome these hurdles by playing with the girls and counselling parents. She organises matches between different classes to bump up their competitive skills.

“It took two years to make a good team and now there are 50-60 girls who play football; one represents Delhi,” she says.

The Kica Women’s Football League, season 1 has six teams of seven players each. The women will be playing on a small turf for 50 minutes with a break. Registrations for season two will be announced after the completion of season one.

410,2020/02/11,"Glamour, excitement to come together at Mahalaxmi Racecourse on Feb. 23","The Mahalaxmi Racecourse will host yet another crowd puller after the Indian Derby — the Poonawalla Breeders’ Multi-Million (Gr. 1) (PBMM) — on February 23. The mega event will be staged as part of the Evening Racing Carnival, which is likely to start at 4 p.m. and end at 8.30 p.m. The PBMM will be conducted at 6 p.m. under the floodlights.

“In its 31st year, PBMM has come a long way since its debut in 1990,” Zavaray Poonawalla, chairman, RWITC, told presspersons.

The total stakes for the event would be roughly ₹1.5 crore, and the winner will take home a “handsome purse” along with a trophy, he said. This year, there will be a 'Clash Of Titans' between Indian and foreign jockeys. There will be also a point-based contest for trainers called, the 'Leading Trainer of the Day'.

Zinia Lawyer, marketing head of RWITC, said there will also be the regular ‘free contest of skill’, where racegoers will have to nominate the first four placings of the PBMM. The first prize is a Honda Amaze car while the three other prizes are a scooter, an LED television set and a laptop. Models in ‘top-of-the-line’ outfits and hats provided by Delna Poonawalla will add to the carnival atmosphere, she said.

Besides, the Poonawalla family, which conducts the event, will be giving a ₹50 betting voucher to everyone in the first (public) enclosure, where entry will be free, said N.H.S.Mani, secretary and CEO of RWITC. There will also be free entry for members in the members enclosure, who will receive a free ₹100 voucher. Non-members entering the members enclosure will need to pay ₹100 as entry fee, besides ₹350 for using the phone. They will also receive a free betting voucher of ₹100. There will be also be a 50% discount on popular food items in the first enclosure, he said.

What is PBMM?

The concept of ‘The Breeders Million Race’ evolved in the late 1980s when members of the National Horse Breeding Society of India got together to find ways to boost breeding and horse racing as a sport, which, in India, was lacking in patronage as compared to racing centres around the world.

The NHBSI decided to institute a race on the lines of the Magic Million and the Cartier Million in Australia and Ireland respectively.

The Poonawalla brothers, Cyrus and Zavaray, came forward to conduct this event and agreed to generate ₹1 million for it. The first sponsored Poonawalla Breeders’ Million race ran on March 11, 1990. Also known as the ‘Juvenile Derby’, the race is for three-year-old horses who run over 1,400 metres. It determines the juvenile champion in the country.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/91prl9/article30787462.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMINDIANDERBY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/glamour-excitement-to-come-together-at-mahalaxmi-racecourse-on-feb-23/article30787456.ece
411,2020/02/11,No fun in intimidating reader with jargon: nuclear scientist,"When communicating about science, doing away with jargon is the best approach, said nuclear scientist Dr. A.P. Jayaraman on Monday. He was speaking at an event to discuss trends in science journalism and communication at Mumbai University.

“There is no fun in intimidating the reader with jargon. If you know your subject, you can speak without jargon. The first principle is to try to speak the common man’s language,” Dr. Jayaraman said.

“Scientists are poor communicators. Therefore, communication technology should be taught to scientists and researchers,” said Dr. Jayaraman, who is the chairman of the National Centre for Science Communicators, which had organised the event along with the Mumbai chapter of the Public Relations Society of India. Dr. Jayaraman has been a part of the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, a people’s science movement of Kerala, for the past 55 years.

“More universities should offer science communication as a degree course. Universities and vice chancellors should know that science communication is the field of the future. The field of journalism too should become increasingly absorbent of science journalism,” he said.

Sawpnesh Kumar Malhotra, former head, division of public awareness, Department of Atomic Energy, said the phenomenon of organisational perception management is not new. “Efforts to protect and manage positive images, identities or reputation of organisations can be found in historical accounts of the Roman Catholic Church and the universities of ancient Greece,” he said.

Mr. Malhotra said the public concerns about nuclear power range from its safety, cost, highly radioactive and hazardous nuclear waste. “But nine out of the 17 sustainable goals are touched by atomic energy. People have to be told that atomic energy is needed very badly. Communication is thus crucial.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o84xsx/article30787454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bm-science-event,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-fun-in-intimidating-reader-with-jargon-nuclear-scientist/article30787455.ece
412,2020/02/11,HC reserves judgment in Parachute vs influencer case,"The Bombay High Court on Monday reserved the judgment in an appeal filed by a social media influencer, Abhijeet Bhansali, against an order passed by another HC Bench to pull down a video posted by him on Parachute oil.

Social media influencers are those who have acquired a considerable follower base along with a degree of credibility in their respective space. Depending on the popularity of their field of expertise, their following can range from thousands to millions. These influencers often employ the goodwill they enjoy amongst their followers/viewers to promote a brand, persuade or dissuade viewers from purchasing a product.

Mr. Bhansali, a YouTuber/V Blogger, runs a channel called Bearded Chokra, on which he produces and uploads videos wherein he reviews products of various manufacturers. On September 1, 2018, he published a video, ‘Is Parachute Coconut Oil 100% Pure?’

According to Marico, which manufactures the oil, the video is disparaging and denigrating in nature, and it makes claims about Parachute’s edible oil, which are false and unsubstantiated.

A Division Bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice Bharati Dangre was hearing a commercial appeal filed by Mr. Bhansali against an order passed by a single Bench of Justice S.J. Kathawalla. The order was passed on January 15 directing Mr. Bhansali to take down/remove and/or block/restrict access to the video.

The court had earlier said, “Freedom of speech is considered above reputation even though both are fundamental rights. An opinion based on facts can be never be defamation.” According to it, what a social media influencer says is considered reality in modern world. “If the society trusts influencers, then that trust comes with a moral obligation,” it said.

In the last hearing, the Bench had also said the appeal filed by Mr. Bhansali needed to be entertained as the single judge appears to have laid down a law without laying down the principle. The court on Monday said the single judge had completely missed the point in the case, and reserved its judgment.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hc-reserves-judgment-in-parachute-vs-influencer-case/article30787417.ece
413,2020/02/11,BMC chief assures HC of law department revamp,"Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi told the Bombay High Court on Monday that he is taking measures to revamp the corporation’s law department to reduce cases pending before the courts.

A Division Bench of Justices S.J. Kathawalla and B.G. Colabawalla was hearing a petition filed by one Kabita Jalui on September 27, 2019. She was seeking action from the assistant municipal commissioner, R South ward, to take necessary steps to shut down Amantran Restaurant at Evershine Millennium Paradise at Thakur village, Kandivali East. She also wanted action to be taken against the owner for running the eatery without a licence.

In the previous hearing, the court had said, “When we were made aware that the restaurant is admittedly being run without a licence, at least since 2016, we expressed our concern and enquired from the advocate representing BMC as to what steps have been taken since then to shut down the eating house. The answer was that the restaurant has been shut since the past three months. Since we were not satisfied with the answer, we again enquired as to what steps were taken by the corporation since 2016. The answer given now is that the corporation issued a notice and instituted prosecution against the individuals running the eating house without a licence.”

The court had also said, “That the advocates for the corporation and its officers completely lack sensitivity and are also not equipped to understand the seriousness of such matters is clear from the affidavit filed by the corporation. They have, instead of dealing with the issue of why the restaurant was allowed to run for several years without a licence, stated that they found the restaurant closed during the inspection on January 18, 2020. Neither the corporation nor the Chief Fire Officer have realised the consequences that are invited by such eating houses which run without a licence.”

The Bench had then summoned the BMC chief to be present in court.

On Monday, when the court told Mr. Pardeshi that it has received no assistance from the advocates and officers of the BMC, he assured the court that the number of cases before the court will reduce. He said an IAS officer has been appointed to oversee the revamp and streamlining of the legal department.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/sdjx0n/article30787379.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMPARDESHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-chief-assures-hc-of-law-department-revamp/article30787381.ece
414,2020/02/11,Kurla residents may get respite from flooding,"Residents of Kurla (West), who have endured monsoon flooding for years, can expect some relief with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) trying to prevent the overflow of Vihar lake into Mithi river. The corporation has invited bids for a consultant to conduct a feasibility study. The proposal was mentioned in the BMC budget as well.

Every monsoon, residents of Kranti Nagar, Kismat Nagar, Bail Bazaar and Taximen’s Colony suffer waterlogging as Mithi river swells. The river floods due to heavy rainfall coupled with high tide but another major reason is the excess water from the Powai and Vihar lakes being drained into it. When the lakes are filled to capacity, the excess water goes into the river and eventually into the sea. However, since its width and depth has reduced over the years, the water floods these areas. Sometimes, the water even enters the airport’s runway at Santacruz, hampering operations. Similarly, water comes on to the tracks between Sion and Kurla, bringing Central Railway services to a halt.

Nationalist Congress Party corporator from Kurla, Saida Khan, had written to additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal in 2019 after the Mithi overflowed three times last year. She had demanded that this excess water be diverted into the Airoli creek. The BMC has now invited bids for a feasibility study on diverting the water to the creek or Bhandup Complex water treatment plant. It has made a budget provision of ₹2.69 crore for this work.

“I am happy that the BMC has taken steps based on my proposal. If this water is diverted, it will give relief to the entire area, where thousands of people suffer every monsoon,” Ms. Khan said.

“We can’t control high tide or rain but if we control this excess water, it will be a huge relief. Every monsoon, we have to pay utmost attention to Mithi’s level and if it touches the danger mark, the NDRF is called in and these people shifted. It will prevent flooding at the airport and railway tracks too,” Manish Walunj, assistant municipal commissioner, L ward, said.

If it decides to go ahead with the proposal, the BMC will have to construct drains from Vihar lake to Airoli creek to drain the water.

In the long run, the BMC wants to have a flood mitigation system based on underground reservoirs, shafts, tunnels and piping systems. It has recently got the go-ahead to approach the Japan International Cooperation Agency for technical assistance to assess the feasibility of such measures. The BMC has already held meeting with experts from Japan in Mumbai and has set aside ₹5 crore for the study.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i4n4vn/article30787358.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMFLOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kurla-residents-may-get-respite-from-flooding/article30787359.ece
415,2020/02/11,Committee to look into real estate woes,"The State government has set up a steering committee of Cabinet ministers, which will include senior officials and industry representatives, to review issues concerning the real estate sector following a meeting of industry representatives with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday.

The committee will comprise Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, Urban Development Minister Eknath Shinde, Transport Minister Anil Parab and senior officials besides leading developers such as Niranjan Hiranandani, Rajan Bandlekar, Nayan Shah, Shahid Balwa, Boman Irani, Ajay Ashar, Vinod Goenka, Dominic Rommel and Dilip Thakkar.

In the meeting, the developers’ lobby sought concessions for the sector in the budget, including a 50% cut in stamp duty, which would bring relief to home buyers and help push sales.

A delegation comprising members of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) and Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI) met Mr. Thackeray to demand fiscal concessions for the struggling construction sector. The government in turn brought the developers up to speed with the final plans for a unified Development Control Rule (DCR) for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).

Mr. Thackeray said in a statement the State government was ready to solve developers’ problems, but the developers “need to impose a code of conduct for themselves.” Mr. Thackeray said the developers and State will have to work as team to overcome the crisis that the real estate sector faces. “Developers should help the government realise the dream of providing homes to slum dwellers at a time when a lot of SRA projects were dragging. The ready reckoner rates must also align with the carpet area and the market rates for the cost of housing to rationalise. The developers must help the government in this endeavour,” the CM said.

“The dialogue comprised numerous suggestions on long drawn-out issue of activating SRA (Slum Rehabilitation Authority) projects in accordance with the appropriate rehabilitation of projected affected people, revival of several projects that have come to a halt due the to liquidity squeeze and economic downturn,” said Niranjan Hiranandani, president, NAREDCO.

Emphasis was also laid, he said, on ensuring the quick rollout of new developments “in order to bring in financial soundness by revision of ready reckoner rates,” cess, fungible floor space index charges and duties levied in the sector. “'The industry also put forward a demand to reduce stamp duty by 50%, which will bring in relief to discerning home buyers and help developers to log in sales numbers,” he said.

The committee will closely review the issues and the State has assured industry of quick action, Mr. Hiranandani said.

In June 2019, representatives of two apex associations of leading developers and businesspersons, MCHI-CREDAI and NAREDCO, had met Union Minister for Housing and Urban Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri and Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal in the city demanding concession in taxes at the Central level and a 50% cut in the premium and development charges levied on major construction projects in Maharashtra.

Last year, the Maharashtra government had cleared decks for a slew of fiscal concessions likely to cost the State exchequer about ₹800 crore. While they were approved by the then Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, several of them are yet to be implemented in the absence of a final approval to select provisions of the DCR and a unified DCR for the rest of the MMR. “Today, the government apprised us of the modalities of the unified DCR, which is about to be implemented in the MMR soon,” said a developer who attended the meeting.

Among the concessions cleared last year were promises to slash premiums, including a fee on additional buildable area or floor space index (FSI) for projects. The builders also sought an extension of the package to the MMR, senior officials of the Urban Development Department said.

Among the concessions were, removal of the development cess on the additional FSI component completely. The cess was proposed under Mumbai’s new DCR. The premium charged in the case of residential projects was reduced to 35% from 50% while the commercial charges in the same category were brought down to 40% from 60%.

Senior officials said the premiums on construction of information technology parks, redevelopment of Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority structures too were reduced by 50%. “Some of these need to be included in the State budget,” said a builder.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/i3mi2p/article30787387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/committee-to-look-into-real-estate-woes/article30787354.ece
416,2020/02/11,Winter nears end as mercury climbs steadily,"It seems Mumbai’s love affair with winter is about to come to an end. Monday’s maximum temperature saw a sharp two degree rise from Sunday and minimum temperature at 21.2 degrees Celsius was the highest February minimum since 2016.

The daytime temperature climbed to 35 degrees Celsius, four degrees above normal. The all time record of highest maximum February temperature is of 39.6 degrees Celsius on February 25, 1966. Meanwhile, the highest minimum, in 2016, was 22 degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal.

K.S. Hosalikar, deputy director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday tweeted, “Winter Season packing up in Mah: Max Temp model guidance indicate, temp could rise in Maharashtra in next 4 days. (sic)”

417,2020/02/11,ETC passes for sea link to not be renewed in March,"Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) passes for the Bandra-Worli Sea Link will not be renewed for March, instead motorists will be given FASTags, which had been rolled out on the sea link in January. The Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) aims to increase the adoption of FASTags through the move.

MSRDC officials said around 40,000 vehicles use the sea link on a daily basis and around 52,000 vehicles currently had ETC tags. “Over 90% of the ETC tags are monthly passes, which will be changed to FASTags upon renewal. The remaining work on a reducing balance concept, which will be phased out gradually,” Vijay Waghmare, joint managing director, MSRDC, said.

FASTags were introduced on the sea link on January 26 and MSRDC officials said they have since seen the adoption double. “On an average, around 2,000 vehicles would use ETC on the sea link every day. Over the last two weeks we have seen the number of motorists using ETC or FASTags increase to around 5,000 per day. We expect the number to cross 8,000 by the end of this month,” Mr. Waghmare said.

At present FASTags are operational on the sea link and are yet to be implemented on the five Mumbai entry points. Mr. Waghmare said the toll operator was conducting trials across all entry points and FASTag will be rolled out once they are completed. MSRDC officials said roughly 25% of all vehicles going through the five entry points everyday had ETC tags and would potentially convert to FASTag once the system is rolled out. Dahisar and Vashi toll nakas cater to nearly 80,000 vehicles per day, with half of them passing through in a four-hour period during morning and evening peak hours.

FASTag was first rolled out on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and National Highway 8 in the State in December 2018. The earnings from non-cash toll collection has since increased from around ₹30 lakh per day in November to roughly ₹1 crore in February, MSRDC officials said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/auop00/article30787314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMSEALINK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/etc-passes-for-sea-link-to-not-be-renewed-in-march/article30787316.ece
418,2020/02/11,Accident victim gives life to five people through organ donation,"In death, a 25-year-old man from Raigad district gave a new lease of life to five critically ill patients on Sunday. Mahesh Yerunkar, who was severely injured in a road accident in Mangaon, was brought all the way to JJ Hospital in Byculla, where doctors declared him brain-dead. The noble gesture by Yerunkar’s family marks the 11th organ donation in Mumbai this year. It is also the second in a public hospital.

While one of the donor’s kidneys was transplanted to a patient in JJ Hospital, the other was transplanted to a patient admitted to Wockhardt Hospital in Mira Road. His heart was transplanted to a patient in Jaslok Hospital and his liver was given in two parts to patients at Apollo and Jupiter Hospitals.

Yerunkar, who was known for his helpful nature, looked after his family’s car washing business. On Thursday, he was returning home after attending his grandfather’s death anniversary rituals when a car rammed into his motorcycle near Mugavali Phata on Mumbai-Goa highway.

“Due to the construction work to bypass Mangaon, a pillar has come up near Mugavali Phata which has become a blind spot for drivers. Two other fatal accidents were reported at the same spot in the past,” his cousin, Vishal, said.

The accident occurred around 1 a.m. on February 6. Yerunkar, who had severe multiple injuries, was first rushed to the district hospital where his head was bandaged and leg was plastered.

‘Lack of facilities’

“There was no CT scan or MRI there. The doctors advised us to take him to a better-equipped facility. We then rushed him to DY Patil Hospital in Navi Mumbai but they refused to admit him as there were no ventilators available. We then took him to another hospital in Vashi where we were turned away once again for the same reason. Eventually, we had to bring him to JJ Hospital,” Vishal said.

Yerunkar reached JJ Hospital, which is over 150 km away from Mangaon, at 7.30 a.m. on Thursday in an unconscious condition. He was immediately put on a ventilator. His condition however remained critical and doctors declared him brain-dead on Saturday.

“He would go out of his way to help others. His father thus agreed to donated his organs,” Vishal said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/j7k651/article30787252.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bmJj-hosp-docs,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/accident-victim-gives-life-to-five-people-through-organ-donation/article30787254.ece
419,2020/02/11,Fake currency racket: three past trips by courier under scanner,"The 36-year-old man arrested on Sunday with high quality counterfeit currency worth nearly ₹24 lakh has made at least three prior trips abroad over the last six months, which are now under the scanner of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch.

Javed Sheikh, a resident of Kalwa, was intercepted at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport on Sunday after he landed from Dubai. A search of his baggage revealed counterfeit notes of ₹2,000 denomination hidden in the lining of his bag, which had even passed the Customs check.

“Mr. Sheikh had been to Dubai once before and to Bangkok twice during the last six months. We are checking the purpose of these trips. The ease with which he was able to pass through Customs indicates that Sunday was not the first time he had ferried counterfeit currency,” a senior Crime Branch officer said.

The officer said Mr. Sheikh’s call detail records corresponding to his three trips are being obtained to check who he met or spoke to immediately after landing. “We suspect the involvement of several more players on the India end of the racket,” the officer said.

The Crime Branch is working with Central intelligence agencies for information on the overseas end of the racket. The police suspect Dubai and Bangkok are just pit stops, and the currency originates from Pakistan.

If the samples of the notes sent to the Currency Note Press in Nashik are certified as “high quality”, the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act will be invoked in the case, officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fake-currency-racket-three-past-trips-by-courier-under-scanner/article30787213.ece
420,2020/02/11,PMC depositors start two-day agitation at Azad Maidan,"Around 20 depositors of the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank kicked off a two-day sit-in on Monday, gathering at Azad Maidan from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.

In September last year, the Reserve Bank of India placed restrictions on PMC Bank after a multi-crore-rupee fraud came to light. The Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police filed an FIR against bank officials and employees for allegedly advancing unsecured loans to the HDIL Group, causing losses amounting to over ₹6,500 crore. The EOW has filed two charge sheets in the case so far.

Monday’s protest was aimed at the RBI over the difficulties faced by the depositors in getting their money back. The depositors were seen holding banners saying: “Thanks for doing your job so well Reserve Bank of India, we literally lost all our life savings,” and, “Get well soon RBI.”

According to the depositors, they have not received all their money yet, even though it has been over four months since the investigation began. Depositors said they have received only ₹50,000, while senior citizens have received ₹1,00,000 since September.

Chandrashekhar Chittrapu (69) said, “What is more painful is that the RBI is partly responsible because on several earlier occasions, it gave a clean chit to the PMC in its audit. How many of us actually look into technical terms like liquidity, asset base before entrusting a bank with our savings? By its very definition, a bank stands for trust and as an underlying security of assets.”

Another depositor, Madhavi Thakur, said ₹50,000 is not enough to sustain a family or even live individually, and one also has to bear costs, such as in health emergencies.

Manjula Kotiyal, another protester, said they have to pay fees for their children’s education, and each of them has lakhs of rupees as savings in the bank. “We met Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur in Delhi to communicate our grievances in December last year. He had promised us that he will try and help us. However, in Parliament, he said it was the State government’s lookout.

421,2020/02/11,More’s driver files case against girl’s family for staged abduction,"The driver of suspended Deputy Inspector General (Motor Transport) Nishikant More has filed a complaint of criminal conspiracy against a minor girl and her family — who have accused the police officer of molestation — for allegedly staging a kidnapping in December.

The complainant, Rakesh Gaikwad, has said that while he was on duty, the girl’s family harassed him and pulled him by the shirt collar, falsely accusing him of kidnapping the girl.

According to the complaint filed on February 6, the incident occurred in Kharghar around 9.30 p.m. on December 21 when Mr. Gaikwad was waiting in the police vehicle near Pacific building at Utsav Chowk. Mr. More and his wife had gone to visit a doctor nearby. The girl’s father, brother and other people surrounded him and started questioning him about her. The brother pulled him out by his collar, the complaint said.

‘No kidnapping’

Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone II, Ashok Dudhe, said, “We have CCTV and call record evidence that shows that there was no kidnapping.”

According to a police source, the girl and her mother were hiding inside a washroom in Pacific building. The girl called the police control room claiming that she had been kidnapped, but before and after making the call, she had called her father as well.

“No one has been arrested in this case. We have served the family members with a notice to present themselves before us,” inspector Mahesh Patil from Kharghar police station said.

The case has been registered against the girl’s parents, brother, an unidentified person, and her friend Ankit Singh, who was arrested in a separate case for kidnapping and raping the girl in January.

They have been booked for criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting, defamation and assaulting a public servant under the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 3 (penalty for causing disaffection) and 4 (saving of acts done by police associations and other persons for certain offences) of the Police (Incitement to Disaffection) Act, 1922.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mores-driver-files-case-against-girls-family-for-staged-abduction/article30787129.ece
422,2020/02/11,25-year-old caught at Wadala while pasting posters of godman in train,"A man was caught red-handed while putting up posters of a godman by a special team of the Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Monday.

The culprit, Sabbir Sheikh (25), was pasting posters of a ‘Baba Guru Hussain’ at 5 a.m. on board a train at Wadala Road station, which was travelling from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to Bandra. “On receiving information from a source, constables Ganga Sagar, Ratanlal Meena and Manoj Meena dressed up as civilians and boarded the train to find the man putting up these posters,” Maheshchandra Joshi, inspector, Kurla car shed, said.

The accused was then taken to court where 13 cases were filed against him, including two pending cases from 2019. He was imposed a fine of ₹2,300 per case that came to a total of ₹29,900, and was allowed to leave after paying the money. He had also pasted posters of other babas such as ‘Baba Jaid Khan’ in the past, RPF officials said.

K.K. Ashraf, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, Mumbai Division, Central Railway, said they had set up teams as they had been receiving complaints about the rising incidents of posters being pasted on local trains. The RPF has been cracking down on the posters especially of self-proclaimed godmen as it amounts to defacing railway property and is also punishable under the anti-superstition Act.

RPF officials said they did not have jurisdiction over the latter and hence charged the accused under Section 166 of the Railways Act.

Mr. Joshi said Mr. Sheikh confessed that the posters were mostly put up in the Harbour Line and the Western Line as these had lesser police arrangements than the Central Line, and was paid ₹300 per night for the job. The RPF has been taking steps to curb the poster menace in Mumbai local trains for the past few years. In 2019, the RPF had registered 240 cases and jailed 50 people for defacing railway property. The number of cases has been reducing as it stood at 509 in 2018 and 1,580 in 2017.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h6u8i9/article30787144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11bmTrain-poster,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/25-year-old-caught-at-wadala-while-pasting-posters-of-godman-in-train/article30787095.ece

They also said in the new contract, in addition to distributing linen, workers had to undertake housekeeping duties of the coach and that the new contractor was hence asking them to do two jobs for the same pay.

424,2020/02/11,State hikes reward to stop liquor smuggling,"The State government has decided to increase the reward money offered to informers for providing intelligence on the trade of illicit liquor and its smuggling across the State’s borders.

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday reviewed the work of the Excise Department and directed that the reward amount for informers be increased from 2% to 5% of the worth of the seizure, an increase of nearly 150%. The meeting was attended by senior secretaries including those from the Planning and Finance departments.

By hiking the reward money, the State hopes to strengthen the network of informers and curb liquor smuggling, officials said. Mr. Pawar informed the officials that trade in illicit liquor and its smuggling was causing huge revenue loss to the State and asked the department to increase the number of checkpoints as well as inspections. Mr. Pawar also said there is need to think seriously on curbing deaths from the consumption of spurious liquour.

“He gave us directions to carry out strict inspections under the watch of senior officials. The Deputy Chief Minister also expressed the need to think seriously about preventing death from poisonous hooch,” said an official of the Excise Department.

425,2020/02/11,CM assures speedy justice in Hinganghat case,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has assured speedy justice to the family of the 24-year-old woman lecturer from Hinganghat in Wardha district, who succumbed to burn injuries on Monday morning after being set ablaze by a stalker last week.

Addressing mediapersons, Mr. Thackeray expressed grief over the woman’s death. He said, “No words are enough to describe the horrors of this incident. I appeal to people to be patient. The government will ensure that the accused is punished for murder. Such criminals have no mercy in Maharashtra, he should get the strictest punishment.”

He added, “We are following up to ensure that the trial and its judgment are completed speedily. Maharashtra is a progressive State that respects women and anything that breaches this image will not be tolerated.”

Mr. Thackeray said his government will study the Disha Act, enacted recently by the Andhra Pradesh government, and try to make laws stricter to prevent such incidents. The Disha Act mandates completion of investigation into cases of sexual offences within seven working days from the time of record, and trial within 14 working days from the date of filing the charge sheet.

Mr. Thackeray said, “We will see what the law is and Maharashtra will improve it to ensure that nobody dares to do such a thing again. All departments will work in co-ordination with each other.”

The victim, Ankita Pisudde, had been critical after sustaining burns on February 3 when she was set afire allegedly by Vikesh Nagrale (27) while she was on the way to her college. “She was undergoing treatment at Orange City Hospital & Research Centre in Nagpur, where doctors declared her dead at 6.55 a.m.,” Hinganghat’s police inspector Satyaveer Bandiwar said.

Later, some angry locals threw stones to block a road in Hinganghat when an ambulance carrying the woman’s body was about half-a-kilometre away from her native village, Daroda. The police then brought the situation under control.

Strong reactions

The news of the victim’s death led to strong political reactions from across the State. Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari tweeted, “I am deeply saddened to know about the demise of the young woman lecturer from Hinganghat who lost her battle to death.The entire society is agitated today. The unfortunate incident has compelled each one of us to introspect. Today women are progressing in all walks of life. They are assuming newer responsibilities and tackling challenges efficiently. In order to further hasten the progress of women, society must bear a positive attitude towards them. My heartfelt condolences to her parents.”

State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said the trial would be held in a fast-track court and a family member of the victim would be given a government job.

Water Resources Minister Jayant Patil tweeted, “The accused will be given a strong punishment. The mentality behind this heinous crime needs to be tackled. That is why it is important to fast track this case.”

Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said to ensure that such an incident does not happen again, “the government will be more sensitive and take a tough stance in such cases”. Congress Minister Ashok Chavan said on Twitter, “Criminals should have fear of the law. There are laws but their implementation is necessary. If the criminal is brought to justice immediately and given punishment like death sentence, it will instill people’s faith on the justice system.”

Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis tweeted, “The criminal should be given the strictest punishment so that no woman has to go through this again.”

Ujjwal Nikam named SPP

The State government on Monday appointed senior lawyer Ujjwal Nikam as the special public prosecutor (SPP) in the Hinganghat case.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray made the announcement on Monday. Mr. Nikam was the prosecution’s main lawyer in the State’s case against 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab.

426,2020/02/11,HC pulls up State for lack of action in tribal welfare scam,"The Bombay High Court once again expressed displeasure towards the State government for not taking action against 123 officers who allegedly misappropriated funds allotted for the welfare of the State’s Scheduled Tribes.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing four public interest litigations (PIL) filed in 2012, of which one was filed by Bahiram Motiram, an Adivasi from Nashik.

The PILs had alleged that various schemes by the State government as well as by the Central government for the benefit of the Scheduled Tribes do not reach them and huge amounts have been siphoned off and misappropriated.

The PILs also state that the budgetary provision of 9% is yet to be made in the yearly budget for tribal development and the State is yet to establish 24 project offices in tribal areas to implement the schemes.

In the previous hearing, Manisha Verma, Principal Secretary of the Tribal Development Department (TDD), filed an affidavit that read, “No official of TDD has been arrested and placed under police custody for more than 48 hours, and hence the question of suspending any official of TDD does not arise.” The 14-page affidavit also mentioned, “None of the officials who were officiating the posts where irregularities have taken place are currently working in the same posts.”

After reading the affidavit, the High Court said, “All this is just an eyewash. Does the Principal Secretary seriously want us to accept such an affidavit where she is saying that she is unable to get information from the police. The State government is shielding and protecting the prima facie guilty officials. Political parties at the helm of affairs are changing but they will still protect their fraternity.”

On Monday, the court directed the State to file an affidavit with details of the number of accused arrested, FIRs registered, applications for bail, charge sheets filed, officials framed with charges, and those who have filed for discharge.

427,2020/02/11,BJP seeks honour for Savarkar to upset MVA,"In a bid to cause friction among the alliance partners of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has moved a proposal to introduce a resolution in the budget session of the Assembly to honour Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar with the Bharat Ratna.

The BJP plans to introduce the resolution on February 26, Savarkar’s death anniversary. The Shiv Sena, however, said only a resolution congratulating the Central government would be passed if Savarkar is indeed awarded the Bharat Ratna.

Playing it safe

Transport Minister and Sena leader Anil Parab said his party’s demand to honour Savarkar with the Bharat Ratna has been pending for years. “We will bring a resolution congratulating the Central government if Savarkar is awarded the Bharat Ratna,” he said.

The proposal was moved by Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and former finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar at a Business Advisory Committee meeting held at the Vidhan Bhavan on Monday. The meeting was convened to finalise the schedule of the budget session, which will begin on February 24. The State budget is scheduled to be presented on March 6.

Mr. Mungantiwar said the BJP has proposed to introduce a resolution to honour the revolutionary work of Savarkar. He said, “February 26 is the death anniversary of Swatantryaveer Savarkar. We want the State Assembly to honour one of the greatest freedom fighters of India by passing a resolution. We have made a proposal for the purpose.”

Mr. Mungantiwar said the response from the government, especially Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, has not been encouraging as it has not supported the introduction of the resolution.

According to sources, the BJP’s move is aimed at causing a rift in the MVA alliance as the Sena, the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party are in disagreement over Savarkar’s Hindutva politics and his letters to the British government seeking clemency while being imprisoned at the Cellular Jail in Andaman and Nicobar Islands.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ukvtow/article30786554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMSAVARKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bjp-seeks-honour-for-savarkar-to-upset-mva/article30786555.ece
428,2020/02/11,Sour House in Bengaluru specialises in naturally fermented products,"After following the much-charted path of studying engineering and then heading to the US for his Masters, Selvan Thandapani worked several different jobs. But the 36-year-old always knew he wanted to do something using his hands.

He tried carpentry and roasting coffee beans. Then, while living in Chennai he discovered an interest in baking. “I started making regular yeasted bread. But I was finding it very difficult to get good yeast. Someone randomly mentioned sourdough. I had lived in the US and my wife is British but I didn’t know much about sourdough at that point. I realised that you could actually grow your own sourdough starter. So, I slowly started learning about it just by watching YouTube videos and so on. I did that for almost a year and then got to a point where I was really interested in it and thought maybe it has a business angle to it,” he smiles.

After the couple moved to Bengaluru in 2016, during which time Selvan was working as a design consultant, things clicked. “I started baking a loaf of bread every week. My workplace lets me do it part time so I was working for three days and baking for three. This helped me stretch the concept and see if there was a market demand for fermented products.”

When it became clear that there was, in fact, a demand, Selvan started Sour House in March 2018, moving to the present space in Koramangala in January 2019 where he has three people working under him.

On the menu are five sourdough breads — seeded, whole wheat sour, dark, sour, olive — as well as baguettes. Apart from kimchi and hung curd, there are drinks such as kombucha, which comes in three flavours, as well as kefir water and milk kefir. Sour House also make special loaves from time to time such as a beetroot sour loaf topped with sesame seeds.

Talking about why people should try sourdough, Selvan says, “One, it is completely different to a regular loaf of bread. If you like bread, you should try it at least once because it has so much flavour and texture. Two, there are health benefits. It’s a prebiotic unlike something like kombucha which is a probiotic. Once you consume it, it’s good for your gut.”

Selvan will even help you make your own sourdough bread through workshops conducted once or twice a month. “No prior baking experience is required,” he assures.

While the present space has the capacity to bake 120 loaves, Selvan says that they will be shifting to a bigger space opposite the Koramangala Police Station in a week where they will be able to bake 200 plus breads in a day. “We want to do pastry and maybe sandwiches. The plan is to have a space where people can come sit down and enjoy the experience. It will be immersive; they can hang out and see what we do,”

Prices of the breads start at ₹150 for baguette and go up to ₹220 for a loaf. Place orders 24 hours prior. The products are available at select Nature’s Basket and Blue Tokai outlets.

429,2020/02/11,Touring Telangana's indigenous food identity,"When Mumbai-born Garima Arora, the first Indian female chef — awarded a Michelin star for her restaurant Gaa in Bangkok, voted Asia’s Best Female Chef by Asia’s 50 Best in 2019 — landed in Telangana with her Food Forward India team, they knew exactly what they wanted.

Taste food. Visit places. Learn about food and all that for sure. However, instead of going star hotel hopping and following a traveller’s guide to eat in Telangana, they went deep into rural Telangana, hunting for toddy, looking for dishes that tribal people prepare, sampled Deccan home cooked meals and sipped Irani chai with a several rounds of Osmania biscuits, puffs and what not. The team wasn’t here to simply take notes on recipes. In fact none of them did. Nor were they interested in packing ingredients or wanting to know what can be used as a substitute to toddy in the toddy chicken. “If toddy chicken needs toddy, there can be no other way of cooking it. There is no need to substitute it. This journey into the heartland of Telangana where toddy tappers opened their homes to us was an overwhelming experience. It is steeped in a culture and tradition which many of us don’t know. For me regional and traditional food is more than what is served to eat. It is a way of life that has been going on for generations,” said Garima.

In line with her vision, Food Forward India (FFI) will rediscover the narrative around the food of India at home and bring it to the attention of international gastronomy and change stereotypical views.

Why Telangana? The idea was to capture the food identity of Telangana, the youngest state. In the process, FFI wants to uncover Telangana’s gastronomic uniqueness.

The focus of FFI is to start a dialogue of foods and ingredients that have been shunned either because it is not presentable in a five-star set up or because we don’t want to discuss it. Garima strongly believes that no food should be laughed at. Her Michelin star chef status notwithstanding, she is like a student of food, such is the rapt attention with which she listens to details, putting each of the hosts feel at ease.

Apart from sampling toddy at a village near Medak and learning the traditional art of serving it, the team also visited the unit of Sai Bhaskar Reddy whose research work and achievements include designing 50 good stoves. “Visiting the Chenchu tribals and getting a taste of their food was something I experienced for the first time. It made me emotional to hear their stories of food. There is so much knowledge and care in what they prepare and consume, yet we look outwards to learn about healthy food,” adds Garima.

Towards the end of FFI’s research trip, there was a session of Urban Adda, complete with presentations and discussions exploring Telangana on tribal, rural and urban levels around some key ingredients, in a storytelling and inclusive dialogue format.

Among the speakers Aparna Pallavi who spoke about her research on Mahua followed by a quick recipe demonstration. Then Sai Bhasker Reddy shared his stove journey which followed eating fresh bajjis by Lakshmi made on a stove modelled on his innovation. As Lakshmi was the first person who agreed to use the stove designed by Sai Bhaskar, he named the stove model after her. Then there was a talk about millets by ‘Millet Sisters’ of Deccan Development Society. Babu Rao of Niloufer Cafe shared his journey over cups and cups of irani chai. Another speaker spoke about introducing traditional eating habits to the present generation to preserve the habits.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ctdj5u/article30789973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym111garima,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/food-forward-india-garima-arora-gaa-first-indian-female-chef-awarded-michelin-star/article30789981.ece

433,2020/02/11,Staying afloat,"The story so far: After a to-do it was decided that Sarojini (the author’s grandma) and her cousins could go to school.

It was a memorable day when grandma and her cousins went to school. All of them lived in their grandfather’s house, as most people did in those days. Grandma’s youngest uncle escorted them followed by a giggling maid who carried their “tiffin” and a mud pitcher of drinking water. The girls wore their best clothes and a lot of jewellery.

“The missionary-mem should not think you come from a good-for-nothing family,” said grandma’s grandma.

“But we’re going there to study,” protested grandma.

“You are not going to school looking like beggars!”

Love at first sight

Sarojini loved school from the word go. She found it exciting to write the alphabet on the slate given by her English teacher, intrigued when making tiny stitches on a white cloth. She loved the stories, especially about a man called Noah and his ark. The teacher’s Bengali accent was strange and she had a funny way of saying things. Grandma and the others broke into giggles every now and then. School got over too soon!

But there was another treat waiting for them. The river! Out of bounds till now, but now they had to bathe there before going home. The maids who accompanied the girls sat outside the school with towels and a change of clothes. Grandma did not know to swim, but the others did.

“Phuli, you’ll teach me how to swim, won’t you?” pleaded grandma, as Phuli was the acknowledged champion.

“Not a chance! I’m not having your grandma coming down on me like a ton of bricks!” said Phuli.

“What will you hold on to?” a cousin asked. “We used the stem of a banana tree when we learnt.”

Grandma was about to burst into tears when another cousin said, “You can hold on to my shoulder. It’s easy!”

The girls jumped into the river. The water was crystal clear and they could see the pebbles at the bottom.

“Don’t you get into the deep water,” cried the maids.

“Do shut up!” said everyone.

A few days of getting ducked and grandma managed to stay afloat. And then came the final triumph — Grandma was actually swimming!

434,2020/02/11,Prey to a curse,"Garuda is the son of Vinata, a wife of Sage Kashyapa. Here is the story of his birth.

Sage Kashyapa once granted two of his wives: Kadru and Vinata, a boon each. Kadru asked for 1,000 sons while Vinata wanted two who would be more powerful than all of Kadru’s put together.

So, the sage held a yagna and invited the Valakhila rishis to conduct it. He asked another of his sons, Indra, king of the devas, to get him wood of a special tree for the ceremony. Now, Valakhila rishis were short and Indra watched them tottering with a small log, stumble and fall. Indra laughed and flew on with the wood for the yagna. The rishis were angry and decided to create a new king of gods at the yagna. A chastened Indra ran to his father and confessed. Though angry, Kashyapa pleaded with the rishis not to change the order established by Lord Brahma. Finally, the rishis agreed and said they would instead create a king of birds.

The yagna produced 1000 eggs for Kadru and two for Vinata. These eggs were kept in warm jars. Kadru’s eggs hatched first. Her offspring were snakes. Vinata became impatient.

Impatience

One day, unable to wait any longer, she broke open one of her eggs. To her horror out came a half-formed child with a perfect upper torso and nothing below. “Your impatience and jealousy has caused this,” it accused her. “For this, you will be another’s slave. If you are patient, my brother will release you.” And the child flew away to become Aruna, the charioteer of Surya, the sun god.

One day, Vinata and Kadru were walking in the garden when they saw a white horse fly across the sky. “Look,” said Kadru, “it is Uchchaishravas, the flying horse.” As they spoke, a quarrel broke out among them. Kadru said the horse’s tail was black while Vinata said it was white. They decided to swim across the ocean to take a look and whoever was wrong, would be the other person’s slave. After making the bet, Kadru began to have doubts. So, she ordered her sons to cover the horse’s tail and make it black. After threats and some persuasion the snakes agreed and Kadru won her bet. Aruna’s curse came true and Vinata became a slave.

Next time, we will see how she is rescued.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/37xj38/article30789968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14YTMYTHjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/prey-to-a-curse/article30789969.ece
435,2020/02/11,Virus alert!,"So, last week the PB came home crying. Big time. This is not normal, because it’s usually the PB making someone else cry i.e, ME!

Apparently, someone on the school bus saw him sneeze a couple of times and told him he had coronavirus.

In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last couple of weeks, coronavirus is a new strain of a virus that has been reported in a place called Wuhan in China. It’s a zoonotic virus, that means, it can pass from animals to people, and people across the world are kind of freaking out about it. Cities are under lockdown, people are being advised not to travel to certain places, and doctors are trying to find a way to treat this new strain of the virus.

Batty as ever

Now, in the middle of all this chaos, there are all sorts of crazy stories and rumours doing the rounds. So, this kid told MY brother a bunch of untrue things about the virus. Like he was going to grow webbed bat wings because of the virus, and become nocturnal. He also told him that since he had coronavirus, he would have to go and live in Wuhan and that if he wanted to cure himself, he should drink herbs mixed with bat blood!

So, of course, the PB came home crying, asked where his passport was, and told Appa to book him a ticket to Wuhan. He also thought he would need to learn to sleep upside down because he was becoming a bat! If I wasn’t such an amazing brother, I would have milked this for all it was worth and given the PB a batman outfit (gettit) and told him to practise for his new nocturnal life. But I’m a good bro. I went to the World Health Organisation website and read out a whole bunch of news and information to him.

Guys, in times like this, it’s important not to let people pass on fake news. That could be your friends, your relatives (uncles and aunties forwarding things on WhatsApp groups) or the kid next to you on the schools bus. When someone tells you something, DON’T just accept it as the truth. Verify it on a proper information site or ask your parents to. Don’t believe everything you read on Facebook.

Now, since I’m not THAT nice a brother, I’m going to put the Batman mask on PB while he sleeps.

The concert will feature Vikku Vinayakram, Grammy award-winning Carnatic percussionist, on ghatam and his grandson S. Swaminathan on kanjira, who will play with Nadaka, Aurovilian musician of international repute.

According to a press note from Auroville, the baithak will be an impromptu concert, a completely improvised session, where the guest artists arrive on the day of the performance and perform together the same evening.

Mr. Vinayakram, Grammy award-winning Carnatic percussionist, has had early trysts with international music platforms when he joined fusion band Shakti to play alongside John McLaughlin and Zakir Hussain in the 1970s. He has also collaborated with The Grateful Dead’s drummer, Mickey Hart, on the Planet Drum project.

Mr. Vinayakram, who accompanied the legendary M.S. Subbulakshmi at the UN headquarters in New York, has also teamed up with musicians such as Balamurali Krishna, Bhimsen Joshi, and Hariprasad Chaurasia among others.

“I remain grateful to have been able to share the stage with such incredible musicians in those early days of Indian fusion music and, I am proud to perform once again with my old friend and mentor, Vikku ji in Auroville”, said Mr. Nadaka.

440,2020/02/11,Puducherry MLAs stage walkout from Smart City review meeting,"Legislators belonging to the ruling Congress and its ally, the DMK and the opposition AIADMK on Tuesday caused a flutter at a review meeting chaired by Puducherry Local Administration Department Minister A. Namassivayam to review the progress of works being implemented under the Smart City programme.

As soon as the meeting commenced at the Chief Secretariat, DMK legislator R. Siva and Congress legislator K. Lakshminarayanan sought to know the progress made under the Smart City project. Mr. Siva charged that the project remained only on paper and there was no implementation of any scheme for the last two years while many States, according to him, had made impressive progress under the project. ​

​MLAs A. Anbalagan and A. Baskar (both AIADMK) and T. Djeamourthy (Congress) joined them and took objection to the Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar who is also the Chairman of Puducherry Smart City Development Limited (PSCDL) being absent at the meeting.​

​Congress legislator K. Lakshminarayanan contended that it wrong on the part of the authorities to hold the meeting when the Chief Secretary was not present. During his absence, any decisions taken by the meeting would not have any sanction. All the files relating to Smart City were being perused by the Chief Secretary and hence holding the meeting was not proper, he argued. ​

​The MLAs then staged a walkout from the meeting. ​

​Later talking to reporters, Mr. Anbalagan said that the Smart City project had been envisaged at an outlay of ₹2,000 crore and the Centre had already released ₹200 crore. But the Puducherry Government had not released any funds for the project. He said that the government was drawing up a plan to cover the assembly constituencies held by the ruling Congress and ignoring the opposition segments while implementing the projects. ​",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/o0df7m/article30790842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11FEBTH--WALKOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/puducherry-mlas-stage-walkout-from-smart-city-review-meeting/article30790843.ece
441,2020/02/11,Bird sanctuary proposal for Kaliveli yet to take off,"It is peak birding season at Kaliveli wetlands, the second-largest brackish water lake in South India after Pulicat lake, with thousands of migratory birds descending during the season. But the long-pending demand for a bird sanctuary in Kaliveli, a wetland area in Villupuram district with rich biodiversity, is yet to become a reality.

Though the place is home to a diverse species of flora and fauna it has neither received its due attention nor gained popularity in spite of initiatives by the Forest Department, claim conservationists who have been pitching to declare it a bird sanctuary. Spread over 670 sq km of catchment area, the demand for a bird sanctuary was first made in 2010 when migratory birds started flocking to the wetlands in large numbers.

K. Raman, founder of Puducherry-based Indigenous Biodiversity Foundation (IBF) and S. Vimalraj, a naturalist have recorded sightings of rare migratory birds including the Booted Eagle, Greater Spotted Eagle, Pallid Harrier, Western Mash Harrier, Temminck’s Stint, Ruff, Ruddy Turnerstone, Pied Avocet, Terek Sandpiper, Marsh Sandpiper, Eurasian Wigeon and Garganey in the wetlands.

“The presence of the Golden Jackal and Jungle Cat were also found in different areas in Kaliveli pointing to their widespread distribution in a study conducted by IBF recently. Earlier, birds such as the Grey Pelican used to nest, roost and feed here. But their natural habitats have been disturbed and proliferation of shrimp farms is a major disturbance. There is an urgent need for the government to act and protect this wetland to ensure that it remains a safe haven for its diverse flora and fauna,” Mr. Raman said.

Though Kaliveli meets several designation criteria such as being a representative example of a natural or near-natural wetland type found within India, it failed to make to the list of sites recently announced under the Ramsar convention.

According to Raphael Mathevet, Head of Ecology Department, French Institute of Pondicherry (IFP), “Unlike Kaliveli, the newly designated sites of international importance for waterbirds in January have the status of a bird sanctuary. The wetlands, which is incontestably one of the main wetlands of the Coromandal coast, is not yet officially a bird sanctuary although everything is ready at the level of authorities in Villupuram and Tamil Nadu.”

The government should ensure the conservation of the ecological characteristics of the site. Today it is important first to preserve the incredible high value and beauty of the local scenery and the temporary-flooded grassland and its lake, which largely remains pristine as a wild landscape could be, he said.

There is a need to undertake ecological restoration of abandoned aquaculture ponds located on public lands in order to bring back the ecological function of these areas and to create well designed nesting areas for the avifauna, Mr. Mathevet said.

According to 2004 assessment of IBCN and Bird Life International, Kaliveli supports more than 20,000 birds every year. The lake has been a feeding ground for long distance migrants from the cold subarctic regions of Central Asia and Siberia including Black-tailed Godwits, Eurasian Curlew, White Stork, Ruff and Dunlin.

According to Abhishek Tomar, District Forest Officer, Villupuram, “The Forest department has prepared a detailed proposal and submitted it to the Government. The government had raised some queries on the survey numbers and it was rectified and sent back one-and-a-half months back. The government is now looking into it and the proposal is under their active consideration.”

Officials are hopeful of getting the necessary approval from the government and a formal announcement on notifying the wetlands as a sanctuary is expected this year.

The government has already sanctioned ₹60 crore for construction of a check dam to prevent the intrusion of sea water and waste water from shrimp farms into the wetlands. The Forest department has also initiated steps for creation of nesting sites for migratory birds, an official said.

Conservationists say that Kaliveli is one of the places that should be declared as a bird sanctuary, as this is a major wetland on the East coast. The declaration of a sanctuary may take time and it is for the government to speed up the proposal.

According to Ratheesh Narayanan, a wildlife researcher of IBF, “The announcement of Kaliveli as a bird sanctuary will protect, propagate and develop its surrounding environment. It will give the bird species that are endangered or close to extinction a chance to revive. Poaching, encroachments and illegal farming in the protected area will be controlled and ecological tourism will benefit the locals.”",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/88hywr/article30790278.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11FEBTH--KALIVELI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/bird-sanctuary-proposal-for-kaliveli-yet-to-take-off/article30790279.ece

443,2020/02/11,Meet discusses challenges in treating epilepsy,"Jipmer hosted various programmes in connection with International Epilepsy Day to highlight the challenges posed by one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide affecting more than 65 million people, which is about 1 in 100 persons.

According to Jipmer, worse still, more than 70% of people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get proper treatment.

The cause is unknown in 6 out of 10 persons with epilepsy but among the remaining, it may be related to brain damage sustained from birth injury, road traffic accidents, and infections like neurocysticercosis and tuberculosis or stroke or due to brain tumours.

The Department of Neurology, Jipmer, held an interactive health education programme, a Continuing Medical Education (CME) programme, a quiz competition for medical students and a radio health educational talk, a press note said.

Rakesh Aggarwal, Jipmer Director, inaugurated the CME.

P. Sathishchandra, former Director and Vice-Chancellor, Nimhans, who has served as the president of the Indian Academy of Neurology (IAN) and the Indian Epilepsy Society (IES), spoke on the on the topic ‘Hot Water Epilepsy’.

Dhanaraj M., former head, Neurology, Stanley Medical College, Chennai, K Malcolm Jayaraj, senior assistant professor, Neurology, Stanley Medical College, Chennai and Lakshminarayanan K., paediatric neurologist and epileptologist, Chennai, delivered lectures in the sessions.

The other experts who spoke on different aspects of epilepsy were Pankaj Kundra Dean (Academics), Pradeep Pankajakshan Nair, Additional Professor, Neurology, Vaibhav Wadwekar, HOD Neurology, Pradeep Nair, Mukilan Balasubramanian, Assistant Professor, Anesthesia and Critical Care and Sathia Prabhu, Associate Professor, Neurosurgery from Jipmer, also spoke on different aspects of epilepsy.

About 150 delegates from different departments of Jipmer and other medical colleges in the region participated in the programme.

A patient interactive session on “Epilepsy and Mental Health” was a highlight.

The session was led by experts from the Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, including Rajeswary Agoram Assistant Professor, Neurology and Balaji Bharadwaj, Associate Professor Psychiatry, in the institution.

Students from the College of Nursing, Jipmer, enacted an educational skit on epilepsy. Around 250 People living With Epilepsy (PWE) and their care givers participated in the event.

444,2020/02/11,Reimagining the city planners’ vision for nightlife,"City planners, who have for long ignored the night hours in their scheme of things, are now starting to wake up to the prospects of a 24/7 identity for cities, especially metros, according to Luc Gwiazdzinski, professor at the University of Grenoble-Alps, France.

In a recent talk, ‘Geography of the Night’ at the French Institute of Pondicherry during the Pondicherry Heritage Festival, Prof. Gwiazdzinski drew the audiences into questions such as why the was night so neglected, why public authorities forget to plan the city for the night, and why nocturnal hours are too often considered in negative terms.

In etymological terms too, the night was cast in negative shade. In European languages, the term is constructed negatively, since it means ‘not-8’ (n-ight, n-otte, n-uit...), the eight meaning the eight hours that human beings spend sleeping (some less, some more), he pointed out.

However, considering space in relation to time, it has become imperative to consider the city during the night, when other landscapes appear, with other uses, other frequentations.

Prof. Gwiazdzinski pointed out that the city at night can be the space of intimacy and rest (in one's room), or of transgression (bars, etc.), but it is also the space of work — in Europe, for instance, a fifth of the population works at night.

In fact, the professor had advanced these fascinating thoughts in The Urban Night: a Space Time for Innovation and Sustainable Development (Journal of Urban Research 11 | 2015), where he argued that just like the human body, cities are bound by the rhythm of the transition between day and night.

“In a society that is rethinking its nychthemera, the night has a lot to offer the day and the future,” he had stated. To his audience at the IFP, Prof. Gwiazdzinski said, “Fortunately, a certain awareness is emerging. Cities are beginning to be designed for the night, and “night mayors” are even sometimes elected to better manage these night spaces”.

However, as he stated in the paper, some of the real challenges lay in lighting the night without killing it; making the night accessible while preserving its original identity; developing the night without creating new conflicts of use; animating the night while respecting our body clocks; ensuring public safety without imposing a curfew or opening up the night while protecting the workers’ health. Most importantly, reconciling the “right to the city” with the “right to the night” and finally reclaiming the night while conserving some of its mystery.

Real challenges

Beyond the urban night, the issue is whether or not to retain our traditional rhythms or to shift towards a continuous society, an à la carte 24-hour, seven-day city that represents comfort for some and hell for others.

“By burying these issues or asking the private domain to referee, we allow the economy alone to dictate its laws and run the risk of seeing a series of isolated decisions generate new conflicts and new inequalities.

The 21st edition of the Bharat Rang Mahotsav (BRM) parallel theatre festival hosted across select cities by the National School of Drama (NSD) offers a package of five Indian and two international productions.

Entry is free for all the shows.

Abhilash Pillai, Dean Academics at NSD, told the media that the festival, held here in collaboration with Adishakti, presents a treat for theatre enthusiasts with each of the critically acclaimed seven shows being carefully curated from across India and around the world.

Among the five Indian plays, two are in Malayalam, one each in Odiya, Tamil and Kannada, while the international productions feature one each from the Czech Republic and Bangladesh.

A highlight of Richard III, performed by the Prague Shakespeare Company, is that it features the Deputy High Commissioner to India from the United Kingdom in a central role.

Alongside theatre shows scheduled for 7 p.m., an array of traditional dance and folk performances will also be part of the audience experience.

Interactive session

There will also be an opportunity for viewers to interact with the director of the play after the performance. R. Raju, alumni of NSD, and former Head and Dean of Department of Performing Arts, Pondicherry University, said the entry being free provided the public an access to view various experimentations and innovations in contemporary theatre.

The festival will be launched in the presence of Chief Secretary Ashwani Kumar, actor M. Nasser, acting chairman of NSD Society Arjun Deo Charan and others.

446,2020/02/11,City to host youth theatre festival,"The capital city will this month play host to a youth theatre festival with plays representing all the 14 districts. The State Youth Welfare Board will organise the festival to be held at Tagore Theatre on February 22 and 23.

The festival here will be the culmination of weeks of district-level competitions, from which winners were chosen to represent the district at the State-level.

According to the organisers of the festival, in addition to highlighting the works of young theatre practitioners, the major aim of the festival is to provide opportunity for theatre enthusiasts from all districts.

“Often, theatre festivals have only State-level selections, due to which some districts are at a disadvantage. Districts with an active cultural space and lots of theatre personalities will have more than one play representing them. So, we decided on this format to ensure that everyone gets an equal opportunity,” said a member of the organising committee.

By transgenders

Fifteen plays will be staged at the festival, with one play by a group of transgender theatre personalities to be staged at the valedictory function. The rest will be part of the competition.

One of the conditions for the plays to be chosen to the competition was that the director should be below the age of 40.

There should also be a considerable number of youth and women on the stage as well as in the technical crew.

The plays should be written after January 2010.

Prize money

The winners of the competition will get a prize money of ₹1 lakh, while the second and third placed groups will get ₹75,000 and ₹50,000 each.

The plays chosen at the State level will get a grant of ₹25,000 each and the second and third placed plays at the district level will get ₹10,000 and ₹5,000 each.

Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs E.P. Jayarajan will inaugurate the festival at 9.30 a.m. on February 21.

The valedictory function is scheduled to be held at 6 p.m. on February 22.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/cmyp6m/article30786857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvtv,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/city-to-host-youth-theatre-festival/article30786858.ece
447,2020/02/11,A ‘crushing stone’ clears the way to the past,"Kollampara, near Nedumangad, has thrown up a quartzite ‘crushing stone’ from the Neolithic era which sheds light on the prehistoric culture of southern Kerala.

The discovery was made by A.S. Vysakh, Assistant Professor and Research Supervisor, Postgraduate Department of History and Research Centre, Sree Narayana College, Chempazhanthy, and Rahul Raj, a PG student of the college, during an excavation at Moonamkuzhi, Kollampara.

Such crushing stones were used for breaking nuts, seeds, bones and other hard substances. The discovery indicates that a Neolithic culture prevailed in the region, Mr. Vysakh said, adding that the stone was found two feet below the earth during the dig.

The region where the quartzite tool was discovered is lateritic, he said. “So this find can be included in the category of ‘selected stones,’ meaning that it is foreign to that particular region and was brought from elsewhere.”

Heavy utilisation

The oval-shaped, 10.16 cm-long crushing stone weighs 0.580 grams. The battering marks at both ends are indicative of heavy utilisation and characterise a working implement. The slightly weathered tool exhibits signs of having been ground to shape after which the surface was crudely polished, according to him.

The area where the tool was discovered is generally hilly and was forested until about a century ago. “Nedumangad and its neighbouring regions Vithura, Anad, Nanniyode, Tholicode and Peringamala are home to the Kani tribals. So the discovery of a Neolithic tool from this region is of no wonder and presumably indicates pre-historic settlement,” he added.

In India, Neolithic culture dates back to almost 7,000 BCE. The dates of the southern Neolithic sites mostly fall within the broad time bracket of circa 2,900-1,000 BCE. Neolithic implements are distributed over a large part of south India, including Kerala.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/mchtej/article30786835.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11tvtvstone,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-crushing-stone-clears-the-way-to-the-past/article30786836.ece
448,2020/02/11,Veerappur temple to get a ₹1.25-crore facelift,"Ahead of the annual festival of Shri Periakandiamman Temple at Veerappur near Manapparai, which attracts thousands of devotees from various parts of the State, the district administration has devised an action plan to improve amenities in the village.

Laying of approach road between the main temple and sub temples, forming cement concrete pavements and rehabilitation of Veerappur tank form part of the plan.

Collector S. Sivarasu told The Hindu that the arrival of devotees to the temple had seen manifold increase in recent years. It was expected that the temple would attract a large number of devotees for its annual festival in March. Hence, it had been decided to give a complete facelift to the areas and roads around the temple. In the first phase, a sum of ₹1.25 crore had been allocated for various works. A sum of ₹26 lakh would be spent for laying approach road between the Periakandiamman sannadhi and Mahamuni sannadhi. It has also been decided to lay cement concrete pavement for 462 meter along the temple car street at an estimate of ₹71.55 crore.

R. Shankar, Project Officer, District Rural Development Agency, Tiruchi, said that the works have already started. The formation of approach road was almost over. The formation of cement concrete pavement would be over within this month. It had been decided to complete the work before the annual Masi festival.

Mr. Sivarasu said that the tank behind the Veerappur temple would also be de-silted so as to improve the storage. A sum of ₹9 lakh had been allocated for it. Similarly, a sanitary complex would be constructed at a cost of ₹24 lakh. A tender would be floated soon for the project.

Steps would be taken to provide all amenities for the devotees. Encroachments would also be cleared to ensure free flow of devotees.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/9lgyu/article30789197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY11FESTIVALTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/veerappur-temple-to-get-a-125-crore-facelift/article30789198.ece
449,2020/02/11,Historically-significant Gandhi Park in Guntur now lies in neglect,"Parks are the places where children love to play and senior citizens can stroll on the lawns. The historic town of Guntur is dotted with many parks, most of them in residential areas. While some of them have been well maintained by local residential welfare associations, others are in a bad shape.

Take for instance, the historical Gandhi Park located right opposite the office of Guntur Municipal Corporation. Three years after independence, the municipality decided to establish a park and named it as Gandhi Park. Rao Sahab S. Mukti Swami was the special officer when the park was established.

Gandhi Park has a place etched in the history of the town and was the meeting place for leaders during the freedom struggle. The park still has the Swaraj Maidan pillar erected in 1939 in memory of martyrs in freedom struggle. In 1938, a clock tower was built.

Even after independence, the park continued to be a prominent one and used to host socio, political, cultural, and sports activities. It used to be a favourite playing ground for children and replicas of dinosaurs and a mini auditorium added more interest. Tall teak trees and manicured gardens were the hallmark of the park and even civil servants who worked in the town, remember the park as well maintained in 1980s.

The slide started some 20 years back and as the local municipality looked the other way, the park continued to wither for lack of attention. The Guntur Municipal Corporation took over the maintenance of the park, but did nothing to maintain the park.

While this is the situation in a central park, it is heartening to see parks in residential areas being maintained well. Many of them have walking tracks, children playpens and a compound wall. The walking track-cum-park at Gujjangundla is an example of how the municipal corporation and the local welfare societies can work together.

The park at Vidya Nagar, once a municipal site, has also been developed by opening a library and laying a walking track. The park at Syamala Nagar has a compound wall, a walking track and a playpen.

“The park is one of the earliest parks in the town and we are spending a lot on its maintenance. But there is a municipal dumper bin besides the park which attracts stray dogs, and we fear, our children may be bitten by them,” says Srinivasa Reddy, a resident of Symala Nagar.

New parks planned

The GMC had earlier planned to develop parks as part of a project funded by Andhra Pradesh Urban Services for the Poor (APUSP). The GMC had planned the project in such a way that it would clear the area and build the walking track while the residential welfare associations maintain them. Apart from developing the vacant sites, the GMC also hoped that the sites would be protected from encroachment. Parks have been proposed at Udyoga Nagar reserve site, Santhi Nagar (Muthyala Reddy Nagar), Nava Bharath Nagar, RTC Colony (reserve site), Srikanth Nagar, Kortipadu triangle belt, and Stambalagaruvu reserve site.

But down the line, most of the parks have been bereft of any maintenance with few residential associations taking up the responsibility. With the GMC not keen on further spending on these parks, they have been left without regular maintenance.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/ze5ntf/article30795235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/222093273col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/historically-significant-gandhi-park-in-guntur-now-lies-in-neglect/article30795239.ece

454,2020/02/11,"Pensions stopped on flimsy grounds, allege beneficiaries","A large number of pensioners led by TDP MLA V. Ramakrishna Babu staged a demonstration near the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) office on Monday, alleging that their pensions had been withdrawn by the State government on “flimsy grounds”.

“Pensions of genuine beneficiaries have been abruptly stopped by the government citing vague reasons. Pensions of around 3,000 people from various segments such as fishermen and physically challenged have been stopped in my constituency (Visakhapatnam East) alone,” Mr. Ramakrishna Babu alleged before the media.

Representation submitted

A mild tension prevailed when the pensioners who wanted to meet Municipal Commissioner G. Srijana were stopped at the GVMC entrance gate by the police. However, Ms. Srijana walked up to the gate and received the representations from the TDP MLA.

Several protesters poured out their woes before the media. “I am a fisherman. My pension has been stopped on the grounds that I am an ex-serviceman and enjoying the benefits under that quota. But the fact is that I have never served in the armed forces,” claimed 70-year-old Ch Tata Rao (70).

Apparao, another senior citizen from Jalairpeta, alleged that his pension was stopped on the ground that he owned a house built on 750 sft area. “I have no house of my own. I live in a small 200 sft rented accommodation,” he said.

‘Genuine ones left out’

Speaking to the media, Mr. Ramakrishna Babu alleged that that grama volunteers in their reports had purposefully erased the name of the genuine pensioners.

“The government pays around ₹2,200 per month as pension to senior citizens and now the genuine beneficiaries are suffering as it has been stopped,” he said.

The MLA told the GVMC Commissioner that grama volunteers had done a “shoddy job during the survey conducted to identify the genuine beneficiaries”. He urged Ms. Srijana to assign the survey job to the Urban Community Development (UCD) wing the civic body as it was done earlier.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/t1bd2s/article30787052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11VZ3PROTESTFORPENSION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/pensions-stopped-on-flimsy-grounds-allege-beneficiaries/article30787053.ece

More amenities

The beaches will get batter infrastructure and tourist amenities such as eco-friendly biotoilets, shower panels, changing rooms, purified drinking water, access pathways, seating benches, sit-out umbrellas, children play area, fitness equipment, first-aid station, cloak rooms and parking lots for vehicles.

Addressing a media conference here on Monday, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said in all, 1.73 lakh applications were received.

Only assigned land and government land was acquired. Those who gave 1 acre of assigned land would be given 900 square yards and those who have encroached land would be given 450 square yards. The land would be developed and given with a right to the owners to sell it.

461,2020/02/11,Delhi 2020 Results | What happened in key constituencies,"Delhi Assembly elections turned out to be a contest between the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the BJP. Congress was out of the game.

The AAP won 62 seats out of the total 70 Assembly seats it contested, five less from the last elections.

The BJP put up a fight in the run up to the poll after a comparatively slow start to the campaigning in January. It has won six seats (and is leading two others), up from the three it won in the 2015 polls - Rohini, Vishwas Nagar and Mustafabad.

Key constituencies

For Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, the home turf of New Delhi was a rather comfortable win with 46,758 votes (61.1% vote share) compared to the BJP’s Sunil Kumar Yadav, who managed 25,061 votes (32.75%). Kejriwal had won by a margin of 31,583 votes in the 2015 elections.

Patparganj was a close fight between Manish Sisodia --who is hailed as a high-scorer and had clutched a significant vote share in the previous two elections -- and Negi. The latter, along with Laxman Rawat of the Congress, are migrants from Uttarakhand and the community holds about 20% vote share in the constituency. Sisodia received 70,163 votes as against Negi’s 66,956 votes. Rawat, meanwhile, just got 2,802 votes.

Among the three seats that the BJP won the last time, the saffron party continued to be strong in two. In Rohini, BJP MLA Vijender Kumar managed to retain his constituency, securing 62,174 votes against AAP’s Rajesh Nama Bansiwala, who got 49,526 votes. In Vishwas Nagar as well, Om Prakash Sharma (65,830 votes) comfortably won the seat against Deepak Singla (49,373 votes) of AAP. It had to, however, give up the Mustafabad constituency where AAP candidate Haji Yunus (98,850 votes) comfortably defeated Jagadish Pradhan (78,146 votes).

Shakur Basti witnessed a close contest, with State Home Minister and AAP candidate Satyendar Jain initially trailing behind S.C. Vats of the BJP. Jain finally won, securing 51,165 votes against Vats’ 43,573 votes.

Development Minister and State AAP convener Gopal Rai (84,776) won his home turf of Babarpur against BJP’s Naresh Gaur (51,714 votes). The margin of over 33,000 votes was close to that in 2015.

Similarly, sitting AAP MLA from Greater Kailash Saurabh Bharadwaj (60,372) retained his seat against Shikha Roy of the BJP (43,563 votes). Atishi, AAP’s candidate from Kalkaji who lost the Lok Sabha election last year from East Delhi, also defeated BJP’s Dharambir Singh after initially trailing. She received 55,897 votes as against Singh's 44,504 votes.

In Karawal Nagar, Mohan Singh Bisht of the BJP (96,721 votes) won against AAP’s Durgesh Pathak, who managed 88,498 votes.

Meanwhile, Burari gave a clear win to AAP’s Sanjeev Jha, who had received 1,39,598 votes. The Janata Dal (United) candidate trailing him, Shailendra Kumar, managed 51,440 votes.

Close fight

BJP candidates put up a strong challenge to AAP candidates in several constituencies. In Adarsh Nagar, Pawan Sharma of AAP faced a strong challenge from BJP’s Raj Kumar Bhatia. Sharma won with 46,892 votes even as Bhatia garnered 45,303 votes, a gap of merely 1,589 votes. In Bijwasan and Laxmi Nagar, the gap was further down to just 3 digits - 753 votes and 880 votes, respectively.

Similarly in Rithala, the contest was initially close between AAP’s Mohinder Goyal and BJP’s Manish Chaudhary. Goyal finally won with a safe margin, though, securing 87,940 votes against Chaudhary’s 74,067 votes.

Kirari also witnessed a tight electoral battle, with AAP’s Rituraj Govind (86,312 votes) winning against Anil Jha of the BJP (80,658 votes). In Krishna Nagar, S.K. Bagga of AAP won 72,111 votes as compared to 68,116 votes secured by BJP’s Anil Goyal.

Shalimar Bagh saw AAP’s Bandana Kumari lead with 57,707 votes against BJP’s Rekha Gupta, who received 54,267 votes.

462,2020/02/11,Opposition sees it as a referendum on BJP’s politics of polarisation,"The Opposition parties in unison congratulated Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal for his resounding victory in the Delhi Assembly elections. They said the BJP’s defeat in the elections showed that politics of polarisation and division didn't pay dividends.

Rajya Sabha floor leader of the Biju Janata Dal Prasanna Acharya, in a telling comment, said, “The BJP claims to be the biggest political party of the world. And it has been defeated by the smallest party in the country. This shows the beauty of Indian democracy and maturity of Indian voters.”

West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee was one of the earliest to congratulate Mr Kejriwal. In a tweet, she said, “Congratulations @ArvindKejriwal as #DelhiResults show @AamAadmiParty all set to win #DelhiElection2020 with a thumping majority yet again. Leaders playing on faith through hate speech and divisive politics should take a cue, as only those who deliver on their promises are rewarded.” She had endorsed the AAP in the Delhi polls.

The Congress, which drew a blank in the elections, was all praise for Mr. Kejriwal. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, in a tweet, congratulated him, while former UPA Minister P Chidambaram, in a series of tweets, said the Delhi results was a booster for the confidence of the Opposition that the BJP could be defeated in every State. “The Delhi vote is close to an All India vote than to a state-specific vote. Because Delhi is a mini India,” he said in a tweet.

Rashtriya Janata Dal, which fought in four seats in Delhi, also complimented Mr. Kejriwal. ""Congratulations Arvind Kejriwal ji & Delhi ! You have defeated negative & blatant hate politics decisively. Your verdict marks the defeat of politics of polarisation and division. I sincerely hope BJP takes a cue from this result and shuns communalism & bigotry once for all "", tweeted Leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav.

DMK President M K Stalin called the Delhi results a clear vindication that development trumped communal politics.

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the AAP had given a befitting reply to the BJP’s politics of hate and violence.

CPI general secretary D Raja called it a defeat for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah who, he said, concentrated all their energies on the Delhi polls. This was a defeat for the BJP narrative on the Citizenship (Amendment) ACT and National Register for Citizens that was used for communal polarisation.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackery said the poll results showed that people din't want to listen to ‘mann ki baat’ (Mr. Modi's monthly radio show) any more but preferred ‘jan ki baat’ instead.

Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar accused the BJP of polarisation. The people of Delhi had rejected the saffron party’s divisive policies.“The results of the Delhi polls indicate that winds of change are blowing in the country,” he said, adding that the BJP's, arrogance had proved to be its undoing”.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/vramv4/article30794200.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11IN-KEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/opposition-sees-it-as-a-referendum-on-bjps-politics-of-polarisation/article30794201.ece
463,2020/02/11,"Analysis | Delay in decision-making, absence of clear strategy and factionalism led to Congress wipeout in Delhi","The wipeout of the Congress in the Delhi Assembly elections almost disproved the saying that change is the only constant in life.

“No-change” seemed to be the constant for the Congress as it drew a blank again.

If anything, the change was for the worse. Its vote share went down to below 5% from 9% in the last Assembly polls in 2015 and 22% in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

“We’re again decimated in Delhi. Enough of introspection, time for action now. Inordinate delay in decision-making at the top, lack of strategy and unity at State level, demotivated workers, no grassroots connect... all are factors. Being part of the system, I too take my share of responsibility,” tweeted party spokesperson Sharmishtha Mukherjee, daughter of former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Sandeep Dikshit, ex-MP and son of former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, was another party member who had been critical of the Delhi leadership.

Despite the Congress trying to showcase his mother Sheila Dikshit’s development legacy, Mr. Dikshit was absent from party forums.

He did, of course, bring out regular video messages, called “Jan Ki Baat”, where he attacked the Arvind Kejriwal government on key issues such as education, health among others.

So what went wrong? As Ms. Mukherjee's tweet pointed out, delay in decision making, no clear strategy and factionalism were some of the most easily identifiable reasons.

After the sudden and unexpected death of Sheila Dikshit last July, the Congress leadership took an inordinately long time to appoint her successor.

Incumbent Congress chief Subhash Chopra got a little over three months to prepare his party for the battle of Delhi. The party, that ruled the capital for three consecutive terms between 1998 and 2013, was marked by pronounced ad-hocism.

Though many believe that the party had given Delhi up to ensure that the Aam Admi Party’s (AAP) victory and defeat the BJP, party insiders argue it was more a case of lack of clarity in terms of strategy. Who should the Congress attack more, the BJP or the AAP?

While a section of the Congress party wanted the BJP to be defeated at any cost, the Delhi unit had identified the AAP as the main opponent.

And finally, the narrative was not of the future but of the past, focussing on the development of the Sheila Dikshit government.

True that Delhi had witnessed quite a transformation during the 15-year rule of Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government but it had its share of problems.

The massively inflated electricity bills (running into thousands of rupees) after the Sheila Dikshit privatised the government-run power corporation Delhi Vidyut Board was one of the main catalysts for Mr. Kejriwal.

The image of Mr. Kejriwal challenging private power companies — who used to cut power connections to homes that had not paid these inflated bills — by forcibly reconnecting the snapped wires caught the imagination of the people.

Since then the promise of free water, cheap electricity, better government schools and a clean government have only added to his aura, one that his rivals have not been able to diminish.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/7d2us5/article30793313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CONGRESS,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/news-analysis-delay-in-decision-making-absence-of-clear-strategy-and-factionalism-led-to-congress-wipeout-in-delhi/article30793317.ece

The party, he said, would replicate the Delhi model in Punjab in the 2022 Assembly election.

The AAP’s political affairs committee chairman Harchand Singh Barsat said that the historic victory of the AAP in Delhi had redefined the political narrative across the country by “rejecting divisive forces hellbent on destroying the social fabric of the country”.

‘Loud and clear’

“The unprecedented victory of the party had sent out a message loud and clear across the country that elected governments would have to work harder for betterment of education, healthcare, cheaper electricity, safety and security of women, etc.,” Mr. Barsat said.

“The Punjab unit of the party would replicate the Delhi model in Punjab in the 2022 Assembly election,” he added.

Sikh radical outfit Dal Khalsa’s spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh said the people of Delhi “in their collective wisdom had defeated the BJP’s Hindutva agenda by reposing faith in AAP”.

“Mr. Kejriwal won the Delhi polls because of Hanumanji as he recited the Hanuman Chalisa and was blessed by Lord Hanuman otherwise he would not have won,” Mr. Raina told reporters in Jammu.

Reacting to the landslide victory of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi, he said the vote percentage of his party also increased manifold.

“He [Kejriwal] remembered Hanuman for the first time and recited Hanuman Chalisa and he was blessed by the Pawan Putra,” he said.

Asked why the BJP was not blessed despite chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’, he said the Party won the Parliamentary elections with a thumping majority because lakhs of Party workers chanted the name of Lord Ram repetitively.

Meanwhile, jubilant AAP activists hit the roads outside the exhibition ground in Jammu to celebrate the victory of the party in the Delhi elections. They distributed sweets before dispersing peacefully.

“The voters of Delhi rejected the politics of hatred and voted for the work done by the Party during its rule,” one of the activists said, alleging that the BJP left no stone unturned to divide the people on communal lines by raking up the Shaheen Bagh protest.

466,2020/02/11,Delhi Assembly elections 2020 | The seats that AAP lost,"With leads or wins available for all constituencies in the Delhi Assembly polls 2020, AAP seems poised to win with a thumping majority — 62 of 70 seats. However, this is five less than they won in 2015. This time around, they have ceded five seats to the BJP.

The BJP has leads in Gandhi Nagar, Ghonda, Karawal Nagar, Laxmi Nagar, Rohini, Rohtas Nagar and Vishwas Nagar. In 2015, the BJP had won in Rohini, Mustafabad and Vishwas Nagar.

In Gandhi Nagar, Anil Bajpai has a lead of over 5,000 votes against the AAP’s Naveen Chaudhary. Mr. Bajpai was one of the AAP MLAs who joined the BJP in 2019 during the Lok Sabha polls, and was then disqualified by the Speaker.

The BJP’s Kapil Mishra, also a rebel AAP MLA who joined the BJP, may be trailing in Model Town, but his old seat of Karawal Nagar has been appropriated by the BJP for now. Mohan Singh Bisht, a three-time MLA, lost in 2015 to Mr. Mishra by a landslide, but has regained that ground with a lead of over 8,000 votes.

Ghonda also saw the AAP trail by a massive margin of over 28,000 votes. In Laxmi Nagar, the BJP’s Abhay Verma is leading by a very slim margin of 880 votes against incumbent AAP MLA Nitin Tyagi.

Rohini is a seat that the BJP has retained, with the AAP unable to make any gains in the constituency. The saffron party’s sitting MLA Vijender Gupta sought re-election based on reconstruction of internal roads and better maintenance of street lights. The BJP has held sway over the seat for over a decade; except for the 2013 Delhi Assembly elections when the party’s Jai Bhagwan Aggarwal lost to the Aam Aadmi Party’s Rajesh Garg by close to 2,000 votes.

Rohtas Nagar is another constituency that the AAP has let slip out of its grasp. Incumbent MLA Sarita Singh lost to the BJP’s Jitender Mahajan by a margin of over 13,000 votes.

469,2020/02/11,Analysis | Arvind Kejriwal’s campaign does the trick for AAP,"In the end, Shaheen Bagh could not swing the Delhi Assembly elections for the BJP. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his campaign stressing the many achievements of his government did the trick for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The loss in Delhi is a setback for Home Minister Amit Shah, who made it his mission to ensure that Mr. Kejriwal was denied a third term in office.

Union Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur was banned from campaigning for 72 hours for raising the slogan of “death to traitors” on January 30, while he was earlier removed from the list of the BJP’s star campaigners.

Mr. Shah repeatedly said Delhi’s voters should press the “lotus” button on the electronic voting machine so that the “current” was felt in Shaheen Bagh, where thousands of people are peacefully protesting against the CAA-NRC-NPR regime.

Mr. Shah personally addressed 52 public meetings, road shows and street corner meetings, U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath addressed 12 public meetings in Delhi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke at three public meetings, including one on Ramlila grounds.

At one time, it appeared that the firing incidents in Jamia and the entry of masked hoodlums into JNU on January 5 (no arrests have been made by the Delhi Police in the matter so far) could lead to more violence. The Election Commission of India only intervened to remove the DCP in charge of the Jamia Millia Islamia area.

In an interview to The Hindu before the poll, Mr. Kejriwal only spoke of his work and the fact that he was going to the people on the basis of his performance. He was critical of Mr. Shah on Delhi’s deteriorating law and order situation but did not directly criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He was perhaps conscious of the fact that those who voted for Mr. Modi at the Centre said time and again that they would back Mr. Kejriwal in Delhi.

For the BJP, the defeat in Delhi comes close on the heels of the loss in Jharkhand, where again the party stressed on CAA-NRC and Ram mandir. In Delhi too, Mr. Shah promised at several public meetings that a Ram temple would be constructed in Ayodhya in four months.

It’s evident that what worked for the BJP in the Lok Sabha election did not work for it in Delhi or Jharkhand. The voter, clearly, has different interests and objectives in national and Assembly elections.

Though the BJP succeeded in raising its vote share by about seven percentage points to around 39% in the current polls (counting was on at the time of writing), the AAP lost barely a percentage point from its 2015 tally. The gap between the AAP and the BJP is more than 12 percentage points and the Congress too has lost nearly 5% of the vote since 2015.

Interestingly, in 2013, when the BJP got 33.07% of the total votes cast, it won 31 seats, while in 2015, with 32.19% votes, it managed only three. In 2013, the Congress too got a healthy 24.55% of the vote and eight seats, while in 2015 it could not open its account, with just under 10% of the vote.

A three-cornered contest in Delhi could have helped the BJP, but the Congress did a massive favour to the AAP by not campaigning. Like in 2015, the Congress voter turned out in large numbers for the AAP while the party under Sheila Dikshit came second in the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, pushing the AAP to third position.

Finally, Mr. Kejriwal was the face of the AAP and its governance. The BJP failed to settle for any leader in Delhi, chastened perhaps with its projection of Kiran Bedi ahead of the 2015 poll. It’s something of a mystery why a powerful, organised and wealthy party like the BJP could not build up a younger leadership in Delhi.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, contesting from New Delhi constituency, is leading against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Sunil Yadav by over 20,000 votes.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has retained the Patparganj seat by 3,207 votes. A founding member of the AAP, Mr. Sisodia holds the education, finance and tourism portfolios in addition to his post as Deputy CM.

The AAP’s Atishi Marlena is leading in Kalkaji constituency. Ms. Marlena was the AAP’s candidate against BJP MP Gautam Gambhir in East Delhi during the 2019 Lok Sabha election.

Kapil Mishra of the BJP — who tweeted the controversial comparison of the Delhi elections to a contest between India and Pakistan, and was censured by the ECI — is trailing against the AAP’s Akhilesh Tripathi by over 11,000 votes. Mishra defected to the BJP from the ruling party in 2019 and even campaigned for the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections.

The Congress’ Arvinder Singh Lovely, who also contested unsuccessfully against Mr. Gambhir, is trailing in the Gandhi Nagar constituency. Mr. Lovely, who was a Minister in the Sheila Dikshit government, had jumped ship to the BJP in 2015, only to rejoin the Congress in 2018, calling himself an “ideological misfit” in the saffron party.

Former Chandni Chowk MLA Alka Lamba, who rejoined the Congress in 2019, has barely over 3,400 votes, as against the AAP’s Parlad Sawhney’s 45,800-odd vote count. Ms. Lamba had earlier quit the Congress in 2014, after a 20-year stint in the party, but returned to it terming Mr. Kejriwal as an “autocrat... never listens to AAP workers and elected representatives of the party”.

Newcomer Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga of the BJP is trailing behind the AAP in Hari Nagar. Mr. Bagga physically assaulted lawyer Prashant Bhushan in 2011, for the latter’s remarks supporting a plebiscite in Jammu & Kashmir. He has also been a Delhi BJP spokesperson since 2017, after gaining prominence by running social media campaigns in favour of the party.

In Okhla constituency, where the Shaheen Bagh protests have been taking place, sitting MLA and member of the AAP’s national executive Amanatullah Khan is leading by a massive margin of close to 77,000 votes. The constituency also includes Jamia Nagar where protests and violence took place.

Incumbent MLA and former Delhi BJP chief Vijender Gupta is leading in Rohini — a seat that the BJP has held for over a decade, with only a brief loss to the AAP in 2013. His margin, is a little over 12,600 votes.

One of the AAP’s youngest leaders Raghav Chadha, who is contesting from Rajinder Nagar, has won. Mr. Chadha campaigned for the seat by reminding people that he is a “local boy” who grew up in the area.

AAP spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj is also leading in Greater Kailash constituency with a margin of over 16,000 votes.

“I congratulate Arvind Kejriwal...In comparison to 2015, the BJP’s vote share has registered an increase which is the result of the hard work put in by its workers...these results also seem to herald the dawn of a new political era in the city, which has become bipolar instead of triangular,” he said.

BJP sources, however, blamed the party’s strategy of not projecting a chief ministerial face against Mr. Kejriwal, not being able to counter the AAP’s power and water subsidy schemes and “unwarranted comments” against Mr. Kejriwal by senior party leaders — including Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur, who was among the 200-plus party MPs covering the Capital as part of the BJP’s campaign — for the results.

“All these star campaigners ended up doing was overshadowing the local candidate; they also took the focus away from local issues,” a BJP insider said.

Senior Delhi Congress leader and national spokesperson of the party Sharmishtha Mukherjee, said the party had taken enough time to introspect and it was time for action now. “Inordinate delay in decision- making a the top, lack of strategy and unity at State level, demotivated voters and no grassroots-connect, are all factors,” Ms. Mukhejree said.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/cartoon/wojut1/article30796369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-cartoon-deepak-1,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/delhi-assembly-elections-2020-aap-sweeps-delhi-with-62-seats/article30790189.ece
473,2020/02/11,Delhi Assembly election results: AAP party workers sing ‘Lage raho Kejriwal’,"With blue and white balloons, buntings and giant cutouts of their leader Arvind Kejriwal, AAP workers went into early celebration mode at their party headquarters on Tuesday as trends showed the party leading in 57 of 70 seats.

The drumbeats of victory sounded loud and clear as hundreds of party workers danced to the words “Lage raho Kejriwal” set to tune.

A stage was set up on the roof of the party office, decorated with balloons and flowers, from where Kejriwal is expected to address party workers after the final results are announced.

The Chief Minister was at the party office, following trends as the votes were counted — the trends suggesting that the party would sweep the polls in keeping with its symbol, the broom — but did not come out.

The Aam Aadmi Party was leading in 57 seats and the BJP in 13 seats, according to trends on the Election Commission website.

“We knew it. We have changed the politics of this country. Now it is Delhi, next is India,” said a jubilant Sanjeev Singh, a party volunteer from Hari Nagar.

“We hope we get such a clear majority that a message goes out that doing Hindu-Muslim politics will not work any more,” added another volunteer Fareen Khan.

The AAP headquarters were decorated with blue and white balloons and big cut-outs of the man who steered the campaign and looked set to form government for a second consecutive term.

A big poster saying “Acche honge paanch saal, Delhi mein toh Kejriwal” was also put up.

“People of Delhi have showed the way to the country that only development work will take the country forward and not Hindu Muslim politics. All kind of divisive politics has been rejected by the people of Delhi and we will win 70 out of 70 seats,” said Sushil Gupta, AAP Rajya Sabha MP.

479,2020/02/11,India striker Lalremsiami named 2019 FIH Women’s Rising Star of Year,"India forward Lalremsiami has been named as the 2019 FIH Women’s Rising Star of the Year, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) said on Tuesday.

The 19-year-old attacker took the prize ahead of Argentina’s Julieta Jankunas and Frederique Matla of the Netherlands, who finished second and third respectively, the FIH said in a statement.

The player from Mizoram got 40% of all the votes cast. She got 47.7% of her votes from among national associations, while the media, fans/players contributed 28.4% and 36.4% respectively.

Lalremsiami first came into the wider hockey consciousness at the Hockey Women’s World Cup in 2018 when she was one of the stand-out players of the tournament.

Since then she has been at the heart of the rise of the Indian women’s hockey team as it has cemented a spot in the world’s top 10 teams over the past two years.

Since making her debut in 2017 in a test series against Belarus, Lalremsiami has made a name for herself as a striker of phenomenal ability. Twice in her short senior career she has been top goalscorer — in a test series against Korea in 2017 and against Spain in 2019.

At the Ready Steady Tokyo event, which took place in August 2019, Lalremsiami scored the winning goal in the final against Japan. Over the course of that event, India drew with Australia, who were ranked at number two in the world, as well as drawing with Asian rivals China.

However, the two events that really made India and Lalremsiami’s year — at either end of the emotional scale— were the competitions leading to qualification for the Tokyo Olympic Games.

At the FIH Series Finals in Hiroshima, India beat off opposition from eight other teams all seeking a place in the Olympic Qualifiers. India held their nerves and took top spot, setting up a double header against USA.

Tragically for Lalremsiami, her father died during the course of that event, but the young athlete played on, despite her grief.

She later said, “I wanted to make my father proud. I wanted to stay, play and make sure India qualified.”

Lalremsiami did not feature among the goals in the two Olympic Qualifier matches against USA but her constant running and creativity helped put the opposition defence under pressure, allowing captain Rani Rampal to score the decisive goal that sent India to Tokyo.

Lalremsiami’s achievements are all the more remarkable considering that she hails from a small, agricultural community in Mizoram.

As a teenager, Lalremsiami left home to join the hockey academy at Thenzawi, 150 kilometres from her home.

“Hockey is not very famous in my village; very few people played the sport. However, I was always interested in playing hockey so I had to move to Thenzawl, which was very far from my village so I had to move into their hostel in my early teenage years,” she was quoted as saying by Olympic Channel.",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/india-striker-lalremsiami-named-2019-fih-womens-rising-star-of-year/article30789468.ece
480,2020/02/11,Interactive map shows global coronavirus spread in real-time,"Scientists in the U.S. have developed an interactive map of the novel coronavirus spread, that allows users to see the number of cases worldwide, recoveries and deaths, as well as trends in real-time.

The map updates every few hours with data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization (WHO), Chinese and other government agencies, including those in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.

“Mapping is a powerful tool to tell social, cultural and political phenomena,” said Bo Zhao, an assistant professor at the University of Washington in the U.S.

“As a geographer, and in what people call the ‘post-truth era,’ it’s important to weigh in with data sources to show people how things are happening,” Zhao said.

By zooming in on various countries — such as China — users can see the number of cases, recoveries and deaths, as well as trends over time, according to the researchers.

The outbreak of the coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China in December, has been declared a public health emergency by the WHO.

Tens of thousands have been infected, and hundreds have died so far.

Zhao recently produced an online atlas to illustrate the global refugee experience. The coronavirus, he said, is another societal issue that people can gain perspective on by seeing it on a map.

According to Zhao, while the Chinese government has been criticised for its response to the crisis, and concerns have arisen about its transparency, China’s National Health Commission data is the most accurate available for the country.

However, the outbreak is not just affecting China or the city of Wuhan, he added.

“It is a global issue, and that’s the perspective users can gain from the map. The numbers on display are important, too, because there are more recoveries than deaths,” Zhao said.

“That can give people encouragement,” he said.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/hgbkyz/article30567852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/interactive-map-shows-global-coronavirus-spread-in-real-time/article30790768.ece
481,2020/02/11,"India moves to include elephant, bustard in global conservation list","India will be moving to include the Asian Elephant and the Great Indian Bustard in the list of species that merit heightened conservation measures. The list will be debated at the 13th Conference of Parties (COP) of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), an environment treaty under the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

Gujarat meet

The COP is scheduled to be organised from February 17 to 22 in Gandhinagar, Gujarat. There are 130 parties to the convention and India has been a member since 1983.

“We expect the COP to clear the inclusion of the Great Indian Bustard and the elephant as it has been vetted by technical experts and reflects the consensus of several countries. The elephant faces risks particularly in neighbouring Bangladesh and Nepal,” Soumitra Dasgupta, a senior official in the Union Environment Ministry told The Hindu.

India is home to several migratory species of wildlife, including the snow leopard, Amur falcons, bar- headed geese, black-necked cranes, marine turtles, dugongs and hump-backed whales.

Having the elephant and the Great Indian Bustard in the list — more formally known as Appendix 1 — would coax countries neighbouring India, where wild animals such as tigers and elephant foray into, to direct more resources and attention to protecting them. There are now 173 species in the Appendix 1.

PM to address

Representatives from across the world, and conservationists and international NGOs working in wildlife conservation, are expected to attend the COP, which will also see Prime Minister Narendra Modi address the gathering via video conference.

The Union Environment Ministry reports India as having 29,964 elephants according to the Project Elephant Census in 2017. The pachyderm merits the highest level of protection, or Schedule 1, under the Wildlife Protection Act.

India to lead

India has been designated the President of the COP for the next three years. “The government of India has been taking necessary actions to protect and conserve migratory marine species. Seven species that include Dugong, Whale Shark, Marine Turtle (two species), have been identified for preparation of Conservation and Recovery Action Plan,” the Ministry said in a statement.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/hrez6f/article30784718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-elephant,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/india-moves-to-include-elephant-bustard-in-global-conservation-list/article30784719.ece
