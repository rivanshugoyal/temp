2,2020/01/30,Kingfisher Ultra India Derby beckons this weekend,"The Kingfisher Ultra Indian Derby (Gr.1) (2,400m), which occupies the pride of place as the blue riband of the Indian racing calendar, will be staged here on Sunday, February 2, at the Mahalaxmi race course.

This year’s edition will mark the 78th successive running of this prestigious event and the total prize money on offer is ₹2,20,80,000 and the winner’s purse is ₹1,32,48,000. All the 15 races over the Derby weekend (Feb. 1 & 2) are high stakes races.

The weekend carnival will feature evening racing on Saturday (Feb. 1) starting at 4.30 p.m. and afternoon racing on Sunday (Feb. 2) starting at 2.30 p.m. But two races post Derby will be run under floodlights.

Added attraction

Another added attraction for the punters on Derby day will be the carried forward amount of ₹20 lakh, which will be added to the collection of combined jackpot pool of Sunday, February 2.

A large field of 20 runners will face the starter this year. Among them the present form of Bangalore based colt War Hammer looks imposing. He is unbeaten in all his seven starts including last Sunday’s (Jan. 26) Bangalore Derby, where he put all the doubts of his staying ability to rest, by winning the mile and a half trip in a decisive manner. One has to see how he recovers from this hard run and travel within a short span of seven days.

Fan following

The Mumbai based queen filly Juliette, who won the Indian Oaks (2,400 m) with an amazing turn of foot, will enjoy lot of fan following and may pose a serious threat. Apart from this top duo, the Vishal Gaikwad-trained Victorious Sermon — who won the Ruia Cup comfortably over 2000m — is also making good promises on the training track. The Pune Derby winner Trouvaille, who lost to Victorious Sermon in Ruia Cup, if ignored his last run, is working well on track and might be a threat to all.

The Kolkatta Derby winner Trafalgar also looks strong to reckon with, as evidenced by his track performances.

Trainer Satish Narredu’s Sir Supremo, who decimated his rivals in the South India Derby at Chennai, puts himself in contention too for this coveted event.",races,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/races/kingfisher-ultra-india-derby-beckons-this-weekend/article30693600.ece

In partial relief for the government, however, MEPs decided not to hold a vote on the joint motion until the second half of March 2020. On March 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Brussels for the EU-India summit, and an amendment moved by MEP Michael Gahler of the European People’s Party (EPP) sought the time so as to ensure that India could engage with the MEPs on the motion.

7,2020/01/30,"Divorce sealed, Brexit finally arrives today","Friday will mark a truly historic moment, but almost nothing will happen.

A few Union Jack flags will be lowered from EU buildings in Brussels, more will be waved in jubilation by Brexiteers in London at the moment of Britain’s departure — at 11 p.m. in the U.K.

But for most of the half a billion people in Britain and the bloc, it will be a normal Friday night.

Britain and the bloc fought tooth and nail for the best part of four years — with insults flying across the English Channel — over the terms of their divorce. Now, on the eve of one of the most significant events in EU history, the political eruptions have ceased and an uneasy quiet reigns — the calm before the next storm.

The EU would prefer the night to pass without anyone noticing. After all, it is losing one of its biggest members, a diplomatic, military and economic power on a par with Germany and France. The U.K. is the first nation ever to turn its back on the EU in the 62-year history of this experiment in political union.

EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke this week of “the agony of parting.”

British PM Boris Johnson, a champion of Brexit, promised a “dignified exit” that is “mindful of everybody’s feelings.”

The U.K. will no longer be part of EU summits and ministerial meetings.

8,2020/01/30,Nurse held for poisoning babies with morphine,"A nurse in Germany has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning five premature babies with morphine, the police said Thursday, adding that the infants had survived.

The woman was taken into custody on Wednesday after investigators found a syringe containing breast milk and traces of morphine in her locker at Ulm university hospital in southern Germany.

The babies, who were between one day and one month old and staying in the same hospital room, all suddenly developed breathing problems “at almost the same time” in the early hours of December 20, Ulm police chief Bernhard Weber said.

“Only because of the immediate action taken by the staff could the five lives be saved,” he told a press conference.

The young nurse taken into custody has yet to be formally charged but faces five counts of attempted manslaughter, Ulm prosecutor Christof Lehr said at the same press conference.

She denies poisoning the babies, he added.

Prosecutors believe she acted with premeditation and “accepted that the babies could die” as a result of her actions, Mr. Lehr said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nurse-held-for-poisoning-babies-with-morphine/article30695385.ece
9,2020/01/30,Terror attacks drop by 85% in a decade in Pakistan,"Terror attacks in Pakistan plummeted by more than 85% over the past decade. It’s a welcome statistic for the country, but one that risks being overshadowed by international concern over its efforts to curb terror funding and lingering militant activity that could test any future peace agreement in neighbouring Afghanistan.

The tally, put together by Pakistani think tanks, found terror attacks dropped from nearly 2,000 in 2009 to fewer than 250 in 2019, a steady decline that underscores the long-haul nature of fighting terror.

But a Paris-based international watchdog said in October that Pakistan was not doing enough to stop terror financing. The group meets next month to decide whether the country should be downgraded from a gray status to black, alongside Iran and North Korea, a step that could pose a challenge to Pakistan’s economy.

Pakistan’s militant groups are often interlinked with those across the border in Afghanistan, so its progress at reining in terror is critical, particularly as Washington seeks to secure a deal with the Afghan Taliban to bring an end to the 18-year war, America’s longest military engagement.

The sharp decrease in terrorist violence, which we began to see in 2014, is nothing short of remarkable, said Michael Kugelman, Asia Program Deputy Director at the Washington-based Wilson Center.

But, he cautioned, Pakistan is certainly not out of the woods yet. Last year, the Financial Action Task Force, or FATF, the watchdog that monitors terror financing, said Pakistan had fully implemented only one item from a list of 40 measures to curb terror financing and money laundering. The other 39 measures were either partially implemented or in some cases overlooked entirely.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/terror-attacks-drop-by-85-in-a-decade-in-pakistan/article30695336.ece

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Russian warplanes hit the Idlib province town of Ariha, but the Russian Defence Ministry said its “aviation did not carry out any combat tasks in this area of Syria”.

The government and its Russian allies have upped their deadly bombardment of Syria’s last major rebel bastion, slowly chipping away at it from the south.

11,2020/01/30,WH seeks to quash John Bolton testimony in Donald Trump trial,"President Donald Trump’s defense team, seeking a speedy acquittal at his Senate impeachment trial, resisted Democratic efforts on Wednesday to have former National Security Advisor John Bolton testify, arguing that it could prolong the divisive proceedings for months.

Mr. Trump lashed out at Mr. Bolton on Twitter, saying his former aide was coming out with potentially damaging allegations in an upcoming “nasty & untrue book” because he was fired from his White House position.

Mr. Bolton reportedly claims in the book that Mr. Trump told him military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his political rival Joe Biden — the charge at the heart of the two articles of impeachment approved on December 18 by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives.

The fight over Mr. Bolton’s testimony intensified as the Senators, who will decide Mr. Trump’s fate, began directly questioning Democratic prosecutors and White House lawyers.

Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said it may be an “uphill fight” to garner enough Republican support to issue a subpoena to Mr. Bolton, who has said he is ready to testify.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ru7g45/article30695167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30RDBOLTON1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wh-seeks-to-quash-john-bolton-testimony-in-donald-trump-trial/article30695168.ece

“We have to do everything to protect our people,” he said.

The Russian foreign ministry said that as of Thursday it would stop issuing Chinese citizens with electronic visas, which can be used to cross into parts of the Far East and western Russia.

The foreign ministry also advised Russians to refrain from travelling to China and for those in China to get in touch with the Russian embassy.

14,2020/01/30,"Japan issues arrest warrants for ex-U.S. soldier, two others for Ghosn escape","Japanese authorities on Thursday issued arrest warrants for a former U.S. special forces soldier and two other men on suspicion of smuggling former Nissan Motor Co boss Carlos Ghosn out of Japan.

Warrants were issued for former U.S. Green Beret Michael Taylor and two other men, George-Antoine Zayek and Peter Taylor, prosecutors said in a statement. A warrant was also issued for Ghosn for illegally leaving the country, prosecutors said.

Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, at the end of last year, while he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.

The arrest warrants come days after prosecutors searched the Tokyo office of Ghosn's former lawyer.

Lebanon and Japan have about 40 days to decide whether Ghosn will be extradited to Japan or stand trial in Lebanon, Reuters reported last week.

The two countries have no extradition treaty and Lebanon does not typically hand over its nationals. Ghosn's legal team is hoping to hold the trial in Lebanon, where the former auto executive has deep ties and hopes to clear his name.

15,2020/01/30,Tibet reports first confirmed case of coronavirus,"Tibet has reported the first confirmed case of novel coronavirus pneumonia, Chinese health authorities said on Thursday.

The first case was reported after a 34-year-old man from China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus, travelled to Tibet and complained of sickness.

The patient surnamed Zhang is from the city of Suizhou in Central China’s Hubei province. He came to Lhasa by train from the provincial capital Wuhan on January 24 and was hospitalised on January 25.

So far, the majority of the cases in China and abroad are from the province for which Wuhan is the epicentre.

The regional centre for disease control and prevention diagnosed the patient as a suspected case on Tuesday. Samples have been sent to the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention for further tests.

The patient’s vital signs are stable, and close contacts have been put under medical observation, state-run China Daily reported.

Death toll in China’s novel coronavirus increased sharply to 170 with 38 more fatalities reported on Wednesday mainly from the worst-affected central Hubei province.

Wuhan has been under a virtual lockdown for days, with transport suspended and citizens told to stay home due the spread of the virus.

China’s National Health Commission said on Thursday that 7,711 confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus had been reported in 31 provincial-level regions and in the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps by the end of Wednesday.

China has ramped up efforts to contain the virus. The country has extended the New Year Festival holidays till February 2 to prevent reverse migration of millions of migrants works to return to their work from holidays.

Universities, primary and middle schools and kindergartens across the country will postpone the opening of the spring semester until further notice.

The government is focussing efforts to prevent mass gatherings and mass travel to ensure the virus is not spread fast.

Beijing has also launched temperature detection at 55 subway stations, including stops at railway stations and Beijing airport. Passengers with abnormal body temperatures will be sent to hospital.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/o9aybo/article30670855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tibet-reports-first-confirmed-case-of-coronavirus/article30690224.ece
16,2020/01/30,South Korea’s Moon urges calm amid protests over virus quarantine sites,"President Moon Jae-in urged South Koreans not to give in to fear on Thursday, as the government prepared to evacuate the first of about 700 citizens from the epicentre of a new coronavirus epidemic in China's central city of Wuhan.

The first of up to four planned flights to Wuhan had been expected to depart on Thursday morning, but was delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency said, although they are now expected to depart later in the day.

“The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,” Mr. Moon said in a speech, decrying “fake news” for having stirred excessive anxiety.

An image of a coronavirus.

Protesters had used tractors on Wednesday to block the roads to facilities earmarked for quarantine centres in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 km south of Seoul, the capital.

The government wants to isolate evacuees for at least two weeks at the facilities, usually used as training centres for government officials, to rule out any symptoms.

A handful of protesters calling for the quarantine centre to be located further away from homes and schools in Jincheon gathered outside the site on Thursday.

“I am a mother of a 3-year-old and a 4-year-old,” said Jincheon resident Lee Ji-hyun. “I was so worried I sent them to stay with my in-laws.”

Some residents said children were pulled out of kindergarten or sent to relatives in other cities.

“I dont like my friends who have travelled to Japan or China because they might be carrying the coronavirus,” said Song Ji-hoo, a 6-year-old accompanying his mother to the protest.

He was sad at not being able to play with his friends, who had all been sent to stay with their grandparents, he added.

Moon tried to reassure residents, saying the initial evacuees would only be those free of symptoms, who would be placed in isolation.

“The government will be taking air-tight steps to ensure the residents of areas where the facilities are do not need to be concerned,” he said.

South Korea has reported four cases of the newly identified virus. All had arrived from visits to Wuhan, where the virus surfaced late last year.

The new strain has an incubation time ranging from one to 14 days and can spread before symptoms show, complicating efforts to screen people at international borders.

The rapid spread of the virus has triggered alarm since scientists know little about it, including how lethal it is, and cases of milder infections are unlikely to be detected.

A liaison office operated across the border in North Korea would be closed until the outbreak eased, South Korea's unification ministry said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/kw3280/article27770313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOUTHKOREA-MEMORIALDAY-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-koreas-moon-urges-calm-amid-protests-over-virus-quarantine-sites/article30690191.ece
17,2020/01/30,Deadliest day for China in fight against coronavirus,"China reported its biggest single-day jump in novel coronavirus deaths on Thursday, as global fears deepened with more infections confirmed overseas, including three Japanese evacuated from the outbreak’s epicentre.

The World Health Organization, which initially downplayed a disease that has now killed 170 in China, was readying to meet on Thursday to decide whether to declare it a global emergency.

At least 15 countries have confirmed infections. Airlines began cancelling flights servicing China on Wednesday, and more followed suit on Thursday.

Meanwhile, more than 6,000 tourists were put under lockdown aboard a cruise ship at an Italian port on Thursday after two Chinese passengers were isolated over fears they could be carrying the coronavirus.

Beijing has taken extraordinary steps to arrest the spread of the virus, including effectively quarantining more than 50 million people in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province.

The government on Thursday reported 38 new deaths in the preceding 24 hours, the highest one-day total since the virus was detected late last year. All but one of the new deaths were in Hubei.

The number of confirmed new cases also grew steadily to 7,711, the National Health Commission said. Another 81,000 people were under observation for possible infection.

Thousands of foreigners have been trapped in Wuhan since it was sealed off last week. Massive cities like Beijing and Shanghai were also eerily quiet as countless people followed advice to stay indoors, or at least wear masks when venturing out.

Japan and the United States on Wednesday became the first countries to organise airlifts from Wuhan for their citizens. A second U.S. flight is planned in the coming days. Britain was planning an evacuation of around 200 of its citizens early on Friday morning. Australia and New Zealand were among others organising similar operations.

Tokyo on Thursday reported that three people who were aboard the first evacuation flight had tested positive for the virus after landing back in Japan.

Two of the three infected passengers showed no symptoms, according to Japanese authorities, underscoring the difficulty detecting the coronavirus.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ml57rq/article30690020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKBRITAINCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-virus-death-toll-rises-to-170-more-than-1700-new-cases/article30690021.ece
18,2020/01/30,Gita Sabharwal of India appointed UN Resident Coordinator in Thailand,"The UN has appointed Gita Sabharwal of India as the Resident Coordinator in Thailand.

The UN Resident Coordinator is the highest-ranking representative of the UN development system at the country level. Resident Coordinators lead UN Country Teams and coordinate the world body’s support to countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda. Resident Coordinators are the designated representatives of the UN Secretary-General. They report to the UN chief.

“United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appointed Gita Sabharwal of India as the United Nations Resident Coordinator in Thailand, with the host government’s approval,” the UN said in a press release on Wednesday.

Sabharwal brings 25 years of experience in development, peacebuilding, governance and social policy across five Asian countries, including Maldives.

She most recently served the UN in Sri Lanka as the Peacebuilding and Development Adviser for nearly seven years.

19,2020/01/30,"U.S. expands troop, fighter jet presence at Saudi base","Across the vast expanse of this desert air base, hundreds of tents have popped up and a newly arrived squadron of US Air Force F-15E fighters is lined up on the tarmac, flying daily missions over Iraq and Syria. Off in the distance, two American Patriot missile batteries are scanning the skies, prepared to knock down any Iranian attack against the Saudi kingdom.

The US troop presence here has grown to roughly 2,500 since last summer, when the US announced it had begun deploying forces to what once was a major US military hub.

The return of the US forces to Prince Sultan Air Base is one of the more dramatic signs of America’s decision to beef up troops in the Middle East in response to threats from Iran.

On Wednesday, the top US commander in the Middle East spent a few hours meeting with his commanders and troops here, assessing what he called a “sweet spot” of the US force projection in the region.

Prince Sultan Air Base, said Marine General Frank McKenzie, presents a complicated target for Iran to hit and provides a remote location for US troops, fighter jets and other assets. It also provides greater security for Saudi Arabia, which asked for US help in the wake of an Iranian drone and missile attack on oil facilities in the kingdom last September.

Right now, the large white tents that flap in the stiff winds give a temporary feel to the mission. But according to Air Force Colonel Jason King, vice commander of the 378th Air Expeditionary Wing here, there is “prudent planning” underway that could lead to the tents being replaced with trailers and other more permanent structures.

Saudi Arabia is a decades-long American ally, a relationship initially built on America’s dependence on Middle East oil. The military connection has been strong, even during periods of stress in the broader relationship, including in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, attacks in which most of the hijackers were Saudis.

The kingdom also has been harshly criticized in Congress for the 2018 killing of Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi and for its role in errant airstrikes in Yemen that have killed or injured many civilians.

Gen. McKenzie is careful when asked how long the US will stay.

“I think this is an important part of our architecture right now and we will continue to evaluate that as we go forward,” he said. “It’s a well defended place and we can put a lot of combat power here.”

The base’s future, he told reporters travelling with him, is part of a discussion with Defence Secretary Mark Esper about how many forces are needed in the region. That calculation is being made against the backdrop of President Donald Trump’s push to get US forces out of the Middle East and end what he calls America’s “endless wars”.

The base is a vivid representation of the struggle to balance the escalating threats in the Middle East against the Pentagon’s insistence that the US military shift more of its focus to Asia and the risks from China and Russia.

U.S. tensions with Iran have been roiling for months but spiked after the U.S. carried out a drone strike in Iraq that killed Qassem Soleimani, Iran’s top general. In response, Iran on January 8 fired as many as two dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases where US troops were stationed.

The U.S. had no Patriot defences at those bases because it judged other locations, in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the Gulf, to be more likely Iranian targets.

U.S. officials contend that both sides do not seek war and have moved to de-escalate, but threats from Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria still pose a worrisome threat.

Wednesday’s stop at Prince Sultan Air Base was the second time in a week that Gen. McKenzie has visited a military site in the Middle East where the US recently set up Patriot batteries to protect against missiles fired by Iran and Iranian-backed militias in Syria and Iraq. Reporters accompanied Gen. McKenzie to the first site on the condition they not disclose its location for security reasons.

Any possible future conflict with Iran, Gen. McKenzie said, “is not going to be a ground maneuver war, it’s going to be a war of fires, it’s going to be a war of ballistic missiles, a war of unmanned aerial systems and cruise missiles. So the ability of nations in the region to provide for their air defense is going to be important“.

It was a little more than a year ago when then-Defence Secretary Jim Mattis pulled four Patriot batteries out of Jordan, Bahrain and Kuwait. It was all part of the Pentagon’s new national defense strategy that pointed to China and Russia as key adversaries and the top priorities for the future.

But the rapidly escalating threat from Iran — which includes attacks against tankers and other commercial ships in the Gulf region as well as the strikes against Saudi facilities and US troops — has forced the US to reverse those moves and send even more of the high-tech systems to the region.

In addition to the Patriots, the US has also sent a THAAD anti-ballistic missile defense system, which complements the Patriots by providing a defense against ballistic missiles travelling outside the Earth’s atmosphere.

According to Army Lt Col Tom Noble, there are four Patriot batteries in Saudi Arabia, including the two at Prince Sultan Air Base. Noble, the commander of the Air Defence Artillery Battalion, said each battery has from six to nine truck-based missile launchers that routinely scour the air for threats.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9oamfr/article30689915.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USSAUDIARABIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-expands-troop-fighter-jet-presence-at-saudi-base/article30689916.ece

21,2020/01/30,U.S. hits Russian railroad with sanctions over Crimea,"The Trump administration has imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based private railway company that last month opened passenger service between Russia and Crimea, a Ukrainian peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014.

The sanctions target Grand Service Express, its CEO and seven people who were slapped with European Union sanctions earlier in the week for their role in organizing Russian local elections on Crimea in September. The EU and the US imposed economic sanctions on Russia after the annexation and refuse to recognise Moscow’s authority over the region.

The Treasury Department handed down the new sanctions on Wednesday two days before Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is due in Kyiv to meet with the Ukrainian president and other officials. They may be intended to send a message of support from the Trump administration during the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump over his dealings with Ukraine.

“Treasury’s action, taken in close coordination with our international allies and partners, reiterates our unwavering support for restoring free and fair democratic processes in Crimea,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

The sanctions may also serve to reduce the sting of Pompeo’s recent disparaging comment about Ukraine. Following an interview last week with NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly, she said he shouted obscenities at her for asking about Ukraine and asked whether she thought Americans really cared about the country.

The railway connection to Crimea was inaugurated in late December by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who rode a train across the 12-mile (19-kilometer) bridge.

22,2020/01/30,Death toll from New Zealand volcanic eruption rises to 21,"Another person who suffered critical injuries from an eruption of a New Zealand volcano last month has died, bringing the death toll to 21, police said Wednesday.

Police Deputy Commissioner John Tims said the person died Tuesday night at Auckland’s Middlemore Hospital. Police have not yet identified the victim. Tims said they would do so after the person’s wider family has been informed.

There were 47 people visiting the tourist destination of White Island when the volcano erupted December 9, killing 13 people initially and leaving more than two dozen others hospitalised with severe burns.

Eight more people have died in hospitals in New Zealand and Australia in the weeks since the eruption.

Experts say super-heated water that burst from beneath the crater’s surface caused the burns, which in some cases covered large portions of the victims’ bodies or damaged their lungs.

Many of those killed and injured were Australian tourists who had been travelling aboard the Royal Caribbean cruise ship Ovation of the Seas.

One of the people who died in the weeks after the eruption was 42-year-old Atlanta area woman Mayuari Singh, whose husband was also hospitalized with injuries.

American honeymooners Lauren Urey, 32, and Matthew Urey, 36, from Richmond, Virginia, were also hospitalized with injuries.

Their families said last month the couple had been progressing as well as could be hoped for given the extent of their injuries. Two weeks ago, the organizer of a crowd fundraising effort for the Ureys said the couple hoped to return home soon.

New Zealand authorities are investigating the circumstances around the disaster. Many have questioned why tourists were allowed on the island after its alert level was raised by authorities three weeks before the eruption.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tarfrb/article30689624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKNEWZEALANDVOLCANOERUPTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/death-toll-from-new-zealand-volcanic-eruption-rises-to-21/article30689625.ece
23,2020/01/30,Iranian factory makes U.S. and Israeli flags to burn,"Business is booming at Iran's largest flag factory which makes U.S., British and Israeli flags for Iranian protesters to burn.

At the factory in the town of Khomein, southwest of the capital Tehran, young men and women print the flags by hand then hang them up to dry. The factory produces about 2,000 U.S. and Israeli flags a month in its busiest periods, and more than 1.5 million square feet of flags a year.

Tensions between the United States and Iran have reached the highest level in decades after top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq days later.

In state-sponsored rallies and protests in Iran, demonstrators regularly burn the flags of Israel, U.S. and Britain.

Ghasem Ghanjani, who owns the Diba Parcham flag factory, said: “We have no problem with the American and British people. We have [a] problem with their governors. We have [a] problem with their presidents, with the wrong policy they have.”

“The people of America and Israel know that we have no problem with them. If people burn the flags of these countries at different rallies, it is only to show their protest.”

Rezaei, a quality control manager, who declined to give her first name, said, “compared to the cowardly actions of the United States, such as General Soleimani's assassination, this [burning an American flag] is a minimal thing against them. This is the least that can be done.”

For hardliners, anti-American sentiment has always been central to Iran's Islamic revolution, and Iran's clerical rulers continue to denounce the United States as the Great Satan.

Last November, however, many Iranians took to the streets to protest against the country's top authorities, chanting “our enemy is not the U.S., our enemy is here.”

24,2020/01/30,BBC to cut an estimated 450 jobs in modernisation plan,"The BBC has said that plans to “modernise” the British broadcaster’s newsroom will lead to the loss of an estimated 450 jobs.

The cuts represent a substantial blow to the national public service broadcaster, which has a worldwide reputation for high quality news and entertainment programs.

BBC News employs about 6,000 people, including 1,700 outside the UK, according to an article about the job cuts on its website.

Fran Unsworth, BBC’s director of news and current affairs, said the streamlining will be carried out with an eye on digital journalism.

“We need to reshape BBC News for the next decade in a way which saves substantial amounts of money,” Unsworth said on Wednesday. “We are spending too much of our resources on traditional linear broadcasting and not enough on digital.”

The broadcaster said it wants to “reduce duplication” while saving 80 million pounds (USD 105 million) in costs.

Like traditional news outlets throughout the world, the publicly funded BBC faces financial and political pressure in a fast-changing media landscape.

Both supporters and critics of Brexit have criticized BBC’s coverage of the UK’s impending departure from the European Union. Some officials in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative government have suggested changing the BBC’s funding model.

The broadcaster currently is funded largely through a 154 pound (USD 200) annual fee paid by every household with a television. It is not state-controlled, although the government sets the terms of the broadcaster’s charter, which is renewed once a decade.

The broadcaster also received negative coverage over the salaries of some in the news division that were regarded as too high and for a gap between what the BBC’s women journalists made compared to male counterparts.

The announced news operation cuts were not fully detailed. Some shows, including the current affairs and debate program Victoria Derbyshire, will be eliminated, while the flagship daily news program Newsnight will produce fewer long pieces.

Other cuts target positions at national radio service 5 Live and at the English language morning news World Update program of the BBC World Service.

25,2020/01/30,United States Federal Reserve holds its policy rate but eyes virus outbreak,"The U.S. Federal Reserve held its policy interest rate steady on Wednesday, but again said it is monitoring “global developments” to decide its next move.

Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell said, however, that while the global economy seems to have stabilized, the deadly virus outbreak in China presents a potential risk.

The SARS-like outbreak in China has left over 130 people dead and thousands sickened, while airlines have cancelled flights and businesses have been shuttered. That could undermine other major economies if global supply chains that flow from China are disrupted.

“There will clearly be implications at least in the near term for Chinese output and I would guess for some of their close neighbours,” Mr. Powell told reporters following the policy meeting. However, “the situation is really in its early stages and it’s very uncertain about how far it will spread and what the macro-economic effects will be,” he said. “We are very carefully monitoring the situation.”

Cautious optimism

There remains grounds for “cautious optimism” about the global outlook,” Mr. Powell said, but “none of this is assured” given continued uncertainties, including the impact of the virus outbreak.

The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee left the benchmark interest rate steady in the target range of 1.5-1.75%, as expected, at the end of its two-day meeting. Policymakers also signalled that they want to see U.S. inflation push a bit higher, to hit the 2.0% Fed target.

After cutting rates three times last year in their effort to buoy the economy amid President Donald Trump’s multi-front trade wars, this is the second policy meeting where the central bank has made no move. The statement Wednesday repeated that policymakers will “continue to monitor the implications of incoming inflation for the economic outlook including global developments and muted inflation pressures.”

Inflation goal

The Fed’s statement however focuses mostly on the domestic economy, noting that household spending has been “rising at a moderate pace,” a slightly less upbeat view than in December.

Slowing consumer spending on top of “weak” business investments and exports could undercut the Fed’s ability to meet its inflation goal, which is running at just 1.5%. The statement tinkered with the wording from December to stress that the policy is aimed at “inflation returning to the Committee’s symmetric two percent inflation objective.”

The decision, though widely expected, is unlikely to please Mr. Trump, who has repeatedly berated the Fed and called on Mr. Powell to slash rates to zero to supercharge the U.S. economy, which the President says is at a disadvantage against foreign economies with lower rates.

“The Fed should get smart & lower the Rate to make our interest competitive with other Countries which pay much lower even though we are, by far, the high standard,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “We would then focus on paying off & refinancing debt! There is almost no inflation-this is the time (2 years late)!”

In a technical move, the Fed also slightly raised the interest it offers to banks with cash on deposit at the central bank, bumping it up to 1.6% from 1.55%, reversing the rate cut in September.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/qtntt8/article30688086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OJ06Ijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/united-states-federal-reserve-holds-its-policy-rate-but-eyes-virus-outbreak/article30688078.ece

Her 80-year-old father was the fourth confirmed case in France of the new coronavirus that has killed more than 100 people since it emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. “A fifth case has been detected,” Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said at a news briefing.

“It’s the daughter of the Chinese tourist who was hospitalised recently in intensive care,” Buzyn added.

The woman in her thirties, “whose condition has worsened, who needs oxygen,” has also been placed in intensive care, Ms. Buzyn said.

27,2020/01/30,Greta Thunberg patents own name and ‘Fridays for Future’,"Teen eco-warrior Greta Thunberg said Wednesday she has registered both her own name and her “Fridays For Future” global protest movement as trademarks in order to prevent them from being hijacked for fraudulent purposes.

“My name and the #FridaysForFuture movement are constantly being used for commercial purposes without any consent whatsoever,” the 17-year-old Swede wrote on her Instagram account. “I assure you, I and the other school strikers have absolutely no interests in trademarks. But unfortunately it needs to be done.”

She complained that “there are still people who are trying to impersonate me or falsely claim that they ‘represent’ me in order to communicate with high profile people, politicians, media, artists etc.”

‘Forced into trademarking’

There had also been instances of marketing, product selling and people collecting money “in my and the movement’s name,” she wrote. “That is why I've applied to register my name, Fridays For Future,... as trademarks. This action is to protect the movement and its activities.”

Ms. Thunberg, whose protests have attracted millions of young people across the globe, also said she was setting up a non-profit making foundation to handle the financial side of “Fridays for Future”, such as book royalties, donations and prize money.

She insisted that the foundation would be “completely transparent,” for example, with regard to the taxes it has to pay. “The foundation’s aim will be to promote ecological, climatic and social sustainability, as well as mental health,” the campaigner wrote.

Ms. Thunberg’s climate struggle began quietly in August 2018 when she skipped school for the first three weeks, and then on Fridays to spend the day outside Sweden’s parliament with a sign labelled “School strike for climate”. Since then, she has become the face behind the global protest movement, particularly for young people.

Ms. Thunberg has also come under ferocious attack from climate changes deniers, who accuse her of being manipulated by a “green lobby”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/264uwn/article30689516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001O24JUjpgasdhlkasjd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greta-thunberg-patents-own-name-and-fridays-for-future/article30689519.ece
28,2020/01/30,European Parliament debates anti-CAA motion; vote delayed till March,"A joint motion, combining five different resolutions tabled by Members of the European Parliament against India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act, was debated at the Plenary session in Brussels, with an expected vote on the motion on Thursday postponed until March.

The debate opened with a statement by Helena Dalli, the Vice-President of the European Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who spoke strongly in favour of the “rich, frank and open” relationship the European Union (EU) shares with India.

She highlighted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Brussels in March for the 15th India-EU Summit. “We believe that it is the role of the Supreme Court of India to assess the compliance of the law with the Constitution and we are confident that the ongoing judicial process will contribute to appeasing the tensions and violence witnessed over the past weeks in the country,” said Dalli, who concluded the debate with a message to “pursue and intensify” dialogue with India as a “respected democracy” and valued EU partner.

Two Indian-origin MEPs, Dinesh Dhamija and Neena Gill, were among a host of members who spoke up in India’s favour to point out elements of “disinformation” around the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) within the parliamentary motion. Thierry Mariani, a French MEP, alluded to the “hand of Pakistan” in the motion being tabled, while others condemned it as meddling in another country’s internal affairs.

Pakistan-origin MEP Shaffaq Mohammed and others such as S&D’s John Howarth and VERTS/ALE’s Scott Ainslie described the CAA as a “highly discriminatory” legislation and alleged that the EU had crumbled in the face of India’s diplomatic lobby and prioritised trade and business interests over human rights concerns by postponing a vote on the motion.

“The only lobby that has won today is that of common sense and respect,” countered ECR’s Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki.

Earlier, the European Parliament had announced that the vote on the motion would be postponed to the Plenary session in March. “Following a decision by MEPs at the opening of Wednesday Plenary session in Brussels, the vote on the resolution on India’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) 2019 has been postponed to the March session,” said a statement from the European Parliament.

Ongoing legal process

One of the groups behind the motion, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), said the reason for the postponement was because the CAA was undergoing a legal process in India.

“As the Supreme Court in India will rule in the coming days linked to this issue and, as such, the law may be adapted, it was considered better to vote on the resolution in the European Parliament when there is full clarity on the situation,” a spokesperson said.

However, another group GUE/NGL, objected to the postponement, saying they “disagreed” with the delay. Meanwhile, the government sources in Delhi claimed a diplomatic victory over the vote delay and said friends of India prevailed over those of Pakistan in the European Parliament.

“Strenuous efforts of outgoing British MEP Shaffaq Mohammad to have a resolution passed by the European Parliament against India on the penultimate day before Brexit were defeated,” a source said.

The motion takes note of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) statement last month, which described the CAA as “fundamentally discriminatory in nature”, and also of other UN as well as the European Union (EU) guidelines on human rights as it calls on the Indian government to “repeal the discriminatory amendments“.

The debate on CAA on Wednesday followed the European Parliament’s historic ratification of the Brexit bill, under which the UK is set to formally leave the economic bloc on Friday.

‘Needs to be holistic in nature’

“While the CAA’s stated goal of protecting persecuted groups is welcome, an effective national asylum and refugee policy should be just and holistic in nature and apply to all those in need,” notes the motion, which describes the CAA as “discriminatory in nature and dangerously divisive“.

The Indian government has maintained that the CAA, which was passed by the Indian Parliament last month, is an internal matter of the country and stressed that the goal is to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries. It has been extremely critical of the move in Brussels, which the European Commission — the executive arm of the economic bloc — has sought to distance itself from.

“As members of Inter Parliamentary Union, we should respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures, especially in democracies,” Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Monday wrote to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli.

The European Parliament motion is critical of any protection being denied to Muslims and that even though India also shares a border with Bhutan, Burma, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the CAA does not bring Sri Lankan Tamils under its purview, who form the largest refugee group in India and who have been resident in the country for over 30 years.

“Amnesty International India has pointed out that the CAA does not bring under its purview other persecuted minorities, including Muslim populations such as the Rohingya in Burma, Ahmadis in Pakistan, Hazaras in Afghanistan and Bihari Muslims in Bangladesh,” it noted.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/dhc6c2/article30689485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30JANHOLOCAUST-MEMORIALEU-PARLIAMENTjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/european-parliament-debates-anti-caa-motion-vote-delayed-till-march/article30689423.ece
29,2020/01/30,36 killed in suspected militia massacre in eastern Congo,"Thirty-six people have been killed in a suspected militia attack in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo region of Beni, where hundreds have died in violence since November, a local official said Wednesday.

Congolese troops have been carrying out a military operation on an armed group in the east of the country — long plagued by various militias — and militiamen have responded with a series of massacres against civilians.

“They were all hacked to death. This brings (the toll) to 36 bodies,” local Beni Governor Donat Kibwana told AFP, updating casualties from Tuesday’s attack. Officials had earlier reported 15 fatalities.

Two admitted for surgery

Two people with skull fractures caused by machetes have been admitted to the hospital in Oicha for surgery, an AFP reporter there said. The main attack took place late Tuesday in Manzingi, a village 20 km northwest from Oicha, while a pastor was also killed in nearby Eringeti.

According to a toll compiled by a civil society organisation, the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), 265 people have now been killed in the Beni region since the army began its crackdown on the armed group, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), on October 30.

The massacres seem to be a tactic by the ADF to frighten the population into silence, local commentators say. The group has also disrupted operations to curb an outbreak of Ebola in North Kivu province. Tuesday’s massacre occurred to the west of the ADF’s usual area of operations, which is closer to the Ugandan border. The army offensive, unfolding in thick forest and jungle, has led to what the military say is the capture of the group’s headquarters and the killing of five of its six leaders.

Brutal militia

The ADF, blamed for the deaths of more than a thousand civilians in Beni since October 2014, began as an Islamist-rooted rebel group in Uganda that opposed Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.

It fell back into eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995 during the Congo Wars and appears to have halted raids inside Uganda. Its recruits today are people of various nationalities. U.N. experts estimated the ADF in 2018 to number around 450 fighters.

A report to the U.N. Security Council last week said the ADF seemed to follow an extreme Islamist ideology, but there is no information on whether the group had links with international jihadist groups. The spate of massacres has become a major challenge for President Felix Tshisekedi, who took office a year ago last Friday.

In November, angry protests erupted in the city of Beni, the region’s administrative hub, as citizens accused the U.N. Peacekeeping Force in DR Congo of failing to protect them. Mr. Tshisekedi, in his first State-of-the-Nation address to Congress, last month said he had changed the army command in Beni and sent 22,000 troops to the region.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/tbnj52/article30688041.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OI8YCjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/36-killed-in-suspected-militia-massacre-in-eastern-congo/article30688037.ece
30,2020/01/30,"What has my father got to do with my Padma Shri, asks Adnan Sami","Pakistani-origin musician Adnan Sami , in the headlines for his Padma Shri, says he is an artiste and he has nothing to do with politics but his name is being dragged into controversy by some people to further their agenda.

Mr. Sami , who became an Indian citizen in 2016 and had expressed his “infinite gratitude” at being chosen for the government award, also asked what his father had to do with his award.

His father’s past as a Pakistani Air Force pilot has drawn criticism but Mr. Sami finds this argument “irrelevant“.

“My father was a decorated fighter pilot and he was a professional soldier. He did his duty for his country. I respect him for that. It was his life. He got awarded for that.

“I did not benefit or credit from that. Similarly he cannot get credit for what I do. What does my award have to do with my father? It is irrelevant,” Mr. Sami told PTI in an interview.

Mr. Sami , who is among the 118 Padma Shri awardees this year, is in the centre of controversy with the BJP saying he is highly deserving of the award and the opposition Congress and NCP questioning his merit.

The 46-year-old composer-singer was also involved in an unseemly Twitter spat with Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill.

He said he shared a good relationship with people across the political spectrum.

“People who are criticising are some minor politicians. They are doing it because of some political agenda that they have and it has nothing to do with me. I am not a politician, I am a musician,” Mr. Sami said.

“They have their own political agenda and issues with the government and they are using my name as another stepney to try and further their agenda,” he added.

Politicians such as Maharashtra Minorities Development Minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik called the recognition to Mr. Sami a damage control move by the ruling BJP government at the Centre for being questioned over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens.

Mr. Sami said he is ready to face personal and professional criticism but dragging his name into politics is uncalled for.

“I am dragged into it because of politics and not because of my art. The irony of all this is that all these wonderful, rosy sentences that art knows no boundaries or art is above politics, why don’t they practise that? Leave art and artistes out of this nonsense,” he added.

'Got Naushad award during Cong. regime'

Mr. Sami said he was conferred with the Naushad award during the Congress government’s rule and he was a Pakistani citizen at the time.

“Now I am an Indian citizen, perfectly entitled to be given this award. They are bringing the Pakistani element, it is funny, hilarious. They are picking up on something because they don’t have anything else to pick up on.

“These are all junior guys, either they are trying to become relevant and some of them don’t know that their seniors are so respectful. I am friends with everybody, whether it’s the BJP or the Congress. I am a musician. I share love through my music,” Mr. Sami said.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cqgl2h/article14443897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Adnan-Sam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/what-has-my-father-got-to-do-with-my-padma-shri-asks-adnan-sami/article30690667.ece
31,2020/01/30,Code green at Australian Open,"What can 1,88,708 used PET bottles do to the environment? A lot of damage, actually. But thanks to Tennis Australia and Tirupur-based garments company NC John & Sons, they have been given new life as apparel for ball boys, girls, and courstside statisticians at the ongoing Australian Open tennis tournament. The company has tailored 25,000 garments for the tournament, all of them 100% recycled polyester.

Seated in his office at the Small Industries Development Corporation (SIDCO) campus in Tirupur, Alexander Neroth, CEO of NC John & Sons, shows us T-shirts, leggings, shorts, zipper-jackets and tennis dresses that his company made as part of the order. In aqua blue, white, and green, the apparel is made of polyester filament yarn from recycled plastic bottles.

“We got the yarn imported from Taiwan,” explains the 46-year-old. “The fabric,” he adds, “Was knitted and dyed in Surat, and brought to Tirupur. Our team of around 100 tailors, most of them women, created the outfits based on the designs from Tennis Australia.”

For Alexander, whose company has been making sustainable apparel since 2007, this is business as usual. But he does add that he is happy that their work has put them in the spotlight.

“We got the order from Tennis Australia through one of our customers in Australia,” he explains, adding that his company has been chiefly exporting garments to the US and the UK. “The team visited us in November last year to ensure that the entire process was green.”

In fact, 40% of the power consumed by SIDCO in Tirupur is from wind and solar energy. Alexander, however, wishes that more industries in the textile and knit wear hub, located on the banks of the Noyyal river 52 kilometres from Coimbatore, come forward to tap into the market polyester has to offer.

This is also among the reasons why Alexander’s recycled garments have not entered the Indian market yet. But he hopes to sell in India soon. “People in our country are by nature concerned about the environment,” he feels, adding, “In a year or two, we plan to launch our own brand.” Polyester, however, is often not considered to be on a par with cotton — a lot of people prefer the latter for its natural properties.

Alexander is now getting a lot of enquiries for his sustainable apparel — his company also does clothes in organic cotton blends and recycled cotton. “We started making apparel with 100% recycled polyester a couple of years ago. Right now, 90% of what we do is sustainable. Soon, we hope to reach the 100% mark,” he explains.

Alexander just received an email from a leading cricketer’s brand. “Imagine if the Indian cricket team wore our T-shirts,” he says. “I will be much happier then: the entire nation will get to see them.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/q7pbzf/article30692669.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPAUSTRALIANOPENTENNIS2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/code-green-at-australian-open/article30692670.ece
32,2020/01/30,Made with mud: At the Earthen Architecture Workshop in Pollachi,"The central table at the dining hall in Iyal Farms in Sethumadai is strewn with sand, marble powder and lime. “These are the basic ingredients for lime plastering, a traditional method followed around the world,” says Coimbatore-based architect Srinath Gowtham. Thirty three students from Rathinam School of Architecture are busy following his instructions. They are part of an Earthen Architecture Workshop organised by Pollachi Papyrus. Srinath and his partner Vinoth Kumar focus on sustainable architecture. “Different regions have developed methods based on the resources easily available there. But, with time, people moved on to use cement loaded with chemicals. Once used, the cement loses its binding properties, unlike mud and lime that can be reused,” explains Srinath.

Vinoth now takes a tile and demonstrates a plastering technique practised around Puducherry and Cuddalore. Lime, river sand and marble powder is spread roughly on the tile before the next layer of lime, marble powder, egg white and coconut oil is added. “The egg white and oil gives it a natural shine. Colours can also be added,” Vinoth says. He uses natural colour powders made out of mud and stones that he sourced from Rajasthan. Once the layer dries, it is polished with a flat stone. “It takes a lot of time for beginners but, with practice, one gets better,” Vinoth is reassuring. By the end of the session, the central table is laid with freshly plastered tiles.

The next task is to make a mud wall. Students mix soil, sand, and straw with water and roll them into balls. “The straw adds strength,” explains Srinath. These mud balls are flattened and laid on top of one other over the stone foundation till they reach the desired height. “The most important thing in constructing mud houses is the technique. It can last for generations but, if not done properly, it can affect the structure’s life.”

Srinath and Vinoth met when they were both at SVS School of Architecture, Coimbatore. “After college, we visited Auroville where we met architect Manu Gopalan, who focuses on sustainable buildings. We worked under him for four years and that experience changed our lives. We learnt about sustainability and its importance. We felt that we should share this knowledge with others and came back to Coimbatore. We now hold workshops on sustainable architecture and also take up projects under the name Bhutha Earthen Architecture Studio. In the past six months, we have done five sessions,” says Vinoth.

Srinath says that one of the biggest misconception about mud houses is that “they will look like little huts”. He refutes this by saying, “We have even built three-storeyed structures using this method. The roofing is done with tiles and wood.” The duo say that the knowledge of sustainable architecture has increased over the years. “There are many people who are interested in going back to the old ways. It is a positive sign.” But it has limitations too. “It is labour intensive and time consuming. It will take at least one year to build one house. But, in the end, we are not harming Nature,” says Vinod.

33,2020/01/30,"Meet Ani, the Samaritan in Thiruvananthapuram, with the ‘green’ auto","Saagar alias Ani looks surprised when I address him by his name after hailing his autorickshaw down. But then, Ani and his autorickshaw are famous in and around Medical College.

His autorickshaw is a mobile mini garden, a rare sight in the city. Potted moneyplant, butterfly pea, aloe vera and holy basil (tulsi), to name a few, are tied to the sides of his autorickshaw.

On the dashboard are rosaries and images of gods and goddesses. An empty bird cage has a plastic container with fish in it. The roof of his autorickshaw has colourful toy planes that bob up and down when he drives. A post on the back of his autorickshaw announces free trips for Cancer patients. An autorickshaw driver, Ani, is a go-to person for many at Medical College, especially at the Regional Cancer Centre (RCC).

“Many who see my autorickshaw, or hear about me by word of mouth, come up to me. Those who visit RCC often don’t have a clue as to where to go, what to do, who to approach... RCC is a like a sea and when they ask, I help direct them to the right people and place. When they tell me that they don’t have a place to stay or lack funds to stay in hotels, I take them to either free or cheap shelters. A few of these shelters even provide free food. Some people need blood donors and I arrange it for them. If the blood group they seek matches mine, I donate mine,” says Ani, who arranges drinking water for patients and visitors to RCC daily.

Having lost his parents when he was young, Ani, a class two dropout, started doing odd jobs from an early age. He was a “local goon” by the time he was in his teens and was in and out of prison.

A few police officers he had befriended advised him to mend his ways. “And so I started doing odd jobs and also worked as a coconut plucker.” It was while he was on a job plucking coconuts that “I met Sathyaseelan sir.”

A former army doctor, Sathyaseelan took Ani under his wings and encouraged him to turn his life around. “He was the one who encouraged me to get an autorickshaw,” says Ani, who bought the vehicle three years ago and has since made the three-wheeler his residence.

“My brother and I gave our property to our younger sister when she got married. My brother stays with his wife and family. I, unfortunately, don’t have a family or a home. My autorickshaw is my home now. I sleep in my auto, freshen up at a nearby temple pond and go about my work. By the way, my real name is Shajikumar and my pet name is Ani. A radio jockey who interviewed me christened me Saagar alias Ani and the name stuck,” says the 40-year-old, who hails from Sreekariyam.

Ani, who does odd jobs to make ends meet, says: “I wanted to do something meaningful with my life and helping cancer patients seemed like the right choice. I find a sense of satisfaction in helping them, especially children who travel in my vehicle. The toy planes, the plants, the fish... it keeps the children entertained and they forget their pain for those few minutes in my auto. The plants especially help fight the blues.”

Ani, who lives frugally so that he can use whatever he earns to help the patients at the hospital, says some, however, laugh at him for his way of life. “But I am content. The smile I see on the children’s faces when they enter my auto is worth every penny I spend towards helping my passengers.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/cxqjdp/article30692221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvmAni2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ani-provides-free-rides-to-cancer-patients-in-his-mini-garden-autorickshaw-in-thiruvanananthapuram/article30692222.ece

Emerging as a new face of the mainstream parties in J&K setting an “achievable agenda”, Mr. Baig speaks on how politics was shaping up after the dilution of the special status.

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti made two speeches in Delhi and Srinagar where she warned that “there will be no one to unfurl the tri-colour in case Article 370 is touched” and “those hands will burn too.” You recently unfurled the flag at the PDP office in Jammu.

I am patron of the party like Mufti Muhammad Sayeed. A patron is supposed to give advice on the policy matters of serious implications on the situation in J&K. Both these statements were made without my knowledge. Unfortunately, I don’t know how to describe them. Initially, I thought these statements were made in anger and out of some emotional disturbance. On second thought, it came to my mind that a person who has been a chief minister would not make such statements unless somebody had misled her into making them. I wish I could talk to her and at some stage we meet and she apprises me of the situation which led her to make them. Those statements did not help the State of J&K. Article 370 was on the BJP’s agenda but downgrading of the State to UT, I fail to understand the circumstances. Maybe they were annoyed by certain postures of the NC and the PDP. Both decided against participating in panchayat and municipal elections. Maybe, the Centre was annoyed by this.

Of late, you have been arguing that the discourse on J&K has changed. How?

There was a time when the discourse on J&K was [about] plebiscite. Today (Pakistan prime minister) Imran Khan says Kashmir should have autonomy, even the U.S. says autonomy. The discourse has changed from independence to autonomy. I am of the view that J&K should get what is possible within the Constitution.

Your recent statements have set a new premise for mainstream politics in J&K. Do you suggest that once the incarcerated regional leadership like National Conference (NC) president Dr. Farooq Abdullah, vice-president Omar Abdullah and the PDP president are released, they need to start anew?

The release of the three leaders will not help. Instead, all the leaders, who have participated in the elections, won or defeated, in the past, and braved the situation, should be released. Once released, they (the leaders) should sit together and in a civilised and responsible manner assess the situation we are in. The current situation is that Article 370 and Article 35A, safeguarding land and jobs, do not exist. The issue is before the Supreme Court. If the final judgment is in favour of the Centre, then we need to come up with practical solutions, taking into account all religious, regional and linguistic groups. So that there will be some degree of safety achieved, dignity and reinstatement in their own eyes. The North-East in fact has a special provision under Article 371, which gives protection on land and jobs somewhat like Article 35A. The same benefit should be extended to J&K. Besides, the sooner the better for statehood to be restored in J&K. In a Union Territory (UT), most powers rest with the Centre and the Lt. Governor, who may or may not consult the Council of Ministers to take the decisions. A UT offers a disempowered structure for the elected representatives to take decision on economic, employment, social and development issues. We have to be unanimous in our demands.

Are you suggesting all regional parties need to come together?

Yes, all, including people from Jammu, should sit around a table and rise above partisan politics and opportunism. We have ethnic identity groups like Dogras, Gujjars, Paharis and Kashmiris in J&K and Article 371 precisely addresses their insecurities.

Will you reach out to other political parties on this?

As soon as they [leaders] are released, it will be my attempt to request them to get together and apply their mind in a responsible and sustained manner. The Centre as well as Members of Parliament (MPs) who voted in favour of degrading the State of J&K to UTs need to be approached. One needs to work hard with patience, perseverance and politeness. No government anywhere will succumb to pressure. A government needs to be persuaded. The demand, however, should be practicable.

We did see the coming together of the regional parties on August 4 when the Gupkar Declaration was signed? Where does that declaration stand as of now?

The Gupkar Declaration was overtaken by the events thereafter. The declaration perhaps did not reach the Prime Minister’s Office. Now, it all depends on the Supreme Court and its final judgment on Article 370 and Article 35A.

Altaf Bukhari, a former legislator, is also thinking on the lines you seem to propagate. Are you two joining hands in the future?

It took them two months to repeat the ideas I floated earlier. I welcome their support though. We did meet once since August 5 but did not discuss what his intentions are and his politics is. I know of my view and the reasons why I hold certain viewpoints now. I can’t peep into their conscience. Yes, the suggestions I had given earlier figured later in their statements.

J&K’s mainstream also has to face the Hurriyat at some point?

I can’t predict the future, even prophets could not. I don’t see the Hurriyat Conference playing any important role. I think they have seen where the path of confrontation can take us. There was a time in 2010 and 2016 that a parliamentary delegation, comprising all political parties, was mandated to talk to the Hurriyat, listen to them and find an honourable solution. Unfortunately, in 2016, the doors were not opened even to the parliamentary delegation. I hope if the Hurriyat wants to play any role now it must be practically achievable, otherwise human lives are wasted. Our trade and tourism is gone and our youth are unemployed and education has suffered. Development is very poor. The politics of confrontation will result in frustration and not happiness in the lives of people of J&K.

Your party always stressed addressing the external dimension of the J&K problem, which is Pakistan?

My view is based on history. After the 1971 Shimla agreement, India and Pakistan have committed to each other to sort out differences on J&K through the process of dialogue. I hope sooner or later that is what happens. Besides, out of 84,000 square miles of erstwhile J&K, 42,000 sq miles are with India, 30,000 sq miles with Pakistan and 12,000 sq miles of the most strategic importance is with China. So when we talk about the resolution of J&K nobody talks about China and the territory under it. In future, the time may come when all the three countries find ways to sort out the differences so that the people of J&K in all the three regions live in peace and prosperity.

The PDP saw cross-Line of Control (LoC) trade and travel as means to address local aspirations. It stands closed now.

It was indeed in the self-rule document. The background was that former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had gone to Pakistan and even PM Manmohan Singh was reaching out to Pakistan. At that stage, I requested late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed to see if we can make any suggestions since we are the affected party. I wrote a document, called self-rule, at that time, as it was assumed that Article 370 and 35A will continue. So a lot of suggestions were made. We also pushed for desirability of open routes, trade and exchange of teachers and students. But things have changed, and will now depend on the outcome of the judgment of the SC. If the SC restores the pre-August 5 position, that will be one situation in which we have to look at things again. My position is that we must learn lessons from Europe and all the three countries — India, Pakistan and China — should sit down and resolve the issue of erstwhile J&K.

Do you see reunification of Ladakh with J&K?

I don’t see reunification happening. I was Ladakh Affairs Minister in the past. I don't think people of Ladakh would like to be under the old arrangement, having strong feelings for other arrangements.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ohvnoj/article30695417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31TH-BG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/discourse-on-kashmir-has-changed-from-independence-to-autonomy-muzaffar-hussain-baig/article30695418.ece
35,2020/01/30,Gandhiji’s killing: 'The Hindu' releases book,"Veteran scientist Dr. M.S. Swaminathan released a special publication on the Mahatma Gandhi assassination trial titled The Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi – Trial & Verdict 1948-49 published by The Hindu, as part of the History Series.

The special publication is a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary year. Releasing the book at his house on Thursday evening in the presence of N. Ram, Chairman, THG Publishing Pvt Ltd., Dr. Swaminathan said it was a moving moment for him, as he was present at Birla House when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated.

The 456-page volume takes the reader through an archival tour beginning with the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and ending with the findings of the J.L. Kapur Commission. Subsequent developments, information on his death obtained through an RTI query and the Supreme Court’s order on not re-opening the trial of the assassination have been added to give the reader an update. The book will be available for purchase next week and can be pre-ordered.

“It is one of the saddest moments [in my life],” Dr. Swaminathan said while recalling that fateful day. He said he had not planned on going to Birla House that day, but went for the prayer meeting only as an afterthought.

Prayer meetings

“Those prayer meetings were very interesting — [people of] all religions were there. Suddenly there was commotion. I was sitting at the back. Someone said Gandhiji had been shot. In 10-15 minutes, Lord Mountbatten arrived. They said after half an hour that he [Gandhi] is no more. The whole area changed to one of mourning,” he said.

He recalled that both Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel were too distraught to make any arrangements.

“Lord Mountbatten was in charge. That’s how they got a gun-carriage to carry his body. Once you have called it official mourning, it became necessary,” he said.

Dr. Swaminathan talked about the time Gandhiji visited his house in Kumbakonam and how his mother had asked him to donate the gold chain and bangle he was wearing to Gandhiji so that they could be auctioned, and the money used for the uplift of Dalits and temple entry.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2ijpky/article30695298.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THLTBOOKRELEASE-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/the-hindu-releases-book-on-gandhi-killing/article30695299.ece
36,2020/01/30,"Address EU’s concerns on CAA, says U.K. High Commissioner Sir Dominique Asquith","India should address the concerns regarding the new citizenship law, the envoy of the United Kingdom said here on Thursday.

High Commissioner Sir Dominique Asquith’s comment came even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) maintained that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, is an internal matter of the country.

“We noted what the government said that, ‘together with all, development for all, trust for all’, and I believe that is the manifested commitment of this government and I trust that it will continue to address the concerns that have been expressed. But that is for the Indian government and the Indian people,” Sir Dominique said.

The High Commissioner’s remarks came days after an anti-India gathering was allowed outside the Indian High Commission in London on January 26.

The envoy said U.K. could not stop protests on its soil as that is part of the democratic culture.

The comments came during the farewell press conference of the High Commissioner before he returns home at the end of his stint.

The EU Parliament had on Wednesday discussed a joint motion against the CAA. Voting on the resolution, however, has been shifted to the end of March in view of the March 13 visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Brussels for the EU-India summit.

Sir Dominique referred to the protests against the new law that are being reported from across the country, saying, “There are protests in every democracy. I can’t pick up a newspaper (that doesn't have) reports and commentary on the Citizenship Act.”

No violation: MEA

The MEA on Thursday, however, reiterated that the new citizenship law that guarantees citizenship for non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, is an internal matter of India.

During the discussion in the EU Parliament, MEPs pointed out that the citizenship law breaches India’s international commitments. EU-India strategic ties are based on shared democratic values, respect for human rights and equality before law and it appears that the CAA goes against such international understandings that India has entered into in the past.

“We are not violating any of the international laws and covenants which are in place. We see the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in a completely different light compared to some of the members of the EU Parliament,” Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/x0ufcx/article30695449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31DOMINICASQUITH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/address-eus-concerns-on-caa-says-uk-high-commissioner-sir-dominique-asquith/article30695450.ece
37,2020/01/30,Thrissur on high alert after coronavirus case,"Thrissur in Kerala has been put on high alert after one of the four persons admitted to the isolation ward of the district general hospital with symptoms of novel coronavirus infection (nCoV), tested positive. The other three persons tested negative for the virus. The condition of the patient is stable, according to Health Department sources.

A 24-hour control room has been set up at the District Medical Office and the district Collectorate.

The student had reached Kolkata from Wuhan, China, on the night of January 23. She travelled to Kochi the next day and reached the airport around 3 p.m. in an Indigo flight. She reached her hometown Thrissur by 10 p.m.

Getting to know about the alert the next day from the news media, she reached the nearest primary health centre at Mathilakam to inform the Health officials about her travel. As she had not shown any symptoms of flu, she was advised to remain home for 28 days and maintain personal hygiene besides wearing mask. She was also given a contact number in case she developed any fever or cough or other symptoms of flu. On January 27, she contacted the District Surveillance Officer when she developed flu symptoms. The district team reached her house and moved her to the isolation ward at the Thrissur General Hospital.

The same day, her body fluid sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. On Thursday morning, the NIV informed that the case was positive.

People, who were in contact with the student person have been put under house quarantine. The Health Department is also tracking and identifying persons who may have come into contact with her.

Isolation wards ready

Special isolation rooms have been set up in government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thrissur, to treat cases of nCoV infections. In all, 20 pay-ward rooms have been vacated to make the special arrangements. The isolation ward has been set up according to Standard Operative Procedure.

“The MCH is ready to take up the challenge. A special medical team has been readied. Safety measures and medicines are in place. Steps have been taken to take care of safety of doctors and other workers,” according to RMO C.P. Murali.

The infected patient may be shifted to the MCH, Thrissur, on Thursday night after a Rapid Reaction medical team, who will reach here with the Health Minister, examine her.

The Health Department has asked people, who returned from China, to report without any delay. The officials have asked people visiting general hospital and the area around it to wear masks.

“People need not panic. But we need to take preventive measures. Wash hands with soap and water frequently. Cover mouth and nose with medical mask or tissue when sneezing or coughing. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever or cough. Seek medical help in case of fever, cough or difficulty in breathing,” officials said.

Senior Health officials told The Hindu that the airport Health authorities had put up information for travellers from China to contact the Health Services for any enquiry on corona virus at Disha 0471- 2552056 or 1056.

The Health Ministry also advised that those with a travel history to China after their return should — for a period of 14 days — sleep in a separate room, limit contact with other family members and avoid visitors and close contact with anyone with cold or flu like symptoms (maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from any individual).

“Thermal screening sensors are operational and few more such equipment are being procured. The immigration and other staff members at the airports have been sensitized and dedicated ambulances are placed at ports. We also held mock drill for checking preparedness and management of possible cases. Deployment of medical and para-medical staff is also being done for round-the-clock service,” the official said. He added that hospitals have prepared isolation wards while personal protection equipments and masks are available in adequate quantity in all the States/UTs.

Jugal Kishore, director professor and head of department-community medicine, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC) said: “There is no vaccine or drug available against the virus. Only symptomatic treatment is available. We still don’t know how the virus will behave in the new population. Prevention and strict surveillance is very important in India.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/tftpjy/article30695754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Thrissur-KKNajeeb,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/thrissur-on-high-alert-after-coronavirus-case/article30695657.ece

The State government is in the process of recruiting more than 8000 police constables in which 33% seats have been earmarked for women.

However, as per the recruitment rules framed by the authorities, in case the seats meant for upper castes or general category women remain vacant for lack of adequate candidates, then the same will be filled with general category men, causing major heartburn for other categories like OBCs, STs and SCs.

The OBCs, STs and SCs have demanded that those seats should go to women from reserved categories and not to the men candidates of general category.

39,2020/01/30,"With VPNs, Kashmiris work around Net ban","Reeling under a grim and uncertain situation after J&K’s special status ended on August 5, Internet users in Kashmir got some reason to cheer this week. Virtual private network (VPN) applications have allowed people to log on to social media sites on 2G mobile Internet services.

Users have posted selfies, made video calls to loved ones and poked fun at the Internet ban.

However, this has not gone down well with the security agencies. Sources said the J&K Home Department and the cellular companies have brought information technology (IT) experts from outside J&K to create a permanent firewall to stop VPNs from functioning and prevent access to social media.

A BSNL official said the Home Department has asked it to refrain from restoring fixed-line broadband services till all the social media sites are firewalled.

The department on January 25 issued an order to restore 2G services on cellphones after a five-month blackout but only “allowed access to the 301 white-listed sites and not to any social media applications allowing peer-to-peer communication and VPN applications”.

Bypassing the ban, scores of VPNs were either downloaded on high-speed Internet or brought from outside J&K.

“My friend who flew from Delhi on Tuesday got over a dozen VPNs,” said a netizen, seeking anonymity.

Reaching out

“It’s after 175 days, 21 hours and 20 minutes that I am posting a message. The VPN has helped me to reach out to you again,” read a message posted on Facebook.

40,2020/01/30,Measure ‘misery index’ of economy: Congress,"India’s economy needs to be evaluated in terms of the global misery index (GMI), the Congress said on Thursday. The benchmark measures people’s “misery score” based on parameters such as unemployment and inflation rate instead of the conventional gross domestic product (GDP), it said.

At a press conference at the party’s headquarters just days ahead of the Budget, former Union Minister Manish Tewari said India now ranked high on the global misery index as it scored poorly on the key economic parameters factored in by the GMI.

“The first is the unemployment rate, the second is the inflation rate, the third is the lending rate and then you subtract the annualised growth of GDP from the sum total of these three rates. That gives you a score which really defines how miserable people living in a particular geography are,” said Mr. Tewari, who said the index was applied to global economies by American economist Steve Hanke.

Mr. Tewari said India’s poor ranking was a “direct result of the social disharmony that the BJP-NDA government had institutionalised”.

“Money is a coward and money goes to the safest harbour. Social disharmony cannot go hand-in-hand with economic growth,” he said.

“So, on the Misery Index, the NDA-BJP government is squarely in the red zone… GDP growth last year was the lowest in 11 years, private consumption was the lowest in seven years, investments were slowest in the last 17 years, manufacturing was at its lowest in 15 years and agriculture was the lowest in the last four years. So, every benchmark that you use actually validates the Misery Index,” the Congress leader said.

Also ahead of the Budget, former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said the country’s finances were in such a “mess” that whatever the government di now would have negative consequences.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidambaram said: “Remember there was a time when the highest personal income tax rate was brought down to 30% with no surcharge? Sadly, under the BJP government there can be no return to those rates because the BJP has messed up the country’s finances.”

“Besides, if the FM cuts personal income tax rates (following the cut in the corporate tax rate), it would be wrong at this point of time and will not serve the purpose of reviving demand. The correct tax to cut is GST, but the government has tied itself in knots that it cannot find a way to cut the GST rates,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dekpja/article30444105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Manish-Tewari,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/measure-misery-index-of-economy-congress/article30695342.ece
41,2020/01/30,"No bar on movement of minerals extracted in Goa before cut-off date, says SC","The Supreme Court on Thursday clarified that its 2018 ban on mining operations in Goa does not bar private mining companies from transporting out whatever minerals they had extracted before the cut-off date of March 15, 2018.

A three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde gave the companies a six-month window to transport the minerals for which they had paid royalty. It assured NGO Goa Foundation that the State government would keep a close watch and ensure that miners moved only minerals extracted prior to March 15, 2018.

This litigation stems from a February 7, 2018 apex court judgment pronounced by a Bench led by Justice (now retired) Madan B. Lokur. It quashed all 88 mining leases renewed by the BJP government in Goa in 2015 to “benefit private mining leaseholders”.

The 2018 verdict noted how these leases were hastily renewed by the State in 2014 with retrospective effect from 2007, just in the nick of time before an amended Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act made auction of leases mandatory to mine notified minerals like iron ore. It condemned the role played by the Goa government in the loot of natural resources.

The court had said private entrepreneurs were given mining leases “virtually for a song”. It found that some of the private miners even owed the State staggering sums of up to Rs. 1500 crore “towards value of ore extracted in excess of the environmental clearance”. Quashing their licences, the court, however, gave the miners time till March 15, 2018 to wind up the operations.

On Thursday, Chief Justice Bobde, who wrote the judgment, concluded that “this court in [2018 judgment] had intended to prohibit the mining as well as transportation of minerals and iron or with effect from March 16.2018 nothing precluded it from doing so"".

He said, “The only prohibition is for carrying out mining operations”. He reasoned that there was no doubt that the ownership of the ore was that of the party that had raised the ore. “The ore which has been permitted to be transported is on condition of payment of royalty. We see no reason why the owners should not be allowed to transport their own ore”.

The court gave clear directions to the State that the transportation of the mineral would be only in respect of such minerals on which royalty is paid.

“The mining leaseholders would be permitted to transport the royalty paid ore/mineral from the jetties/stockyard or pitheads on the basis of the valid transit permits issued to them by the competent authority of the State government”, the court ordered.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-bar-on-transport-of-minerals-extracted-in-goa-before-cut-off-date/article30694990.ece

44,2020/01/30,Mood at Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh electrifying as protest by women picks up,"“This is Freedom Struggle 2.0,” says Asmat Jamil, “We will not budge until the black law is repealed.”

Ms. Jamil (44), a resident of Kolkata, has undergone a kidney transplant. She is a homemaker and the mother of three children; she also runs an NGO called Azzuma; and in her latest avatar, she is the leader of the round-the-clock protest that has turned the Park Circus Maidan into Kolkata’s Shaheen Bagh.

‘Black law’

The black law she’s referring to is the Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA, the opposition to which has turned the place — right in the heart of Kolkata — into a nerve centre of protests. Each day, busloads of Muslims from in and around the city pour into the ground to show support to the Muslim women who have been camping there since January 7.

“All the women you see here — none of them are members of any political party, none of them have joined a protest before. They are all homemakers like me,” says Ms. Jamil.

Growing in strength

When asked how she gathered the courage to begin single-handedly a protest that has now become a talk of the town, she says: “The [mob] attack in JNU (Jawaharlal Nehru University) made me realise that the country is in danger. The thought of saving the country gave me the courage. I got some 60 women together and we sat here. We were joined by 15 to 20 students from different universities. That’s how it all began.”

Today, more than three weeks later, the atmosphere at the venue is electrifying. The place is awash with the tricolour and drenched in slogans shouted by the women. When this reporter had visited the venue about ten days ago, the protesters did not have a mike or a roof. But now, the authorities have allowed them to have a mike and a tarpaulin tent. Also back then, it was the activists who shouted the slogans and the women followed in unison, but now even burqa-clad women can be seen making angry speeches.

‘Pluralistic India’

“What we want is education, jobs, better healthcare and a higher GDP (Gross Domestic Product) — and not CAA,” said Ms. Jamil. “The whole purpose of this protest is to reach our voice to the government. The government should know that even Swami Vivekananda was proud of the pluralistic nature of India.”

At the venue hangs a large poster that says: “Swami Vivekananda rejected the idea of CAA 127 years ago in his Chicago speech!” It depicts Swami Vivekananda (with Ramakrishna Paramahamsa standing behind him) telling Prime Minister Narendra Modi: “Not in our name.”

In one corner of the ground, a young Muslim man is busy creating more such posters; in another corner stands a tea-seller; other corners are occupied by policemen keeping an eye on the busloads of people marching in with the tricolour. At the centre is the dais, surrounded by seated women, who in turned are hemmed in by the men. They are all now responding loudly to the slogan: “Jai Hind ka nara lagao, Modi ko duur bhagao (Chant Jai Hind and chase Modi away).”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/u47ajl/article30694470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-CAA-KOLKATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mood-at-kolkatas-shaheen-bagh-electrifying-as-protest-by-women-picks-up/article30694262.ece

“As Captain of 6E5317 BOM-LKO on 28.01.2020, I do not find the aforementioned events reportable in any way,” Captain Rohit Mateti, is purported to have written in an internal e-mail, an unverified leaked copy of which was posted on Twitter by several users. The leaked mail also appears to show the pilot expressing disappointment that the airline chose to act against Mr. Kamra without any “consultation whatsover with the Pilot-in-Command”.

IndiGo said in a press statement that it had “received the relevant statements and the internal committee has initiated the investigation regarding this incident.” The airline neither confirmed nor denied the contents of the e-mail purportedly written by its pilot.

Earlier this week, IndiGo announced that it was banning Mr. Kamra for six months and warned other passengers against indulging in personal slander while on-board its flights. Soon after, Minister of State for Civil Aviation Hardeep Puri “advised” other airlines to similarly ban Mr. Kamra. SpiceJet, GoAir and Air India have joined IndiGo in prohibiting Mr. Kamra from their flights “until further notice”.

Defending the ban to The Hindu, Mr. Puri asserted that the rules were secondary. “The ban is for threatening behaviour. There are no rules when Kunal Kamra has himself put out the video. Rules are for when the facts are not known. There needs to be zero tolerance for endangering the safety of passengers. There is no need to get into technicalities,” he said.

Observing that it was IndiGo that had decided to impose the ban, the minister said his advise to other airlines to impose a ban was aimed at ensuring an example was set. “We can’t tolerate this. A message needs to go out,” Mr. Puri asserted.

Captain Mohan Ranganathan, an aviation safety expert, took to Twitter to laud Captain Mateti. “I would like to commend the captain for this bold letter, exposing the farce by MOCA (Ministry of Civil Aviation), DGCA and 4 airlines... If MOCA had any decency, they should lift the ban immediately and apologise for this wrong action.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/m0phpj/article28415413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH13INDIGOAIRLINES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kunal-kamra-was-not-unruly-says-indigo-pilot-who-flew-the-comedian/article30693719.ece
46,2020/01/30,Coronavirus outbreak: China assures India of cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,"China on Thursday said it is closely watching the report about one confirmed case of the Coronavirus in India, and assured cooperation to the Indian side in jointly strengthening the epidemic prevention and control.

Chinese Embassy Spokesperson Ji Rong said the mission has maintained close communication with the Indian government on the issue by briefing regularly on the novel Coronavirus (nCoV) development and China’s efforts in preventing and controlling.

“The Chinese side pays close attention to the report of the emergence of one confirmed case of pneumonia caused by the novel Coronavirus in India, and will cooperate with the Indian side to jointly strengthen the epidemic prevention and control,” Mr. Ji said.

The Chinese statement came after a positive case of the deadly virus, originated in China’s Wuhan, was reported in Kerala.

The Chinese government attaches great importance to safeguarding the safety and health of every foreign national in China, including the Indian people, Ji said.

“We are willing to continue to maintain close communication with the Indian side, provide necessary assistance and convenience to ensure the health and safety of Indian citizens in China, and address their legitimate concerns timely,” he said.

“We also hope Indian side could continue to render understanding and support to China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and control,” Mr. Ji said.

India has requested China for permission to operate two flights to bring back its nationals from worst-affected central Hubei province.

The nationwide death toll in China from the Coronavirus has jumped to 170 with 38 more fatalities reported on Thursday mainly from Hubei province, the Chinese government said, while confirming more than 1,700 new infections.

Raja on January 30 said the incident of firing at Jamia Milia Islamia was a “direct result” of incretionary comments made by BJP leaders while campaigning for the Delhi Assembly polls.

Mr. Raja told PTI that it was unfortunate that such an incident had happened on the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

“Jamia firing incident a direct result of provocative statements made by BJP leaders during campaigning in Delhi. BJP leader Anurag Thakur should be arrested for his comments urging crowds to raise slogan of shoot the traitors,” Mr. Raja said.

On January 30 afternoon, a student from Jamia Millia Islamia was injured when a man opened fire at a group of protesters and shouted “Yeh lo azaadi”, triggering panic in the city’s Jamia area.

The man, who is yet to be identified, was detained after he fired at students demonstrating against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, police said.

Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said India has noted European Commission’s clarification that the EU Parliament’s views don’t reflect the official position of the grouping.

“As I have mentioned earlier, CAA is an internal matter of India. It has been adopted though due process and democratic means,” Mr. Kumar said.

49,2020/01/30,"Rahul Gandhi lashes out at PM, says Modi and Godse share same ideology","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on January 30 launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said the latter believed in the same ideology as Nathuram Godse.

Addressing thousands of party workers after leading the “Save the Constitution” march at Kalpetta, organised to protest against the Citizenship law coinciding with the 72nd death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the Congress MP also said Mr. Modi was making Indians to prove that they are citizens of the country.

Referring to Mahatma Gandhi assassin Godse, he said Mr. Modi shared the same ideology with him (Godse).

“Today, an ignorant man is trying to challenge Gandhi’s ideology. He is so full of hatred and anger that he cannot even understand what India’s strength is,” he said.

“The ideology is same. Nathuram Godse and Narendra Modi, they believe in the same ideology. There is no difference except that Modi does not have the guts to say he believes in the ideology of Godse,” the Wayanad MP added.

Attacking the Prime Minister on the new citizenship law, Mr. Gandhi questioned Mr. Modi and asked who was he to ask Indians to prove that they were Indians.

“Indians are being made to prove that they are Indians. Who is Narendra Modi to decide if I am Indian? Who gave him the licence to decide who is Indian and who is not Indian? I know I am an Indian and I don’t have to prove it to anybody,” the former Congress president said adding the 1.3 billion Indians do not have to prove to these people that they are Indians.

He said the country needs to fight the hatred that is being spread and there is need to confront the BJP peacefully.

“Our duty is to fight their hatred. Our duty is to confront them [BJP] peacefully...we do not believe in violence...we believe in love and affection. We will defeat them with love and affection,” he said.

India, which is the land of different languages and religions, used to show the world how great a country it was, he said.

Touching on growing unemployment in the country and the economic slowdown, Mr. Gandhi said the youngsters do not have a future under Mr. Modi and no matter how much the Prime Minister talks about Pakistan, it was not going to get youths more jobs.

National Register of Citizens (NRC) and CAA (Citienship Amendment Act) and the present situation in Kashmir were also not going to get people jobs, he added.

“We all understand that youngsters have no future under Modi...You can study as much as you can but there are no jobs. Today, if you go to the U.S., Western Europe, or any other country and ask what they feel about India, they say India has lost its way.”

50,2020/01/30,"SC to fix on Feb. 3 modalities for hearing case on religious faith, women’s equality","Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Thursday said the nine-judge Bench set to examine the scope of judicial review when religious faith and women's equality are at odds, like in the Sabarimala case, will assemble on February 3.

The CJI was reacting to a mentioning made by several senior advocates involved in the case that they were unable to reach a consensus among themselves about the “larger issues” to be placed before the nine-judge Bench for a final pronouncement.

On January 28, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the CJI about this lack of consensus among lawyers.

On Thursday, Chief Justice Bobde expressed his disappointment at the lack of consensus and said the nine-judge Bench would sit on February 3 to fix timelines and other modalities for hearing the case. The CJI recently said arguments should be over in 10 days. He made it clear that the larger issues involved in the case would not be allowed to be too broad-based and final arguments in the case should be made pointedly without digressions.

When the nine-judge Bench assembled on January 13, the CJI asked the lawyers involved in the case to hold a conference on January 17 to reframe/add issues to be examined by the nine-judge Bench. The court then posted the case for hearing after three weeks.

The nine-judge Bench had clarified that it would not be restricted to the Sabarimala women entry case but examine “larger issues” of law arising from practices such as the prohibition of women from entering mosques and temples, female genital mutilation among the Dawoodi Bohras and the ban on Parsi women who married inter-faith from entering the fire temple.

Chief Justice Bobde had explained that the basis of the Bench’s judicial enquiry would be seven questions referred to a larger Bench by a five-judge Bench on November 14 last. He said the nine-judge Bench was only examining propositions of law raised about religious practices believed to be essential to various religions. It would not go into the individual facts of the various petitions before it.

“We will decide questions of law on women’s entry to mosques/temples, genital mutilation by Dawoodi Bohras, entry of Parsi women who marry outside their community into fire temple. We will not decide individual facts of each case,” Chief Justice Bobde told lawyers in the courtroom on January 13.

On November 14 last, a five-judge Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, instead of deciding the Sabarimala review entrusted to it, sought an “authoritative pronouncement” on the Court’s power to decide the essentiality of religious practices. Framing seven questions, it referred them to a seven-judge Bench. These referral questions included whether “essential religious practices” be afforded constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs).

Chief Justice Bobde, who succeeded Justice Gogoi, formed a Bench of nine rather than seven judges to examine these questions that concern multiple faiths.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/egsxj2/article30679238.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Supreme-Court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-fix-on-feb-3-modalities-for-hearing-case-on-religious-faith-womens-equality/article30692113.ece
51,2020/01/30,SC rejects Nirbhaya convict Akshay’s curative plea,"A curative petition filed by Akshay Kumar Singh, sentenced to death in the Nirbhaya gang rape case, was on Thursday rejected by a five-judge Bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana.

The Bench dismissed the plea via circulation in their chambers, observing that they found no merit in his plea to be spared the gallows. It also found no merit in his plea to stay the execution of his death sentence. The date fixed for the execution of the death warrant is February 1.

Delhi court’s directive

Amid this development, a Delhi court asked the Tihar Jail authorities to respond to a plea made by the Nirbhaya convicts for a stay on the execution of their death sentence. Special Judge A.K. Jain ordered the jail officials to file their reply by 10 a.m. on January 31. Advocate A.P. Singh, representing convict Vinay Kumar Sharma, asked the court to adjourn the executions sine die as legal remedies of some of the convicts were yet to be availed. The prosecution said the application was a mockery of justice and a delaying tactic.

The Supreme Court has so far rejected the curative petitions of three Nirbhaya convicts, including Akshay’s. On January 14, it dismissed the curatives of Mukesh Singh and Vinay Sharma.

Curative is a rare remedy devised by a Constitution Bench of the court in its judgment in the Rupa Ashok Hurra case in 2002. A party can take only two limited grounds in a curative petition - one, that he was not heard by the court before the adverse judgment was passed; and two, the judge was biased.

A curative petition, which follows the dismissal of review petition, is the last legal avenue open for convicts in the court. Vinay was the first among the four convicts to file a curative.

Besides Justice Ramana, the Bench comprised Arun Mishra, Rohinton Nariman, R. Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan.

The court recently dismissed a plea by Mukesh challenging the rejection of his mercy plea by the President on January 17. He moved thecourt shortly after theit rejected a juvenility plea made by another Nirbhaya convict, Pawan Kumar Gupta. Pawan had claimed he was a juvenile at the time of the crime.

Akshay, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay had brutally gangraped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

An accused, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail. A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board. He was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

The Centre recently moved an application for fixing strict guidelines for carrying out the death sentence, saying that convicts tend to misuse the legal process by repeatedly filing a variety of pleas in the court.

The Chief Justice of India recently observed orally that the death row convicts cannot seek legal remedies endlessly and it was important that the death penalty reaches finality.

A Union Health Ministry statement said the “student is in isolation at the hospital. The student is stable and is being closely monitored.”

Following the first case, the government has announced that all persons who have come from China after January 15, will be tested for the virus as it has an incubation period of 14 days. It has also prescribed a 14-day home isolation regimen and advised that trips to China should be avoided.

“India till date has screened 234 flights and 43,346 passengers. Worldwide we have a total of 7,711 confirmed cases and 170 deaths,” a senior Health Ministry official said.

Director of the Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Virology, Pune, Dr. Priya Abraham, said: “Forty-nine samples have been tested till now and one sample has tested positive. Now a next test known as “next gen sequencing test” will be done on the sample and the final result will be declared by Friday evening .”

WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Thursday reconvened the emergency committee on the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005). The committee will re-consider declaring nCoV outbreak a global public health emergency and also advise on recommendations to manage the outbreak.

Thrissur on alert

Thrissur in Kerala has been put on high alert after one of the four persons admitted to the isolation ward of the district general hospital with symptoms of novel coronavirus infection (nCoV), tested positive. The other three persons tested negative for the virus. The condition of the patient is stable, according to Health Department sources.

A 24-hour control room has been set up at the District Medical Office and the district Collectorate.

The student had reached Kolkata from Wuhan, China, on the night of January 23. She travelled to Kochi the next day from where she went to her hometown in Thrissur.

Getting to know about the alert the next day from the news media, she reached the nearest primary health centre at Mathilakam to inform the Health officials about her travel. As she had not shown any symptoms of flu, she was advised to remain home for 28 days and maintain personal hygiene besides wearing mask. She was also given a contact number in case she developed any fever or cough or other symptoms of flu. On January 27, she contacted the District Surveillance Officer when she developed flu symptoms. The district team reached her house and moved her to the isolation ward at the Thrissur General Hospital.

The same day, her body fluid sample was sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. On Thursday morning, the NIV informed that the case was positive.

People, who were in contact with the student have been put under house quarantine. The Health Department is also tracking and identifying persons who may have come into contact with her.

Isolation rooms

Special isolation rooms have been set up in government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thrissur, to treat cases of nCoV infections. In all, 20 pay-ward rooms have been vacated to make the special arrangements. The isolation ward has been set up according to Standard Operative Procedure.

“The MCH is ready to take up the challenge. “A special medical team has been readied. Safety measures and medicines are in place. Steps have been taken to take care of safety of doctors and other workers,” according to RMO C.P. Murali.

The Health Department has asked people, who returned from China, to report without any delay. The officials have asked people visiting general hospital and the area around it to wear masks.

Jugal Kishore, director professor and head of department-community medicine, Vardhman Mahavir Medical College (VMMC) said: “There is no vaccine or drug available against the virus. Only symptomatic treatment is available. We still don’t know how the virus will behave in the new population. Prevention and strict surveillance is very important in India.”

Evacuation from Hubei

Meanwhile, stating that India is still awaiting necessary approval from China to evacuate Indians in Hubei province of China, External Affairs Ministry’s spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, on Thursday said: “We have established contact with over 600 Indians across the province and are individually ascertaining their willingness to be repatriated. We are working round-the-clock on the ground to work out the necessary logistics. Arrangements are being put in place for people to travel to the airport.”

“We have made a formal request to the government of China for bringing back Indian nationals from the Hubei province in two flights. We are conducting regular review on the situation arising out of the outbreak of nCoronavirus in China,” Mr. Kumar added.

“People need not panic. But we need to take preventive measures. Wash hands with soap and water frequently. Cover mouth and nose with medical mask or tissue when sneezing or coughing. Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever or cough. Seek medical help in case of fever, cough or difficulty in breathing,” officials said.

The Health Ministry also advised that those with a travel history to China after their return should — for a period of 14 days — sleep in a separate room, limit contact with other family members and avoid visitors and close contact with anyone with cold or flu like symptoms (maintain a distance of at least 1 meter from any individual).

“Thermal screening sensors are operational and few more such equipment are being procured. The immigration and other staff members at the airports have been sensitized and dedicated ambulances are placed at ports. We also held mock drill for checking preparedness and management of possible cases. Deployment of medical and para-medical staff is also being done for round-the-clock service,” the official said.

53,2020/01/30,Supreme Court stays HC proceedings on plea challenging Kanimozhi’s election as MP in 2019,"The Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the Madras High Court proceedings on a plea challenging DMK MP M.K. Kanimozhi’s election as the parliamentarian from the Thoothukudi constituency in 2019.

A Bench led by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde froze the High Court proceedings on an appeal filed Ms. Kanimozhi against the High Court decision to examine a petition filed by A. Santhana Kumar challenging her election as the Thoothukudi MP.

In her appeal, Ms. Kanimozhi, represented by senior advocate P. Wilson and Joseph Aristotle, said the High Court erroneously banked on a petition which was at best “vague and without material facts”.

PAN number of spouse

The High Court proceeded on the notion that Ms. Kanimozhi refused to disclose the PAN number of her spouse. Ms. Kanimozhi’s Form 26, submitted with her nomination papers, clearly states that her husband does not have a PAN card in the first place.

“The petitioner (Kanimozhi) has clearly mentioned that her spouse does not have a PAN number. If the first respondent (Kumar) herein contends that this statement is wrong, he ought to substantiate the allegation that the statement is incorrect. Without these averments, the bald and vague statement that petitioner has not provided her spouse’s PAN cannot be maintained in an election petition in light of several judgments of the Supreme Court,” the petition said.

Ms. Kanimozhi had asked whether it was justified on the part of the High Court to add averments in the election petition as regards the petitioner’s husband’s income tax reference number?

“When even the election petitioner does not make an averment that the petitioner’s spouse possesses a PAN card or any such card in Singapore, whether it was correct on part of the High Court to frame such an allegation?” the petition said.

Mr. Kumar, in his election petition, had not brought even a single material fact to substantiate his case that Ms. Kanimozhi’s nomination was improper. In fact, Ms. Kanimozhi said his election petition contained hollow allegations chanted over and over like a mantra.

Ms. Kanimozhi's appeal in the Supreme Court had urged for a stay of the High Court proceedings, saying she would otherwise be “forced to face the rigours of trial, which will not only hamper the work of the petitioner as the elected candidate of the people but also cause severe hardships to the petitioner, who will be forced to constantly be in Chennai instead of attending to her official work in Delhi and constituency work in Thoothukudi”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/2upwe0/article30373924.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KANIMOZHIKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-stays-hc-proceedings-on-plea-challenging-kanimozhis-election-as-mp-in-2019/article30690693.ece

59,2020/01/30,Govt takes over IMEI-related processes from private body,"The Department of Telecom has taken over the process to issue and manage IMEI allocation for mobile phones in India from the private body MSAI.

The IMEI number — a unique 15-digit serial number of mobile devices — is allocated by global industry body GSMA and organisations authorised by it. When a mobile phone is lost, the victim is required to mention the IMEI number of the handset for tracking.

The Department of Telecom (DoT) had issued a standard operating procedure in May 2015 to prohibit import of mobile phones with duplicate, fake and non-genuine international mobile equipment identity.

The process was being managed by Mobile Standard Alliance of India (MSAI), erstwhile reporting body of GSMA in India.

“The government has decided to replace the MSAI operated system and hence a new system, Indian Counterfeited Device Restriction (ICDR) system, has been developed by the Centre for Development of Telematics - R&D unit of DoT for implementing the SOP, ” the DoT said in a letter dated January 28, 2020 to industry bodies and concerned government departments.

The new system has been operationalised on pilot basis on the web portal of Central Equipment Identity Register (CEIR). The CEIR is being used to block all services on stolen or lost mobile phones on any network even if the SIM card is removed or the IMEI number of the handset is changed.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nc22ep/article30689544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UNIONBUDGET2019THNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/govt-takes-over-imei-related-processes-from-private-body/article30689545.ece
60,2020/01/30,"Submit fresh report on compliance of plastic rules by Amazon, Flipkart: NGT to CPCB","The National Green Tribunal asked the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) on Wednesday to submit a fresh report on Amazon and Flipkart’s compliance to the plastic management rules, a day after the CPCB said the companies need to collect the waste generated in packaging their products.

Hearing a plea filed by a 16-year-old boy to stop Amazon and Fli pkart from excessive plastic use in packaging, the National Green Tribunal said it is for the regulator CPCB to enforce the rules.

Advocate Balendu Shekhar, appearing for CPCB, told the bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel about the non-compliance of plastic waste management rules by the e-commere giants, saying the e-commerce firms need to fulfil their extended producer responsibility under the rules.

They use excessive plastics for packaging but have not registered with CPCB, Shekhar said, adding the companies should obtain registration as brand owner after submitting relevant documents. Advocate Sanjay Upadhyay, appearing for Amazon, told the green tribunal they will comply with all formalities on extended producer responsibility by June 30.

Hearing on April 22

The bench, however, asked them to approach the CPCB and posted the matter for hearing on April 22. On Tuesday, the CPCB told the NGT that as per provisions 9(2) of the Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016, “Primary responsibility for collection of used multi-layered plastic sachet or pouches or packaging is of producers, importers and brand owners who introduce the products in the market.

“Amazon Retail India Private Limited and Flipkart Private limited are involved in packaging and selling of other companies’ products and thus introducing plastic packaging in the market. They need to fulfil their extended producer responsibility under PWM Rules and should obtain registration as brand owner after submitting proper documents,” CPCB said.

Aditya Dubey, the petitioner in the case through advocate Divya Prakash Pande, has pleaded the NGT to direct Amazon and Flipkart to stop excessive use of plastic in packaging. Responding to the plea, Amazon India said it has been “relentlessly” working to reduce single-use plastic in its supply chain and is committed to eliminating its usage in their buildings by June 2020.

“Towards this, we have introduced ‘paper cushions’, which have completely replaced plastic dunnage across our fulfilment centres in India. We also ensure that packaging material in the form of corrugate boxes and paper cushions contains as high as 100% recycled content and is also fully recyclable. To reduce packaging waste and use of plastic, ‘Packaging Free Shipment’ (PFS) has now expanded to 20 cities within a year,” an Amazon India spokesperson said Tuesday.

Flipkart said it has been “constantly striving to find eco-friendly alternatives for plastic packaging which is resilient and keeps the product safe during transit.”

‘Business with a purpose’

“The company firmly believes in the principle of ‘business with a purpose’ and we are aware of our responsibility towards the environment,” a Flipkart spokesperson said. Dubey’s plea has contended that the companies deliver items in cardboard boxes, which are too large when compared to the size of the items being delivered.

The plea has also said that though the home-delivery service of e-commerce companies have been very useful for consumers, they have given rise to serious environmental challenges. Once goods are delivered, the plastic waste is thrown away in garbage and it ends up at landfill sites, it said.

“Single-use plastic has emerged as one of the biggest environmental challenges for our planet. It is cheap, useful, ubiquitous and very deadly,” the petition has said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/submit-fresh-report-on-compliance-of-plastic-rules-by-amazon-flipkart-ngt-to-cpcb/article30688474.ece

63,2020/01/30,"Prepaid meters may lower power tariff, according to a circular from the Union Power Ministry","Consumers can soon hope for reduction in electricity bills if they have prepaid meters on their premises. This is the crux of a circular sent by the Union Power Ministry to States last week.

According to the circular, States have been allowed to approach their State Electricity Regulatory Commissions (SERC) for reduction in power tariff in cases “where prepayment meters have been installed.”

The reduction has been estimated as in such cases, carrying costs will come down, leading to reduced requirement of working capital for the Distribution Companies (Discoms). Further, this will eliminate associated costs involved in meter reading, billing and collection.

From the consumers’ point of view, the arrangement would allow them to pay at their own convenience, requirement and consumption.

The Union Ministry has also fixed the time frame of six months for implementing its directive through appropriate changes in the relevant regulations or orders.

The Central government’s initiative, which seeks to provide relief to consumers, is in tune with its position. Last year, the Ministry issued guidelines to all States to convert all existing consumer meters into “smart meters in prepaid mode.”

Nothing new

For the last one-and-a-half years, Union Minister of State (independent charge) for Power R.K. Singh has been calling upon the States to go for the prepaid meters within three years. The concept is nothing new as the National Electricity Policy, in 2005, had stated that the SERCs should encourage use of pre-paid meters.

In September last year, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, while announcing 200 units of free power for tenants in Delhi, said the beneficiaries could opt for prepaid meters. In Rajasthan, the installation of prepaid meters for temporary supply has been provided by the Jaipur Discom in the terms and conditions for supply of electricity. In Odisha, the government has decided to have prepaid meters at its offices initially.

As for Tamil Nadu, the authorities are for the implementation of the concept in a phased manner.

At present, the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation is working on providing four lakh “smart meters,” on a pilot basis in T. Nagar, a locality of Chennai.

An official of the power utility clarified that the meters, which have been proposed by the power utility, will not have provision for prepayment, even though they will do automatic reading of consumption by consumers and ensure disconnection in the event of default in payment of bills.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nfboz3/article30687479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29KRASMARTMETER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prepaid-meters-may-lower-power-tariff-according-to-a-circular-from-the-union-power-ministry/article30687480.ece
64,2020/01/30,"I am no Nero to play fiddle when State is held hostage, says West Bengal Governor","Describing the developments at the convocation of Calcutta University on January 28, which he was forced to leave owing to protests by students, as “shameful and unprecedented in the 163-year-old history of the institution”, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said that he was no Nero who would play the fiddle when such incidents occurred and “the State is held hostage by a few”.

“The question is, can we afford to forget what happened on January 28? It is not a political but an existential question … Can malicious elements be allowed to hijack academic institutions as it most painfully happened yesterday?” Mr. Dhankhar asked at a press conference organised at Raj Bhawan on Wednesday.

While pointing out that the chain of events during the convocation, where Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee was awarded a D. Litt by Calcutta University, “did not happen spontaneously”, the Governor said “seeing the ruckus on television, many [in Bengal] were disappointed”.

Students protest

On January 28, a group of students began protesting at the venue where the Governor was to honour Dr. Banerjee, forcing the former to leave. The Governor’s choice of words describing the incident and its effect varied from suggesting that he was in “excruciating pain and totally shaken by the incident” to “a dark period” which cannot be forgotten easily . He said he wanted to underscore “what doom it augurs for the State in particular”.

Mr. Dhankhar spoke of the “downward trend of educational institutions”, the exodus of talented students, and how, “because of a handful people, educational institutions are losing their sheen”.

On being asked how he could perform his Constitutional duties amidst non-cooperation from the State administration, Mr. Dhankhar emphatically said that no situation could deter him from performing his Constitutional duties and that, “The Governor is never on a back foot in the discharge of his duties.”

Reflecting on the developments on January 28, Mr. Dhankhar said that he chose to leave the venue to ensure smooth functioning of the convocation.

“If I had not signed the degree and asked the Vice-Chancellor to continue with the event, there would have been no convocation. I thought — let me not be the disrupter,” Mr. Dhankhar said. A few weeks ago, he was met with protests during the convocation of Jadavpur University and was unable to attend the ceremony as a result.

TMC reacts

State Education Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) secretary general Partha Chatterjee said that the Governor “must understand why the students are protesting against him...and he must ensure that his position is not compromised”.

“The fact of the matter is that he is tweeting the message of Centre, but he has been brought here for the good of the State. Every day, he is making barbed attacks and then inviting the Chief Minister for a cup of a tea,” Mr. Chatterjee said.

He, however, condemned the protest by the students.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/qoj2cu/article28620181.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JAGDEEPDHANKHAR-PTI-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i-am-no-nero-to-play-fiddle-when-state-is-held-hostage-says-west-bengal-governor/article30686708.ece
65,2020/01/30,Countrywide missing persons and vehicle databases go public domain,"Citizens all over the country can now search for missing persons and check police records of any vehicle from a countrywide database.

The citizen-centric services were launched by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on the Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) platform. They can be accessed at the portal http://digitalpolicecitizenservices.gov.in, or through a link in the existing ‘Digital Police Portal’, an official statement said.

“So far, such services were being provided through the State citizen portals. It is the first time that they are being launched centrally,” the statement said. Intelligence Bureau Director Arvind Kumar presided over the launch ceremony.

“The two citizen services, namely ‘Missing Person Search’ and ‘Generate Vehicle NOC’ (No Objection Certificate) will now be available online to citizens,” NCRB Director Ram Phal Pawar said.

‘Huge benefit’

“Citizens can search for their missing kin against the national database of recovered unidentified found persons or unidentified dead bodies, from their homes. This will hugely benefit relatives of missing persons and save them from running pillar to post, as all such details, including photos, are available in the CCTNS and will now be accessible to citizens through this portal at their convenience,” Mr. Pawar said.

On the ‘Generate Vehicle NOC’ service, the NCRB Director said it allows citizens to ascertain the status of a vehicle before its second-hand purchase, as to whether it was “suspicious or clean” based on police records.

66,2020/01/30,Scholar cites Adnan Sami getting citizenship to question CAA’s rationale,"Social scientist Partha Chatterjee on Wednesday cited the case of musician Adnan Sami, who had been granted Indian citizenship well before the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), to contend that the new law was not really required to give citizenship to persecuted religious minorities of neighbouring countries.

Citizenship, he asserted, was given earlier using the Citizenship Act of 1955, which had a provision to “extend citizenship” to a foreigner by registration.

“Many got citizenship in the past because of the 1955 Act” Prof. Chatterjee said, speaking at a street protest in the city organised by a civil society platform, Joint Forum Against NRC. “Now the government is arguing that CAA [2019] is introduced to give citizenship to those who experienced religious persecution. This is a completely erroneous argument as Mr. Sami got his citizenship well before CAA was passed,” he added.

Under the provision to “extend citizenship” to a foreigner by registration as per the 1955 law, the government could grant citizenship to anyone, who had stayed in the country for seven years. Mr. Sami, a renowned musician who’s father was a Pakistani diplomat, submitted in May 2015 a request for Indian citizenship, which was granted with effect from January 2016.

Deconstructing the provisions of the 1955 law and reading it in conjunction with the Citizenship (Amendment) Act of 2003, Prof. Chatterjee said that “for the first time in the citizenship laws of the country, religion is introduced”.

“This is done clearly to identify Muslims as illegal citizens. Its process was started with the 2003 Amendment, when emphasis was given on illegal immigrants,” Prof. Chatterjee said. Blaming the opposition parties for giving the Bill a clear passage in the Rajya Sabha, he said thankfully the people had shown “alertness”.

“Now the leaders, the Opposition and the others are realizing the danger of passing such an Amendment and it would have not been possible without the alertness of the people who dragged the Opposition to the streets. Now the Opposition is waking up and four States passed resolutions against CAA,” Prof. Chatterjee said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nyp3lm/article30687443.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Partha-Chatterjee2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/scholar-cites-adnan-sami-getting-citizenship-to-question-caas-rationale/article30687444.ece

68,2020/01/30,Time limit on advance bail violates personal liberty: Supreme Court,"The protection of anticipatory or pre-arrest bail cannot be limited to any time frame or “fixed period” as denial of bail amounts to deprivation of the fundamental right to personal liberty in a free and democratic country, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court ruled on Wednesday.

A five-judge Bench, led by Justice Arun Mishra, acknowledged that anticipatory bail helps thwart influential powers from implicating their rivals in false cases. Section 438 (anticipatory bail) of the Code of Criminal Procedure protects people from the ignominy of detention in jail for days on end and disgrace to their reputation. The court recorded its amicus curiae and senior advocate Harin Raval’s argument that anticipatory bail is all the more needed now because there is an accentuation of political rivalry and “this tendency is showing signs of steady increase”.

“The life or duration of an anticipatory bail order does not normally end at the time and stage when the accused is summoned by the court, or when charges are framed, but can continue till the end of the trial,” the court held.

The questions referred to the Constitution Bench were twofold: whether the protection granted to a person under Section 438 should be limited to a fixed period till the accused surrenders in court, and whether the life of anticipatory bail should end when the accused is summoned by the court.

The 133-page judgment includes two separate and concurring opinions by Justices M.R. Shah and S. Ravindra Bhat. Justices Mishra, Indira Banerjee and Vineet Saran joined them to issue guidelines for courts while granting anticipatory bail.

“The history of our Republic — and indeed, the freedom movement — has shown how the likelihood of arbitrary arrest and indefinite detention and the lack of safeguards played an important role in rallying the people to demand independence,” Justice Bhat wrote on the importance of the provision.

“The spectre of arbitrary and heavy-handed arrests: too often, to harass and humiliate citizens, and oftentimes, at the interest of powerful individuals (and not to further any meaningful investigation into offences) led to the enactment of Section 438,” he added.

“The normal rule (for grant of anticipatory bail) should be not to limit the order in relation to a period of time,” Justice Shah observed.

The court held that protection against arrest should inure in favour of the accused. Restricting the protection would prove unfavourable for the accused.

However, it is open for a court to impose appropriate conditions for grant of anticipatory bail if the specific facts or the features of the offence involved demands it. Courts have to consider the nature of the offence, the role of the person, the likelihood of his influencing the course of investigation or tampering of evidence, including intimidating witnesses and fleeing justice. But restrictions/conditions can be imposed only on a case-to-case basis.

An application for anticipatory bail should be based on concrete facts and not vague or general allegations. The application should also contain bare essential facts relating to the offence and why the applicant reasonably apprehends arrest. It should also have “his side of the story”.

“These are essential for the court to evaluate the threat or apprehension, its gravity or seriousness and the appropriateness of any condition that may have to be imposed... Special or other restrictive conditions may be imposed if the case or cases warrant, but should not be imposed in a routine manner in all cases,” the Bench pointed out.

The court held that a plea for anticipatory bail can be filed even before the registration of FIR as long as there is reasonable basis for apprehension of arrest and clarity of facts.

Nothing in Section 438 CrPC compels or obliges courts to impose conditions limiting the relief in terms of time or upon filing of FIR or recording of statement of witnesses by the police during investigation or inquiry, etc.

Courts, depending on the seriousness of the threat of arrest, need not wait to hear the prosecution’s version before granting anticipatory bail. Issuance of notice to the prosecutor can be done simultaneously while granting protection from arrest to the accused.

The grant of protection should not be “blanket” but confined to specific offence or incident for which relief from arrest is sought. It is open for the police to move court for arrest of the accused if there is any violation of bail conditions.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/y4t0hw/article30540902.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH11SUPREMECOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/time-limit-on-advance-bail-violates-personal-liberty-supreme-court/article30687440.ece
69,2020/01/30,"“Diplomatic victory for India,” say govt sources as EU Parliament defers vote on CAA motion","Members of the European Parliament began a discussion over a joint motion criticising India’s Citizenship Act on January 29 night. In partial relief for the government, however, MEPs decided not to hold a vote on the joint motion until the second half of March 2020.

On March 13, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Brussels for the EU-India summit, and an amendment moved by MEP Michael Gahler of the European People’s Party (EPP) sought the time so as to ensure that India could engage with the MEPs on the motion. “The issue is ongoing as the Supreme Court has asked the government a number of questions and we should await their answers. We will also have the opportunity to speak directly to Indian government ministers about the Citizenship Law in February,” said Mr. Gahler, referring to the upcoming visit to Brussels by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, while proposing the postponement.

Sources in the government called the vote being put off a “diplomatic victory for India”, and blamed Pakistan, and in particular one British MEP Shaffaq Mohammad for bringing the six different resolutions criticising India to the European Parliament, just days before Britain is due to exit the European Union.

Neither the discussion nor the vote can be enforced by the EU parliament on India, but they could become a cause for strain in ties even as the EU and India seek to energise relations and revive free trade talks.

CAA is an internal matter: India

“CAA is a matter internal to India and has been adopted through a due process through democratic means. We expect that our perspectives in this matter will be understood by all objective and fair-minded MEPs,” the sources said.

However MEPs who asked for the delay said they had wanted time in order to study the resolutions before voting, and didn’t want to impact EU-India relations without a full study.

“In my view, the European Parliament is not yet fully familiar with all the details necessary to objectively pass judgements,” EPP from the Czech Republic Tomasz Zdechovsky, who also pushed for the delay in the vote, explained to The Hindu. “The date of the debate should be rescheduled to at least after March 13, when Indian PM Narendra Modi shares his thoughts with the Members of the European Parliament. This is a precondition without which the resolution would not be competent,” he added.

With 182 members, the EPP is the largest group in the 751-member European Parliament, and two other groups including Identity and Democracy, and European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) were ranged on India’s side as well, while the remaining four groups were keen to table and vote on the resolution. In the vote on the Gahler amendment, 271 voted in favour of delaying the vote till the March 15-18 session and 199 voted to continue with the vote on January 30.

As The Hindu had reported earlier, diplomats from the Indian Embassy in Brussels had reached out to scores of MEPs and groups over the past week to try and stall the resolutions, tone down the harsh language in them and to put off if not cancel any voting on them. The final joint motion retains fairly critical language accusing the government of a “brutal crackdown” on anti-CAA protestors, torture of those detained, internet shutdowns and the “discriminatory” nature of the CAA. The motion urges the government to repeal the law and reconsider including other persecuted minority groups in the region as well. The government has repeatedly rejected all such statements and said that CAA is “an internal matter” for India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9fyoke/article30687341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EU-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/members-of-european-parliament-defer-vote-on-motion-against-citizenship-amendment-act/article30687342.ece

71,2020/01/30,Koppedu sand reach near Nagari goes dry,"The sand reach on a rivulet connected to Aruna river at Koppedu of Nindra mandal in the district is defunct with sand stocks getting exhausted a week ago. The sand reach caters to Nindra, Vijayapuram mandals and parts of Nagari rural area.

Officials of the Revenue, Mines and Geology and Police departments, who inspected the sand reach, found that the workers were unable to dig and lift the sand from the rivulet bed due to the rocky surface. Circle Inspector (Nagari Rural) M. Rajasekhar said that workers were unable to dig any further to collect sand.

“Though there is a proposal to deploy earthmovers, its feasibility would be looked into by officials concerned as using of earthmovers is prohibited at sand reaches,” Mr. Rajasekhar said.

The Mines and Geology officials said that after the sand reach at Surutupalle, the biggest in the eastern mandals, small reaches were being identified at the rivulets connected to the Aruna river to cater to the immediate requirements of the locals in hundreds of villages.

Commemorating the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and calling for unity among religions, protests were staged in other parts of the district. According to organisers, over 4,000 people took part in the march in Adoni.

Leaders of the YSRCP, the TDP, the MIM and Left Parties came together for the rally. The Human Rights Forum, the Aam Aadmi Party and the Awaaz Committee had extended support to the protest.

Human chain

In Kurnool, protesters formed a human chain to highlight their demand. Speaking at the event, CPI(M) district secretary K. Prabhakar said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah are trying to divide people of the country on the basis of religion.

“Time has come to save our country from such forces,” he added.

Activists of the Democratic Youth Federation of India formed a human chain in Allagadda.

73,2020/01/30,"‘Abhay’ wins hearts, fulfils purpose","Thirty-year-old Sridevi was clueless about how to reach her home in the remote M. Nidamanuru village in Prakasam district after arriving at the bus station here in the dead of night after a visit to Nellore for medical treatment for her ailing mother.

On seeing a poster prominently displayed at the bus station by the Prakasam police, she dialled ‘100’ and, in no time, a patrol vehicle from the Ongole Taluka police station reached the bus station.

Ms. Sridevi was a bit hesitant on boarding the police vehicle initially. After some reassuring talk by the woman police personnel, she got into the vehicle and reached her home safely.

Similar was the experience of P. Sirisha, a 36-year-old woman from Kesarajukunta. After reaching Ongole in the late hours from Guntur, where she had gone to consult a neurologist for her sick daughter, she was perplexed on how to reach her home safely.

Unwilling to take an autorickshaw, she called the integrated command control centre, and the ‘Abhay’ vehicle headed by CI K. Lakshman came in a few minutes to drop her home on the outskirts of the city, where autorickshaws ruled the roost in the absence of city bus services.

Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal, who launched the novel service between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. in the wake of the brutal rape and murder of a veteranarian in Hyderabad, told The Hindu that the aim was to instil a sense of security among women and avoid incidents of crime against them.

Initially, women had inhibitions on boarding the police vehicles. But now, they are availing of the service without any hesitation impressed by the conduct of the trained police personnel.

Network of vehicles

A network of police vehicles stationed at the 66 police stations, 10 Rakshak vehicles and 12 patrol vehicles plying on the National Highways in the district have been linked to a special monitoring cell at the police headquarters through radio network.

The personnel were provided with body-worn cameras and GPS equipment, and the whole process was monitored online from the police control room to ensure transparency and accountability, and intervene whenever necessary, added the SP while overseeing the running of the service.

All the police stations and patrol vehicles spread across the 18,000 sq km area were brought under one single radio network, and the Abhay service was popularised by putting flexi banners at vantage points.

There was no laid down systems and procedures for the service as it was a first-of-its-kind initiative, Special Branch CI N. Srikanth Babu, who monitors the functioning of the control room, explained.

GPS trackers

In view of limited availability of four-wheelers, the service was modified to ‘Escort Home’ service. “The trained personnel wearing body-worn cameras are monitored live from the police control room through the GPS-based trackers to ensure that the process is smooth,” he said.

There has been a reduction in crime against women at night time after introduction of the service in December 2019, according to the data compiled by the District Crimes Record Bureau.

While there were 17 crimes against women in four categories (rape, outraging modesty, eve-teasing, POCSO cases) reported at night time in November 2019, the number had come down to 10 in December 2019.

Even in relative terms, out of the total crimes against women in the above categories in November, 33% (17 out of 52) occurred at night time whereas in December, only 22% (10 out of 47) occurred at night time.

The Abhay service has so far been availed of by 435 women since its inception.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/2ddsd9/article30694260.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VJPG4-ABHAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/abhay-wins-hearts-fulfils-purpose/article30694261.ece
74,2020/01/30,Dadi dares Naidu to seek fresh mandate on three capitals issue,"YSRCP general secretary Dadi Veerabhadra Rao on Thursday asked TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu to seek re-election from the 23 Assembly constituencies his party won.

By opposing the establishment of three capitals – Visakhapatnam (Executive), Amaravati (Legislative) and Kurnool (Judicial), and, thereby, opposing the development of the North Andhra and Rayalaseema regions, Mr. Naidu was acting as a leader representing just the 29 villages in the capital region.

Mr. Naidu was trying to project Visakhapatnam as a city prone to cyclones and, therefore, unfit to be made the Executive capital, Mr. Veerabhadra Rao alleged while addressing the media here.

When cyclone Hudhud struck the city in October 2014, when Mr. Naidu was the Chief Minister, not a single human life was lost, and all the industries revived their operations in a short time, Mr. Veerabhadra Rao said.

The cyclone had hit the coast once in the last 100 years, and there was no justification to oppose the location of Executive capital in Visakhapatnam, he said, and pointed out how Kolkata, Mumbai and Chennai had become capitals.

“Several countries too have made their coastal cities national capitals,” the YSRCP leader claimed, and alleged that Mr. Naidu had stayed in a bus in the Collectorate to supervise the Hudhud relief operations just to gain political mileage.

Even after losing power, Mr. Naidu was behaving as if he could influence the powers-that-be to reject the State Cabinet’s resolution to abolish the Legislative Council.

Following in the footsteps of N.T. Rama Rao, who, as National Front Chairman, had asked the constituent parties to secure the resignation of their MPs over the Bofors issue, Mr. Naidu should ask his MLAs to resign and seek re-election over the three capitals issue.

The campaign will be launched by District Collector G. Veerapandian and will last until 13 February.

Addressing reporters in the city on Wednesday, district leprosy officer P. Chandra Rao said that the theme for this year’s campaign is centred on early detection and ending discrimination against those suffering from leprosy.

Dr. Rao said that every person must thoroughly examine themselves and immediately go to the doctor if they find white patches on their bodies. “There are 87 primary health centres in the district, all of which provide free health care and treatment for leprosy,” he added.

Allaying fears, he said they have cured all cases that have been reported. “A ward has also been given in the Kurnool Government General Hospital, where people could be admitted if there are any complications,” he added.

Dr. Rao also advised the people to not believe in rumours or superstitions if they identify white spots on their bodies. Giving out the details, he said there were 419 cases detected in 2019(till December 19) as against 531 cases in 2018.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/two-week-awareness-programmeon-leprosy-to-be-launched-today/article30687517.ece
78,2020/01/30,"Waive GST on life insurance policies, says AIIEA","At the ongoing 25th National Conference of All India Insurance Employees Association, the members resolved to demand the withdrawal of GST from life insurance policies, here on Wednesday.

M. Girija, Joint Secretary of AIIEA, pointed out that the Union Government has not imposed GST on other savings models such as fixed deposits or mutual funds, but is imposing GST on life insurance policies that vary from 2.5% to 18%. “Even insurance policies are savings and they cannot be treated differently,” she said.

The members voiced their disapproval against the disinvestment in LIC. They were of the opinion that LIC being the largest government-owned insurance company, the proposal of disinvestment should be shelved.

“From an invest of ₹5 crore in 1956, the company has grown phenomenally and today has an asset value of over ₹31 lakh crore. Its solvency rate is over 158%, so where is the need to privatise it?” asked K. Venugopal, president of South Central Zonal Insurance Employees Federation.

He further added that about 82% of its revenue is invested in government schemes and 85% of its surplus is invested in government equity. “Privatisation will not benefit either the corporation or the government, so why is this bill being mooted?” he questioned.

AIIEA has also taken a decision to oppose the disinvestment in three general insurance PSUs. “There is a move to merge the three government-owned general insurance companies such as United India Company, The National Insurance Company and Oriental Insurance Company and then privatise them. We welcome the merger but not the privatisation,” Mr. Venugopal said.

Moreover, the members were of the opinion that in the government-owned insurance companies including LIC, people are the major stakeholders, and hence there is a need to involve the public and take their opinion on disinvestment before the bill can be tabled.

AIIEA has also decided to urge the Union Government to increase the exemption limit of insurance policies for filing Income Tax returns.

“People invest in insurance policies and the amount is utilised by the government in building infrastructure. Keeping this in mind, the government should increase the exemption limit, which would encourage people to invest more. The amount can be utilised for nation-building,” Ms. Girija said.

The four-day conference will end on Thursday, and a draft resolution copy will be handed over to the Union Government.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/waive-gst-on-life-insurance-policies-says-aiiea/article30687250.ece
79,2020/01/30,Govt. suspends custodian of Hathiramji mutt,"The State Government on Wednesday suspended Mahant Arjun Das as the custodian of the Sri Swamy Hathiramji Mutt, citing certain irregularities committed by him at the helm of the religious body.

Headquartered in Tirupati, the Hathiramji mutt has landholdings across the country. It was also the administrator of the Sri Venkateswara temple at Tirumala until 1933, prior to the formation of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in 1933.

News of the suspension order being served on the custodian of the once-hallowed institution rocked the temple city on Wednesday. The suspension order was served by the Commissioner of the Endowments Department, who is also the Member Secretary of the Andhra Pradesh Dharmika Parishad.

The Dharmika Parishad exercised the powers vested under Section 51(3) of Andhra Pradesh Charitable and Hindu Religious Institutions and Endowments Act 30/1987 in suspending the Mahant, pending enquiry into charges of irregularities against him.

Sri Kalahastheeswara Swamy Devasthanams Executive Officer C. Chandrasekhar Reddy was given full additional charge of the Hathiramji mutt.

Tense moments were witnessed at the mutt as Mahant Arjun Das remained out of reach for government officials as well as mediapersons who attempted to contact him for his reaction.

Mr. Reddy took charge of the mutt even as the Mahant abstained. “I tried to contact him before taking charge as directed by the State Government. As I failed to get any response after calling him on his phone, I was forced to take charge in his absence,” Mr. Reddy told the media.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-suspends-custodian-of-hathiramji-mutt/article30687235.ece
80,2020/01/30,Srivani Trust gets ₹40 crore in just 100 days,"The newly floated Sri Venkateswara Alaya Nirmana (Srivani) Trust by the TTD on Wednesday scripted a new chapter in the history of the temple administration by mobilising funds to the tune ₹40 crore in a span of just 100 days.

The trust was floated with a serene intention of mobilising funds for the promotion, propagation and protection of Sanatana Hindu Dharma vis-a-vis constructing temples of Lord Venkateswara, particularly in the areas dominated by weaker sections and backward communities in the country and thereby stall the alleged religious conversions.

The incentive offered by the TTD that whoever contributes ₹10,000 towards will be extended with a one-time privilege of VIP darshan at the Tirumala temple has not only enabled the trust reap fortunes but also has made it as the best option for having a comfortable darshan of the presiding deity.

According to statistics, 33,980 devotees have so far donated online towards the trust. While 18,216 devotees have contributed ₹10,000 and in multiples online towards the darshan tickets, 18,216 devotees have availed the darshan tickets offline (across the ticket counter under current booking).

Further, while the contributions from the people of the State touched ₹10-crore mark, it was followed by the devotees from Telangana, Karnataka, New Delhi, and Maharastra.

Another interesting factor is that immense contributions have also been registered by the NRIs in United States, Malaysia, Singapore, and UAE.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/srivani-trust-gets-40-crore-in-just-100-days/article30687223.ece

The firm has been working with local farmers for the past several months and has been exporting bananas to domestic destinations too along with other small operators. The 650-m rake will be flagged off at the goods loading yard of the Tadipatri Railway Station on Thursday.

83,2020/01/30,Experts stress need for skilling ITI candidates,"Candidates enrolled at Industrial Training Institutes (ITIs) need to be highly skilled to meet industry requirements as merely being qualified will not help them secure jobs, experts said at an Industry Institution Interface meet on Wednesday.

The meet was organised at the SC Railways Carriage Repair Shop (CRS) here by the Department of Factories with representatives of the industry and ITI principals coming together to chalk out strategies to reduce the gap between demand and supply of skilled manpower.

M.V. Sivakumar Reddy, Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories, Chittoor, spoke on the need for students to get practical knowledge and hands-on experience to learn the nuances of their study. “When the industry comes forward to train the students, the latter also get to know the safety practices required at the workplace and get acclimatised to the industrial atmosphere. It thus becomes easy for them to get placements,” Mr. Reddy said.

The industry can be assured of a skilled workforce suitable for recruitment, besides easily reaching the 75% local target set by the government, thus earning respect from the villagers in the vicinity, Mr. Reddy said. While helping contain migration to cities, this would also help the local youth contribute to the organisation and their village, he added.

TERI Director General Ajay Mathur said at the World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) 2020 in New Delhi on Wednesday that the institute would be happy to provide clean, energy-efficient solutions to Andhra Pradesh along with The Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) with the support of the Government of Japan through the Japan-India Technology Matchmaking Platform (JITMAP), according to a press release by A. Chandrasekhara Reddy, CEO of A.P. State Energy Conservation Mission (AP-SECM).

Mr. Reddy quoted Mr. Mathur as saying that Energy Efficiency (EE) would play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between power supply and demand, and would ultimately lead to achieving cost-effective power.

Since the supply options often require huge investments and have a long gestation period, enhancing EE provides an alternative solution for meeting the ever-rising demand without sacrificing the larger goal of high economic growth.

In his message read out by the SECM, Energy Secretary N. Srikant said that the State government was committed to achieving cost-effective power and that it was implementing several revolutionary schemes in the power sector for the benefit of farmers and marginalised sections.

The State government believes cost-effective power can serve as a tool for strengthening the power sector, making Discoms economically viable, promoting industrialisation and enhancing the living standards of people, Mr. Srikant said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/willing-to-provide-ap-energy-efficient-solutions/article30687189.ece
86,2020/01/30,"Farmers oppose Seed Bill 2019, pass resolution against it","Farmers in the region have urged the government not to adopt and enact the draft Seed Bill 2019 on the ground that it threatens the seed sovereignty of the agricultural community.

A resolution to this effect was passed at a seminar organised by the Raitha Mitra Farmers Producers Cooperative Ltd. and Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association and Institute of Horticulture, Mysuru, on Thursday.

Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the Association who delivered the keynote address, said that there were genuine fear and concern among the farmers that they would be divested of their right to cultivate and propagate the indigenous seeds and would be forced to become dependent on patent-owning companies.

He said the multinational companies would exploit the farmers in case the seed sovereignty was lost, resulting in a further increase in cost of cultivation that has to be borne by the farmers.

Mr. Shantha Kumar said the agricultural sector was already under stress and a new act that divests them of seed sovereignty would add to their financial burden.

Anant Hegde Ashisar, Chairperson, Karnataka Biodiversity Board, said though he welcomed the broad objectives of the Seed Bill 2019 there were certain anomalies that need to be rectified. He said the present draft bill was better than the prevailing 1966 Seed Act.

Mr. Hegde also called for institutional support for farmers engaged in conservation of indigenous plants and varieties.

He also called for third-party appraisal of the quality of seeds manufactured by private companies so that farmers were not foisted with spurious seeds.

Krishna Prasad of Sahaja Samruddha stressed the importance of ensuring that the farmers’ right of breeding, saving and using seeds was not compromised as this ensures promotion of agro-diversity.

He said it was not enough to regulate the quality of seeds alone; equally important was the regulation of the price lest the farmers are exploited by profit-seeking private companies.

KMF sources said that 40 paise of the ₹2 hike per litre would go into the fund.

This initiative comes in light of the State government not warming up to the idea of having a cattle insurance scheme. The KMF had suggested a scheme entailing a ₹120-crore burden on the State exchequer. Sources in the milk federation said that of the estimated 25 lakh cattle, about 20,000 cattle deaths that could qualify for compensation are reported annually. “Modalities of the compensation and how to administer the corpus fund will be worked out now,” a source said.

The distribution of the ₹2 hike among all the stakeholders associated with the KMF will bring cheer to milk society employees as well as agents who deliver milk in the market.

89,2020/01/30,University of Mysore tells Chinese students not to return till scare subsides,"Amid a global concern over the coronavirus outbreak, the University of Mysore has asked its Chinese students who are on a vacation break not to return till the virus scare subsides.

Out of the 120 Chinese students enrolled in various postgraduate programmes in the Department of Studies in Computer Science at the university under a Chinese programme, 18 went back to their native places earlier this month as part of the vacation that coincides with Chinese New Year on January 25.

All the Chinese students enrolled in the study programme here stay in a separate hostel for them. Though many Chinese students opted out of the holiday and stayed in their hostel in view of the virus scare in China, some went ahead with their vacation.

But, ahead of the scheduled return of the students on vacation, the remaining Chinese students became worried over the coronavirus, which is feared to be spreading to different parts of the world.

“The Chinese students here shared their apprehension of the spread of coronavirus. They did not want their fellow Chinese students to return now as they share a hostel with them,” said Registrar R.

90,2020/01/30,Dream of high-speed train travel revived,"The concept of high-speed travel between Mysuru and Bengaluru so as to cover the 139 km distance between the two cities in less than an hour is back in the reckoning after a long hiatus.

Railway Board Chairman V.K. Yadav on Wednesday announced that the Chennai-Bengaluru-Mysuru route was one of the six new high-speed corridors to be implemented by the railways, which has re-kindled hopes of faster, improved connectivity between the two cities.

According to officials, the Detailed Project Report (DPR) is likely to be prepared by the National High Speed Rail Corporation of India Ltd. which is to implement the project though no final decision has been taken regarding it.

Incidentally, a feasibility study for increasing the speed on this section was given to China Railway Eryuan Engineering Group and it had submitted its interim report in June 2015. But subsequently, Germany conducted a fresh feasibility study on the route and submitted the report to the Railway Board in November 2018. The study was fully funded by Germany and the report is reckoned to have spoken positively in favour of the high-speed corridor and is expected to cost around ₹1 lakh crore.

The concept of a high-speed railway is not new and was first proposed in 2008-09 but it remained on paper. But subsequently efforts were made to decrease the running time between Mysuru and Bengaluru by speeding up the trains. A technical survey was conducted by the Rail Vikas Nigam Ltd. and High Speed Rail Corporation (HSRC) to assess the feasibility of running trains at speeds in excess of 160 kmph on the section

But a preliminary survey indicated that top speed in excess of 160 kmph could not be attained for greater part of the journey as there were 135 curves of which as many as 37 curves had a curvature of 5 degree.

Subsequently, the authorities put the issue on the back burner while there were suggestions that a semi-high speed corridor would be feasible as it entailed increasing the average speed to around 120 kmph between the two cities so as to cover the distance of 139 km in around 75 minutes.

This called for reducing the curvature in some sections by realigning the track besides replacing the 52 kg per metre rail with 60 kg per metre rails. It would not have cost more than a few hundred crores of rupees and was reckoned to be feasible. But there was no further development or news about high-speed travel until the fresh announcement made on Wednesday.

Consequent to track doubling and completion of electrification the travel time between the two cities is a little less than 2 hours (as in case of Shatabdi Express) and around 2.30 hours in case of other express trains. Nearly 20,000 people travel daily in each direction and there are 34 pairs of trains (including non-daily services) operating between the two cities.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yswsg5/article30695689.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MYSTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dream-of-high-speed-train-travel-revived/article30695690.ece
91,2020/01/30,Coronavirus: Private hospitals reluctant to set up isolation wards in Karnataka,"Three days after the Health and Family Welfare Department asked private hospitals to set aside 10 beds for admission and treatment of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), many hospitals are reluctant to do so.

While four hospitals have agreed to set up the isolation wards and one of them — Manipal Hospitals — has already done so, most are not coming forward as the managements are worried that isolation wards, especially for coronavirus, may deter patients with other ailments from seeking care, sources said. Although an official communication from the Health Department said that 10 private hospitals have been identified, B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director, Communicable Diseases, said they were yet to confirm their willingness to set up the wards in writing. “As of now only Manipal Hospitals has set up a ward, and we have inspected it,” he said.

Dr. Prakash, who is the State nodal officer on 2019-nCOV, said the department cannot force hospitals to set up isolation wards. “We can enforce it under the Karnataka Private Medical Establishments Act only if the outbreak is declared as a public emergency in the country. It has been only three days since we asked them to set aside 10 beds. They need time to identify and set up the wards. We hope more hospitals will come forward in the coming days,” he said.

R. Ravindra, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, said smaller hospitals were not geared up to handle the situation. “Large hospitals can identify a portion or a floor for an isolation ward, but it may be difficult for smaller hospitals as their staff are not trained in managing isolation wards, especially if there is an outbreak of an infectious disease,” he said.

Seven discharged

Meanwhile, with the Health Ministry modifying the admission and discharge guidelines in isolation wards, seven patients who had been quarantined at the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases were discharged on Thursday even before their test reports arrived.

Institute director C. Nagaraja said that according to the new guidelines, only those who have come directly from Wuhan city in China, where the virus first surfaced, and have flu-like symptoms should be quarantined. “Those who have travelled from other cities in China and have symptoms can be put under home isolation for 28 days under the supervision of surveillance officers. So, we discharged seven patients on Thursday and advised [them] to strictly be under home isolation for 28 days,” he said.

“Apart from this, one patient has sought referral to a private hospital. With this, we have only two patients in the ward now. Although eight more persons self-reported to us on Thursday, we have taken their samples and sent them home as they are clinically stable and have only mild symptoms,” Dr. Nagaraja said.

Following a positive case detected in Kerala, the Union Cabinet Secretary on Thursday held a video-conference meeting with Chief Secretaries of all States to review the status of preparedness.

Preparations

Apart from five beds each that have been identified at Jayanagar General Hospital and Epidemic Diseases Hospital in Bengaluru, five-bed wards have also been identified in all district hospitals. Besides, the National Institute of Virology, Bengaluru unit, and the Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute will be activated for testing of coronavirus within the two days, said an official note.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-private-hospitals-reluctant-to-set-up-isolation-wards-in-karnataka/article30695667.ece
92,2020/01/30,Kalaburagi DC told to fix schedule for razing 282 illegal structures,"The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday directed the Deputy Commissioner of Kalaburagi to spell out the schedule for demolishing 282 illegal constructions, identified by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), in the protected area of the Gulbarga Fort and the great mosque in the fort.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order after the ASI informed it that 282 illegal structures had been identified for demolition and notices issued to those who put up such structures by following due process under the provisions of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.

The Bench was hearing a PIL petition filed in 2018 by Sharan Desai of Kalaburagi. The petitioner complained that authorities had allowed illegal constructions on the protected, prohibited and regulated zones of Gulbarga Fort and the great mosque.

Section 19(1) of the Act states that no one, including the owner or occupier of a protected area, can construct any building within the protected area, carry out certain types of activities, or utilise the area in any other manner without the permission of the Union government.

The ASI, according to earlier orders of the court, had identified 282 structures in the protected area, and 148 structures in the prohibited and regulated area. It had also issued show-cause notice to the persons who put up the structures. After considering the responses, the ASI, on December 4 and 5, 2019, passed an order for demolishing all 282 structures and sent it to the Deputy Commissioner for execution.

Meanwhile, the Bench asked ASI to consider the representations received in connection with the other 148 illegal constructions and decide the future course of action. Further hearing on the matter has been adjourned till March 4.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bvqhoa/article30695654.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGGLBFORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kalaburagi-dc-told-to-fix-schedule-for-razing-282-illegal-structures/article30695655.ece
93,2020/01/30,Yoga camp off to a grand start,"A five-day yoga camp by yoga guru Baba Ramdev got off to a grand start on Thursday with several yoga enthusiasts of different age groups and from different walks of life turning up at the venue despite the chilly weather.

Baba Ramdev demonstrated various yogasanas and delivered short discourses during the first day programme, which stretched for over two-and-a-half hours.

During the programme, a pledge to make the world disease-free through yoga was made.

Emphasising the need for a ban on tobacco products, Baba Ramdev said that if ban was imposed, there would be no poverty in India. “Yoga has no caste or religion. It is a science. If you adapt this science in your life, diseases will not come near your,” he said.

Inaugurating the camp, Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami said that yoga was more important than food and water. “For a peaceful, contented and disciplined life, practising yoga is important,” he said. The seer lauded the efforts of Baba Ramdev in popularising yoga at a global level.

Chairman of VRL Group Vijay Sankeshwar said that good practice of yoga keeps diseases away. He stressed the need for launching a campaign against consumption of tobacco and gutka.

Recalling Baba Ramdev’s visit to Hubballi 12 years ago, Mr. Sankeshwar said that following his visit, yoga practitioners had increased and their number was in lakhs now. Through Yoga Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had further popularised yoga, he said.

Felicitated

Mr. Sankeshwar, who has been honoured with the Padma Shri award, was felicitated by Baba Ramdev and Gurusiddha Rajayogindra Swami.

95,2020/01/30,BSY’s assertion worries Ramesh Jarkiholi supporters,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s assertion that the State will not have a fourth Deputy Chief Minister, seems to have affected the mood of Ramesh Jarkiholi’s followers who were expecting their leader to become one.

Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s followers held a meeting in Gokak on Thursday to discuss various issues. “We know that Ramesh Sahukar has a responsibility to ensure that all his followers get ministerial berths,” said a zilla panchayat member who attended the meeting. “He convinced them to resign from the coalition government and led them to the BJP, after promising them that they will be made Ministers. Now, if they are not made Ministers, they will ask him and not the BJP leadership. The BJP leaders should keep their word,” he said.

Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi and his younger brother and BJP MLA, Balachandra Jarkiholi, met at a private hotel in Bengaluru on Thursday.

After the meeting, Mr. Balachandra Jarkiholi told journalists that neither he nor Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi had wanted to be Deputy CM. “It was a creation of the media. We never asked for it,” he said.

Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi’s confidante Mahesh Kumthalli, MLA from Athani, said in Bengaluru they expected that their leader would be made the DCM.

“He deserves to be made the deputy CM. Laxman Savadi is already the DCM and having two DCMs from the district will be historic,” he said. “I will be happy if I am made a Minister. If not, I will happily serve my constituency as a MLA,” he said.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Lakhan Jarkiholi, who lost to his elder brother Mr. Ramesh Jarkiholi in Gokak, said BJP would not make him a DCM. “He will not be even made a Minister,” he told journalists in Gokak on Thursday.

“I have already said that If he is made the Irrigation Minister, he will make sure the party goes underwater,” he said.

“The BJP may remain safe if he is given Small Scale Industries or Municipal Administration portfolios,” Mr. Lakhan Jarkiholi added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bsys-assertion-worries-ramesh-jarkiholi-supporters/article30694357.ece

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Ravi Gouda, Mohammad Qadeer, Sridhar D., Chandra Mohan, Naveen Kagalkar and Narayan Roogi, leaders of different bank employees’ unions, said that the wage revision settlement due from November 2017 will be the major demand of the strike.

“There will be no banking activity for two days,” he said.

The union leaders also warned of the second round of strike on March 11, 12, and 13, and an indefinite strike from April 1, if their demands were not amicably settled.

101,2020/01/30,Online payment of property tax likely from April 1,"The Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) has issued work orders for the roll out of online payment of property tax with effect from April 1.

MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde told The Hindu that digitisation of records in the property register is on and the data will be fed into the systems while software is being developed for the online calculation of tax.

“We are working hard to ensure that the system is in place from April 1 as it marks the beginning of the new financial year’’, said Mr. Hegde.

A long-pending project which had many false starts but failed to take off, its implantation to a large extent hinges on the completion of the existing property survey in the MCC limits but is yet to take off.

But Mr. Hegde said the window available for completion of the property survey is exactly two months and though it is a difficult task, it was not impossible.

The Urban Property Ownership Record (UPOR) project has completed the property survey and has developed a database for all properties in Mysuru city besides about 40 villages surrounding it coming under the MUDA jurisdiction. But the MCC was keen to conduct its own property survey given specific requirements for tax calculation.

“The UPOR records will give us data pertaining to the plot dimension and its geographical coordinates with relation to other properties etc. But for the calculation of property tax we also need the land usage, the quality of construction determined on the basis of use of granites, tiles, marble etc, the quality of wood used etc., and this calls for a fresh survey’’, said Mr. Hegde.

In case the survey cannot be completed by April 1, MCC may migrate to the online system with the existing database and records that are being digitalised and carry out the survey later. “If the two-month window to complete the survey and update the data base is too short, we may even roll out the online taxation system with the existing records, and carry out the corrections if any on completion of the survey’’, he added. However, the thrust is on completing the survey within the available time and roll out the system.

Intriguingly, online payment of property tax is being pushed by NGOs such as Mysore Grahakara Parishat (MGP) since more than a decade but the officials had persisted with the current cumbersome method of spot payment. The reason extended was that any new system had to be approved by the Directorate of Municipal Administration. However, the MCC Commissioner said it was not true and many city corporations had switched over to the online payment system 10 years ago.

The online payment will be a more transparent process and eliminate the inconsistencies in tax calculation and help shore up the revenue mobilisation.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yo7kgw/article30694458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30MYSTAX,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/online-payment-of-property-tax-likely-from-april-1/article30693189.ece

103,2020/01/30,Nationalised banks to remain closed for two days,"All branches of nationalised banks will remain closed on Friday and Saturday following a strike call given by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), said R. Kumar, Hassan district convener of the forum.

At a press conference here on Thursday, he said the forum has given the call for the strike to put pressure on the Indian Banks Association to revise wages of the employees, besides other demands.

The revision of wages had been pending since November 2017. The IBA had refused to accept the demands of the unions even after a series of dialogues. The banks, due to the hard work of the employees, had been making profits. But the profit had been adjusted to bad loans, to show a loss. “Above 80% of the bad loans belonged to corporate companies, not common people. The RBI should take responsibility for the bad loans and take strict actions to recover the loans,” he said.

Other demands of the employees include a review of retirement benefits, employee-friendly pension scheme and fixed working hours for officers, Mr. Kumar said.

The employees of all nationalised banks would assemble at N.R.Circle and take out a march to the Deputy Commissioner's office on Friday. There would be no banking services on both days.

The unions would hold strike for three days from March 11 and would go on an indefinite strike from April 1 to put pressure on the IBA, if the demands were not fulfilled, he added.

110,2020/01/30,Handicraft artisans hope for GST cut,"Ahead of the Union Budget, artisans in the handicraft sector are looking for greater tax relief to overcome the financial impact of the economic downturn and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates.

Mysuru is one of the major hubs for handicrafts and supports nearly 5,000 to 6,000 families who are mainly engaged in wood inlay works, furniture and making of idols. But the imposition of GST – which is 18% for furniture and 12% for wall hangings, inlay works and other decorative items – has hit the artisan community hard.

There is no GST on making small idols of gods and goddesses but the bulk of revenue for artisans comes from furniture and inlay works. Incidentally, Mysuru wooden inlay work has a Geographical Indication tag and is recognised for its unique characteristics and skills of the local artisans.

However, the artisans are of the opinion that the economic downturn and the high GST rates have impacted their fortunes.

S. Ramu of the Mysuru Handicrafts Manufacturers Association told The Hindu that they have made many representations to the government to reduce the GST but without any success. “We have appealed once again ahead of the budget and hope that a tax cut will give the requisite boost to the sector,” said Mr. Ramu.

In the pre-GST era, the artisans had to worry only about VAT and it was a nominal 4% on most products though it was 14% on furniture. “But overall, it was lower than the GST rates,” said Mr. Ramu. Consequently, the handicraft turnover has registered a steep decline, aver the Association members, who look forward to a GST rate cut in the budget.

Sunil Kumar, Assistant Director, Handicrafts Marketing and Extension Centre, Mysuru, which looks after the sector in 10 districts said artisans do complain about the high GST rates and have sought a reduction in GST on furniture from 18% to 12% and on other products from 12% to 5%.

The association said the economic slowdown and fall in demand coupled with high GST has eaten into the profits and they are barely sustaining. “Notwithstanding the lower profit margins due to the taxation rate and the dwindling orders we have to pay the skilled artisans and daily wagers to retain them,” Mr. Ramu said.

The bulk of the handicraft items are sold to retailers who in turn depend on the tourist footfall to fuel the demand for handicraft products. But the manufacturers have been forced to shore up the prices to sustain themselves which has lowered the sales and consequently the demand. It is a vicious cycle to break from which the artisans now hope for rate cut.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/751dwg/article30687422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29MYSHANDICRAFTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/handicraft-artisans-hope-for-gst-cut/article30687423.ece

A meeting in Thiruvananthapuram on Wednesday demanded that the department immediately put an end to intentional burning in forest areas.

It said forest fires had been globally rated as a disaster. With the Western Ghats vulnerable to wildfires, the government and the departments concerned should evaluate recurring forest fires as a disaster and rally all resources to tackle such incidents.

The meeting called for a coordinated effort of the Tribal Welfare, Forest, and Fire and Rescue Services departments as well as district administrations to address the issue.

The impact of forest fire on the rural economy, soil fertility, groundwater recharge, and river flow should be evaluated as environmental degradation was at its peak in the State.

The ecological value of grassland and forest ecosystems should be studied and the loss to the economy and ecology considered when planning a sustainable model for rebuilding Kerala.

113,2020/01/30,Modi’s words akin to Hitler’s: Shibu,"The words of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that “you may hate me, but do not hate India,’’ was akin to the controversial speech heard in Germany way back in 1935, Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) secretary Shibu Baby John has alleged.

Mr. John was inaugurating the ‘human map’ (Manushya Bhoopadom) of India, organised by the United Democratic Front (UDF), in protest against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), in Pathanamthitta on Thursday.

Drama

The ‘so-called protest’ of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) against the CAA was nothing but a deceptive drama, he said. The RSP leader said both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and the CPI(M) that had never hoisted the national flag at their headquarters were acting as ‘wholesale agents’ of patriotism.

Clash

The country was witnessing a dangerous clash between the Hindutva envisaged by Swami Vivekananda and the Hindutva of hatred and hostility propagated by Mr. Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, he said.

Mr. John said the anti-CAA protests across the country could not be treated as conflicts between Hindus and Muslims. He said the ongoing agitation would continue till the anti-people CAA was repealed. Victor T. Thomas, UDF district chairman, presided over the meeting.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/modis-words-akin-to-hitlers-shibu/article30695968.ece
114,2020/01/30,Kerala Congress (M) factions hold separate functions,"Rival factions of the Kerala Congress (M) on Wednesday organised separate events to commemorate the 87th birth anniversary of the party founder K.M. Mani.

While both the factions chose the occasion to uphold the KC(M) patriarch’s image as the saviour of the destitute, the programmes organised by them differed in focus as well as in content.

The programme organised by the Jose K. Mani group was inaugurated by Mar Jacob Muricken, Auxiliary Bishop of the Pala diocese, at the Paikada Athuralayam in Kochidappadi, near Pala. This was followed by district-level inaugurations at different locations.

Family members attend

The function at Pala was also attended by family members of Mani, including Kuttiyamma Mani, wife of the late Mani. Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, presided over the function. Speaking on the occasion, Bishop Muricken said Mani, while serving as a political leader for decades, always dedicated a share of his works to ensure the welfare of the destitute and desolate.

According to the organisers, inmates of as many as 1,000 charity centres joined the charity initiative, which offered clothes and medicines to the needy.

The Joseph group, on the other hand, organised a K.M. Mani Jayanthi Sammelan in Kottayam in the afternoon and offered assistance to patients undergoing dialysis. KC(M) leader and Kaduthuruthy MLA Mons Joseph inaugurated the event at a function presided over by the KC(M) district president Saji Manjakadambil.

KC(M) working chairman P.J. Joseph, meanwhile, was conspicuous by his absence at the programme. Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Mons Joseph said the party would soon open a K.M. Mani Global Study Centre to help young generations learn about the KC(M) leader’s contributions towards the varying sectors of Kerala society. The centre, according to him, will function as a non-political entity by roping in the service of experts in various subjects, including political science, economics and agriculture.

115,2020/01/30,Erumely residents on the warpath,"The stinking odour that emanates from the Valiyathodu canal, which courses through Erumely and eventually meets the Manimalayar river, often pervades the spiritual ambiance surrounding the town here.

As every year, the waterbody was an invariable dumping yard for partially treated sewage during the just-concluded Sabarimala pilgrim season.

This unchecked flow of faecal sludge from toilet complexes continuously for about two months has now choked its water flow, raising severe health concerns.

Court’s intervention

Miffed over the continuing inaction by the authorities concerned in cleaning the waterbody, a few local residents in Erumely have now approached the High Court of Kerala seeking its intervention in restoring and protecting the waterbody.

Admitting a Public Interest Litigation in this regard, the court has sought the response of the departments concerned on the issue prior to commencing the hearing.

Permanent solution

According to the petitioners, the objective is to make a permanent solution to the issue of sewage treatment.

“Around 2,000 toilets run by various agencies including the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) and the Erumely Jamath operate in the town here round the clock without sewage treatment plants (STPs).

The directions by the District Collector to establish STPs from time to time have fallen in deaf years,” says Lijin Thampan, who represents the petitioners.

The continuous discharge of waste, according to the Pollution Control Board (PCB), raises the presence of faecal coliform bacteria in the canal by several times over the permissible level of 500 units.

Taking a serious note of the issue, the PCB proposed action, including environment compensation cost against the TDB, for polluting the waterbody.

Though temporary stop-memos and show-cause notices were issued on the basis of it, the authorities are yet to initiate any major action against the polluters.

“The PCB concluded its operations in Erumely on January 20 after collecting a few water samples from the Valiyathodu canal. As far as the removal of faecal sludge is concerned, nothing major was done except for transporting a few truck loads to the treatment plant at Brahmapuram,’’ said a senior PCB official.

Clean-up drive

Confirming the issue, T.S. Krishna Kumar, president, Erumely grama panchayat, said a clean-up drive would initiate to clear the sewage waste choking the canal.

“The waste, which has piled up at different points, poses serious ecological and health risks, especially those dependent on the Manimalar river as a primary source of water. It will be taken out and disposed in two days’ time,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/erumely-residents-on-the-warpath/article30695934.ece

118,2020/01/30,Getting across the message on nutrition,"At 10 a.m. on Tuesday, an audio message on the importance of breakfast by the dietician of an Ernakulam hospital reached anganwadi workers in the State through WhatsApp.

The message went into the importance of breakfast, what to eat for a balanced meal, the quantities, and how skipping breakfast may lead to weight gain.

It was a reminder of the importance of breakfast for a healthy life.

Such messages are sent every day as part of the Women and Child Development Department’s Poshan Vani initiative as part of the Sampushta Keralam project to improve nutrition among children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women in the State.

Focus is on social media

The Poshan Vani initiative launched last month aims at creating the largest information, education, and communication (IEC) network in the State to take the message of nutrition to the people. The focus is on social media, with WhatsApp being the main platform for dissemination of the messages - in audio format. Doctors, nutritionists, dieticians, social workers, academics, department officials... all contribute to the audio messages. The messages are shared from the State unit of the nutrition mission to the district programme officers to child development project officers to supervisors to anganwadi workers as part of this network.

Besides information on nutrition, the messages touch upon all topics related to women and children, be it schemes or their rights. As it is a broadcast group, the public too can become a part of it if a message is sent on the number 9447588588.

Women and Child Development Director T.V. Anupama says that as WhatsApp is a fast, cheap, and near universal medium, the nutrition mission is relying on it to disseminate information to the public through field functionaries. As it is given a considerable time every day, it is easy to ensure transmission of messages through it.

The IEC repository, as per content, will be put up on the department website.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/getting-across-the-message-on-nutrition/article30695814.ece

125,2020/01/30,Census communication drops references to NPR,"The Directorate of Census Operations, Kerala, has stopped referring to the National Population Register (NPR) in its census-related communication indicating that the controversial process may be dropped in Kerala.

The decision to avoid references to the NPR was taken following “oral instructions” from the authorities concerned. A formal communication announcing the decision to drop NPR updating was expected shortly, highly places sources said.

Incidentally, the State government had decided to dissociate itself with NPR after The Hindu reporting on December 20, last year that the process was under way in the State.

The Directorate of Census Operations, Kerala, is currently moving ahead only with the House Listing and Housing Census. All the communication being send out from the office since last week refers only to the census and not updating of NPR, census officials pointed out.

The NPR was supposed to be updated along with House Listing and Housing Census from April 15 to May 29 in the State.

On January 14, T. Mithra, Director of Census Operations, Kerala, had written to the City/Town Census Officers asking them to draw up a list of “enumerators and supervisors for House Listing and Housing Census and updating of NPR.”

As the earlier census-related communication issued from the Directorate to the General Administration Department had references to the NPR, the State officials used to strike out the NPR part from it before forwarding it to the census officials concerned.

The officials at the district levels were forced to expunge the NPR-related references from the communication or redraft it before forwarding it to implementation officers. In a few instances, the failure to black out the references to the NPR had resulted in public protests, officials pointed out.

The State had witnessed widespread public protest against the NPR and NRC following the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The State Cabinet had earlier decided to write to the Registrar, General and Census Commissioner of India, expressing fear that updating would lead to the preparation of National Register of Citizens (NRC). The State government apprehended that updating would trigger widespread unrest in the State. The District Collectors had informed the government that updating of NPR along with the Census would upset the whole process.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/census-communication-drops-references-to-npr/article30694819.ece
126,2020/01/30,Modi challenging ideas of great leaders: Rahul,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, MP, has alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is trying to challenge the ideas of great leaders in the country.

Speaking after inaugurating a public meeting held in connection with a United Democratic Front (UDF) against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) here on Thursday, Mr. Gandhi said there were great leaders in the country, including Mahatma Gandhi, who encouraged others to search for the truth.

“But today, an ignorant man was trying to challenge these ideas. He is so full of hatred and anger and he cannot even understand what is India’s strength,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Comparing the ideology of Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse to Mr. Modi, Mr. Gandhi said that both of them believed in the same ideology. “There is no difference, except Mr. Modi does not have the guts to say that he believes in Nathuram Godse,” Mr. Gandhi said.

Mr. Gandhi said the country had showed the world the importance of unity in diversity. Different languages, religions and beliefs in the country were all working together towards one goal. But now, the country had lost its way, he said.

“People are locked up for saying what they believed in,” Mr. Gandhi said adding that the life of thinkers such as Gauri Lankesh and M.M. Kalburgi were examples.

“Unemployment is the highest in the country in past 45 years,” Mr. Gandhi said adding that the economic growth had declined from 9.5% to 2.5%.

Mr. Gandhi said youngsters could not see a future and the people now have to prove that they were Indians. “I know I am an Indian and I don’t have to prove it to anybody,” Mr. Gandhi said adding that 1.3 billion Indians would also not have to prove their nationality.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/modi-challenging-ideas-of-great-leaders-rahul/article30693762.ece
127,2020/01/30,CAA: Kerala Assembly to omit Governor’s remarks in annals,"Governor Arif Muhammad Khan’s meanderings from the government’s policy address will not reflect in Assembly records.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan told reporters here on Thursday that past rulings and precedent compelled the House to include only the speech cleared by the Cabinet in its annals.

Mr. Khan, who was at odds with the Assembly for adopting a resolution seeking the repeal of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), had veered off-script at the cusp of reading out the controversial paragraph number 18 on Wednesday.

The passage said the government believed that the citizenship law ran against the underlying principles of the Constitution and the House had adopted a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Act.

“The Chief Minister had said in its letter that the paragraph reflected the view of the government. I hold the view that the observation does not come under the definition of policy or programme. I disagree with the portion, but I am going to read it to honour the wish of the CM,” he had said.

Mr. Khan, who held the position that the Assembly had no business to legislate or pass an opinion on a Central law, had earlier counselled the government to omit the portion from the policy statement.

He had also hinted that the Supreme Court heard several appeals against the law and any public debate on the matter was sub judice. However, the Cabinet had stuck to its guns and refused to budge from the original script.

An official said Raj Bhavan was unlikely to insist that the Assembly include his remarks in its records. “The Governor had made his point, and he has laid the issue to rest”, he said.

Meanwhile, the Business Advisory Committee of the House will consider on Friday whether to allow Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala to move a motion seeking to discuss the conduct of Mr. Khan and urge his recall.

Officials felt the government might oppose the move. An early indication of the State’s thinking was perhaps evident in the remarks of Parliamentary Affairs Minister A. K. Balan on Wednesday. Mr. Balan had said the government could not support the Opposition’s bid to precipitate a rift between the Governor and the government. He said the UDF had hoped to create a constitutional crisis and “fish in the muddied waters.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hpu176/article30690312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDARIFKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-assembly-to-omit-governors-remarks-in-annals/article30690314.ece

129,2020/01/30,Former Kerala Minister M. Kamalam passes away at 93,"Former Kerala Minister and veteran Congress leader M. Kamalam passed away at her residence near Nadakkavu in Kozhikode on Thursday. She was 93.

She was one of the most respected women leaders in Kerala who had played a major role in mobilising women activists for strengthening the Congress. She also held the portfolio of Minister for Cooperation in the K. Karunakaran Ministry between 1982 and 1987. She was also the chairperson of the Kerala State Women’s Commission.

Born to Keloth Krishnan and Keloth Janaki on August 14, 1926, Kamalam made her entry into active politics by contesting the local body election in Kozhikode at a young age. Twice she had been elected to the Kerala Legislative Assembly. Kamalam was also known for her close political associations with top women national leaders of the party.

A former general secretary and vice-president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, Kamalam was part of the Congress (O) after the split in the party and had become a working committee member.

When the Janata Party was formed, she was also its chairperson in the Kozhikode District Committee. Kamalam had also taken part in a number of agitations and undergone imprisonment in connection with the Vimochana Samaram and later in the agitations related to the Emergency.

Kamalam, wife of late Mambatta Samikutty, is survived by sons Yatheendradas, M. Murali, M. Rajagopal and M. Vijayakrishnan and daughter Padmaja Charudathan.

130,2020/01/30,Kerala Governor reads anti-CAA reference in policy address,"Laying rumours and speculation to rest, Governor Arif Mohammed Khan delivered the Left Democratic Front government’s policy address that poignantly reflected its position and concerns about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Assembly on Wednesday.

The spat between the Governor and the government on the CAA had triggered rumours that he would skip such portions. But he sprang a surprise and read out the controversial paragraph. Deviating from the prepared policy address, he said it was in honour of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s wish that he was reading out the paragraph. “Our citizenship can never be on the basis of religion as this goes against the grain of secularism, which is part of the basic structure of our Constitution,” the address said.

“Our constitutional values have to be protected in their form and content. The former devoid of the latter will make out democracy an empty shell, which, I hope, will not be allowed by the people of India.” The Opposition United Democratic Front confronted the Governor with slogans and placards demanding that the President recall him. They blocked him for 10 minutes, but he was led to the podium with a security cordon and the Opposition boycotted the address in protest.

Critical of Centre

The policy was unsparing on its criticism of the Centre’s economic policies. It voiced concern about the slowdown that has adversely impacted the growth rate, revenue buoyancy and Central transfers to the State. The Centre has not released the quinquennial survey reports of the National Sample Survey Organisation since its inception and thus denied policymakers and researchers a prime analytical tool, the address said.

The policy strongly lashed out at the fiscal conservatism being practised by the Centre and warned that mechanical adherence to deficit ratios would be deleterious and aggravate the slowdown. As a policy prescription, the State wanted the Centre to boost private consumption, mainly in the manufacturing sector.

Shrinking revenue

While the revenue prowess of the States is shrinking, their expenditure obligations are on the rise. The slow down has taken a heavy toll on the State which has an uncompromising stance on social sector spending.The sharp cut in Central transfers and reduction in public borrowing in the last quarter of the financial year from ₹10,000 crore to ₹1,900 crore have compounded the financial woes of the State, the policy address said.

By delivering the address as desired by the government, Mr. Khan has blunted the Opposition criticism of deprecating the Assembly.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/cmn5bn/article30688033.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TVPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-reads-anti-caa-reference-in-policy-address/article30688034.ece
131,2020/01/30,Japanese veena player enthrals music lovers,"Yuko Matoba is one among the many veena players in the world, but what sets her apart is that she is probably the only artiste from Japan to have international recognition.

She was in Kannur recently to do a performance at which she enthralled the audience with her mastery of the veena.

The 70-year-old player had a great passion for music from childhood. She graduated from the Department of Musicology, Tokyo University of the Arts, and received guidance from Professor Fumio Koizumi.

“Professor Koizumi was the first person to introduce Indian music in Japan. He asked me to visit India to learn Indian music,” said Matoba.

She started learning Carnatic music at a college in Chennai in 1972.

“I chose veena as it sounds attractive. I learned how to play it from Rajalakshmi Narayanan, Kalpakam Swaminathan, M. Nageswara Rao, M. Sarada and N. Vijayalakshmi,” she said.

Her first veena concert was in Chennai 10 years ago and since then, Matoba has presented many concerts across India and Japan.

“I have taken part in Veena Navaratri, and have been participating in Veena Utsavam for the past five years in Chennai,” she said.

She still visits the country twice a year to take classes. “I try to learn as many aspects of veena as I can,” she says. Indian and Japanese music, she says, are similar. “They both have a delicate melody line, but I think Carnatic music is more logical.”

When she’s back in Japan, she conducts Carnatic music classes there. “I run private Carnatic music classes and teach musicians how to play the veena,” Matoba said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/2mea9i/article30688020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200127-WA0008,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/japanese-veena-player-enthrals-music-lovers/article30688021.ece

Sudheeran has said that the action of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other leaders of the LDF in not recognizing the Opposition’s demand that the Governor be recalled was a betrayal of the people.

Inaugurating the second day tour of the march led by District Congress Committee president Satheeshan Pacheni against the Citizenship Amendment Act at Kariyad Puducherry in Pannur block, he said the Governor did not deserve the position as he had “insulted the Kerala Assembly and the people of Kerala”.

Taking a dig at the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Mr. Sudheeran said the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front, which claimed to oppose Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, was taking a softer approach toward the Governor.

“The game played by the Governor is undemocratic and unconstitutional and he has become a political player,” he said.

134,2020/01/30,HC decision on Dileep’s plea likely today,"The Kerala High Court is likely to pronounce its judgment on a petition filled by actor Dileep against the decision of the trial court to simultaneously try the female actor rape case and a court charge that three accused in the case had conspired and threatened him to extort money.

Though the prosecution did not have a case that the three accused, Sunil, Sanilkumar and Vishnu, had threatened actor Dileep, also an accused in the rape case, the trial court had included it in the court charge. The three were also accused in the rape case. Counsel for the actor contended that the two charges shall not be tried together and the actor shall not be tried along with the other accused in the case, as it would adversely affect his defence. The counsel also said that the charges in the two cases shall be split and tried separately.

At the same time, senior government pleader Suman Chakravarthy submitted that it was a technical error on the part of the trial court in deciding to trying the two charges together. The charges can any time be altered or modified by the court, he submitted. Mr. Chakravarthy also submitted that the three accused never tried to extort money. In fact, it was an attempt of the accused to reach out to the actor to collect the remuneration for copying the visuals of the rape, he submitted.

Later, when the court considered the case after a break, the prosecution submitted that the charges of criminal intimidation slapped on the three accused will be dropped and the conspiracy charges retained.

135,2020/01/30,The idea is to become the voice of the unheard: Naezy,"Naved Shaikh, popularly known as Naezy, shot to fame when Ranveer Singh portrayed a character based on his life in Zoya Akhtar’s “Gully Boy”. Before becoming part of popular discourse, he was already famous among the independent music lovers because of his rap songs such as “Aafat” and “Meri Gully Mein”. His songs, mostly autobiographical, are known for expressing the aspirations and frustrations of people living in slums and streets. His debut album “Maghreb” has songs which talk about social issues including economic inequality, political instability and life of people living in the streets of slums. Here, he talks about how life changed after “Gully Boy”, what defines Gully Rap and why youth relates to his music.

Edited excerpts:

What intrigued you to come up with “Maghreb”?

I was in the UK for a while and only recently came back to India. The experience there made me realise that we are very much influenced by the western culture in every sense. I asked myself, what is my originality? Throughout my life, I belonged to India but what is that thing which is unique? The Hip Hop scene in India came from western countries. I wanted to translate that idea. West translated in Urdu is Maghreb, which became the album's title. I started writing songs which represent the central idea. It's a reflection of what I have seen in my life and whatever my thoughts are. They were piling up for a while and I put it outside in through this album.

Some feel Gully rap is losing its original meaning?

After seeing the success of Gully rap, some musicians are trying to imitate us. But it is not everyone's piece of cake. They are trying to make it a saleable item which it is not. The values that it represents are much deeper than how it is represented. I think the main idea is to become the voice of the unheard. Through this album, I am trying to put light on the issues on which the idea of Gully rap stands for. People are making Gully rap as a cool thing but they are not aware of the issues that concern people living in slums. I do not want it to become commercialised.

How has your journey from slum to stardom translated into your writings?

My main inspiration is my life itself. I wanted to prove myself and that is why I kept trying despite failures. I get support from my family and my neighbourhood which pushes me to do something. After becoming famous, I moved from my neighbourhood to Bandra. But now when I go back to Kurla, I realise that life hasn’t changed for the people living there. They inspire me to keep going. With this album, it was an opportunity for me to make a comeback as I was not releasing a lot of music. My fans were upset and I wanted to make them happy through meaningful music.

What do you mean by meaningful music and why do you think youngsters relate to the rap you make?

It is very important to make music which is meaningful instead of listening to the commercial song where they are only talking about girls, partying and having fun. Our music is deeper and it's about life. That’s why people relate to it.

In one of the songs, I say income cannot be the criterion for happiness. In my eyes, a rich person who is enjoying his life and partying is not a winner but the person who is giving back to his family and playing his role with responsibility is the winner. When you think about the surroundings and the social environment, it’s a kind of awakening which makes them conscious about their lives.

How do you think the success of “Gully Boy” has changed your life?

There are good points and there are some negative points as well. While I am enjoying the new fame, money and recognition, I am also receiving a lot of hatred from the independent rappers. People are looking at me as a commercial rapper as I am getting involved in things that I don't want to do. Also, my privacy has been snatched. I can't roam around freely. The good part is we are trying to find a way to make use of whatever recognition we have got to serve the whole Hip Hop scene in a better way.

How do you think that the idea of Hip Hop has been assimilated into the original regional voices?

We express more and better when we rap in our regional languages as it comes from heart. The whole scene started with the success of my “Aafat” which changed the outlook of rap and then “Meri Gully Mein” gave the idea of how uniqueness can be special. Now some people are rapping in Marathi, Tamil, Malayalam, Assamese and Bengali. We may have been inspired by the west but we are now creating a strong base of Indian sensibility in rap with our roots, culture and tradition. We are not completely following them. We are not talking about women in a bad way, we are not making explicit lyrics and we are moulding it in the Indian way.

What do you think about the youth of India?

I have a lot of faith in young India. As you can see around, young India is smart to think about the real issues and that is why they are fighting for justice. I think people like us have set the right examples for youngsters. We have to tell them that adapting to new ways of living does not mean forgetting the roots.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/6x7csl/article30694103.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Naezy-Maghreb,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/the-idea-is-to-become-the-voice-of-the-unheard-naezy/article30694104.ece
136,2020/01/30,O.P. Nayyar: Remembering the rhythm king,"Everything in universe pulsates with a rhythm. From the blood flowing in the veins to the magnificent curves of the sea waves, every activity is dictated by an organic beat. Rhythm is at the heart of music and in the vast archive of Hindi film songs, we have had several composers excelling in their craft but perhaps none dazzled the screen with as many unusual rhythmic patterns of music as O P Nayyar. That he earned the sobriquet of the “Rhythm King” is not too surprising as his first name devolved from the most sacred sound of our Universe, Om!

If his melodies defy conventional rules of music making, they also make it apparent that Omkar Prasad Nayyar (or OP as he was popularly known) was a genius who despite absence of formal training, not only composed audacious tunes but also directed some of the most noteworthy musicians of his era. With an audacious confidence in himself, Nayyar created songs of such rare texture that his music acquired a haloed aura, forcing producers to print his name above the film stars on their banners since his name was a magnetic draw for audiences.

Frankly, if people still swoon in delight to the songs of Nayyar it is because their zing and zest give them the much-needed elixir for living. Nayyar’s exceptional talent lay in fusing the bohemian Punjabi spirit and western music in foot tapping rhythm. Take any of his songs and you will discover Nayyar shapes the rhythm with his own web of lilting instruments. Savour the delightfully different songs like “Ye Lo Main Haari Piya” (“Aar Paar”), “Aaiye Meherban Baithiye Jaanejaa” (“Howrah Bridge”), “Dil Par Hua Aisa Jaadoo” (“Mr & Mrs 55”), “Huzoor-e-Walaah” (“Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayegi”) or “Ek Baar Muskura Do” (“Ek Baar Muskura Do”) and you’ll notice the breath taking brilliance of rhythm in each note. The opening notes of “Aaiye Meherban Baithiye Jaanejaa” and “Huzoor-e-Walaah” are sufficient proof of how Nayyar’s unusual beat patterns inspire as well as seduce a listener!

But Nayyar was not just a master at stitching unusual rhythm patterns. His songs had an earthy feel. Fragrant like the fresh daisies that blossom in sunshine, they also shone with their art and grace. Be it romance, tease, guilt, tears or parting, Nayyar’s forte was giving a worthy song that brought alive the story in magnificent resonance of the required emotion, pitch and tenor.

Remember Rafi Sahab’s eternal love ballad “Aapke Haseen Rukh Pe Aaj Naya Noor Hai” (“Baharein Phir Bhi Aayengi”) that literally lingers and drools over the piano keys? Or the haunting “Pukarta Chala Hun Main” that makes the instrument of Santoor map out an exquisite and memorable road journey? Similarly, if he could make you smile with “Suno Suno Miss Chatterji” (“Baharein Phir Bhi Aayengi”) and “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahan” (“CID”), he could also make you weep with sublime tearjerkers as “Chain Se Humko Kabhi” (“Pran Jaaye Par Vachan Na Jaaye”) or “Tukde Hain Mere Dil Ke” (“Mere Sanam”). Irrespective of the stars or banners, Nayyar provided nuggets like “Laakhon Hain Nigha Mein” (“Phir Wahi Dil Laya Hun”), “Hai Duniya Useeki Zamana Useeka” (“Kashmir Ki Kali”), “Tumhara Chahne Wala” (“Kahin Din Kahin Raat”) and “Chal Akela Chal Akela” (“Sambandh”). Even in small time films like “Chhoo Mantar”, “Kalpana”, or “Bhagam Bhag” he gave exemplary songs like “Gareeb Jaanke Humko Na Tum Mita Dena”, “Tu Hai Mera Prem Devta” and “Hey Babu” respectively.

Many labelled him as obstinate or rebellious in temperament but it must be admitted that Nayyar was ahead of his time and his experimentations in music making were due to his devil may care approach to life. Many of his songs have no percussion instruments nor drums but Nayyar weaves a rhythm pattern from unusual sources. It isn’t clear as to who introduced “taali” (clap sound) or the horse shoe sound in film music but one can safely credit Nayyar for providing these sounds their distinct place and identity through a wide array of songs from “Ye Chand Sa Raushan Chehra” (“Kashmir Ki Kali”) to “Maang Ke Saath Tumhara” (“Naya Daur”). For lack of space, one refrains from quoting many songs of established music composers in which they tried to copy his style but failed miserably and one is inclined to agree with music director Anil Biswas that at a time when most music composers were copycats, “Nayyar was an original”.

Believing in full freedom in composition, selection of song writers and singers, Nayyar may have been a flashy showman but was a strict disciplinarian as far as his work was concerned. That is why he could oust Kishore Kumar from the recording studio when Kishore wasn’t doing justice to the devotional notes of “Man Mora Bawra”.

A fatalist, Nayyar believed “Time was the greatest maker of a man’s fortune” and accepted his decline stoically as it was inevitable. He always described Asha Bhosle as a great asset and there is no denial that Nayyar was responsible for her blossoming into an incredible singer. It was his stubbornness as well as visionary foresight that made him never sign Lata Mangeshkar but help Asha create magic under his baton. When they broke, all he said was that “this was destined to happen”.

Gutsy and irreverent, Nayyar was a loner who defied conventions of society and though labelled a rebel, a misfit and a disruptor, Nayyar was truly a blessing for Indian film music. He left home at the age of 18 to pursue a career in music and at the age of 60 plus, left music and home to live alone. Relinquishing his property to wife and children, Nayyar wandered in wilderness as a penitent Yogi… conscious of his burdens as well as wrong doings. Sad that he who composed the most delicate romantic numbers for Hindi screen was rendered longing for divine communion of “Pritam Aan Milo” (his own creation for C.H. Atma) in his last days!",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/i62932/article30694072.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/op-nayyar-remembering-the-rhythm-king/article30694073.ece
137,2020/01/30,"Fahadh Faasil lost 10 to 15 kilos as his character ages from 21 to 58, says 'Malik' director Mahesh Narayanan","Growing up in Poonkulam, a few kilometres away from coastal Kovalam, Mahesh Narayanan had many friends who lived by the sea. He was not oblivious to their struggle for livelihood and their defiance in the face of exploitation. Those stories of perseverance remained with him and now a slice of their life is being transformed on to the celluloid in his second directorial venture, Malik.

The editor-director, who won commercial as well as critical appreciation for his directorial début, Take Off, a gripping drama based on the real-life rescue mission of Indian nurses stranded in Iraq, has made the canvas even bigger with Malik. The Fahadh Faasil-starrer is already riding high on expectations after photographs of the actor in a lean look were splashed on social media. The first look poster with the actor has also enhanced the hype.

The big-budget movie, written and scripted by Mahesh, is “set in a coastal terrain and is inspired by the life of an individual who lived in one of those villages. It is a fictionalised account, taking only certain instances from his life,” he says.

First look poster of ‘Malik’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

The film is based around an incident in the history of Kerala involving two coastal villages, which had its repercussions on the political, religious, judicial as well as social fabric of the State. “The real reason behind the incident remains a mystery. The film explores the tragedy and how it affected the minority community,” he says.

The protagonist is Sulaiman (Fahadh), who emerges as the godfather for the fisher-folk. “A migrant, he is addressed as 'Malik' or owner, for he is the one they all look up to. He motivates them to resist threats to their land, homes, beliefs and occupation. As natural and man-made calamities throw their life out of gear, the State and bureaucratic machinery either remain mute spectators or force them to evacuate, thus opening doors for corporate players to enter the fray. Sulaiman emerges the leader in such a situation and keeps the community united,” narrates Mahesh.

Problems sans boundaries

He observes that the problems faced by the fisher-folk are infinite. “When you talk about boundaries, that doesn’t mean lines of demarcation between countries alone. The ocean is also a boundary. There are border politics, issues of trade and sometimes problems within the community itself and with the authorities. The fisher-folk are sidelined when it comes to education as well. All these have been explored in Malik,” he points out.

He explains that the issues faced by the fishing community is the same everywhere, be it in Kanyakumari, Kolachel, Rameswaram or Dhanushkodi. How the bureaucracy handles their problems is also more or less similar. “Even though we hailed them for their rescue act during the floods, we often choose to ignore their problems,” he says.

Mahesh says that although he had discussed the project with Fahadh much before Take Off, it was put on hold because of the huge production cost involved. “Also, Fahadh didn’t have the stardom he has now. But the success of Take Off brought us a producer. Although we have taken up a sensitive subject, it has been treated in a commercial way,” he points out.

Location hunt

However, the biggest challenge was finding a location. “The story spans 1965-2018 period and so we had to show the transformation of places and people. We couldn’t do that in any of the coastal areas. Also, I didn’t want to shoot at the original location because there are people who still remain affected by the incident and some of them are my friends,” he adds.

So they finally zeroed in on a six-acre plot at Kalamassery in Kochi, where art directors Santosh Raman and Sajan put up the set. Scenes have also been shot along the coastal belt, “from Kanyakumari to Munambam”, Minicoy in Lakswadweep and Abu Dhabi. People from coastal areas were auditioned for certain roles as the characters speak in the slang of the fisher-folk from the coastal belt of Thiruvananthapuram. Pre-production took several months. A miniature set was created before the actual one was made.

Making the cut As the editor of Malik, Mahesh says that he ensured that he shot only “those scenes that he wanted”. Among his upcoming works as editor are Martin Prakkat’s new film starring Joju George and Kunchacko Boban, Karachi 81, a spy thriller featuring Prithviraj and Tovino Thomas, and sequel to Kamal Haasan’s Thevar Magan

Mahesh says IV Sasi’s Ee Nadu was an inspiration to work on a large canvas. “It is a miracle that he shot it in 20-odd days. Not many filmmakers are taking up that genre now and I wanted to try that format in the present time with Malik,” he says.

Calling it the biggest project in Fahadh’s career, he says that the actor lost 10 to 15 kilos as his character ages from 21 to 58. “Like him, other actors also had to put on and lose weight, which they had to do in the 90-odd days we shot the film,” he says. Vinay Forrt plays a pivotal role and others in the cast are Nimisha Sajayan, Dileesh Pothen, yesteryear actor Jalaja, Joju George, Salim Kumar and Indrans, besides several new faces from theatre. Sanu Varghese, who shot Take Off, is the cinematographer. Lee Whittaker, Hollywood action director, has choreographed the action sequences. Music is by Sushin Shyam.

Talking about bringing another real-life story on to the celluloid, Mahesh says that Take Off and Malik fall into different zones.

“People have expectations about your second movie when you’ve had a successful outing with your debut. But I didn’t approach Malik in that way. It’s just that the success of Take Off gave me the confidence to do this one. I always want to tell stories that touch my heart. One gets a kick out of such subjects and that happened in the case of Malik as well. Thankfully, I had a team that stood by me. I want this work to be remembered for at least 10 years,” he says. The film is slated to release in mid-April.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/86z9dn/article30692251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvmmahesh,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fahadh-faasil-lost-10-to-15-kilos-as-his-character-ages-from-21-to-58-says-malik-director-mahesh-narayanan/article30692253.ece
138,2020/01/30,Confident and talented: 'Ala' actor Malavika Satheesan has arrived,"Very few girls get to see their debut film release when they are only 18 as did Malavika Satheesan. Actually Ala is Malavika’s first film but due to reasons unknown, it was released online. She also did BFH (Boyfriend For Hire) with Vishwant that is yet to release so technically that makes Choosi Choodangaane her third movie which will be releasing first. She wants to wait till January 31 to choose her next film.

“This film happened when I was in the XII std and my Board exams were going on. Given the short period, I did my best and scored above 90 percent and balanced both worlds, says a confident Malavika. the film is directed by debutant Santosh, Vishwanth is the hero. “I am getting offers but I am not in a hurry. Let people see my performance, let them judge me and give feedback. I shared my thoughts with a few people I know and they said I should wait and then take a call about going forward. After being in the industry and after a film being stuck and releasing on OTT, it is important to be a part of a big banner. Making a movie is no big deal, but bringing it out and ensuring maximum crowd sees it is quite a task.”

Malavika is from Trivandrum and did Ala immediately after completing her Xth std. Malavika never went to an acting school or got trained, she says she learnt it in the process. Coming from an Army background, participating in pageants was part of her growing up. She did modelling too and would have continued had she not got this offer. She says, “I am good at academics and wanted to get into the Army like my dad. I never stayed n Trivandrum, I have travelled to Jammu, Ambala, Dalhousie, UP, Dehradun, Hyderabad, Sikkim and some more places and had never made permanent friends. Travelling taught me to adjust to all situations though,”

Does she watch Telugu films? “I watched Arjun Reddy and Gita Govindam and a big fan of Vijay Deverakonda. After Baahubali, we started watching Telugu films. Right now my dad is posted in Tamil Nadu, so I am studying economics here in St Francis College,” she says candidly.

In Choosi Choodangane, Malavika plays a college student and shares space with Varsha Bollamma, another leading lady in the film. Malavika plays a straight forward and practical woman who is not bound by emotions.

On being asked if she made friends in the industry? She quips, “There are some people in the industry who help and guide me. I am lucky to be amid all of them. Not all get a chance to work here so I make the best use to do good work. I am lucky and I always have people like the script writers, directors and the producers in the films I worked to offer guidance.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/o6kwew/article30691853.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/malavika,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/malavika-satheesan-telugu-cinema-chusi-chudangane/article30691854.ece
139,2020/01/30,There’s divinity in forgiveness: Mysskin on 'Psycho' and why it's a 'fantasy tale that has ordered reality',"(This interview contains major spoilers)

Dark, violent, eccentric are some of the adjectives thrown at Mysskin to describe his brand of cinema. Dig deeper and you will realise that he is an unexpectedly humane filmmaker who treats his characters with remarkable tenderness, even if they have cruel intentions.

Mysskin is not a provocateur, but a disrupter. He likes to ‘disrupt’ the collective consciousness of the public through his craft. His movies define their own logic, and he writes his own rules when it comes to questions of morality and ethics. Perhaps the best definition of Mysskin’s world comes from the filmmaker himself: “I was dreaming on a piece of white paper with the help of a pencil,” he says with a warm smile, when I meet him in his Alwarpet office.

He is a changed man now. He has mellowed down, both as a filmmaker and a person. But what hasn’t changed is his little idiosyncrasies that are enriched by philosophy — something he quickly admits, “I know I’m meandering with my answers, but I hope you get the essence of it,” he says, when we settle down to dissect (no pun intended) his Psycho. Excerpts from an interview:

Your movies seem to explore the deeper, darker side of human psyche with one common motif: guilt — be it Onnayum Aatikuttiyum (OA), Nandalala or Psycho. Why is it a recurrent theme in the larger framework of your oeuvre?

It’s a personal question. I don’t think I can be truthful to my answer. No human is without flaws and we are designed to commit mistakes and crimes. I believe God [not to be taken in a literal sense, but symbolical] created us to be part of a play. What sort of play, you ask. To go through a cycle wherein (s)he does things they might not be proud of — some of the actions will come back to haunt them. When (s)he is cycled through life experiences, they look back at themselves and their slip-ups. Which is why guilt is not sorcery, but illumination. Guilt is not something to be guilty about (laughs). That’s what I have been trying to address in movies.

In my life, I have committed a lot of mistakes. When you begin to question what is right and wrong, we invariably think about ourselves being morally upright. Maybe I am not objective enough to look at my own movies from a vantage point. Once I’m done with a movie, I take it out of my system and move on. It could also be because I’m influenced by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. What they have been insisting in their books is: forgiveness is divine.

While we are on the subject of forgiveness, I am reminded of the climactic sequence of Psycho where there’s a split-second, extreme close-up of Gautham’s (Udhayanidhi Stalin) hands on Angulimala’s (Rajkumar Pitchumani) shoulders. I am not sure if there was a Buddist subtext, but that seemed to have conveyed the essence: the quality to forgive.

Yes. That was the idea behind that scene, for which I went through a personal struggle to write. I needed to communicate the movie in two lines and sat on it for two days. When Gautham places his hands on Anguli, he sort of provides warmth to a broken man.

Why didn’t he bring a gun instead of a taser? He could have easily killed him. Why doesn’t a man think of repercussions before committing a crime? Why doesn’t he think of himself? These are some of the questions I’ve been dealing with in my movies. There’s nothing else to say in cinema and life, apart from this. Compassion is the offshoot of guilt. If you take OA, the guilt doesn’t arise until it hits Wolf, who leads a robot life executing his boss’ orders. He sees a reflection of himself on the person he accidentally kills. It’s a ricochet bullet in his case. The point where guilt arises...it’s the most noblest place to be.

In that order, it’s safe to say that Psycho is the guilt of a psychopath. Probably for the first time in Indian cinema, we get to examine what a serial killer goes through internally, with such bone-chilling details.

Psycho is not a whodunit, but why done it (laughs). As you said, I wanted to delve deeper into the inner emotional state of a serial killer. I could’ve scratched the surface, showing what happens outwardly thereby giving him a cause. But you need to understand the significance of the first shot. It opens with the point of view of the killer, the protagonist as well as the audience. So, I made the audience travel with him. I could have taken a sublime route, but Psycho is direct in its approach. That’s why people are arguing and debating. Indirectly, I made audiences stand in his shoes by pulling off the biggest trick or lie.

Which was?

Giving the serial killer a character arc. Any movie is about the hero’s journey. Take Thevar Magan for instance. You could see Sakthi completing his arc when he becomes a Buddha, when he’s taken to prison in the end. Psychopaths don’t have a character arc, says John Douglas in his book Mindhunter. They cannot be changed or reformed. Their trauma is so bad that there’s no sympathy or empathy left in them. What if somebody walks into his life, pouring unconditional love and value that he becomes a changed man? I wanted to give an arc for a psychopath. I have taken a leaf out of the Angulimala fable. But in Psycho, Dagini (Aditi Rao Hydari) is the real Buddha and not Gautham. In fact, Dagini is a deity in Tibetian Buddhism.

You seem to find humanity even in someone who is oft-considered amoral or beast in society…

Yes. I’ll give you a simple example. Dagini lives with Anguli for seven days. You can see the latter’s transformation in that short time span. He brings food for her in their second meeting. The next time they meet, Anguli is amused that she’s cleaned the bloodstains in his slaughterhouse. Spills of blood turned into stain and Dagini is the first person to cleanse him of his impurity. Now who would do this, except a mother?

That’s fantastic. You opt for a low-angle shot of his ankles and we don’t get to see his face.

What more could I say by showing his facial expression? Look at the irony in that scene...Dagini is going to die in seven days, but she’s taking a deep slumber in the background. A few scenes later, he loosens her shackles. What made him do that? He goes through some changes inwards and wished he had someone like her.

There is so much depth in the scene where Ram dies, especially when he says, “Romba tired aayiduchu ma.”

It’s one of the most defining moments of Psycho. Watch it closely and observe when Anguli swings the knife on him. He [Ram] requests for an AM Raja song and starts singing ‘Thanimayile Inimai Kaana Mudiyuma’. When he goes to charanam, which has the line ‘Thunai Illamal’, that’s when Anguli decides to kill. But why exactly at that line? Because, ‘Thunai Illamal’ becomes a trigger point for him.

The most fascinating imagery of Psycho, also making a larger philosophical statement, is when Dagini smiles at Anguli when he’s about to perform his ‘art’. It’s probably the greatest commentary on resilience...

That’s one way of looking at it. But what I saw in Dagini was her unwavering calmness and silence. She’s attained enlightenment at this point. It’s as if she’s saying, “Don’t you understand my silence?” If you pay attention to her smile, you can see Buddha’s face.

This is what would have happened to Angulimala when he confronted Buddha. He would have been shocked. This is my interpretation of the fable. Aditi has done a fantabulous job in that scene. Had I cast someone else, I would have missed that smile. Dagini gives rhythm to his life and Anguli begins to receive it.

Do you think the audience would get these Buddist subtexts?

See, it’s not the artist’s job to convey what (s)he’s trying to convey. Appreciating art is also a learning process that requires constant effort. Cinema theatre is a place where you develop localised-intelligence. It’s a place where all your thoughts and bodily movements are contained to figure out what’s happening on screen. If the audience is aligned with the first 10 shots of the movie and if the filmmaker has properly aligned his shots, then there forms a localised-intelligence — the reason why I consider the theatre a place for spiritual awakening. On the other hand, why do they have to understand a movie in the first place? If they don’t get it, let them struggle.

But the reviews have been divided for Psycho and some people have been sticking to their guns...

Either they’re hating it or loving it. There’s no middle ground. This is the second time this has happened to me after Pisaasu. People who call it a “bad” movie are more pure-hearted in my opinion. For them, the movie somewhere has disrupted their social consciousness, making them feel uncomfortable. Or, they completely understood the movie (laughs). I’m puzzled by the response, but it also gives me a high.

Could it also be because you seem to question the fundamental moral grounds — in this case, making a psychopath a tad sympathetic?

That’s one of the factors. It also touches upon a sensitive topic (masturbation). What’s amusing for me is when they point out logical flaws, questioning the absence of CCTV cameras and stuff. All these are people’s projections.

The polarised response stems from the fact that we have been conditioned to tales where the hero vanquishes the villain, to restore light in the world. Ram has to kill Ravana, right?

Even in Ramayana, Ram says, “Indru poi naalai vaa.” Isn’t that one of the greatest lessons on forgiveness? Why should such a monster be forgiven is a question that I keep hearing from people. In fact, I presented the audience’s point of view in my movie itself. But they haven’t seen what Dagini saw in that hellhole. She becomes a witness to his soul gradually reducing. What remains at the end is a child in him. The violence, I believe, was a big shock for the audience.

When you treat your characters with such great kindness, aren’t you also normalising violence?

In all my movies, there’s a bigger violence you’ll find in the outward. But if you remove that, what’s there is unconditional love. Let me give you an example. Take the funeral scene of the sex worker who dies in Psycho. Everything was set and we were about to shoot. But the voice inside me said something was missing in that scene. I heard the voice of an old lady in my head that said, “How can we cry when there’s no head attached to the body?” Only then it dawned on me. And we made a dummy head out of a grindstone and it got a closure. That’s how I see my movies. When the movie ends, the violence gets subsided.

Are you talking about the futility of violence?

Futile is a small word. See, violence is part of the social structure of this world. For the lack of a better example; why should a woman endure excessive pain when she’s in the labour ward? Why can’t it be the most pleasurable feeling? That’s how I see violence. Peace is restored when it ends. Any society without violence might tend to function against the universe’s creation. What troubled people was the graphic violence in Psycho. But don’t you think we shun away from it?

I am a fan of extremist cinema and I like watching blood and gore on screen, because I am not a violent person...

See. That’s when you iron out your differences and find a balance. Aren’t Shakespeare’s tales violent?

The problem, I think, is that Psycho is set in the real world and is not a fantasy.

No, it’s a fantasy tale that has ordered reality. My movies are like fairy tales. They contain fairies, demons and creatures and operate within that structure. That’s why cinematic language is about surprise and suspense. That’s where Alfred Hitchcock and Edgar Allan Poe come into play.

Your movies, if I can say, are an actual representation of society. There’s always the presence of a sex worker, transgender or a differently-abled person…

I grew up with a lot of restrictions imposed on me. But when I started reading literature, the taboos I grew up with seemed fake. Had I listened to my mother, I wouldn’t have made Pisaasu. What I realised with my little understanding is...those who are oppressed are the ones to be celebrated. It’s a simple philosophy I practise.

Another recurring aspect of your movies is that one shot of a person collapsing to the ground — as if his world has been broken and destroyed. It happens in Anjathey; in Nandalala when the son meets his mother after 20 years, in Pisaasu when the father meets his daughter and so on. It also happens in Psycho.

Man’s heart is like a mirror. He’s broken and shattered in that scene. But what I am actually doing is taming humans. They think they’re Gods.

Do you consider yourself a God when you develop your scripts, when you play with the destiny of your characters?

No. That’s a very skewed perspective. I write 20% of my script in an unconscious state. Sometimes, I like to alter between trance and dance.

Do you believe in God?

I’m not able to define it. When I’m with a rationalist, I tend to copy their principles — which is the same case when I’m with a theist. There’s a deeper question that lingers in me: what’s life?

How do you close a water pot? Currently, I have closed it with a book while I’m looking for the proper lid (laughs).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3ytblj/article30691610.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mysskin4JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/theres-divinity-in-forgiveness-mysskin-on-psycho-and-why-its-a-fantasy-tale-that-has-ordered-reality/article30691612.ece
140,2020/01/30,Malayalam actor Unnimaya Prasad on her cool cop act in the thriller ‘Anjaam Pathiraa’,"There is nothing wishy-washy about Catherine Maria, the matter-of-fact screen cop who shines in Midhun Manuel Thomas’ Anjaam Pathiraa, the thriller that is making waves at the box office. For architect-actor Unnimaya Prasad, it was a role that she took on after taking Shyju Khalid’s advice to go ahead and do the part of a police officer on the heels of a cunning serial killer.

“It was casting brilliance as they decided to break away from the usual casting by giving me that role. Hats off to the team, to director Mithun and cinematographer Shyju. He encouraged me to go ahead and do it. And that gave me the conviction that I could pull it off,” says Unnimaya.

She adds that during the filming of Thondimuthalum Driksakshiyum, she was able to observe police officers, their mannerisms, discussions and body language in the course of her work as assistant director of the film.

“Moreover, most of the cast and crew are my friends, be it Mithun, Shyju, Kunchacko (Boban, who plays the lead) or Sreenath Bhasi. In fact, my first film as an actor was in Shyju’s film ‘Sethulakshmi’ in the anthology 5 Sundarikal. With this team, I was comfortable about asking them whether my take was fine or if I needed to improve my scene. That was helpful in breathing life into Catherine,” says Unnimaya, happy about the response she has evoked from viewers. Unlike the fire-breathing women cops in many Malayalam films or the glam girls who slip into figure-hugging khaki, Unnimaya’s police officer is your ordinary hardworking, no-nonsense cop who gets pulled up by her superiors and can take it without bursting into tears or throwing a tantrum. Catherine works with her team to nab a psychopathic serial killer and her act aced the role without any melodrama.

The casting director of Maheshinte Prathikaram, she says a casting director’s job is not to pick any good actor but to look for a character in a person and keep in mind that character’s description while casting. “It is to find out whose mannerisms match that of the character the most. The casting is for the character. There are no definite rules, and requirements keep changing with every character,” she explains.

Having worked on both sides of the camera, as actor, assistant director and casting director, certainly has helped her career arc in films. Her enthusiasm for cinema is evident in her voice as she explains how watching a film made and the discussions among the cast and crew that shape a film have moulded the actor in her. “You understand how a script is interpreted by master craftsmen in cinema and how a director interprets a character and a scene for an actor and how he/she interprets the character in accordance with the director’s vision and how he again defines it during the actual portrayal of that role during a shoot. For instance, an actor like Fahadh [Faasil] is amazing. He never ceases to surprise us,” she says.

As an example, she highlights a scene from Kumbalangi Nights, when Shammi, Fahadh’s character, eavesdrops on the sisters talking in the kitchen and joins them in the discussion. “The scene required Shammi to be near the kitchen door and ask the sisters if they were discussing him. So we had kind of worked out how Fahadh might portray the scene so that the cameraman could position the lights and camera. But Fahadh surprised all of us. He made it ever so creepy by peeping into the kitchen with a smirk and saying his lines. It was superb. He never sticks to a template. That is the kind of work you see while working behind the camera,” says Unnimaya.

An architect from the College of Engineering Trivandrum, Unnimaya says she was always drawn towards cinema and was waiting for a chance to work in films.

Agreeing that multi-tasking as an architect and actor/assistant director is not easy, she says she manages to do both by prioritising. “So, if I need to go for a site visit for my architectural work, I do that first. But one can’t take a break during shooting. There are at least 150 people on the sets. This certainly involves quality planning over time and can only be possible with the support of my architect colleagues, all better than me,” she explains.

The passionate cine buff she is, Unnimaya says reading a script, listening to a character description, a scene description and then trying to figure out how it will be portrayed is perhaps the best part of being an assistant director.

Although not committed to a new project, Unnimaya will be seen in Pada and Halal Love Story and she will also be working in Thangam, their own production.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7r1y3b/article30691187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvmUnnimaya,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/malayalam-actor-unnimaya-prasad-on-her-cool-cop-act-in-the-thriller-anjaam-pathiraa/article30691189.ece
141,2020/01/30,Malayalam actor Govind Padmasoorya thrilled over success of Telugu debut with 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo',"Govind Padmasoorya, or GP as he is popularly known, is on cloud nine. The reason is the success of his debut Telugu film, the Allu Arjun-starrer and blockbuster Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. GP cannot keep the excitement out of his voice as he speaks of enjoying the experience, of not only of working with Allu Arjun but also the love that he is getting from the superstar’s fans associations across the length and breadth of Kerala — Kannur, Alappuzha, Kozhikode, Thrissur and places in between. His time back home has been a whirl of events organised by these. “I am feeling pampered and I am savouring it!” he confesses.

Allu Arjun, during a function in Hyderabad, referred to GP as a friend and ‘brother’, “That has had an impact on the fans, they take to heart whatever Bunny (Arjun) says. And somehow his words have had an impact and have embraced me.” GP is all praise for the Telugu superstar and his humility, especially how he is with his fans. “I have heard him speak. What a vibe! Since I am a compère I can read an audience and what energy. I got goosebumps listening to him.” This film is one of his biggest films yet. His Tamil film Kee gave him an opportunity to explore roles that are different from his Malayalam films.

Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo follows Kee (2019), directed by Kalees, starring Jiiva. As Shivam, the anti-hero, GP impresses audiences and it brought him Allu... The last time Malayali audiences saw him was in the Pretham films.

“Kee took almost two years filming, during which I couldn’t change my look either. I sport a very thick beard in it and for continuity’s sake I couldn’t take it off nor could I sign on any project in the interim,” he explains his absence from the screen. The wait was long, and there were times when he questioned his decision. But he was so invested that he didn’t want to quit, “Kalees told me that he felt bad that I had to wait. And I am glad that I stuck on.” By the time the film released it was well worth the wait.

Ala.. director Trivikram Srinivas saw Kee and liked GP’s work in it. “Trivikram sir and Allu Arjun have done films together before this, which have done well. Plus the cast included actors such as Tabu, Samuthirakani, Sachin Khedekar, Jayaram, Pooja Hegde...”, GP counts the reasons for doing the film. Post-Kee a couple of offers for Tamil films came his way, he is glad he didn’t commit to them. “I am glad I waited, and not waste the opportunity it presented me.”

The magnitude of the film’s success exceeds his imagination, as also the humility of the artists in the Telugu film industry. “I was treated so well and the hospitality was amazing.” Although he did not dub for the original, he has dubbed for the Malayalam version of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. He holds the entire experience close to his heart. “I was very excited and all, but I wondered if I would get to see Bunny dance. We had combination scenes but not one where I could see him dance.” But the fates had other plans, GP gleefully says he got to see Arjun dance - the result of a last minute improvisation.

GP started his career in films, later moving to the small screen as anchor before returning to films.

His effusive screen presence has made him a much-loved television anchor/compère. When Kee came his way, he was asked if wanted to do a negative character given his popular image. The role is different from how the Malayali audience sees him, he essays it with sophistication.

Ala ... has opened the doors to Telugu film offers and he confesses he is tempted to take them up though Malayalam is dear to him. He wants to take his time and choose his way carefully and sensibly.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/xv3ahk/article30691070.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpgp2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/malayalam-actor-govind-padmasoorya-thrilled-over-success-of-telugu-debut-with-ala-vaikunthapurramuloo/article30691071.ece
142,2020/01/30,Mollywood composer Prashant Pillai on his bond with filmmaker and frequent collaborator Lijo Jose Pellissery,"“The Lijo Jose Pellissery after Angamaly Diaries (AD) is very different from the Lijo Jose Pellissery before the film’s release,” says music director Prashant Pillai, as he ruminates about his working relationship with Malayalam’s master of avant-grade cinema.

“Before AD, Lijo always used to stress about even simple issues and his creative output started getting affected. Post AD though, there is a radical boldness in his personality and lifestyle and a noticeable change in his approach to people and issues. He’s a hippie at heart and that's shining through now. His sensibilities have changed and he is now more open to taking creative liberties. It has transformed him and thus transformed all of us, his collaborators, as well, as he continues to define new paths for Malayalam cinema,” adds the Bengaluru-based composer, over the phone, while vacationing in Goa.

That’s what, he says, makes Lijo different from most other directors whom he has worked with. “While working on City of God, for example, Lijo was under huge pressure, partly, because of the star cast. It affected everything and consequently, it was a huge effort for me to compose even one song, let alone an entire album. After he got settled, he really let his creativity loose and now it’s as if the universe opened up for me. With him, there are no boundaries and I am able to immerse myself into the task without the need to please people,” he explains.

Lijo spotted Prashant’s work in their mutual friend Bejoy Nambiar’s short film, Rahu, and invited the youngster to début in Mollywood with him, with Nayakan (2010).

Since then, the composer has been a constant presence in all of Lijo’s films, namely City of God (2011), Amen (2013), Double Barrel (2015), Angamaly Diaries (2017), Ee. Ma. Yau. (2018) and Jallikattu (2019). With each of these films, the duo revolutionised the very soundscape of Malayalam cinema, plumbing its depths to deliver some very unconventional tracks: the haunting ‘Gee, gee, gee...’ sequence in Jallikattu, ‘Ee Solamanum Soshanannuyum...’ that soulful acapella number in Amen, the Wild West in a trance in Double Barrel, the earthy folk songs of Angamaly Diaries, to name a few.

Prashant credits Lijo with having clear-cut ideas, which in turn helps him make magic with sounds. “One of the best things about Lijo is that he is clear about the sound that he wants. It’s rare to get a filmmaker with a sound vision like that. The most amazing thing is that he can mimic exactly what sound or what musical instrument he wants. My job is to give spirit to those ideas,” explains Prashant.

Brewing concepts

Lijo is said to be one of the few filmmakers who lets collaborators in on the gist of a film well in advance, giving due importance to each department of cinema. For instance, Prashant and Co. heard about Double Barrel around the time City of God went on the floor. “I like brewing concepts in my mind. I lived with Double Barrel well over two years and by the time we started work on the film, it was familiar territory. Right now, Lijo has told me around 30/40 different concepts, all deeply engrossing stories, each of which has got my creativity in overdrive!” he says.

Their working relationship seems to be very much about osmosis, drawing from each other to create those stunning combinations of the visual and the musical. “Ultimately, he calls the shots — and that’s how it should be — but he is always open to ideas. Say, in a particular scene, he has the vision of a bird flying from one point to another. He allows you to build sound around that concept and is willing to alter it — say four birds flying together — depending on what you come up with, ” he says.

The composer readily admits that it’s not all smooth sailing. “We fight a lot. Verbal wars are a constant in our working relationship! Often, though, we end up sheepishly agreeing that we are fighting over nothing!” says the composer, with a laugh.

It’s a working relationship that’s also strengthened by the bonds of friendship. One of their favourite things to do, while scouting a location or during the shoot is to wake up at 4 am and go on a drive, stopping first to get a refreshing cup of frothy tea (that Lijo is particularly fond of), before barging into some hole-in-the-wall restaurant for breakfast. “It’s our thing; something that gives us both a thrill. We don’t necessarily always talk music; we mostly talk about life and ideas for upcoming projects. We both share the same sensibilities about life and creative expression. We are least bothered about what the world thinks about us or what the world does. Actually, Lijo and I are polar opposites when it comes to our taste in cinema. However, there is a single beautiful string that connects our idea of cinema that makes ideas flow. Our relationship is a personal space based one, which one cannot just call as friendship. It is brotherhood, one that is deeply spiritual,” says Prashant.

144,2020/01/30,Anoop Sathyan on the casting coup of Shobana and Suresh Gopi for his début ‘Varane Avashyamundu’,"Writer and director Anoop Sathyan’s soon-to-be-released Varane Avashyamundu has enough reasons to grab eyeballs. Not only are Shobana and Suresh Gopi pairing up again on screen, Kalyani Priyadarshan is making her début in Malayalam cinema in the film. Dulquer Salmaan, who stars in the movie, is the film’s producer.

Anoop, son of celebrated filmmaker Sathyan Anthikad, is a techie-turned-filmmaker. With his father all set to start a new project with Mammootty, and his twin Akhil working on a project with Fahadh Faasil for his début venture, Anoop knows all eyes are on his film. He, however, is not letting the pressure to live up to expectations get to him. As Anoop is busy giving the final touches to Varane Avashyamundu, he talks to Friday Review about his journey so far.

Excerpts from the interview:

You have achieved a casting coup for your directorial début...

I was looking for actors and not stars. I was actually working on another project written by Bobby and Sanjay, with Dulquer Salmaan in the lead, for my début. When that project got delayed, I planned this as a small movie. But even while working on it, I had Shobana, Suresh Gopi and Nazriya on my mind. I approached Shobana after taking an appointment, without seeking any recommendations or references. She liked the thread of the story and told me that she would consider it. It took some time to convince her to say yes. Suresh Gopi was ready, but was not sure if he would have the dates.

Suresh Gopi and Shobana | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

How did the thread of the story come to you?

I developed this script based on an idea I have had for a while now. I took some time to write it. This is a story involving four characters and their emotions.

Why did Nazriya opt out of the project?

When the project got delayed, she got busy with other commitments.

What is the storyline of Varane Avashyamundu?

The film merges the lives of a few characters living in an apartment complex in Chennai. Shobana is a single mom and Kalyani is her daughter. Suresh Gopi is an ex-military person and Dulquer, a street smart youth, who comes into their lives at a certain point.

Any particular reason for setting the story in Chennai?

While working in Wipro, I used to live in Chennai and I love the city. While selecting the crew, I was particular that they too share a love for Chennai. Although there are run-of-the-mill visuals of Chennai that we see in movies, we have set the film in a different backdrop.

Considering your father is a well-known filmmaker, was entering the film industry a natural progression?

Actually, as kids, we always stayed away from movies and shootings. I have heard my father say in old interviews how his children have no career plans in movies. We have visited his sets twice, during the shooting of My Dear Muthachan and Pingami. He was not keen when I told him I was joining visual communications after my graduation. The turning point was when I got admission to the National Institute of Design where I studied filmmaking. I made a few short films and a documentary titled A Dream Called America, which received appreciation. I later joined Lal Jose as an assistant and have worked with him in five movies.

How was Dulquer Salmaan as a producer?

Dulquer was excited when he heard the storyline and offered to be the producer. The original plan was to cast a newcomer for Dulquer’s role. When he came into the picture, we revised the script. He has a key role in the film. I haven’t portrayed him as a star but as an ordinary youngster.

What were your challenges as a new director?

The execution part was indeed a challenge. I was warned about the difficulties of shooting in Chennai and the possible issues while working with an experienced cast. We planned the shoot as if we were using film rolls and without spot editing. We divided the shots in such a way that we could go for minimum takes. The shooting was done in a relaxed atmosphere and was truly a wonderful experience.

Have you planned your next?

I have some plots in mind but I am not thinking about that right now. I might do a documentary next as I will have to handle each department on my own. It’s my way of unwinding. I feel that it also helps me in getting good content for fiction.

Did you discuss the script with your father for feedback?

I discussed the basic thread with him and then showed him the first half of the script. I had sent him some scenes we had edited. I was happy that he liked what he saw.

Which of your father’s movies have influenced you the most?

Obviously there are quite a few. Nadodikkaattu, however, tops the list as I know every dialogue and even the scene order of that movie. I have even shot my movie in some of the locations used in Nadodikkaattu. I am also a fan of Sandesham as I have realised the different layers in the movie. I really like his recent works like Oru Indian Pranayakatha, Vinodayathra, Bhagyadevatha and Njan Prakashan. I have great admiration for his commitment towards his work and his preparation each time he is working on a fresh project.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ejyyou/article30681374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvfDulqueer,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/anoop-sathyan-on-the-casting-coup-of-shobana-and-suresh-gopi-for-his-dbut-varane-avashyamundu/article30681376.ece
145,2020/01/30,Kalakshetra foundation revokes permission for T.M. Krishna's book release event,"Kalakshetra Foundation withdrew the permission it had given to hold the book release function for T.M. Krishna’s Sebastian & Sons: A Brief History of Mrdangam Makers on its premises.

In a statement to the publishers of the book, the Foundation’s Director Revathi Ramachandran said that the institution was an autonomous body under the Ministry of Culture, Government of India. “Being a government organisation, it cannot allow any program that may instigate political, cultural and social disharmony,” the statement read.

Her statement further said that “a book review” that had appeared on Wednesday contained certain statements related to the book that touched on controversial issues and had “a lot of political overtones”.

“We were unaware of the controversies surrounding the subject matter of the book at the time of renting our auditorium for the book release,” the statement added.

“An exceptional and unverifiable incident has been projected as some kind of universal rule. This is likely to create avoidable issues, including disaffection among communities,” Ms. Ramachandran’s statement further said.

‘A celebration’

Musician and writer T.M. Krishna said he was “saddened and baffled” by the Foundation’s act of revoking permission for the book release event. “The book is a celebration of generations of makers of mrdangams. They have worked with blood, skinned cows, goats and buffaloes so that we can all enjoy music. The book brings out the reality of how they have been marginalised for generations — how is this controversial?” he questioned.

Stating that he was “astounded by the fact that the programme was perceived to be one that could instigate disharmony”, Mr. Krishna pointed out that the mrdangam graces the stage of Kalakshetra every other day.

“How is it okay not to talk about the cow then? It is a complicated subject, but not a controversial one. I can understand if people have different points of views from the book or disagree, but I don’t understand why this is disharmonious,” he said.

Mr. Krishna said that the book release event would now take place at the Asian College of Journalism on February 2, at 6.45 p.m.

Chidambaram urges

Veteran Congress leader P Chidambaram said it was shameful that Kalakshetra should withdraw permission to hire their auditorium to release the new book by T. M. Krishna. “‘Withdraw permission’ is an euphemism for cancelling a contract. Cancellation is illegal besides being high handed,” he said.

“Even if Kalakshetra is frozen in time, the world will not stop. Glad to know that book launch will take place on same date, same time at a different venue. This is an opportunity to stand up against institutional capture [of Kalakshetra]. Urge book and music lovers to gather in large numbers at the Asian College of Journalism,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/os8j2b/article30693138.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KRISHNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/kalakshetra-foundation-revokes-permission-for-tm-krishnas-book-release-event/article30693139.ece

147,2020/01/30,State’s wait for resolution of Pennaiyar dispute continues,"CHENNAI Tamil Nadu may have to wait for six more months for the resolution of its dispute with Karnataka over Pennaiyar river, with the Central government constituting a negotiation committee to go into various issues concerning the dispute.

The dispute is essentially over the Karnataka government’s plans to construct structures on the river and its tributaries which, according to Tamil Nadu, will adversely hit the livelihoods of lakhs of farmers in Krishnagiri, Dharmapuri, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram and Cuddalore districts.

In mid-November last year, the Supreme Court dismissed the State’s suit for a permanent injunction on five of Karnataka’s projects — two to pump the river water for feeding about 160 tanks and for irrigation purposes; another pumping project to draw 284 million cubic feet (mcft) of water; the diversion of surplus water of the Varathur Tank to the Narsapur Tank in Kolar district; and the construction of a reservoir of 500 mcft across the Markandeyanadhi. The court asked Tamil Nadu to take up the matter of the formation of a tribunal with the Centre. On November 30, the State wrote to the Centre, seeking the formation of a tribunal under the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956.

As per a communication Tamil Nadu received a few days ago, the negotiation committee will have to report to the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti regarding the outcome of its deliberations within 6 months.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/states-wait-for-resolution-of-pennaiyar-dispute-continues/article30687674.ece

In a statement, he said a caste-wise census was the answer to the problem of a few communities taking most of the benefits of reservation while sidelining many other communities.

“In every category, reservation benefits are being captured by a section [of the population].

The Most Backward Class category was created because reservation benefits weren’t reaching everyone in the Backward Class category in an equal way,” Dr. Ramadoss said.

A few influential communities were usurping the reservation benefits, he said, adding, “Only a caste-based census will help resolve this issue. With the 69% reservation also under threat, a caste-based census is the only way to protect it.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ramadoss-demands-caste-wise-census-in-2021/article30687637.ece

“It seems love jihad (perceived attempts by Muslim men to convert women from non-Muslim communities to Islam by feigning love), which is widely prevalent in Kerala, is spreading to Tamil Nadu. The murder accused in Vijay Raghu’s case had made desperate efforts to secure the hand of his daughter. Hence, I have asked the police to investigate whether his murder was a fallout of love jihad,” Mr. Murugan told The Hindu after holding discussions with Collector S. Sivarasu and Tiruchi Police Commissioner V. Varadharaju on the progress of the investigation into the murder case.

Mr. Murugan added that the victim had actively taken part in efforts to dispel people’s ‘misconceptions’ about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

When a group of traders had called for the closure of shops in Gandhi Market as a mark of protest against the CAA, Raghu had successfully persuaded them to keep the shops open, he noted.

Earlier, Mr. Murugan told reporters after meeting the victim’s kin that the police had formed five special teams to nab the accused, and the case had been altered to invoke provisions of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The District Collector had been asked to pay compensation to the victim’s family in accordance with the Act, he said.

151,2020/01/30,TNPSC exam scam: Stalin out for Jayakumar’s scalp,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Wednesday demanded a CBI inquiry into the malpractice allegations surrounding the Group-IV Services examination conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).

In a statement, he demanded the dismissal of D. Jayakumar, the Minister for Personnel and Administrative Reforms, in order to ensure a free and fair probe.

“At a time when the faith of the youth in the TNPSC has been shattered, the Madras High Court has cancelled the interviews for the Motor Vehicle Inspector posts. This has thoroughly exposed the AIADMK government,” he said.

Mr. Stalin said the claim that a record clerk was responsible for the scam was actually a ploy to allow the bigwigs involved in the fraud to escape.

“If a record clerk can commit such a major scam though the answer sheets were sealed, what is the need for a chairman, members and secretary? People think an attempt is being made to protect the power centre,” he said.

He sought to know why Mr. Jayakumar, who remained silent for 25 days, suddenly convened a meeting. “Where was he all these days? Why has he suddenly become the super spokesperson?” he asked.

Stressing the need for restoring faith in the TNPSC, Mr. Stalin said the inquiry should be conducted under the guidance of a sitting judge of the Madras High Court. “Otherwise, the youth wing of the DMK will hold a demonstration,” he added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tnpsc-exam-scam-stalin-out-for-jayakumars-scalp/article30687590.ece

He recalled that the TNPSC had debarred 99 candidates from appearing for its exams for life. The TNPSC was an independent and autonomous body, and in the light of recent incidents, the government was naturally concerned, he said.

155,2020/01/30,Rajinikanth told Income Tax Department he was into ‘money lending’,"Tamil film star Rajinikanth, against whom the Income Tax Department on January 28 withdrew proceedings related to alleged concealment of income between the financial years 2002-2003 and 2004-2005, had claimed to be in the “money lending business”.

Tax assessment orders accessed by The Hindu point out that the actor had claimed to have issued loans to the tune of ₹2.63 crore, received interest of ₹1.45 lakh for it in the assessment year 2002-2003 and earned a net profit of ₹1.19 lakh that year. After disclosing these details, the actor had also paid tax for the profit he had earned.

Of the total quantum, he had offered a loan of ₹1.95 crore at an interest rate of 18% to K. Gopalakrishna Reddy; another ₹60 lakh to a financier named Arjunlal; ₹5 lakh to Sashi Booshan; and ₹3 lakh to Sonu Pratab. In the I-T returns filed for the year 2003-04, the actor had reportedly added a loan amount of another ₹10 lakh, given to Murali Prasad.

In that year, he had claimed to have received interest of ₹1.99 lakh and declared a net profit of ₹1.64 lakh. However, in 2004-05, he had claimed to have written off loans to the tune of ₹1.71 crore after declaring them as “bad debts”. Due to this, he filed negative returns, claiming to have suffered a loss of ₹33.93 lakh that year.

Suspecting that the actor had made the claim of being in the money lending business only to avail himself of the benefit of “bad debts” in the future, the I-T sleuths questioned him in February 2005. Mr. Rajinikanth had stated that he had not acted in any films from the financial year 2002-03 to 2004-05.

He had said that he earned revenue from his Raghavendra marriage hall and Arunachala Guest House at Kodambakkam in Chennai. Further, he had started a production house, ‘Lotus International’, for producing his 2002 movie Baba, which bombed at the box office.

To a question as to whether he had been engaging in the money lending business too, the actor had reportedly replied: “No. I might have given some loan and advances but this is not as a money lending business.” He also claimed that all those to whom he had lent money were his friends, and hand loans given to them would not amount to engaging in the money lending business. When confronted with the money having been lent to financier Arjunlal, he said: “This one transaction to a financier will not amount to money lending business.” On being questioned, the actor’s accountant T.S. Sivaramakrishnan had supposedly said: “As per books of accounts, he has given loan to six persons. I do not know whether it is money lending business.”

On the basis of these material and after finding that the actor had not obtained a licence for conducting a money lending business, the Assessing Officers came to a prima facie conclusion that he had only offered hand loans to friends. But Mr. Rajinikanth later wrote to the department, claiming that he was indeed involved in money lending activity. “It was originally construed by me under a misconception that a money lending business should mean only pawn broking...On this understanding, I could not clarify in the manner required at the time of recording of my statement. Later, I was made to realise that what I have been doing... is nothing but money lending activity only,” he said.

“I am carrying on this business of finance as any ordinary financier would, to start with, using my own funds which had arisen out of my tax paid incomes. Lending money and the rate of interest varied from person to person based on their association/past track record. I had lent money only by way of cheque and not otherwise,” he submitted.

When things stood thus, he filed a revised return of income on February 14, 2005 and withdrew his previous claim of bad debts written off for a sum of ₹1.71 crore. Claiming that he was still making efforts to recover the loan amount, he insisted on reversing the premature claim of bad debts and declared that his income for 2004-05 was actually ₹1.46 crore. However, the Assessing Officers for all three financial years came to the conclusion that he was not in the money lending business and therefore, the income through his loans could not be assessed under the head of ‘business income’. They concluded that interest from hand loans could be assessed only as ‘income through other sources’.

The actor then took the matter on appeal up to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and obtained an order in December 2009 that his income from money lending activity should be assessed as ‘business income.’ In the meantime, he also got the claim of bad debts allowed by the same appellate tribunal for the assessment year 2006-07.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/crz8f1/article30687489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30INDIA-ENTERTAINMENT-CINEMA-BOLLYWOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/rajinikanth-told-income-tax-department-he-was-into-money-lending/article30687490.ece
156,2020/01/30,School bus operators seek relief from FASTag payments,"A section of school bus operators have sought relief from paying FASTag charges, as the number of trips they make in a day exceeds the 50-trip limit. The operators say their destinations are near the toll plazas.

FASTag cards, that will ensure hassle-free travel for vehicles on the highways, maintained by the National Highways Authority of India, are causing problems, claim operators.

“We have been facing difficulties for the past several years, regarding payment of the toll fee, at the Chennasamudram toll plaza, en route Vellore. Of a total stretch of 46 km under the maintenance of the toll plaza, our school buses use less than a kilometre. Notwithstanding this, we pay toll charges, as paid by other local vehicles, besides capping the number of trips to 50 a month,” said a bus operator from Walajah.

“Though several petitions have been sent to local authorities, the NHAI and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, seeking concessional toll fee, the pleas have not evoked a favourable response. For the past several years, we have been paying toll for all buses that we run for our students,” he said.

“After the introduction of FASTag cards, we will be paying nearly ₹2 lakh, every month, for our buses to pass through the toll,” he said, adding that educational institutions run on a “not-for-profit basis”, and cannot be equated with a commercial carrier for levying toll fee.

Other bus operators have also been feeling the pinch. They say that any increase in bus fee will strike a blow to the parents, besides forcing them to look for cheaper and unsafe means of transportation for their children.

There are many schools throughout Tamil Nadu who will be hurt by this “one size fits all” approach of collecting toll, he said. Rural schools will mostly be affected by the FASTag tariffs, and this has to be brought to the notice of the government, the bus operators added.

The toll plaza manager at Chennasamudram said toll charges were fixed by the NHAI. School buses were earlier allowed free trips over and above the fixed number of 50, after intervention of the District Collector and the Regional Transport Officer, he added.

Concessional fee

Moreover, buses from the local side (within 20 km from the toll plazas) are allowed to pay ₹75 for a single trip, as against ₹150/225 a single/two-way trip. Likewise, local cars, with registration numbers TN23/TN73 (Vellore/Ranipet), are allowed to ply at a concessional fee of ₹20 a trip, he said.

159,2020/01/30,World Leprosy Day: schoolchildren take out rally,"As part of the Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaign, school and college students on Wednesday took out a rally near the Anna statue in Arcot, to raise awareness about medical facilities available to eliminate leprosy from the society.

The students carried placards highlighting the need to maintain clean surroundings and hygienic conditions to prevent leprosy.

District Collector S. Divyadharshini administered a pledge to the participants and flagged off the rally.

A number of programmes were held under the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), where doctors who have done exemplary work as part of the mission were honoured by Ms. Divyadharshini.

Schoolchildren also shared their views on “Leprosy Eradication: Mahatma Gandhi’s Dream” through their essays.

Leprosy elimination

The National Leprosy Control Programme was launched by the Government of India in 1955.

After the introduction of the Multi Drug Therapy in 1982, the programme was converted into the National Leprosy Eradication Programme (NLEP), in 1983, with the objective eradicating the disease from the country.

Twenty-nine States/ U.T.s have attained the level of leprosy elimination, i.e., a prevalence rate of less than one case of leprosy per 10,000 population, and 572 districts (81.13%) of a total of 705 have also achieved the elimination level.

The Sparsh Leprosy Awareness Campaign, 2018, was started as an annual activity, during the fortnight from January 30 to February 13, to raise awareness about leprosy.

Deputy director (health services), Vellore, K.S.T. Suresh; deputy director (family welfare) K. Nedumaran; deputy director (health services-T.B.) P. Prakash Ayyappan; Arcot Municipal Commissioner S.

160,2020/01/30,Two more admitted in city hospitals,"Two people who returned to Hyderabad from China with mild cold and cough were admitted at the Isolation Ward of Fever Hospital and Gandhi Hospital on Thursday. Samples collected from them were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, to test for coronavirus.

Telangana health officials said they are yet to receive test results of samples collected from five people admitted at Fever Hospital till Wednesday. All of them were discharged as their condition was stable.

A 39-year-old man who arrived in Hyderabad from China with cold was admitted to Gandhi Hospital on Thursday morning. The one who was admitted at Fever Hospital is a 29-year-old software engineer who returned from Shanghai on Wednesday night. As he suffered from sore throat, he got admitted at the Fever Hospital’s Isolation Ward on Thursday afternoon.

Another person from Karimnagar who returned from China who developed some health issues contacted the health officials.

The first positive case of coronavirus in India detected in Kerala has further alerted Telangana health officials. If samples collected from any person admitted in Telangana government hospitals were to test positive for nCoV, symptomatic treatment will be provided to them as there is no specific treatment for nCoV yet, said senior officials from the State Health department.

World Health Organisation too in its situation report-8 on nCoV stated that currently there is no known effective antiviral therapy for 2019-nCoV. They are working with its networks of researchers and other experts to coordinate global work on clinical care and treatment, epidemiology, and other aspects.

“This (nCoV) is like any other flu. Its symptoms are the same as Swine flu. Symptomatic treatment will be provided to treat cold, cough and throat pain. It will be a huge challenge if someone develops high temperature and distress in lungs as these could lead to pneumonia. If anyone develops pneumonia, all care will be provided including ventilator support and pulmonologists to attend them” said Dr G Srinivas Rao, Director of Public Health (Telangana).

He said that compared to Ebola, or other highly infectious diseases, mortality rate among those suffering from coronavirus is low.

In any case, if anyone tests positive for nCoV, people in contact with them, such as family members, will be isolated too and their samples too will be sent for tests.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/two-more-admitted-in-city-hospitals/article30695251.ece
161,2020/01/30,Rejig of PACS put on hold for now,"The State government has decided against taking up reorganisation of Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS), as planned earlier in tune with the increased number of mandals in districts other than Hyderabad — from 443 to 573 — and conduct the elections only for the existing societies.

One of the main reasons attributed for the delay in conduct of elections to PACS committees whose elected term was over in January-February 2018 has been the government’s plan to reorganise the societies in tune with the increased number of mandals to serve the farmers better. “That’s the reason why the special committees led by persons in-charge (PIC) were put in place to administer the societies for the last two years by extending their term every six months,” a senior official told The Hindu.

There are a total of 906 PACS and 40 Farmers’ Service Cooperative Societies (FSCS) with over 20 lakh farmers as their members. Erstwhile Nizamabad district has the highest PACS of 144, followed by Karimnagar (125), Medak (111), Nalgonda (110), Warangal (98), Khammam (97), Adilabad (77), Mahabubnagar (76) and Rangareddy (68).

Elections to the societies were last held in January-February 2013. Since the Chief Minister has directed completion of the cooperative elections at the earliest, it has been decided to shelve the reorganisation idea, which the sources said is a complicated and cumbersome exercise, for now due to paucity of time.

“It was planned to reorganise the societies to serve the farmers better in line with the government plans to form crop colonies to structure their produce as also its organised disposal,” the official said adding that the societies play a crucial role in supply of fertilizers and subsidised seed to farmers and procurement of some crops such as paddy from farmers. Since there is no reorganisation this time, the cooperative elections would be held as per the old districts, prior to their reorganisation.

Notification

Meanwhile, Additional Registrar of Cooperative Societies V. Sumitra, who is State Cooperative Election Authority, has issued orders on Thursday to complete the constitution of managing committees of PACS and FSCS by February 15. Accordingly, the notification was issued by the State Authority and the PACS/FSCS-wise election notice by the election officers would be issued on February 2.

Nominations would be accepted for three days from February 6, scrutiny would be done on February 9 and withdrawal of nominations would be allowed till February 10. Polling would be held on February 15 from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. and counting of votes would be taken up immediately after polling. Results would be announced on the same day and election of office-bearers would be completed in the next three days.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rejig-of-pacs-put-on-hold-for-now/article30694895.ece

163,2020/01/30,Ways to beat stress,"The Indian Institute of Technology, Hyderabad (IIT-H), has been focusing on ways to reduce the stress on students. The institute has initiated several measures for this, including direct interaction with students by the director as well as the faculty.

Three students committing suicide on the IIT-H campus in the last one year has tarnished the image of the institute. This has put a lot of pressure on the management, which has decided to introspect and take up corrective measures. Recently, the faculty was asked to keep an eye on two first year students and interact with them frequently. Not only that, they would counsel students, particularly those scoring less marks.

Motivational speaker B.V. Pattabhiram recently held a counselling session for students. An additional counsellor has been hired for the purpose. IIT-H has also decided to introduce a course on yoga.

“We are interacting with students over a cup of tea. We are asking them to not compare themselves with others. We are also seeing to it that they involve in activities like dance, music and yoga,” said Prof. B.S.

164,2020/01/30,KTR appointed chairman of TS Fiber Grid Corporation,"A meeting of the board of directors of Telangana Fiber Grid Corporation on Wednesday resolved to appoint Information and Technology Minister K.T. Rama Rao as the chairman of the board of the corporation which was incorporated to execute T-Fiber project to provide affordable and high speed broadband connectivity in over 10,000 villages of the State.

Mr. Rama Rao, Principal Secretary of IT Jayesh Ranjan, Director (Electronics) of IT, Electronics and Communications Department Sujai Subhash Karampuri and Finance Secretary Sandeep Kumar Sulthania who were all directors of the corporation attended the board meeting.

Mr. Jayesh Ranjan told The Hindu that the project was aimed to be completed in the next 12 months with an investment of ₹ 1,200 crore. L & T Infotech, Sterlite Technologies Limited and ECIL were selected as system integrators and all three will have the same role of laying cables.

T-Fiber piggybacks on drinking water project — Mission Bhagiratha — to save digging and trenching. About 64,000 kms of trenches that will be dug for Mission Bhagiratha will also be used for T-Fiber. The fiber optic and water pipelines will run side by side in the same trenches. The large black pipe was for water and blue pipes for fibre optic cable.

The project was a multi-year deal for L & T Infotech, Sterlite and ECIL to design, build and manage the rural broadband network. It was partly funded by Central government’s Bharatnet programme and envisaged to strengthen government-to-government and government-to-citizen services with triple play services of voice, video and data to the citizens. The uniqueness of the project was that it will connect every household, about 83.58 lakh of them, across the rural part of the State.

The project was implemented on a pilot basis in Maheswaram mandal of Rangareddy district shortly after incorporation of the corporation in 2017.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ktr-appointed-chairman-of-ts-fiber-grid-corporation/article30694772.ece
165,2020/01/30,"BJP seeks action against Keshava Rao, Tukkuguda EO","The Bharatiya Janata Party has sought the intervention of Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan to order a high-level inquiry into the recently held urban local body (ULB) polls, to suspend Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament K. Keshava Rao and also take criminal action against election officer of Tukkuguda Municipality Rajeshwar Reddy.

A delegation of top BJP leaders led by party president K. Laxman met the Governor on Thursday at the Raj Bhavan and apprised her about the ‘blatant misuse of power’ right from the stage of issuing notification to the last phase of the election of the chairman, vice-chairman, mayor and deputy mayor posts.

“The scale and magnitude of misuse is unprecedented in history and TRS in its anxiety to grab as many municipalities as possible, irrespective of whether they have numbers or not, subverted all the procedures even while the State Election Commission (SEC) has remained a mute spectator to the entire process,” the party explained.

The Tukkuguda (Rangareddy district) episode is a good example of how low the ruling party has stooped to grab power, charged Mr. Laxman. The BJP won nine seats, TRS five seats and one independent won out of total 15 seats.

Mr. Keshava Rao, was elected to Rajya Sabha before formation of Telangana, and later he was declared elected from Andhra Pradesh in the draw of lots held on 30th May, 2014.

Objections ignored

Yet, Mr. Rao “illegally claimed” to be ex-officio member under Telangana Municipalities Act, 2019 and chose Tukkuguda Municipality to cast his vote on January 27. EO Rajeshwar Reddy did not heed to objections raised by the BJP, the police refused to take any action against the duo despite a complaint lodged and a representation made to the SEC to countermand the election to post of chairperson and vice-chairperson was ignored.

“This is a clear case of subversion of the Constitution,” the BJP leaders informed the Governor and said this episode illustrated the manner in which the local body polls were conducted in the State. They claimed that as per the Municipality Act, an ex-officio member for any municipality has to be identified within 30 days from the date of conduct of elections and this cannot be revoked.

Giving another example, the party said Education Minister and Maheshwaram MLA Sabitha Indra Reddy chose Badangpet Municipal Corporation as ex-officio member but later she shifted to Tukkuguda and the “illegal act was supported” by the municipal authorities concerned, the party added. Senior leaders N. Indrasena Reddy, N. Ramchander Rao, S. Malla Reddy and others were part of the delegation.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/cxoowk/article30694723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy30BJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-seeks-action-against-keshava-rao-tukkuguda-eo/article30694724.ece

169,2020/01/30,Third death sentence awarded by Sessions Court,"The proceedings of the Yellapatar gang rape and murder case which ended on Thursday in death penalty for the three accused awarded by the designated Special Court for its speedy trial becomes the third instance when the Sessions Court in Adilabad awarded capital punishment. The latest verdict has brought back memories of two earlier cases, though their nature was entirely different.

The first case was one of murder and was tried in 1973-74 as recalled by the legal fraternity. That trial and judgement of 45 year back had come in much different circumstances so far as logistics was concerned.

The case in question refers to the death sentence awarded by the then Sessions Judge to Bhoomaiah and Kishta Goud, two of the three accused in the case of murder of a moneylender in a village in what is now Tiryani mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district. The two, accused number 2 and 3 Bhoomaiah and Kishta Goud, were said to be naxalites of the then Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) People’s War Group.

“The trial was conducted in Asifabad court by the then District Judge Y. Vasudeva Rao as the offence happened under the jurisdiction of Asifabad taluk (now in KB Asifabad district),” recalled senior advocate in Adilabad Bar Association, Shashikant Rao Deshpande. “In those days, the Sessions Court in Adilabad used to function from Asifabad court for 15 days in a month,” he explained as he walked down the memory lane even recalling his own function as State brief for the accused number 1 in the case who was arrested after the death sentence of the other two was carried out.

Mr. Deshpande remembered freedom fighter and Asifabad advocate D. Gopal Kishan Rao being State Brief for Bhoomaiah and Kishta Goud. “They were awarded death sentence which was upheld by the then Andhra Pradesh High Court and Supreme Court and were finally executed in Chanchalguda prison in December 1975,” he added.

The second death sentence had come in the year 1981, also in a murder case but, the sentence was not confirmed by the High Court. The current death penalty has come about four decades later.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/doyj4k/article30694296.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31ADB-ADVOCATE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/third-death-sentence-awarded-by-sessions-court/article30694297.ece

The issue would be taken up at the earliest so that the enhanced reservation would become effective from the next academic year itself.

The meeting discussed about the problems faced by Podu farmers and the Minister had assured that the Chief Minister himself had given a clear assurance that they would be resolved soon. The Council had also decided to appoint liaison officers to solve the problems that were cropping up with the Forest Department whenever roads were being laid to tribal hamlets.

In addition, it was decided to represent to the government to provide three phase power supply in the tribal hamlets which was likely to cost ₹260 crore. The Council hoped that the issue would be resolved during the ensuing budget session of the legislature and it was also decided to take to the notice of the government pendency of bills pertaining to Tribal Welfare Department as also the delay in release of subsidy amounts announced for budding tribal entrepreneurs.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tribal-advisory-council-seeks-cms-support-in-enhancing-st-reservation-to-98/article30694247.ece

Outside the court hall, people who were connected with the case directly or indirectly or those who had gathered just out of curiosity displayed rising anxiety as the moment of reckoning drew closer. The family of the victim and relatives who had come from their native Gosampalle village in Khanapur mandal of Nirmal district openly expressed their desire that the accused get capital punishment.

176,2020/01/30,Chinese coronavirus impacts Karimnagar granite industry,"The dreaded coronavirus outbreak in China has cast its impact in farwaway Karimnagar, and how. Granite industry in the erstwhile Karimnagar district is witnessing a decline in exports of the local stone, especially to China.

Due to the virus outbreak which is spreading rapidly in China and other countries, Chinese buyers have stopped visiting Karimnagar district to purchase the locally available and popular Tan brown and Maple Red varieties. For the last fortnight or so, no buyer from China has visited the district. The district has around 70 granite quarries and another 200 odd polishing units.

Hotel industry also hit

Further, some Chinese buyers who visited during the first week of this month have already left following instructions from their country due to the coronavirus outbreak fearing any consequences in the country in spreading the disease. Now, there is not a single China buyer in the district, and the local hotel industry too has taken a hit.

R. Tirupathi Goud, former Karimnagar District Granite Quarry Owners’ Association president, said the outbreak of corona had forced stoppage of China buyers to visit the country and Karimnagar district. “Every month around 20 to 30 Chinese buyers used to visit the district and purchase granite by marking the raw blocks. On an average about 30,000 cubic metres of granite per month was exported to China. That has completely come down in last few days and the industry is set to lose at least ₹ 50 crore to ₹ 100 crore per month with no exports and stocks remaining in the quarries,” he said.

Chinese “Stone Fair” postponed

Expressing concern over the outbreak of the epidemic in China, Sri Venkatesh Granites (SVG) director Arjun Karwa said all the Chinese buyers have left the country and now there is no single buyer for the granite from the district, and huge stocks have piled up. To exacerbate, the proposed “Stone Fair” in Shamian in China from March 16 to 19 too is postponed to June 6 to 9 following the coronavirus,” he said.

The local granite industry, which is already struggling with fall in exports, would again plunge into a crisis with the outbreak of disease in China, Mr. Karwa feared. “Owners would be forced to reduce the staff and resort to cost-cutting till exports to China pick up. The coronavirus outbreak in China would not only affect the granite industry, but other sectors such as hospitality in the district,” he stated.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/chinese-coronovirus-hits-karimnagar-granite-industry-hard/article30692982.ece
177,2020/01/30,Yellapatar rape and murder case: Telangana special court sentence all three accused to death,"The three accused in the November 2019 Yellapatar gangrape and murder of a Dalit woman were awarded the death penalty on Thursday by the designated Special Court for speedy trial. Adilabad District Judge M.G. Priyadarshini, also the in- charge Judge of the Special Court, termed the crime the ‘rarest of rare’ kind before delivering the verdict.

The sentence to hang until death, needs to be confirmed by the Telangana State High Court. The Judge provided a 30-day period to the accused to appeal before the High Court.

“The accused, Shaik Babu, Shaik Shabuddin and Shaik Maqdoom, of Yellapatar village were found guilty of all charges,” said Additional Public Prosecutor M. Ramana Reddy.

“They were awarded capital punishment under section 302 IPC read with section 34 of IPC and section 3(2) (v) of the SC, ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989 and fined ₹5,000 each, given life imprisonment under section 376 D and fined ₹2,000 each besides three-year imprisonment and imposing a fine of ₹1,000 on accused 2 and 3 under section 404,” he said.

It took only about 45 days from the date of filing of charges for the Special Court to deliver the judgment in what had become a sensational issue in the State. There was a strong demand, especially from the SC organisations for justice to the poor family of the victim which hailed from Gosampalle village in Khanapur mandal of Nirmal district but were temporarily staying in Jainoor mandal, headquarter of KB Asifabad district.

The 30-year-old poor Scheduled Caste woman belonging to the backward Beda Budaga Jangalu caste, who earned her livelihood by bartering utensils for discarded human hair and selling balloons, was gangraped and brutally murdered by the trio on November 24 last year between Ramnaik tanda and Yellapatar habitations in Lingapur mandal under Lingapur police station limits of KB Asifabad district.

“The police arrested the three accused on November 27 as investigations revealed their role in the heinous crime and they were remanded in custody immediately,” KB Asifabad Superintendent of Police M. Malla Reddy said at a press conference after the verdict was delivered.

The case attracted considerable attention in the wake of a similar incident, the Disha case, which took place in Hyderabad a few days later. A Special Court for speedy trial was designated on December 11 and the police filed an almost 100-page charge sheet on December 24.

The trial began on December 27 as the prosecution examined witnesses. The court appointed advocate A.A. Rahim as State Brief for the accused.

The prosecution had cited 44 witnesses and produced circumstantial evidence based on DNA reports and reports on blood and semen of the accused. The Judge found the accused guilty of the offence and awarded the death sentence.

It may be mentioned here that the State government has borne the responsibility of education of the two sons of Teku Gopi, the husband of the victim.

Tourists visiting Medaram also go to Laknavaram lake, as a result, there is going to be huge traffic congestion on the road from Chalvai to Laknavaram.

As there is no other way to reach the lake, people need to take this same route. This leads to traffic snarls and inconvenience to devotees. At the same time, the road leading to the lake is under repair with several culverts under construction. So, officials have decided to close the tourist destination till the jatara got over.

Laknavarm lake is one of the most sought after tourist destinations in the district. The lake is a sprawling water body spread over an area of 10,000 acres. The two hanging bridges connecting the floating islands are an attraction. The Kakatiya rulers, who recognised this saucer-shaped land, built a sluice gate to hold rain water in the 13th century.

He delivered the guest lecture on “Creativity and Innovation in Engineering” at Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) on Wednesday.

“Engineering as a problem solving process connects those new needs and new technologies together. Because creativity is concerned with the generation of effective, novel solutions, creativity and engineering are in essence, two sides of the same coin. In fact, engineering can be characterized as a special case of the more general process of generating effective, novel solutions to problems, ie. creativity,” he said.

Dr. Reddy advised budding engineers to think out of the box and approach problems in new and innovative ways.

IG Kanpur. Mohit Agarwal said the suspect was shot dead in the encounter. ""We have found a large cache of guns and gunpowder from him. He was constantly firing at police,"" Mr. Agarwal said.

185,2020/01/30,Kanhaiya Kumar begins protest march from West Champaran to Patna,"CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar on Thursday kicked off his month long “Hamara desh, hamara samvidhan, Bapu dham se Gandhi maidan (Our country, our constitution, from Bapu’s spot to Gandhi Maidan)”, protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) from Gandhi’s Bhitiharwa Ashram in West Champaran.

The group of marchers led by the former Jawaharlal Nehru University Student’s Union president, his supporters and local party workers was, however, stopped for some time by authorities who prevented Mr. Kumar from addressing a meeting outside the ashram after the district administration rescinded the permission given to him due to the ongoing Saraswati Puja.

“He (Kanhaiya Kumar) was neither detained nor arrested,” West Champaran District Magistrate Nilesh Ramchandra Deore said by telephone. “Since his meeting was cancelled by the district administration last night to maintain law and order situation there on occasion of Saraswati Puja, he was stopped from addressing the meeting for sometime,” he added.

However, Mr. Kumar was later allowed to address the meeting and to begin his protest march.

Earlier, in a post on social media the CPI leader had said he was being detained by the West Champaran police and was not allowed to address the meeting and begin his protest march. Speaking to local journalists he reportedly said, “the administration wants all Indians to show documentary proof of being citizens but the police is not showing papers for the detention order”. “They (the BJP government at the Centre) have used official machinery as a part of a deep rooted conspiracy to gag the voice of the common people and derail my scheduled programme, which is aimed at spreading awareness about CAA, NRC and NPR to the common people,” he contended.

The protest march, which commenced on Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, is scheduled to culminate with a public meeting at Patna’s Gandhi Maintain on February 29.

186,2020/01/30,"Vidya Bal, veteran social activist and feminist writer no more","Stalwart social activist, feminist writer and journalist Vidya Bal, who was a tireless crusader for gender equality, passed away at a private nursing home in Pune on Thursday. She was 83.

According to sources, she was unwell for the past month and had been undergoing treatment.

Active in the social field for more than half a century, Bal was a towering personality in Maharashtra’s progressive milieu, articulating her ‘socialist feminism’ through her trenchant journalism in magazines such as Stree (‘Woman’) and Miloon Saryajani (‘All of us together’), which she founded in 1989.

Born into a traditional middle-class family and married at the age of 18, Bal’s socialist orientation began when she joined the editorial staff of Stree in 1964 after a stint at the Pune division of Akashwani in the late 1950s.

At Stree, Bal came into her own with her powerful and sensitive elucidation of the myriad problems and issues facing women, especially in the State’s rural hinterland.

Unlike some thinkers, she did not just satisfy herself with expressing her thoughts and penning articles - she launched social platforms such as the Naari Samata Manch, started awareness campaigns and personally toured villages with a single-minded determination to awaken society to women’s issues and the prejudices faced by them.

With a view to pushing her investigation into problems afflicting women and attracting a wider readership, Bal launched her own monthly, Miloon Saryajani, which not only gave space for women’s issues but documented travails that men too face.

Noted writer-activist Kiran Moghe said, “Her passing away is a personal loss for me. We all lived in the shadow of Ms. Bal’s guidance and her campaign to strive for equal rights for both men and women will never be forgotten”.

Against the backdrop of the recent temple entry agitation, Bal, along with lawyer Neelima Vartak, filed a PIL plea in the Bombay High Court in 2016, demanding the enforcement of a law permitting temple entry and worship for all in Hindu religious places.

“Her passing will undoubtedly leave a huge void in the struggle for women’s rights in Maharashtra and the country. Her labour of love, Miloon Saryajani, will forever remain a powerful voice for women to express their thoughts,” said Avinash Patil of the Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti (MANS), with whom Bal had a fruitful association.

From agitating for better sanitation facilities for women to championing euthanasia, Bal’s erudition, seemingly inexhaustible energy and dignity touched and endeared all those who came in contact with her.

Nandini Jadhav, who heads the Pune branch of the MANS, said: “I met Vidya tai at her Prabhat Road residence just before she was admitted to the hospital…even though she was ailing, she was full of ideas and we spoke for nearly four hours, reflecting on women’s issues and the way ahead. She was the last of a dying breed of social crusaders…I think the best way to preserve her memory is by carrying her work forward. We have that huge responsibility now”.

Nationalist Congress Party leader Vidya Chavan described Bal’s death was “truly a sad moment”. Bal was active till her last breath, Ms. Chavan said.

Bal’s mortal remains were kept at her Prabhat Road residence for admirers to pay their final respects. The cremation will be be at the Vaikuntha crematorium.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/veteran-social-activist-and-feminist-writer-vidya-bal-passes-away/article30691306.ece
187,2020/01/30,Anti-CAA protests: Court finds loopholes in Nagina case,"Finding glaring loopholes in the police investigation, a Bijnor court has granted bail to 48 persons accused of indulging in rioting, arson and attempt to murder on December 20, when the protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) turned violent in the Nagina town of the district. One person was killed and five were injured in the incident.

In Nagina, the police had arrested 83 persons. The First Information Report (FIR) accused them of firing at the police, breaking government vehicles and vandalising private vehicles and shops.

‘No evidence’

While listening to the bail plea of 48 of them on Tuesday, the District Sessions Court judge Sanjeev Pandey observed that the government lawyer had not submitted any proof that people in the crowd had fired at the police. “No evidence has been presented in the court that showed the recovery of weapons. Recovery of two shells of 315 bore from the site has been recorded but nothing in the investigation shows who fired them,” the order said.

Similarly, the judge pointed out, no proof had been submitted that showed that the mob indulged in arson and destroyed private vehicles. “The police have reported damage to one government vehicle but the technical inspection was done on January 12, 20 days after the said incident,” he said.

Mr. Pandey also said that the FIR had stated 13 policemen had been injured but none of them had been found to have gunshot injuries. “They have ordinary bruises, only one has a cut mark,” the order said.

No criminal record

Considering the accused, who had been in judicial custody since December 20, had no previous criminal record, the judge found suitable ground to grant bail to 48 persons.

Meanwhile, Rampur Police have dropped the serious charges, including murder, attempt to murder and dacoity, against 26 of the 34 people arrested in connection with the December 21 violence in the city.

Of the remaining eight, District Magistrate-Rampur Aujaneya K. Singh said six had been arrested later on the basis of collected evidence and recovery made from the other two.

‘Not vindictive’

Mr. Singh said the administration did not want to go with a “weak case” to the court. “We are working in a transparent manner and are not vindictive,” he said. “These people were arrested from the site of violence but no evidence has been found against them that warrants Sections 302 and 307 [to be invoked] against them. Hence, the Investigating Officer dropped these charges. However, they will continue to face other charges such as rioting, voluntarily causing hurt and obstructing a public servant from discharging his duty.”

Lawyer Shaila Khan described the order as a “positive” development. “Now, we will approach the court for their bail,” she said. She lamented that many of accused were sole breadwinners for their families. She alleged that the administration was trying to ensure no one came out for peaceful protests again by foisting serious charges on them.

‘Legal process’

Mr. Singh argued that one had to go through a legal process even if the Investigating Officer found within a week that some of the arrested persons were not involved in any heinous activity. “It applies to everybody. At no point have we denied permission for peaceful protests. All through, I have been in touch with the families of the arrested people and have informed them of the developments in the investigation, but we have to also understand that one person died in violence on December 21,” he said.

188,2020/01/30,"Round two: 1,615 of NDFB’s 3 factions give up arms","The process of disbanding the 34-year-old National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) began on Thursday, with 1,615 members of its three factions laying down arms at an official programme in Guwahati.

Officials said another 2,850 cadre of the three groups are expected to lay down arms on February 7 in western Assam’s Kokrajhar, the headquarters of Bodoland Territorial Region (BTR) where the State government has invited Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Most of the cadres are distributed among three designated camps.

Of the 1,615 who laid down arms, 836 belonged to the NDFB (Progressive), led by Dhiren Boro and Gobinda Basumatary; 579 to the NDFB (RD), led by its founder-chairman, Ranjan Daimary; and 200 to the NDFB (S), led by B. Saoraigwra. Together, they deposited 178 firearms, 14 grenades and a two-inch mortar.

“The surrender today has great significance. It will go a long way in ensuring speed for the growth engine that the Prime Minister has envisaged for the Northeast,” Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said.

NDFB (S) general secretary B.R. Ferenga said the third Bodo Accord signed in New Delhi a week ago should be implemented with utmost dedication. “We have returned to mainstream to be part of a good administration. We believe in the Indian Constitution, and hope that this accord will bring in development in coming days,” he added.

President of All Bodo Students’ Union Promod Boro said, “The Bodo people have carried the terrorist tag for decades.

191,2020/01/30,Court allows women to vote in traditional bodies in Meghalaya,"The High Court of Meghalaya on Tuesday ruled that the women in the State have the right to participate in the election of the heads of traditional village bodies. Despite the three principal communities of Meghalaya – Garo, Khasi and Jaintia – being matrilineal in their social set-up, traditional village bodies did not allow women to participate in elections in a case related to the election of the headman of Nohwet village under the State’s Pynursla subdivision.

The case was against the Syiem of Hima Khyrim. Syeim is a king-like chieftain and Hima, in the Khasi language, is similar to a kingdom.

“...if election of the headman of village Nohwet takes place, the women shall also be permitted to cast their vote. However, the outcome of such election shall be subject to the final outcome of the present writ petition,” he said.

Bose Swell Khongthohrem, a former headman of Nohwet had filed the petition against the Syiem and the Sordar (head of several villages in a specific area) concerned for allegedly denying women their right to take part in the election process of the village Dorbar, or council.

Mr. Khongthohrem said he was removed through a secret ballot as headman after he defied the tradition to let women vote.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/court-allows-women-to-vote-in-traditional-bodies-in-meghalaya/article30687821.ece

193,2020/01/30,Coronavirus: Isolation wards set up in Jammu and Kashmir,"Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday decided to open isolation wards, a day after the screening started of passengers travelling from Nepal and China for the coronavirus. Thirty-two students from Kashmir remain stranded in China.

An official said a plan was unrolled to prevent the spread of the virus in the Union Territory. The government ordered the establishment of a control room in the State Surveillance Office in Srinagar and Jammu, quarantine of suspected patients, advisory to all districts and announcements to be made at railways stations and airports.

Isolation wards have been opened at the Government Medical Colleges in Jammu and Srinagar and at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura, and in other districts. A special team of doctors and paramedics will be constituted there. “The samples of the suspected cases will be drawn immediately and sent to the National Institute of Biologicals, Pune,” the official said.

Former Finance Minister Syed Mohammad Altaf Bukhari appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take steps to evacuate Jammu and Kashmir residents, especially students and businessmen, from China. He has sent the details of 32 students stranded in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. “The Ministry of External Affairs should airlift them in a special flight,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/coronavirus-isolation-wards-set-up-in-jammu-and-kashmir/article30687770.ece
194,2020/01/30,Find ways to improve the revenue of farmers: Congress,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi government should implement a minimum income guarantee scheme to boost rural consumption, on the lines of what his party had promised before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, and a national farm loan waiver to tackle rural distress, the Congress said on Wednesday.

Addressing a press conference as part of the Congress’s special series on the Union Budget, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan asked the union government to spell out its measures to double farm incomes by 2022.

Mr. Chavan demanded reduction in Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on agriculture inputs to less than 5% and said the government should announce measures like universal basic income to put more money in the hands of farmers and the poor so that their consumption increases.

The party demanded that petrol and diesel be brought under the GST regime. He said the Centre had earned over ₹13.5 lakh crore by way of taxes on petroleum products in the past five years.

“We demand that the government should put more money in the hands of 95% of the poor who live in rural areas and help improve consumption through schemes like MNREGA. The government should also bring a universal basic income scheme to ensure that there is direct benefit to people and money should go into their accounts directly to help improve consumption levels,” Mr. Chavan said.

Serious questions

The Congress leader also raised serious questions about the Centre’s procurement policy, minimum support price, functioning of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the crop insurance scheme. “I want to give some figures. In 2019-20, the total amount disbursed as compensation to Kharif crops is ₹153 crore, while the premium collected by the insurance companies is to the tune of ₹25,853 crore,” he said.

Mr. Chavan said that for the farmers’ income to double by 2022, the agriculture sector would have to see a compound growth rate of at least 12% annually, while it was only growing at 2.9%.

“How will India’s dream of becoming a $5 trillion economy be accomplished,” Mr. Chavan asked and asserted that India’s official data had now come under the global scanner for its credibility. “There is a lot of jugglery of figures going on and, therefore, the credibility of India is being questioned,” he alleged.

Mr. Chavan also said the Centre was in default when it came to paying the States’ share of taxes and claimed that the union government owes ₹15,000 crore to Maharashtra alone.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/akeuij/article30687744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30TH-CHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/find-ways-to-improve-the-revenue-of-farmers-congress/article30687745.ece
195,2020/01/30,George Fernandes’ political legacy is important in present context: Sharad Pawar,"Addressing a function on the first death anniversary of socialist leader George Fernandes, NCP president Sharad Pawar said his ideas are more relevant today when the Narendra Modi government is adamant on diluting the labour laws and privatising national assets like the railways.

“The country is going through a dangerous time. George Fernandes’ ideas are far more relevant today when the government is allowing foreign direct investment in all sectors including defence, diluting the labour laws and privatising railways,” Mr. Pawar said.

He said the government by allowing 100% FDI in defence is imperilling the national security. “Thanks to their decisions, our country could face serious problems.”

He said the government has started the process of privatising the railways — trains and even many stations. “The government is bringing a policy to hand over stations to private players thereby handing over public assets to a few select people. This is when the common man will remember George,” he said.

Fernandes always stood for the interest of the common man, farmers and labourers. “The government has abolished 40 labour laws and brought labour codes in its place which are anti-labour. These codes in fact violate the International Labour Organisation convention,” Mr. Pawar said. He said if a person as politically alert as Fernandes was alive, these laws could not have been cleared.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/9aihht/article30687593.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MH-KOREGAON-BHIGCI71CB6Q3jpgjpg-23jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/george-fernandes-political-legacy-is-important-in-present-context-sharad-pawar/article30687567.ece

197,2020/01/30,Reliance Industries Ltd. lays out road with plastic waste,"A 40-km pilot project of road network made with 50 tonnes of plastic waste has taken shape within Reliance Industries Ltd.’s (RIL) Nagothane township.

Under its sustainability initiative, plastics used by RIL in the construction include end-of-life post-consumer plastics, such as multi-layer films used for packaging of wafers, snacks, flimsy polyethylene plastic bags, flexible polyethylene packaging materials used by e-commerce companies, garbage bags, cling wraps and other flexible plastic products collected from within the township and surrounding areas of Pen taluka.

Vipul Shah, chief operating officer (COO), petrochemicals business, RIL, said, “This is part of RIL’s endeavour to instil sustainability and circularity concepts in everything they do. The roads at Nagothane manufacturing division are a proof of concept that even end-of-life plastics can be utilised in a sustainable manner in creating meaningful and useful assets.”

Mr. Shah declared phase one of their sustainability and circularity initiative project as complete, while commercially launching the Waste Plastic to Road initiative. “We will be happy to share our experience with governments and local bodies across the country to help increase the use of end-of-life plastics for such productive purposes. Apart from being beneficial to the environment, the use of plastics also enhances the quality of roads,” Mr. Shah said.

The Nagothane manufacturing division is part of its petrochemicals complex commissioned in 1989, with various production units producing polyethelene and polypropelene, among other things. The unit records the movement of several hundred tankers driving in and out every day. The adjoining residential area is home to several employees and their families.

The construction of the model roads at began in May 2019 and was completed in just two months. The Raigad area was later witness to torrential rains last season, with Nagothane alone receiving a record 2,500 mm rainfall.

“The newly-built roads were submerged under water for many days, but there has not been any road erosion. Fully-loaded trucks ply on these roads daily, but there has not been a single pothole till date,” Mr. Shah said, pointing to the roads, which RIL plans to pitch to the National Highways Authority of India, municipal bodies and so on over time as specifications become clear.

The inclusion of plastics in the road mix has enhanced its durability and strength as also provided superior bonding among aggregates, lower seepage of water, and lesser erosion, all this resulting in reduced abrasion of tyres. The cost of a kilometre of a road with plastic — 3.5 m wide, 5 cm topping — costs ₹1 lakh less to make as compared to a conventional bitumin-only road.

To make this happen, the innovation team at RIL modified a hot-mix plant to automate and enhance efficiency of the process of mixing end-of-life plastics with bitumen and gravel for road construction. “R&D teams across our manufacturing sites are striving to improve existing products and processes,” Mr. Shah said.

One of the major challenges in the business is collection of such plastic. The extended producer responsibility or EPR, to make the polluter pay, is touted as the way forward. A robust collection system of such plastic will ensure that even types of plastic that do not fetch waste pickers much money, because they cannot be recycled, are put to use for making roads.

198,2020/01/30,Death toll in Nashik accident rises to 26,"The death toll in the collision between State transport bus and an autorickshaw in Nashik district on Tuesday, rose to 26 by Wednesday.

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), which was called in to help, called off the rescue operation on Wednesday morning.

The accident occurred in the Meshi Ghat in Deola tehsil on Tuesday evening, when the bus collided with an autorickshaw in front of it and both vehicles fell into a deep well by the side of the highway. Local police and fire brigade reached the spot within the hour and started rescuing the occupants of the vehicles.

An NDRF team of 30 personnel was dispatched from its Pune base and reached the spot around 1.15 a.m. on Wednesday.

“The local authorities had already removed both vehicles by the time we got there. However, they were having trouble locating the victims who were still underwater as they did not have deep water divers. We pressed our divers into service and found one victim,” Deputy Commandant Sachidanand Gawde, NDRF, said.

He said the water in the well was pumped out and NDRF personnel again entered the well.

“We found an infant’s body, which was stuck under the debris that had fallen into the well along with the two vehicles, around 10 a.m. on Wednesday. We then conducted a final search, confirmed that everyone was accounted for, and called off the operation,” Mr. Gawde said.

The deceased include 14 men, 10 women and two minor girls, who were twin sisters. Their mother, too, died in the accident. Besides, 32 injured victims are being treated at various government hospitals in Nashik.

Meanwhile, the Deola police said preliminary inquiries have found that the bus driver, who was among those who died, was at fault.

“Inquiries till now indicate that he was trying to overtake from the wrong lane at high speed and ended up hitting the autorickshaw in the process. We are in the process of posthumously booking him under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicle Act,” police inspector Suhash Deshmukh, Deola police station, said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ozbymp/article30687544.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMNASHIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/death-toll-in-nashik-accident-rises-to-26/article30687546.ece

Zameer Momin of the Bahujan Mukti Party said, “Nearly 300 protesters were detained in Pune. The shutdown was complete in several parts of the city, including Camp, Swargate, Bhawani Peth and Kondhwa.”

Transport remained largely unaffected in Pune, and educational establishments functioned as usual. In some places like Hadapsar, where the agitators attempted to send State transport buses back to the depot, the police ensured immediate resumption of services.

The police said no untoward incident was reported.

In contrast, in the bandh was marked by stray incidents of stone-pelting and vandalism in other parts of the State. In Shirpur in Dhule district, a State transport bus was damaged and two passengers received minor injuries. In Akola, the police lathi-charged demonstrators who pelted stones at them.

In Yavatmal, traders and protesters squared off after the latter forced business establishments and markets to down shutters. In one instance, a shopkeeper hurled chilli powder at protesters.

The commission was hearing two separate pleas: one seeking the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leader’s cross-examination and another which claimed the investigation had been transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to hide the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh’s (RSS) role in the violence.

Justice J.N. Patel, the head of the commission, “We are going to call all those persons — whether a former chief minister or anybody else — if by doing so we are able to throw more light on the case.”

The commission was hearing a petition filed by Dr. Sanjay Lakhe Patil, an intervenor and president of Karmaveer Pratishtan, who has made several pleas, including calling Mr. Fadnavis as a witness to be cross-examined for his “misleading” statements in the Maharashtra Assembly.

The petition, filed on Monday, claims that in the statements last year, Mr. Fadnavis did not blame ‘urban naxals’ for the violence, but confessed that the riots were instigated by Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote.

Meanwhile, People’s Republican Party leader and MLC Jogendra Kawade on Wednesday filed a statement before the commission blaming the RSS for its role in the violence. The MLC said Mr. Ekbote and Mr. Bhide were closely associated with the RSS, and the alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi was a means to divert attention from the role of the RSS in the violence. “The RSS is more harmful than the naxals. What were the intelligence agencies doing about the alleged conspiracy?” he asked.

Mr. Fadnavis had last week said the NIA taking over the cases was the correct decision, and accused the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of sabotaging the Pune Police’s investigations. Mr. Patil’s application has alleged that Mr. Fadnavis shielded the accused in the guise of his privileges in the Assembly.

201,2020/01/30,Uttar Pradesh Police arrest Gorakhpur doctor Kafeel Khan in Mumbai,"Gorakhpur-based doctor Kafeel Khan was on January 29 arrested from Mumbai, an Uttar Pradesh Police officer said.

Amitabh Yash, Inspector-General, U.P. Special Task Force said: “Dr. Kafeel Khan has been arrested by STF in Mumbai.” The official reason for the arrest is not yet known. However, an FIR was lodged against him on December 13, 2019 in Aligarh under Section 153-A of the Indian Penal Code (promoting enmity between different groups).

According to the FIR, Dr. Kafeel Khan is accused of provoking the religious sentiments of Muslim students of the Aligarh Muslim University while he was addressing a gathering of around 600 students about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on December 12. Dr. Kafeel Khan tried to spread hatred among the Muslim students of AMU towards the Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs and Christians coming under the ambit of CAA, the FIR alleged.

“Dr. Kafeel allegedly said through the CAA, “we are giving employment in our homes to thieves who are stealing in our neighborhood,” the police FIR said. “Dr. Kafeel said in his speech that Mota bhai teaches us to become Hindu or Muslim but not human beings,” the FIR said.

202,2020/01/30,Living on the edge,"Migration and displacement are important part of human history. Spurred by war, violence and natural disasters, they lead to agony and sorrow for those affected. Focussing on the climate change and dislocation due to it, artist Sudipta Das is currently holding her multi-media solo show “The Exodus Of Eternal Wanderers” at Gallery Latitude 28.

The artworks were triggered when Vadodara, where Das lives and works, was flooded in 2019. “Naturally, there was panic, people became temporarily displaced. For me, the natural disaster flooded back memories of my younger years spent in Silchar, Assam where floods are common phenomena each year. Nature and climate change have created a transient state for the earth and for the humans who encounter its devastation,” says Das. Thus, came into being the “eternal wanderers,” whose greatest aspiration is the will to survive and wanting to find a place/way to make a living.

The first work that immediately draws attention is the “Land Of Exhile”, which has a multitude of diverse dolls, men, women, and children of all ages, spread out on two tables placed at a little distance from each other. Some dolls, so delicately placed on the edges, makes one feel anxious.

Explaining this, Das says, “The chasm represents the physical, human and emotional losses caused by seasonal floods. The few sculptures that balance precariously over the edge consider the uncertain and unstable position of human lives when in a state of flux. A sense of placelessness comes about in the rift that must be overcome to begin life anew. This precarity is thrust upon those who lose everything they have as they are forced into exile, yes, perhaps they long for their lost homes, perhaps they long for stability and normalcy.”

Placed next to this work is “Crossing Over”, showing a large number of people walking in a single file across a bridge or plank. Wearing diverse attires, many have their meagre possessions packed in bags and boxes on their back or in hand-held bundles. One can truly sense the loss people experience of their homes, land, belongings, and memories.

“This depicts the true state of shifting lives, migrations, dispossession, and Diaspora. Fragile bodies and changing states with ever-resilient and versatile essences, humans walk in line toward an uncertain future where they will begin life afresh. Each sculpture awaits the deliberation of onlookers, yet life moves on and there is no time to cling onto what has been lost, or that what is not.”

Lifelike depiction

The figures at the exhibition are truly lifelike reflecting individual characters and personalities. Children portray innocence, while elders show worry, helplessness and at times a vacant look. These figurines are paper sculptures that were inspired by the Korean dakjee doll making technique learnt by Das during her residency in Korea in 2017.

“What makes my creation different is the process of preparing the materials, my experimentation, treating paper several times, pushing its identity, dyeing with natural colours. I enable the material to don new tonality and characteristics with which I can express the many facets and hues of human nature. Using paper, layer after layer, just as layers of our personality and character, I make up each person’s identity.”

Going beyond the human movement, Das also portrays how the displaced people live. This comes across vividly in the Shelter series I to X, which exhibit hutments, temporary tenements made of plastic or cloth or corrugated boards, with clothes hanging on a line, bundles wrapped in cloth or plastic, umbrella, ladders, and footwear kept outside and a goat too.

While many may find these living conditions, pathetic, she disagrees. “Pathetic is perhaps only an onlooker’s perception or judgment. Even in these decrepit covers and temporary shelters, people celebrate the joys of everyday living, children still laugh and play and life still goes on. To my eyes, they have created their own world and their own secure spaces, insecure as they may seem to others.”

A poignant artwork which deserves special mention is the “Mother And Child”, showing two children strapped on the front and back of a woman. The woman’s face is serene while one child is fast asleep another has a naughty look with eyes wide open and fingers in the mouth. “I feel that a large part of our identity and security comes from our parents, especially our mothers, who imprint upon us our identity even before birth. A great sense of security and nurturing comes from being close to one’s mother or even her bosom,” observes Das. Likewise, the “Shelter IX” reflects the artist’s eye for detail as it limns a temporary cover with two gaping holes, through which a face and a hand are visible.

Das says her aim is to make the viewers experience the uncertainty and precariousness of life itself. “That all we have made for ourselves is temporary, that our states are temporary, and yet happiness can be found in everyday living, in daily conditioning and in simple moments.”

The authors include Rabindranath Tagore, Ishwar Chandra Vidya Sagar and Sunil Gangopadhyay.

His pen and ink drawings are riveting and resonant, they are shaped from his own experiences of solitude, alienation, pain, horror, and moods of tenderness and serenity experienced in his childhood. When he illustrates “Rajkumari Poncho Pushpa” there is the inkling of observation and memory and the power of nostalgia.

At times, these images are offshoots of ideas while his grandmother narrated stories to him in the thick of night or monsoon months. The lines are bold, and precise, and create a controlled alchemy of characters and emotion. The drawings that emerge are potent both in form and content. Stripped of colour, they convey an architectonic quality in the structuring of the imagery – we also understand his perfection in scale and gesture.

Meera Mukherjee: Fiery Nataraja

Sculptor Meera Mukherjee once said, “To my mind every artist must also be an artisan, who brings to his work a devotion which moves him through the progress of his work,” Mukherjee passed away in 1998 after a life of incredible sculptural explorations. She believed that true sculpting could only happen when a sculptor dips into her roots in the hope of finding modernist modes.

Meera Mukherjee’s 1995 bronze at the Akar Prakar booth is a delight for the tired eyes. It has tribal threads of rustic rhythms. It evokes the scene of Lord of the Dance. The Anandatandava, the frenzy and iconic appeal coalesce to create a Nataraja. She uses the economy of attributes by giving us four hands like the Chola bronzes of the past but keeps the two feet planted solidly on the ground. We must imagine Nataraja’s right hand raised in the reassuring abhayamudra and left hand in gajahasta, indicating the defeat of ignorance that hinders the realisation of the universal truth. We can see how Mukherjee stretched her forms well beyond the rules set by the classical Chola tradition, as if telling her viewers to extend their imagination just like she did.

L N Tallur: Untitled

Sculptor and installation artist L N Tallur loves drawing the crowds in and wants us to gape at his works with awe in the Chemould Prescott booth. Ever since his days at M.S.University Baroda, he has developed a keen interest in the relationship between viewer and museum object and explored whacky, ingenuous interactive processes.

L.N. Tallur’s work at India Art Fair

On exhibit is his installation of a uniquely-designed Apasmara set between printed dental plaster evoking the museum object but inviting inquisitiveness from the viewer who will be in a dilemma. Tallur calls it floccinaucinihilipilification -it is a prototype for an idea. “Yesterday, it was antique, when it goes under the microscope, you get a beautiful pattern - I have printed that pattern on the sculptures. So here, micro and macro both are seen together. This is a test of an idea, so I don't know if it is worthless or worthwhile. I want the viewer to be part of the journey of contradictions and they should either be amused or shocked or provoked to think,” says Tallur.

The viewer will be compelled to touch this didactic work, the little dwarf almost squeezed between the spaces and the folds. In addition to the engaging conceptual and humorous aspects in this work, Tallur balances fine craftsmanship and with compelling aesthetics cocks an eye on historians and antiquities in museums and the art of the subjectivity

Nityan Unnikrishnan: Untitled

An untitled work by Nityan Unnikrishnan at the ongoing India Art Fair

At the Chatterjee & Lal booth is a stirring portrait of a bespectacled man with grey hair, his gaze is one that probes, provokes and asks you to stop and gaze back. Nityan Unnikrishnan, an NID Graduate and a mid-career artist, paints an urban scape teeming with people in the background, while the grey haired gentleman in the check shirt takes centre stage.

Amongst his crowd of humans, we can sense quirky men and women, detailed with the minutiae of dense domesticity. A powerful observation and the skill to create multiple images of city life are obvious in his work. The silver-haired man seems strangely familiar. His work grabs your attention for its slice of surrealism as well as his ability to present a visual that could belong to any of India’s cities teeming with cosmopolitan crowds. His penchant for perfecting the figurative idiom and weaving in satirical commentaries keep his works refreshing .

Anjan Modak: Untitled

An untitled work by Anjan Modak

Amongst emerging artists, Anjan Modak is a discovery. His fragile figurative works dance before your eyes. At Emami Art, Modak’s works echo the evanescent, the ephemeral and the evocative. He steeps his figurative works with quasi-abstract elements, and satire. His images are talking to us about conspicuous consumption. In a subtle way, he signifies brands and status and gaps between the rich and the poor.

Disturbances between classes of society and people and the superficial vagaries of society all come into play in these facile human forms that seem both surreal and modernist in moorings of expression. Rich in texture, the blend of graphite and watercolour give us an overlay of rare fantasy – here is a dreamy world full of thorns and tribulations.

204,2020/01/30,Meet French artist ‘Le Gentil Garcon’ who explores the Japanese storytelling form of Kamishibai,"Le Gentil Garcon holds aloft a pair of hyoshigi, or clapping sticks, he procured from Kyoto in Japan and rhythmically strikes it. “Long ago, this musical instrument was used to gather kids by a kamishibai storyteller who would arrive on his bicycle. The distinctive clip-clop sound was recognised by children as that’s when they got to have candies and also listen to good stories,” says the French artist and self-taught filmmaker. Le Gentil Garcon is, in fact, his artist name, which means ‘The Nice Guy.’

The Japanese art of kamishibai, which translates to “paper play” or “paper theatre”, is a form of visual and participatory storytelling, that was popular particularly during the Great Depression and post-World War II period. The artist would keep changing frames placed inside a wooden box with an open face while narrating stories and educational material connected by the images. Perhaps, it is much like the traditional Rajasthani art form of kavad katha that made use of colourful storytelling wooden boxes that told tales from the epics. However, the advent of television and other forms of entertainment and infotainment has more or less sounded the death knell of the traditional Japanese storytelling form.

Through his nine-minute film, Chronicle of the Past World, Le Gentil Garcon attempts to “re-interpret” the practice of kamishibai, also seen as a form of street theatre that served as an engaging learning tool. The Lyon native first came to know about the storytelling form during an exhibition about Japanese art in Paris. Later, while doing his residency at the Kyoto art centre Villa Kujyoyama in 2012, he chanced upon Osaka-based octogenarian Tadashi Sugiura, perhaps one of the few surviving kamishibai narrators. This re-kindled Le Gentil Garcon’s interest and he collaborated with Tadashi for the film.

Rendered with English subtitles, the short documentary film shot in Japanese fictionalises a kamishibai, wherein Tadashi himself dons the role of the storyteller on bicycle who traditionally used to pedal from village to village with his candies and ‘picture scrolls.’ Le Gentil Garcon’s stories in the film, which brings in Japanese, French and modern-day references to help explain the idea, attempts to teach children elementary concepts and ideas such as colours, shapes, animals, seasons, numbers, phases of the moon and more with an interactive approach as it was practised on another era.

“It encapsulates the children’s world. They often see things differently, and simple ideas find new meanings in their imagination. This movie is a testimonial to the art form,” says ‘The Nice Guy’.

Shot chiefly at the Kyoto Art Centre, Chronicle of the Past World, on a critical level, zooms in on the “loss of traditional culture and invasion of machines in man’s life”, what the 45-year-old calls is “an amalgamation of art and science.” Le Gentil Garcon first wrote the script in his native French and got it translated into Japanese with the help of an academic.

As part of his presentation in the city on Saturday (February 1), organised by Alliance Francaise de Trivandrum in partnership with the Embassy of France in India and and the Insitut Français India, Le Gentil Garcon will put on display a kamishibai box he is fashioning with the help of a carpenter, which will then be mounted on a bicycle “to evoke a true old-world feel” of the storytelling experience.

Though deemed a “dying art”, Le Gentil Garcon says kamishibai has of late seen a “small renaissance for cultural and pedagogic reasons” in the Japanese society. In fact, when the telly arrived, the Japanese initially called it “the electric kamishibai”, he points out.

Le Gentil Garcon will also be putting up a month-long “interactive” exhibition of his artworks, titled ‘Stories Bloom at Trivandrum’, at Alliance Francaise de Trivandrum, Vazhuthacaud, from February 7. One of the highlights is 100 postcards he has collected from across France. Titled Trivandrum Exquise — Lettres de France, they bear pictures representing French life and culture. “Also on show will be ‘Snowflake art’ done on a plastic sheet where about 200 tiny distinctive snowflakes are carved into it. No two flakes are similar,” he says.

Another interactive “multimedia” work revolves around Norwegian artist Edvard Munch’s famous expressionist painting The Scream. “It will be a game and is based on the work’s theft from a gallery in Oslo,” he says.

A performance by Le Gentil Garcon based on kamishibai and Chronicle of the Past World will be held on February 1 at 10 am at Napier Museum and at 4 pm at Kanakakkunnu Palace. The solo show ‘Stories Bloom at Trivandrum’ will be on at Alliance Francaise de Trivandrum, Vazhuthacaud, from February 7 to March 7.

205,2020/01/30,Children’s Art Fest: Young hands foster art celebration,"Creativity gets a free run on canvases at the fourth edition of Children’s Art Fest 2020. Hosted by Children’s Fine Art Gallery (a division of Daira: Centre for Arts and Culture), the three-day festival is a platform helmed by sisters Atika and Atiya Amjad of Daira to ignite the fire of art among children and teenagers. While Atika has conceived it, the festival is for young to interact with art and enhance their skills.

At Daira, Atika greets us with a cheerful smile. While two volunteers carefully pack artworks, she counts her blessings. “Every year a new team of art-inclined volunteers support the endeavour. Even when I worked solo, people helped me. It is a miracle that I have such people around me.” This year her volunteers include entrepreneur Syed Safiullah, Safeer Khan, founder of Ferishto, Preeti K Bhatnagar, who runs the Prerna Creations art academy and artist-art teacher Kappari Kishen.

As part of the Art Fest, artists, associates of the art fraternity and around 5000 children, parents and teachers come together to celebrate art and also witness a plethora of innovative art-based activities. Hues of lavender will create a splash at Jawahar Bal Bhavan, the venue for Lavender 2020, a group exhibition of artworks by young adults.

The story of this Children’s Art Fest began when a few fellows of Idex Global Fellowship from the USA came to Hyderabad to work in affordable private schools. “The Fellows took us on a tour and we saw pathetic and dingy classrooms with no tables for children to write. I realised art can create miracles in these lives,” shares Atika. From thereon she focused on involving children in art, in a bid to infuse creativity and positivity in their lives. That eventually led to the launch of Children’s fine art gallery.

Growing popular

The curriculum that Atika designed helped students to visualise and inspire. When the project went online, it touched many students. Teach For India (TFI) picked up this art curriculum for its schools. The Children’s Art Festival has grown over the years; 30 schools adopted by TFI, in its first fest, will attract 100 schools this year, in its fourth edition.

One of the highlights of this edition will be a display of works by teachers of art academies. The event ‘Jungle Call In The Dark’ attempts to recreate a jungle in urban chaos. She explains, “Paintings of tigers in a dark room, with jungle music in the background, gives visitors an experience of the wild.”

The fest’s creative zone caters to different tastes with Amar Chitra Katha (ACK) Alive workshops, storytelling sessions, spot writing competitions, quilt making workshops for rescued elephants (by Wildlife SOS), art installations, experts’ talks and also how to write an art journal. The festival also pays tribute to the artist (late) Surya Prakash. Atika says, “Last year, when Surya Prakash came to the festival, he joked, ‘I see Vaikuntam dominating here’. I then had mentioned doing a project on his works and life; we will be showcasing that now.”

Holding the festival in January has a special reason. “Moat schools complete the syllabus around this time. This art event will rejuvenate them for the final examinations in March.”

With just a day to go to the festival, Atika is excited and nervous. “The moment I end a festival, I start planning for the next one. I cannot live without a dream. As the festival grows bigger, I feel some magic is happening and I enjoy this ride.”

206,2020/01/30,Bharatanatyam of their choice,"For this year’s annual day, the students of Matangi Nrithyakshetra wished to present something that resonated with them deeply. So the Director, Matangi Prasan asked them to write their own short stories last summer. “Most of the stories they wrote were dreamy and heroic. So the presentations on stage should also reflect these themes and sentiments,” felt Matangi, as their dance teacher.

They then talked about ‘heroism and women’ and how it is represented in their history textbooks. ‘What kind of qualities are traditionally attributed to women characters in Bharatanatyam?’ was another question they discussed. “By revisiting the tales of warrior women of Karnataka, my students, instead of feeling proud, were really disturbed. They had problems with the way these stories were being told and the negligence in recording stories of women in general. The Forgotten Battles, a production by senior batch of students is an attempt in this regard,” says Matangi.

“The textbooks presented these warrior women as if they were destined to achieve it. But how did they rise to the occasion? The journey of becoming extraordinary from ordinary is what resonates with women of all times. We wanted to explore that part,” she explains. But finding texts that chronicled these kind of narratives was the most challenging. Finally, they came across books by Archana Garodia Gupta and Yugal Joshi on warrior women of India.

“Not Just Another Bharatanatyam Showcase” will be on February 1, 6 p.m. at Bangalore International Centre. The show is conceptualised and directed by danseuse Matangi Prasan and the music is composed by veena artiste, Y.G. Srilatha.

Children’s author, Roopa Pai and theatre personality, Sharanya Ramprakash will be the chief guests of the programme.

In dance class, the younger children discussed from photosynthesis to animal tales to Amazon fires. “I wanted to see how they could present the same through Bharatanatyam. This made them try different movements for describing phenomena they studied in their science and environmental classes. This was truly educative for me as the children had to teach me scientific concepts from step one,” quips Matangi.

They would bring their science textbooks to dance class, read and discuss with the group what they wanted to try out. “Everyday they would come up with newer ways of explaining it, till we finalised on one,” she adds. This production will be presented by children between the age of nine and 14 and is named -- ‘Science meets the Arts’.

Children between the age of five and eight read not only from Panchatantra , they were also aware of the wildfires in the Amazon and Australian forests. “What would these animals from Panchatantra discuss in the current scenario? The Sky has Fallen captures this,” she mentions.

For arriving at these ideas, the team made use of a number of techniques including drawing and painting. “This exercise also made their stories crisper,” she observes.

The team is not making use of any multi-media presentations. “The focus is on presenting concepts and ideas through simple movements. Children perform to the recitations, explanations and music in the background,” informs the young dancer.

The main aim of these experiments is to create a culture of debate in dance class. “When I was a student, I was blamed for asking questions by my peers. But as a dance teacher, I wish to create a positive environment for my students to be critical and engage in debate in a healthy manner,” she asserts.

Matangi views this as an exercise to break free from the one-way teaching methodology and creating art from the bottom.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/2wqq98/article30690966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31bgfrmatangi,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/bharatanatyam-of-their-choice/article30690970.ece
207,2020/01/30,Neeraj Chopra makes it to the Olympics in style,"Almost nine months after he underwent surgery, Neeraj Chopra finally returned to action in the most comprehensive manner possible — by qualifying for Tokyo Olympics in his very first competitive outing of the year.

The 22-year-old, who missed out on the entire 2019 season after an elbow surgery in early May, threw 87.86m, well past the 85-metre qualifying mark, on his fourth attempt at the ACNW League Meeting in Potchefstroom, South Africa, late on Tuesday evening. It was his first competition following an intense rehabilitation programme, first at the National Institute of Sport (Patiala) and the Inspire Institute of Sport (Vijayanagar), before shifting base to Potchefstroom in November to train under biomechanics expert Klaus Bartonietz.

Relieved

“The biggest feeling is one of relief. It was very important to qualify as early as possible because I missed out on the entire last season.

“I knew the sooner I managed to do so, the better it would be because as time goes on, there will invariably be desperation and mistakes will creep in,” Neeraj told The Hindu in an exclusive chat from his training base.

Neeraj returned to rehab in September last year, testing himself tentatively and even thinking of participating in the World Championships before being advised against it. He was then expected to turn up at the National championships in October, but the Athletics Federation of India asked him to go slow.

Working wonders

The rest and workout in the interim have clearly worked. In Potchefstroom, Neeraj managed to easily cross the 80m mark in all his attempts, starting with 81.63m before gradually moving to 82.00 and 82.57.

After the 87.86m, he did not attempt any more throws in order to avoid extra pressure on the elbow. To put things in context, this is Neeraj’s second-best throw ever, behind the 88.06m he threw at the 2018 Asian Games for the gold and a new National record.

“The best thing is that now I can relax, not worry about qualification and only concentrate on training harder here on.

“The main target now would be to compete in major tournaments, including the Diamond League between now and Olympics, try and do my best and test myself against high-level competition and improve my performances there.

“But I will also have to be careful and take care of myself, not strain too much or risk injury. The main focus, though, will only be on Tokyo,” he added.",athletics,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/16fzlt/article30686388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30FRESHNEERAJ,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/athletics/neeraj-chopra-makes-it-to-the-olympics-in-style/article30686389.ece
208,2020/01/30,"Under-19 World Cup | Bangladesh defeats South Africa, enters semifinals","Bangladesh dished out a clinical all-round performance to beat hosts South Africa by 104 runs and enter the semifinals of the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Thursday.

Asked to bat, Bangladesh rode on half-centuries from opener Tanzid Hasan (80 off 84 balls), Shahadat Hossain (74 off 76) and Towhid Hridoy (51 off 73) to post a competitive 261 for five.

The South Africans were below par with the ball as two out of five Bangladesh wickets came through run-outs.

Off-spinner Pheko Moletsane (2/41) and Tiaan van Vuuren (1/46) were the only wicket-takers for the home team.

Rakibul picks up five

South Africa was no better with the bat also as left-arm orthodox bowler Rakibul Hasan returned with impressive figures of five for 19 while Tanzim Hasan Sakib scalped two wickets to bowl the hosts out for 157 in 42.3 overs.

Middle-order batsman Luke Beaufort top-scored for South Africa with a 91-ball 60, while opener Jonathan Bird made 35 but their contributions were not enough to see the hosts through.

Fanning penalised

Australia opener Sam Fanning has been penalised with two demerit points for making a deliberate elbow contact with Indian pacer Akash Singh during the quarterfinal of the ICC U-19 World Cup at Potchefstroom, South Africa.

According to a statement released by the ICC, Fanning has been been found guilty of a Level 1 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel.

210,2020/01/30,NZ-A vs IND-A: Gill and Vihari put up some fight,"Shubman Gill’s run-a-ball 83 was the only high point for India-A as New Zealand-A grabbed the opening day honours in the first ‘Test’ in Christchurch on Thursday.

India-A was all out for 216 in its first innings and New Zealand-A responded strongly, reaching 105 for two at the close.

Put in by Hamish Rutherford, the Indians were soon in a spot of bother at 34 for three in the 17th over at the Hagley Oval.

The 20-year-old Gill found an able ally in skipper Hanuma Vihari (51), and the duo added 119 runs for the fourth wicket.

Having recovered from the early blows that also included the big wicket of opener Mayank Agarwal, the visitors looked on course with both Gill and Vihari in good nick.

However, off-spinner Cole McConchie, who was the second most successful home bowler behind medium-pacer Michael Rae, dismissed Vihari in a bizarre manner.

After Vihari played a sweep directly onto Rachin Ravindra’s shin at silly mid-on, the ball flew towards the wicketkeeper and Dane Cleaver calmly pouched it. Vihari’s knock was a 79-ball effort studded with eight 4s.

After Gill fell to Rae, it did not take the New Zealanders long to wrap up the India-A innings.

The home team lost skipper Rutherford for 28 but his opening partner Will Young (26) was there in the middle when stumps were pulled out.

Ravindra made 47 off 67 balls with seven 4s.

211,2020/01/30,"NZ vs IND fourth T20I: Series sealed, India may look for experimentation","An unassailable lead has opened up the window for experimentation but there will be no let-up in India’s intensity when it faces New Zealand in the fourth T20 International in Wellington on Friday.

Both teams spent Thursday travelling from Hamilton to Wellington, and with a similar tight schedule for the final game of the series as well, there seems to be little chance of nets for either match.

India skipper Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri pride themselves on a win-at-all-times mentality, and have the chance to go for a 5-0 sweep.

Waiting in the wings

However, if experimentation kicks in, Sanju Samson and Rishabh Pant are waiting for opportunities. Pant’s call-up would depend on which batsman is left out, and whether K.L. Rahul will continue to keep wickets.

While the top trio is assured of places, Shreyas Iyer has been in superb touch, but Manish Pandey and Shivam Dube need more game time as well.

Any of the top four may be rested over the next two games. It could even be Kohli and Rohit Sharma alternating in Wellington and Mt. Maunganui.

More changes may be expected in the bowling department. Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav and Navdeep Saini are waiting in the wings. All three may not get a look-in immediately. Rest assured though, the team management is sure to rotate a spinner and pacer each.

Washington is part of Kohli’s new-ball strategy on the big Australian grounds, so he can expect a run over the next two games. Saini could replace Shardul Thakur, especially if Washington adds his batting depth to the lower order.

The final question would be over Jasprit Bumrah’s inclusion. While he had an off night in Hamilton, there ought to be thoughts about his workload. He is part of both the ODI and Test squads, and is a shoo-in for the T20 World Cup as well.

For New Zealand, there is a straightforward change coming up. Colin de Grandhomme is no longer with the squad, giving up his spot for batsman Tom Bruce. This could be an easy swap for the hosts given that they have been light in the middle-order in the past three matches.

Captain’s spot

There is also a school of thought that Kane Williamson should move up top. Given his batting master class in Hamilton, there is potential for him to open the innings with Martin Guptill with Colin Munro sliding down.

Mitchell Santner was promoted on Wednesday night to add more momentum to the innings, and it remains to be seen if it was a one-off ploy or something the Black Caps could consider experimenting with.

212,2020/01/30,NZ vs IND ODI series: Kiwis opts for country’s tallest cricketer Jamieson against India,"Injuries to frontline fast bowlers have forced New Zealand to opt for fresh blood in their pace attack, including the country’s tallest cricketer Kyle Jamieson, for the upcoming three-match ODI series against India.

The 6’8” tall uncapped Jamieson could be in for a potential debut in the series starting February 5 in Hamilton, while Scott Kuggeleijn and Hamish Bennett return to the squad after a long absence.

Injury has meant the likes of Trent Boult, Lockie Ferguson and Matt Henry are unavailable for the series.

Nicknamed Killa, the towering Jamieson has been using his height to good effect in the domestic circuit, bouncing out batsmen.

Born in Auckland and brought up in Canterbury, the 25-year-old has of late sparkled for New Zealand A, including against the touring India A side recently.

He is taller than New Zealand’s batting coach Peter Fulton, nicknamed ‘Two-metre Peter’

While he was coming through the ranks following an impressive performance in the 2014 U-19 World Cup, the Black Caps tweeted in 2016: “Move over Two Metre Peter! Meet NZ’s new tallest cricketer Kyle Jamieson 2.03 metres (6’8) in jandals”.

The Black Caps will rely on Tim Southee’s experience, while Colin de Grandhomme returns to the squad after being left out for the last two T20Is.

Jimmy Neesham and Mitchell Santner will be the all-round options.

Meanwhile, spinner Ish Sodhi has been included in the squad for only the first ODI in Hamilton.

He will be released for the second unofficial ‘Test’ between India A and New Zealand A in Christchurch on February 7.

Coach Gary Stead said his team was aware of the task at hand and looked up to his batsmen to step up.

“We’ve seen from the Twenty20 series (India) are clearly as strong as ever,” Stead said.

“While the bowling line-up has a fresh look, the batting is very settled and we’ll likely have the same top eight batsmen from the World Cup finals.

214,2020/01/30,Ranji Trophy | Abhinav double drives Tamil Nadu,"Abhinav Mukund seems to be a man on a mission, going past some significant milestones in recent times.

After playing his 100th Ranji Trophy match in the last game against Railways and going past 10,000 First Class runs on the first day here at the Motibaug Cricket ground, the Tamil Nadu opener slammed his seventh double century in Ranji Trophy on Wednesday against Baroda.

Like in the previous game where he scored a century in one session, the left-handed batsman again scored rapidly, slamming 206 off just 242 balls with 34 boundaries as TN took a mammoth 316-run first-innings lead.

Quickfire cameos

Dinesh Karthik (49) and Mohammed (54 n.o.) chipped in with quickfire cameos as TN declared on 490/7, scored at a galloping pace of 4.5 runs per over. At stumps on day two, Baroda finished at 10 for no loss in its second innings.

It was Abhinav’s 23rd Ranji Trophy ton and he equalled S. Sharath’s record of most number of centuries for Tamil Nadu.

Resuming on 75, the 30-year-old took no time to get going, hitting three quick boundaries before reaching his second consecutive ton, off just 116 balls.

Suryapprakash at the other end too got a few boundaries before he was bowled by Babashafi Pathan with one that kept low.

Completely at ease

Abhinav looked like he was having an extended net session, playing with ease. Be it drives through the covers, flicks, sweeps or deft late-cuts, he was hardly troubled as he got his next 50 runs off just 66 balls, peppered with eight more boundaries.

The Baroda bowling looked flat with only Babashafi bowling with intent and asking questions of the batsmen. The home team was hampered by niggles to pacer Atit Sheth and left-arm spinner Swapnil Singh who got two wickets.

The left-hander had his moments of fortune when he was dropped twice in quick succession after lunch. When he was on 161, wicketkeeper Viraj Bhosale dropped a simple chance off Baba Pathan and then Ahmadnoor Pathan fumbled one at the covers off Yusuf Pathan when the batsman was on 173.

He raced to the double hundred with two boundaries from 192 — the first one a stylish flick off Yusuf against the turn and then a lucky edge behind the ’keeper.

224,2020/01/30,Slogan-shouting shooter injures Jamia student,"A Jamia Millia Islamia student was shot at and injured on Thursday by a young man, who shouted “kisko chahiye aazadi, mai doonga aazadi (whoever wants freedom, I shall give freedom)” before firing his handgun at an anti-CAA protest.

The victim, who received a bullet injury in the arm and has been admitted to the AIIMS trauma centre for treatment, was identified as Shadab Farooq, a mass communication student.

The shooter, whose identity and pictures brandishing a country-made handgun went viral on social media during the day, claimed he was a juvenile, the police said.

“He has told us he is a juvenile; we are verifying the claim,” Special Commissioner of Police Praveer Ranjan, said. A case under the Arms Act and attempt to murder had been registered, police officials added.

Earlier, before firing his weapon at Mr. Farooq, the assailant had posted on his Facebook page “Shaheen Bagh khel khatam (Shaheen Bagh game over).

This reporter, who was present during the incident, saw the assailant emerge from the crowd, brandish his weapon, open fire and then stand and hand over his weapon to a policeman who accosted him.

Several policemen posted at the protest venue, who were standing about 50 metres from the assailant, appeared to have been caught off guard by the shooter’s actions. The policemen then surrounded the assailant, bundled him into a police vehicle and took him to the Greater Kailash-I police station, where senior officers are believed to have interrogated him.

Soon after the shooting, which happened about 3 km from the ongoing protest against the CAA-NRC at Shaheen Bagh, thousands of people joined the students who were trying to march from Jamia to Rajghat on Gandhiji’s martyrdom day.

“I deplore the Prime Minister’s speech at the NCC rally. I request the EC to take it seriously. Just because he is the Prime Minister, he cannot violate the rules. He cannot violate the guidelines set by the EC,” Mr. Chavan said.

Addressing the Annual Prime Minister’s National Cadet Corps Rally, 2020 on Tuesday, Mr. Modi had said his government brought in the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to correct “historical injustices” and recalled the Nehru-Liaquat pact to assert that the law fulfils India’s “old promise” to religious minorities in neighbouring countries. Criticising Pakistan for continuing to wage proxy wars against India, he said “Our armed forces won’t need more than 10-12 days to defeat them.” Mr. Modi had also said the Jammu and Kashmir problem had been persistent since Independence with some families and political parties keeping issues in the region alive.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tpgc6t/article30689735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cong-asks-ec-to-note-modis-ncc-rally-speech/article30687786.ece
230,2020/01/30,Anti-Corruption Branch files case against AAP's Amanatullah Khan,"The Anti-Corruption Branch has filed a case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Okhla legislator Amanatullah Khan in connection with alleged misappropriation of funds and recruitment in the Delhi Waqf Board which he heads.

A senior ACB official said the case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by BJP MLA and Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta in mid-2019.

“We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act,” said the official.

In May last year, the BJP lodged a complaint alleging that Delhi Waqf Board funds were being “used for minority appeasement” politics by the AAP government.

The BJP alleged that the Board had passed a resolution when the model of code of conduct was in place during the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 authorising withdrawal of money from the bank account of the Board through signatures of any two among: the chairman, a member and chief executive officer (CEO).

The BJP leader said that this resolution was approved by the Delhi Finance Minister even though it allegedly violated a government memorandum dated June 3, 2015, as per which the signature of the board’s CEO was necessary for such withdrawal of money.

Mr. Gupta has claimed that after the resolution’s adoption, the Board issued cheques of increased salaries of Imams and Moazzins of mosques on April 25.

At the core of the BJP’s grouse was also a hike in honorarium to Imams in January 2019, from the existing ₹10,000 to ₹18,000, and that of Moazzins from ₹9,000 to ₹16,000.

233,2020/01/30,Kejriwal takes out roadshow in support of Satyendar Jain,"Sporting his signature muffler, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday took out an hour-long roadshow in an open jeep in Shakur Basti constituency from where his Cabinet colleague Satyendar Jain is seeking re-election.

Amid drum beats and sloganeering, the convoy along with hundreds of party workers traversed through the streets of Rishi Nagar and Rani Bagh as the senior leaders waved and smiled.

“There is a 200-bed Mahavir Hospital... we will convert it into a 700-bed hospital. We are also going to bring the Metro to the area,” Mr. Jain told The Hindu, when asked about the issues he is raising in the area. Neither of the AAP leaders gave a speech during the roadshow.

As Mr. Kejriwal left the area, 55-year-old Shakuntala Manchanda, who had stepped out of her shop to catch a glimpse of the CM, said: “He has done good work and many people’s electricity bill has come down. I have heard that the government schools have also improved. But we are getting the same power bill as before AAP came to power. Last month we got a bill of ₹2,140.”

But she said that she had never seen the local MLA, Mr. Jain, after the 2015 election victory. “Jab election hot hai, tab aate hain. Aage peeche koi nahi aata (during election, they [politicians] come. Before and after it no one comes to the area),” she said.

On Wednesday, the AAP chief took out four roadshows covering Mehrauli, Chhatarpur, Shakur Basti and Moti Nagar. “Received a lot of love from people of Shakur Basti and Moti Nagar. People have made up their mind. This time, entire Delhi will unite and press the broom’s [AAP election symbol] button,” Mr. Kejriwal later said in a tweet.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6kn1ir/article30687773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DEKEJRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-takes-out-roadshow-in-support-of-satyendar-jain/article30687774.ece

236,2020/01/30,Amit Shah tears into Kejriwal on latter’s home turf,"Union Home Minister Amit Shah, during his first appearance on Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s home turf of New Delhi Assembly constituency this election season, accused Mr. Kejriwal of being the “biggest liar” he had seen in his public life.

Speaking at a meeting at B.K. Dutt Colony, located near Lodhi Road, which is home to a significant population of Hindu refugees from Pakistan in addition to government employees, Mr. Shah raised issues ranging from India’s partition in 1947 to the alleged physical assault of former Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash at Mr. Kejriwal’s residence last year.

The Home Minister also raised the issues of the Ram Mandir, the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh and the arrest of Sharjeel Imam.

“If you talk about the disintegration of Mother India, we will ensure you go behind bars... Kejriwal had asked me why I did not, as the Home Minister, ensure that Sharjeel Imam went to jail. Now I have done it. Now tell me when you will sanction the prosecution of those involved in the JNU sedition case,” he said.

“These people have spread propaganda against the amended Citizenship Act. Even today, [Deputy Chief Minister Manish] Sisodia says he stands with Shaheen Bagh. If that is the case, how will you make Delhi secure? Only Narendra Modi can do that,” Mr. Shah said.

Talking about the “unkept” promises made by the government, Mr. Shah said that the Aam Aadmi Party national convenor’s usual retort was that lies were not only being spread about him, but also the national capital.

‘Delhi will teach lesson’

“I have never seen a liar as big as Kejriwal in 56 years... Mark my words, the people of Delhi will teach this [Delhi] government a lesson for not keeping the promises they had made... I have come to Kejriwal’s constituency to remind people of his promises today,” Mr. Shah told a gathering at a local public park here.

Exuding confidence about the BJP’s prospects of forming a government in Delhi “with full majority”, Mr. Shah claimed his visits to many Assembly segments had given him reasons to believe his party was poised to win.

The people of New Delhi constituency, he said, had a special role to play in this regard.

“If the people of 35 Assemblies vote for us, we will form the government. But here, if you defeat Kejriwal, you, as a single constituency, will accomplish what 35 others can,” he said further. The people of New Delhi constituency, he added, had “the remote” which could “change the face of the whole city.”

Referring to the alleged assault of former Delhi Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash, Mr. Shah said, “You [Mr. Kejriwal] and your legislators assaulted the Delhi Chief Secretary at your official house.

Holding the Tricolour, protesters, including those who have been on an indefinite stir at Shaheen Bagh, held posters of the Preamble of the Constitution.

MP Manoj Jha, activist Tapan Bose, Ravi Nair, Supreme Court lawyers, student activists from Jamia Millia Islamia, Jawaharlal Nehru University and others addressed the gathering.

Attacking the government and speaking about the protests, student activist Afreen Fatima said: “I am here for the idea of a nation which accepts me as someone asserting my Muslim identity.” She went on to say that there is a “media trial” that has been taking place to portray people from a particular community as anti-national and seditious. “To them, I want to say, being Muslim is no crime,” said Afreen.

Social activist Ravi Nair argued that the current move by the government would harm Hindus as well. “Look at what happened in Assam where lakhs of Hindus were kept out of the NRC,” he said.

Apart from speakers, those gathered there sang revolutionary songs and recited poems in support of the protest.

238,2020/01/30,"With classical renditions and beats, Republic Day fete comes to a close","As the sun sets behind the South Block and the shadows of the marching contingent grew longer, a mix of drum beats and classical renditions reverberated at Vijay Chowk, marking the culmination of the Republic Day celebrations on Wednesday.

With President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and other leaders present, Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the Beating Retreat ceremony with the loudest cheers from the audience.

From “Ganga Jamuna”, to “Samundra Manthan”, Indian tunes performed by the Army, Navy, Air Force and Central Armed Police Forces bands set the tone for the ceremony as silhouetted camels perched on the North and South Blocks formed the backdrop.

As opposed to reports of “Abide With Me” being replaced by Vande Mataram for this year’s celebrations, the ceremony ended with the hymn, said to be Mahatma Gandhi’s favourite, keeping in line with previous years.

Twenty-six-year old Okhla resident Sarita Naskar, who attended the ceremony for the third consecutive year, said, “I make it a point to attend the Beating Retreat parade every year. To sit in close proximity to the seat of power and watch the ceremony unfold is an experience which cannot be missed.”

Maria Thokchom, who was a first timer at the ceremony said: “While the foot-tapping renditions and formations by the Air Force band was the highlight for me, I was quite glad that “Abide With Me” was retained. It adds a good flavour and serves as a perfect mix with the Indian renditions played.”

As the ceremony drew to an end with “Saare Jahan se Achha” and with the bugle sounding for the retreat, Raisina Hills was illuminated amid a loud cheer from the crowd.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qqxza7/article30687755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL30-RETREAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/with-classical-renditions-and-beats-republic-day-fete-comes-to-a-close/article30687762.ece
239,2020/01/30,AAP seeks campaigning ban on Amit Shah for tweeting ‘fake’ videos,"The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday said that its delegation had met Election Commission (EC) officials to file a complaint and demand a 48-hour campaigning ban on Home Minister Amit Shah. The party said that Mr. Shah and several other BJP leaders had circulated “fake” videos of Delhi government schools to “defame” the people of Delhi.

“An FIR should be filed against people who have posted the fake videos and Amit Shah for tweeting the same. All these tweets, which are defaming Delhi and insulting the children of Delhi, should be deleted,” AAP MP Sanjay Singh said.

“BJP has been continuously using objectionable language against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and by calling him a terrorist, BJP has insulted the two crore people of Delhi,” Mr. Singh said.

“Impose a ban on campaigns by Amit Shah and MPs [Gautam Gambhir, Hans Raj Hans, Parvesh Sahib Singh] for violating the Model Code of Conduct,” read a letter submitted by AAP to the Chief Election Commissioner.

Later, addressing a press conference, Mr. Singh said, “Many parents [of students] have decided to file a ₹100-crore defamation case against Amit Shah for defaming the education system of Delhi, teachers, parents and students. We have talked to many parents and they said they will begin the process tomorrow.”

The party also filed a complaint with the CEO, Delhi, against BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh, stating that Mr. Singh allegedly called Mr. Kejriwal a “terrorist”.

240,2020/01/30,"Couple held for killing minor boy, his mother","A couple was arrested for allegedly killing a woman and her 13-year-old son in north-west Delhi’s Jahangirpuri, police said on Wednesday.

The accused Pardeep (26) and Meenakshi (26) are residents of Rohtak, they said.

The murder came to light after the police found the body of Harshit and his mother Pooja at their house on January 21. During investigation, it was found that jewellery and cash were missing from the house and a case was registered in this regard, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (North West) Vijayanta Arya.

More than 50 CCTV cameras were scanned and call detail records of the suspects were analysed.

It was also found that Meenakshi’s husband was present in Jahangirpuri at the time of the murder, the DCP added.

Under financial crisis

During interrogation, Pardeep disclosed that they were in financial crisis and came to know that Pooja was arranging money to buy a property. They decided to kill her to get rid of the financial crisis. As per the plan, they killed the two on January 16 and looted cash and jewellery from the house.

241,2020/01/30,Balancing the past with the future,"It is a tightrope walk for Alka Lamba, who quit the Aam Aadmi Party to rejoin the Congress last year, to get her key election plank for the high-profile Chandni Chowk constituency just right.

Poke too many holes in the work done in the past five years and Ms. Lamba stands the risk of questioning her own work as an AAP legislator in the constituency.

“If my competitors ask what I have done in the past five years, I say I have done my work with sincerity. I don’t claim to have done everything, but I have done good work,” Ms. Lamba said.

‘Much work left’

She agrees that “much work is left to be done, which is why I have thrown my hat in the ring once again”.

The 44-year-old, who left AAP in September last year, will face BJP’s Suman Kumar Gupta and AAP’s Parlad Singh Sawhney.

Ms. Lamba had commanded a 49.35% vote share in the last Assembly elections.

On one of her campaign trails this week, Ms. Lamba visited Yamuna Ghat, a small residential pocket near Nigambodh Ghat.

Quick on her feet, Ms. Lamba led a small entourage of supporters through the narrow alleys to meet and greet the residents. Light rain did not slow her down.

Pension scheme

“I will carry forward the work done by Sheila Dikshit,” she told a group of women and men who had come out of their houses to greet her. She highlighted that in Delhi, the government has halted the old age pension for the past one year. One of her major poll planks is to increase the old age pension from the current ₹2,000 to ₹5,000.

“The civic bodies said they do not have money and stopped the pension. The Delhi government’s budget during Sheila Dikshit’s tenure was ₹30,000 crore, then everyone used to get their pension. Now, the budget has doubled to ₹60,000 crore yet people are deprived of their rightful pension,” she said.

Ms. Lamba was also quick to attack her former colleague and AAP convener Arvind Kejriwal with whom she had a fallout following a series of differences. One of the bitter point of conflicts was AAP’s 2018 resolution to revoke former Prime Minister and Congress leader Rajiv Gandhi’s Bharat Ratna.

“Why has Mr. Kejriwal given a ticket to Mr. Sawhney, who was AAP’s opponent last election. Only to cut the votes,” she told the crowd.

“If I had the temptation for a post, I would not have resigned from AAP. I could have gone to the BJP, they have power at the Centre. But I came back to the Congress, my home, under Sonia Gandhi,” she said.

“Today, we might not have Sheila Dikshit, but her dream to increase the pension amount will be taken up by Ms. Gandhi,” she promised, while reminding the crowd about how she had helped build the sewer and water lines in the colony through her MLA fund.

Talking about changes in her campaign strategy, Ms. Lamba said: “Last time, AAP had emerged out of a movement. It has been five years since, and everyone know how these years have gone by”. “Ladne, dharne main paanch saal beet gaye (five years have gone by in fighting and protesting),” she quipped.

“The fact is Delhi’s air has in the past six years become toxic, water has failed in potability test, and inflation has hit everyone. Onion prices have gone as high as ₹200 per kg, milk prices have gone up, price of gas cylinder has gone up and there is mass unemployment,” she said.

Busy schedule

With less than 10 days left to polls, Ms. Lamba devotes 12 hours daily to reach to the 1.13 lakh registered voters in her constituency.

In the morning hours, she takes up the Chandni Chowk ward, followed by Civil Lines, and then from 6 p.m.-10 p.m.10, she campaigns at Jama Masjid.

She added that it was not correct for the AAP government to announce freebies five months before the elections. “The AAP government is spending crores of rupees on advertisement and is trying to ride the wave into the elections,” she said.

“The Delhi portrayed in multi-crore advertisements is not the real Delhi. We are struggling to inform the people about it,” she stressed.

It, however, remains to be seen if the crowd is swayed by the freebies or they take up the issues of inflation, unemployment and development, she added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/qvmket/article30687709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30DELAMBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/balancing-the-past-with-the-future/article30687710.ece

However, an investigation is under way to ascertain facts and the exact sequence of events, they added.

Justice Rajiv Shakdher remarked, “Classes were not held. So what was the purpose of having exams if the students were not instructed? Purpose of exams is to evaluate what the students have learned.”

Students and several JNU professors have challenged the university’s decision to hold online open book or take-home exams for the monsoon semester.

Seeks recommendations

The High Court asked the Board of Studies of the various schools and special centres in JNU to convene and give recommendations on how the remaining classes of monsoon semester can be held and how the exams can be conducted.

It asked the Board to forward its recommendations to JNU’s academic council and to place a copy before the court prior to the next date of hearing on February 4.

The pleas challenged the university’s decision to conduct end-semester examinations for the 2019 monsoon semester through an alternative mode of uploading question papers on the university’s website or sending them to students by e-mail and receiving answer sheets through e-mails and WhatsApp messages.

The petitions have also opposed the university’s circular directing the professors to commence course work for 2020 winter semester, saying the directions were issued on instructions of the Vice Chancellor (VC) in exercise of his extraordinary powers under the JNU Act and the statutes of the university.

We are proud, as well as modest, just as our restaurant.”

Postmaster General, Bengaluru HQ Region, S Rajendra Kumar says, “When we got the request for the release of the Special Cover from Brahmins’ Coffee Bar, we helped in the processing of the proposal and the design of the Special Cover and got it approved by the Chief Post Master General. Certainly it is an honour bestowed upon the eatery by the Postal Department.”

Radhakrishna goes on to say that his 89-year-old mother and septuagenarian brother Shankaranarayana Adiga watch the recipes, measurement and preparation time with a hawk’s eye. “They both are always in the kitchen monitoring the cooks. Fifty five years ago, my mother gave the recipe for Uppittu (kaara bath) and Chutney and people lapped it up. We need nothing more than people’s love and connect,” says Radhakrishna.

Uppittu and chutney or Idli and chutney are the staples. “It is the right ingredients in the right measure with the right cooking time that gives it the special zing. In the world of gourmet-kitchens and food chains, this space is considered iconic for its simplicity and local delicacies. We don’t even serve sambar with Idli. It’s only been Idli-Uppittu-chutney. Vade and Kesaribath was added from 1971,” he says.

Ask Radhakrishna about the footfalls per day and he says, “Actually that is not important to us. Even the most busy people as film and theatre personalities, writers, doctors, lawyers and IT professionals come here and wait for their plate to arrive. Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa was here after his swearing in ceremony. Idli-vada is his favourite,” he says adding that they send food to the party head-quarters often.

Radhakrishna says, of the 2000 covers released, one will be framed at the restaurant.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/mb1rs2/article30692866.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30bgm-BCoffeeBar2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/brahmins-coffee-bar/article30692868.ece
247,2020/01/30,Accent on peace for prosperity,"The benefits of education and the ways in which students can deploy their knowledge for the progress of the country was stressed by Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati, who makes it a point to engage with the youth, be it from a Veda Patasala or a mainstream school. On Monday, he addressed the high school students of the institutions run by the P.S. Educational Society, at P.S. Senior Secondary School, Mylapore. He pointed out the yeoman service rendered by the Society, a wing of P. S. Charities, founded in 1905 by Pennathur Subramania Iyer. The institutions, including one offering the CBSE curriculum, have about 5,000 students, the alumni going on to occupy high positions in different fields. On arrival, the Sankaracharya was received with Poorna Kumbham by the heads of P.S. schools and members of the Committee.

The Sankaracharya urged the young audience to imbibe the qualities of respect — for parents, elders, fellow men — and humility, which are ingrained in the Indian teaching system. It has Dharma and bhakti as its strong arms. The country has a long and rich heritage of education, which was imparted free by dedicated preceptors. The legacy continues in the form of Trusts and endowments. Education is an indispensable asset, which trains a pupil in concentration, makes him a refined and complete human being. Talent and the success it brings, however, should not make the beneficiary lose sight of humaneness, which fosters love and compassion. This is the true purpose of education, he reiterated.

Giving back to society

Blessing the senior students, who would be facing exams in a few weeks, the Sankaracharya exhorted them to develop bhakti, love for Nature and a taste for good literature to emerge as strong adults, who would give back to society. This can be done by promoting peace, which in turn will usher in prosperity. Material wealth sans amity will not bring progress and for amity to prevail, mutual support and give-and-take are essential, he said. “Gain proficiency in your mother tongue and Sanskrit, which can unite people across the country,” he said. Conservation of natural resources, solution through dialogue, simplicity and the importance of cleanliness are some of the principles used as a refrain in discourses today. The Sankaracharya pointed out that these are concepts embedded in the soil of this land and through the education received from institutions, students must take them forward to integrate the family, the Nation and the Globe.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/b6z45h/article30692084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31FRPSSS1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/use-knowledge-to-spread-peace-kanchi-sankaracharya/article30692085.ece
248,2020/01/30,What makes Buddhist concepts relevant,"Violence in the modern world is deliberate — in order to keep the arms industry thriving, according to Venerable Samdhong Rinpoche, leading Tibetan Buddhist philosopher and scholar. While it was perfectly legitimate for human beings to use natural resources, problems arose when people moved from being users to consumers, resulting in greedy use.

The monk, former director of the Central Institute for Higher Tibetan Studies, made these observations at “Ethics, Meditation and Wisdom in a turbulent world,” a panel discussion organised by the Maithrim Poshas Trust recently. Sharing that the title of the discussion reminded him of Buddhist terminology — sila (ethics), samadhi (meditation) and pragnya (wisdom), he spoke of people’s reluctance to stress duties over rights.

An attempt to draw up a common charter of duties failed at the World Parliament of Religions, due to lack of consensus, he said.

Venerable Tenzin Priyadarshi, Director, Dalai Lama Center for Ethics and Transformative values, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that traditionally, meditation had been a way to acquiring wisdom. But it has now become a million-dollar industry.

Spiritual gurus are judged by the number of social media hits they have. Materially progressed societies are left with the negative by-products of their progress. Human beings are the only sleep deprived species on earth. And we take pride in depriving ourselves of sleep! We see this as an indication of productivity. Ambitious teenagers in Silicon Valley aspire to become billionaires at a young age. But ask them what they will do after that, and they will say they have not thought that far. Efficiency is all that seems to matter these days, and if only efficiency matters in life, then what is the purpose of being alive, asked Priyadarshiji. The Buddhist concepts of sila, samadhi and pragnya become important in this context, he said.

S. Gurumurthy, editor of Tuglak, who moderated the discussion, said that ethics cannot be just an individual virtue. It must be nurtured by a favourable ecosystem.

A doctor in the audience had two questions. An octogenarian patient, with many complications, came to him with a blood clot, and the family and the hospital wanted an interventional procedure. Ten years ago, the patient would have been given medicines, and they would have waited for the clot to dissolve. He wondered if technical advances had given us the urge to fix problems at once, without waiting for organic solutions to evolve. He also said that as a busy medical practitioner, he did not have the time for anything beyond packaged meditation.

Priyadarshiji said that techno-optimists had Utopian ideas. We have no answers to the question — what will you do if you live to be a hundred. Priyadarshiji said that people tried to become spiritual to manage worldly life. But the purpose of meditation was loftier.

Regarding our attitude to religion, Priyadarshiji said that for most people, interaction with the divine has become a daily exercise in negotiation — ask for a boon, offer something in return.

Mr. Gurumurthy responded that there was nothing wrong in this and that an elitist mentality in worship would marginalise the vast majority. Priyadarshiji said that the death of religion had been predicted repeatedly in the past. But all religions were growing. He spoke of how depressing the visit to an elderly care facility can be.

“We are telling our elders, ‘Your productivity is over. Live here till your end.’” N. Ravi, Trustee of the Maithrim Poshas Trust and Chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, said that he was impressed with the gentle persuasion used by the panellists, which was a change from the usual cut and thrust that marked panel discussions.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/l3ldlu/article30691877.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31FRMAITHRIM,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/what-makes-buddhist-concepts-relevant/article30691879.ece
249,2020/01/30,Dharmaprakasha still glows,"Several decades ago, many businessmen of Bengaluru have poured their hard earned money for the philanthropic cause of the city. But some of the structures representing the yeoman service rendered by these lesser known builders of Bengaluru have been swallowed by the developmental process, which has hardly any concern for the wealth of built heritage of the city. However, the descendants of a few such benevolent luminaries, continue the traditions set by them.

Suryavamse Sajjan Rao is one such Samaritan, whose varied acts of charity and philanthropy, all of which have been inspired by a genuine yearning for the upliftment of the society. They are all represented by several structures which are not only still intact, but also have enriched the built heritage wealth of the city. He was honoured with the title, Dharmaprakasha -- the beacon of Dharma. The light lit by him is still glowing and stands testimony for the great concern he had for his city, Bengaluru.

Thanks to the subsequent generations of the family, particularly Ajay Kadam, grandson of S. Sajjan Rao, has been taking care of all work initiated by him.

S. Sajjan Rao was born and brought up in an humble environment in a small village near Maddur. His maternal uncle Venkata Rao Bhojgade brought him to Bengaluru to earn livelihood. The shrewd and smart young boy, quickly learnt the art of the trade while helping his mentor. Steadily, the promising merchant built up for himself a commanding and influential position in the business world through honest effort, enterprise and sterling character. He was one of the leading yarn merchants and a respected citizen of the city.

He had taken agency of Binny Mill products and was also a sole distributor for all the products of K.R Mills to Mysore Province. He had a dyeing unit in Visvesvarpuram. His close friend and a prominent businessman of Madras, Gokuldas Jamunadas used to import high quality colouring material and send them to Sajjan Rao. When they could not import such materials during World War, the unit was closed.

In the earlier days, Sajjan Rao had his business and residence on Kilari Road in Majestic . The Bangalore City Municipality had given him license on March 6, 1917, to move around the city using a horse driven carriage. Later, he built a bigger trade centre at the square on Avenue Road, then known as Doddapete .

By 1926, he built a palatial house at the junction of K.R Road and Albert Victor Road, diagonally opposite to the famous Kote Venkataramanaswamy Temple. It was a two storied building of grace and grandeur, built in a typical regional architectural style with a broad portico, towers and artistic parapet walls. It was a hub of religious and cultural gatherings, reverberating with devotional songs and Vedic chanting. It was aptly named as Sri Lakshmi Nivasa. In the real sense, it was an abode of the goddess of wealth.

DAYS OF GLORY The Maratha hostel, and a picture that continues to remain on its walls

With increasing wealth and prosperity, Sajjan Rao’s innate zeal for public service also found manifold and generous expression in many acts of charity and service to humanity.

With the welfare of his Maratha community in mind, he was largely responsible for the growth of Maratha Students Free Boarding Home which was established in 1909. With the nucleus fund of ₹40,000 provided by the wife of the late Venkata Rao Bhojgade, he prudently managed the hostel and its assets, adding his own handsome donation of ₹50,000 . Hence the name, B.Venkata Rao S.Sajjana Rao Maratha Students’ Home. The old graceful building of the hostel in the vast premises on Bull Temple Road, Basavanagudi, is still retained. One of the group photos with the managing committee members and the students was taken in 1925, almost 95 years ago, is preserved well in the hostel. It shows S. Sajjan Rao sitting in the capacity of the treasurer of the institution.

During its centenary in 2009, adjacent to the old one, a new building was raised to commemorate the occasion. Today Maratha Hostel is a prominent landmark of the city.

In spite of the expanded trade, growing wealth, and image in the society, the spiritual call from within was urging S. Sajjan Rao to build a temple for Lord Ganesha, a deity worshipped by many communities. However, he built a temple for God Subrahmanya Swamy. DVG, in his book of memoirs, writes that a monk from Tamilnadu had advised Sajjan Rao to build a temple for Subrahmanya, along with a choultry.

Accordingly, Sajjan Rao applies on 16.7.1932 to the city municipality to grant land to take up the construction work. Soon, the municipal office grants him land in Visvesvarapuram. Sajjan Rao jumps into action, puts his heart and soul for the completion of the twin projects. On June 22, 1934, the temple with deities Subrahmanya along with Srivalli and Devasena, Chintamani Ganapati and others were consecrated. At the same time, in 1934, a commodious choultry, attached to the temple, with a very graceful front elevation was also inaugurated. A group photo taken in front of the building shows many dignitaries of the city sitting along with S Sajjan Rao. Subrahmanya swamy temple in Viesvesvarapuram is a popular temple in the city.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/49ahi6/article30691052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31bgfsm-1,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/dharmaprakasha-still-glows/article30691057.ece
250,2020/01/30,The universe’s inner voice,"Da. Ra. Bendre’s poems are much too valuable to remain (hidden) in the consciousness of a few thousand aficionados of Kannada poetry.

“The Narayana of the lotus-heart has himself turned into the mortal Datta

As Ambikatanaya he mirrors forth in Kannada, the universe’s inner voice”

Dattatreya Ramachandra Bendre was born in Dharwad on January 31, 1896 into a Marathi Chitpavan family. The eldest of four boys, his father’s early death meant that Bendre grew up under the aegis of his mother, Ambike (Ambavva), and his maternal grandmother, Godubai. In an autobiographical essay titled, “The High Yoga of Poetry”, Bendre says that “deprived by fate of my father’s and his family’s closeness, it was by direct observance of my mother’s and my grandmother’s conduct that I realised my manhood.” This matriarchal upbringing would instil in Bendre a devotion towards the universal feminine shakti and greatly influence his poetry. It would also be responsible for his naming the poetic shakti within him, Ambikatanayadatta, which is Datta, the son of Ambika.

The other great influence on Bendre would be Dharwad, its people, and its heritage. Beginning his poetic journey in the late 1910s as a poet of the Navodaya period in Kannada, Bendre would – over the course of a fully-lived life of 85 years – go on to write 1427 poems in Kannada and be immortalised as Kannada’s varakavi, the heaven-touched poet-seer. Steeped in the myriad scents and sounds of his beloved Dharwad and full of a life-affirming vitality, Bendre would – among numerous other accomplishments – chart a new course in Kannada poetry by sublimating the janapada or the folk idiom of Dharwad into a lyric poetry of the highest order. In doing so, he would elevate the Kannada language to Himalayan heights and take his place among the world’s greatest lyric poets. (In his use of a vernacular “dialect” to write “high poetry”, Bendre accomplished something that maybe without parallel in both Indian and world literature.)

“Myriad-minded” was the adjective Coleridge coined to describe Shakespeare. It could just as felicitously be used to describe Bendre. (Curiously, what Bendre did for, with, and to the Kannada language finds its closest parallel in Shakespeare’s work on the English language.) A defining aspect of Bendre’s myriad-mindedness was his voracious curiosity. While stories about his all-consuming interest in numerology (in his later years) abound, it is piquant to note that his “personal library” contained over 16,000 books on 102 different subjects! From geology to astrophysics to ‘a theory of immortality’ (also the name of a small booklet he wrote in English), it is not too much of a stretch to say that all the universe was Bendre’s playground. To read his poetry is to come across allusions to – among other things – modern psychology, the vedas, the six yogic chakras, prime numbers, the earth’s magnetic field, and linguistics.

As the writer Gourish Kaikini noted, what was remarkable was how such prodigious and extensive reading had little to no effect on Bendre’s sui generis creativity.

The case of Bendre and Ambikatanayadatta is a curious one. Often mistaken for a pseudonym (pen name) in the Western sense, Bendre described Ambikatanayadatta as the “universal inner voice” within him that dictated what he (Bendre) then presented to the world. In the foreword to his Jnanapitha-award-winning poetry collection ‘Naaku Tanti (The Four Strings)’, Bendre “conveys his gratitude to all those sahrudayas who have continued to welcome the poems of ‘Ambikatanayadatta’. Stories of Bendre going up on stage and saying that “Da Ra Bendre would like to begin by offering his humble prayers to the poet Ambikatanayadatta” are also in circulation.

But it may not suit everyone to share Bendre’s conviction about Ambikatanayadatta or put faith in stories. And that is perfectly all right. Such anecdotes are just ‘the icing on the cake’. It is Bendre’s poetry — with its felicity, its passionate lyricism, its ever-renewing newness, its rootedness in Dharwad's and the-rest-of-Karnataka's soil, its magnificent conceits, and its magical nāda (euphony) that defines him and renders him 20th-century Kannada's rishi. Just as astonishing as the poetry is its range. From the lyrical addressal of contemporary life to the creation of metrical forms that fit the over-three-millenia-old Kannada language’s tempo; from the exploration in verse of a thousand-year-old Kannada metre to wordplay in vedic metres, Bendre’s poetry was a poetry of seeking and revelation.

“The chúrn and churning of the word brought forth a euphony

It felt a joy — it spread a joy — in its own lòve it was happy

It did not mean — it did not want — it was just lyric poetry”

A language is as much culture as it is sound. Hidden within a language's sounds are countless cultural echoes that trace the language's evolution even as they recall the surroundings, idiosyncrasies, characteristics, and lives of its speakers.

Bendre songs To mark the 125th birth year of the great poet, Da. Ra. Bendre, Suchitra Film Society presents, “Aaga Sanjiyagittaa”on February 1, 6.30 p.m. The event will have an introductory talk on Bendre’s poems by scholar, Bendre Krishnappa. Well-known musician Sangeeta Katti will sing Bendre songs. Bendre Krishnappa will also offer meaning and insight into some of the songs Sangeeta will render. The venue is Peer Rangamandira, Suchitra Film Society, BSK II Stage, Bengaluru, 6.30 p.m. Entry fee is ₹50.

It is safe to say that Bendre's poetry may be the most comprehensive exploration of the Kannada language's sound. Indeed, his poetry in many ways is the fulfilment of the Kannada language. Through his relentless ""churning"" of the (Kannada) word, Bendre did not just create an overwhelming lyric poetry but also, to quote a perceptive critic, ""engaged in the exploration of an entire culture"".

Almost 60 years ago, Shankar Mokashi Punekar predicted a time would come when “all of Karnataka will [need to] collectively engage in the study of Bendre’s poetry”. As unlikely as that is, it is just as likely that Ambikatanayadatta Bendre's poetry is world literature's best-kept secret.

It is time the secret was revealed. It is time the people of Karnataka began engaging and helping the rest of the world engage with the poetry of Kannada’s greatest modern poet. After all, in these fraught times, there is something to be said for the soothing influence of a poetry whose only wish is to “spread a joy”.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/ia5ak7/article30691005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGF,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-universes-inner-voice/article30691007.ece

Describing the gunman as a ‘terrorist’, Mr Owaisi took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked him to identify the gunman by his clothes, a reference to Mr Modi’s speech in which he said protesters could be identified by the clothes they wear.

252,2020/01/30,"TS, AP Chief Secretaries’ meet inconclusive","A meeting of the Chief Secretaries of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Somesh Kumar and Nilam Sawhney respectively ended inconclusively with no major decisions taken on key reorganisation issues like division of assets and liabilities of Schedule IX and X institutions, pending dues pertaining to various public utilities and corporations and bifurcation of employees.

The two top officials are reported to have discussed about the pending issues institution wise during the close-to-five-hour meeting that was held at the Telangana Secretariat on Thursday and the discussion mainly focused on the apportionment of assets and liabilities of Schedule IX and X institutions. Senior officials from the Transport department, power utilities, Aviation Corporation and other wings participated in the deliberations to give their version on the pending bifurcation issues.

In addition to the Chief Secretaries, the secretaries of reorganisation affairs of Telangana K. Ramakrishna Rao and AP L. Premchandra Reddy were present at the meeting. Senior officials said it was resolved to continue the discussions further so as to reach a consensus and ensure settlement of the pending reorganization issues.

“Several issues have been discussed and the discussions have been positive. We are hopeful of resolving the pending issues through similar meetings in the coming days duly briefing the two Chief Ministers about the proceedings from time to time,” a senior official who participated in the meeting said. The Telangana Government had conveyed its readiness to continue the deliberations, but officials were tight lipped when asked about the date of the next meeting.

The meeting comes in the light of the recent interaction between Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his AP counterpart Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in which it was decided to direct the Chief Secretaries to meet frequently to iron out the differences between the two States in relation to the bifurcation issues.

It assumes significance in the light of the letter addressed by Ms. Nilam Sawhney asking the Union Home Ministry to treat the recommendations made by expert committee on Schedule IX institutions at one go rather than taking them up institution wise. The Telangana Government was however opposed treating the recommendations on Schedule IX issues as one lot as the recommendations pertaining to demerger of some corporations was unilateral and against the interests of the State.

The two States reached a broad agreement in respect of 53 of the 89 institutions listed under Schedule IX and it was resolved to shortlist another 25 institutions where there are no big differences so that the issues relating to these institutions could be resolved through mutual consent.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/juhh39/article30695980.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy30Chief-Secretaries-meeting,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ts-ap-chief-secretaries-meet-inconclusive/article30695981.ece
253,2020/01/30,‘Recognise millets as foods of future’,"The All India Millets Sisters (AIMS) Network which concluded its three-day conference in Sangareddy district released the ‘Millets Charter 2020’ and declared that millet rights are women’s rights. It also demanded a better deal for millets and farmers cultivating them.

The network partners from various States, who met in Pastapur village of Zaheerabad mandal in Sangareddy district from January 27 to 29, said that women farmers were the preservers of biodiversity which was the soul of millet farming. The agricultural finance institutions should move away from their tradition of preferring non food-crops such as cotton and heavily irrigation-dependent crops such as rice, sugar cane etc, and give priority to millets in view of their nutritional value. More so when a rethinking was happening on agricultural strategy due to deepening climate crises.

With every decade of climate crisis getting worse, familiar grains such as wheat and rice would continue to disappear from food basket of the country and there would be nothing to offer in the food system, the AIMS cautioned.

Millets with their extraordinary capacity to withstand the climate change pressure, might be the only grains that could be tapped for public food systems. “There is an immediate need to recognise ‘Millets as Foods of Future’ for India and all food planning must be based on millets,” they emphasised.

All-India campaign

The Millet Sisters vowed to take up an all-India campaign for implementation of the promise of putting millets in the Public Distribution Systems, a promise that was included in the Food Security Act of India passed by Parliament in 2013, said P.V.Sateesh, Director, Deccan Development Society and National Convenor, Millet Network of India.

The AIMS Network also referred to the Prime Minister’s endorsement of millets as treasure of nutrition and his call to start a millet revolution in India. But this could happen only when State policies such as Kisan Samman Yojana focused on millets. If the current cash support of ₹6,000 per year is applicable to all farmers, the millet-based bio-diverse farmers should get at least ₹10,000 in view of their special contribution to food and nutritional security, environmental security and their contribution to the alleviation of climate crisis.

At present millets were consumed by the rich as they recognised the nutritional value of millets while poor moved away from them. An effective campaign be launched to encourage all sections to consume millets as staple diet when India was placed at 185th position among the malnutritioned nations in the world, the Millet Sisters said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/7n226p/article30695953.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31MILLETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/recognise-millets-as-foods-of-future/article30695954.ece
254,2020/01/30,"Maoists using complex communication system, police tell High Court","One of the five basic documents of the outlawed Communist Party of India (CPI)-Maoist, ‘Strategy and Tactics of the Indian Revolution’, mentioned Revolutionary Writers Association (RWA) as one of Maoists’ open or semi-open Revolutionary Mass Organisations, the Telangana police said.

Frontal organisation

In a counter affidavit filed by police in Telangana High Court in the habeas corpus petition of Osmania University associate professor Chinthakindi Kaseem, it was stated that the Committee for Release of Political Prisoners (CRPP) was a frontal organisation floated by the CPI-Maoist. It also formed a Tactical United Front (TUF), an umbrella organisation of different revolutionary mass organisations. One of them, Telangana Praja Front plays an important role, the affidavit said.

Noting that Maoists and their associates were utilising technology for communication among themselves, the police stated Forensic Science Laboratories were finding it difficult to retrieve and analyse the data from the electronic evidence seized from Maoists. “....Important information is always encrypted in the most complex way using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption which is not decrypted by any agency so far,” they said in the affidavit.

According to the affidavit, the Forensic Labs were returning the digital devices unanalysed due to lack of expertise to crack the PGP encrypted digital documents. While trying to gather bits and pieces of evidence to connect the suspects with the crime, sometimes the investigators stumble upon some tip-off through a network of informants. In Kaseem’s case, the Investigating Officer chanced upon evidence that corroborated already gathered information and hence search warrant was obtained to check his house, the affidavit said.

Referring to a query raised by the HC, the police stated that 118 articles including books, pamphlets, letters and literature were seized from the professor’s house. Among this seized material, the following were found to be objectionable by the police — A book titled Ramnagar Kutra Case-Oka Vidhwamsa Rachana, CPI-ML People’s War group of Naxalites book containing their ideologies, Register of the Telangana Student Front (which according to police is a frontal organisation of Maoists).

Replying to the query as to what evidence police had got to prove the allegation that the professor collected money from businessmen and contractors and paid to the Maoist party, the police cited statements made by some witnesses. Copies of the witnesses, former cadres of Maoists, accusing the professor of collecting money and giving to Maoists were presented along with the affidavit.

The police said in the affidavit that the evidence on record suggested that the professor and his wife were running a journal Nadusthunna Telangana from his official quarter with the money provided by Pulluri Prasad Rao who is CPI-Maoist Central Committee Member. The letters written by the professor who had an alias name of Karthik and SN, have details of funds provided by the party and money collected by them on the party’s behalf establish his complicity in the activities of Maoists, the affidavit said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/69ubnd/article30695923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31KASEEM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/maoists-using-complex-communication-system-police-tell-high-court/article30695924.ece
255,2020/01/30,Stay away from corruption or get sacked: KTR,"Newly elected councillors and corporators were told to stay away from corruption or face severe consequences from the government, including removal from the posts.

The warning came from Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president K.T. Rama Rao, while speaking to the newly elected members of the municipal polls at Telangana Bhavan on Thursday.

KTR said if someone was constructing a house, officers and councillors were the first to demand money, and this practice should stop now onwards. Similarly, the government would not spare anyone deliberately delaying granting building permit.

He said since the party had asked the aspirants to read the new Municipal Act thoroughly there was no way corrupt practices would be spared. Even recommendations from the MLA or a Minister would not help and corrupt people would be sacked.

KTR wanted to know why officials took so much time to study the building plans submitted to them. Building rules were not rocket science and there was no reason for any delay in granting permit. He wanted the councillors to be active participants and sought suggestions from them for improving the Municipal Act.

The Minister also patted himself and the party for allocating 57% of seats to women though the reservation was 50%. He advised the new elected members to work with focus, ignoring criticism from the opposition. The government would grant ₹3,000 crore for municipalities every year and there was no reason for them to fear lack of funds.

‘Insult to people’

261,2020/01/30,‘Clean Ward’ mooted to treat highly infectious diseases,"Health Department officials are mulling setting up of a ‘Clean Ward’ where people suffering from rare and highly infectious diseases such as Novel Coronavirus (nCoV), Ebola and Nipah virus can be admitted. The design and infrastructure of the ward would be such that infections from the patients would not spread to doctors, nurses or anyone else on the premises.

Besides an isolation ward, ICU with ventilators and general wards will also be made available to the patients. Depending on the severity of disease, one would be shifted from one ward to another. All such facilities are proposed to be located in a single building.

Currently, anyone is suspected to have nCoV is admitted at Sir Ronald Ross Institute of Tropical and Communicable Diseases, better known as Fever Hospital, in Nallakunta. If the patient’s condition worsens followed by severe difficulty in breathing, he/she has to be rushed to Gandhi Hospital for ventilator support.

This can be avoided if the Clean Ward is set up with all other supporting facilities in one building.

Land at disposal

Officials said they had initially considered the Fever Hospital premises for establishing the Clean Ward at an estimated cost of ₹16 crore, but the Government General and Chest Hospital at Erragadda was eventually selected since it has vast swathes of land. Officials added that the design has been provided by the technical committee of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Testing in city

Meanwhile, a day after the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare stated that four labs of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Viral Research and Diagnostics Lab Network in four cities, including Hyderabad, were activated to test samples for detection of nCoV, Telangana Health Department officials said the ICMR lab at Gandhi Hospital here will be chosen for the purpose.

Staff at the hospital will be trained in handling and testing the samples. It is learnt that reagents and testing kits would be supplied to perform the tests. It will take around 10 days to initiate such tests.

As of now, samples collected form those suspected to be having nCoV are sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune. Time taken to transport the samples can be significantly cut down once the ICMR lab at Gandhi Hospital is activated.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/z366ar/article30687369.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY30CHESTHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/clean-ward-mooted-to-treat-highly-infectious-diseases/article30687364.ece
262,2020/01/30,NRC fear: clamour for birth certificates grows louder,"The clamour for birth certificates has grown louder and more urgent in the context of the fear surrounding the impending National Register of Citizens, and several citizens are doing rounds of various GHMC offices seeking issue of the certificates.

The anxiety is more pronounced in case of people whose parents returned after staying in foreign countries for some time, and whose birth certificates were issued by the Indian Embassies in the respective countries, officials say.

Usually, the rush for birth certificates is high around the time of school admissions as several schools demand certificates as the proof of age. What is being witnessed now is off-season rush, say officials.

On an average, about seven to 10 persons per day are visiting the GHMC headquarters, seeking birth certificates for themselves or their offspring.

“All of them are those who stayed abroad for a while, and then returning to settle in India. They are all anxious that their and their children’s names would be deleted from the citizenship register if birth certificates are not produced,” says an official.

A predominant majority of such persons approaching GHMC constitutes Gulf returnees, while a minority are from the USA too.

As per the procedure, birth certificate should be applied for within 60 days during the person’s first visit to India, by producing the document issued by the Indian Embassy in the corresponding country.

“If the application is given after 60 days or during subsequent visits, we can certify only the ‘non-availability of birth certificate’,” says the official.

A circle level official said, several persons who were born in the city are also being trapped by middlemen who promise to get the certificates done for payment.

“Many gullible people are being waylaid and robbed of money by brokers who prowl the circle offices, in the name of birth certificates. I have dealt with people who paid ₹5,000 to ₹10,000 to get the certificate,” he said.

GHMC does not straightaway issue birth certificates to people who have completed 14 years of age even if they are locals. All it can issue is non-availability certificate, which needs to be produced before the special executive magistrate in the rank of RDO in district collectorate, along with date of birth certificate, and identity proof.

The application will then be forwarded to the local tahsildar’s office, from where a Revenue Inspector will do the ground verification. After receiving the detailed report from the Tehsildar’s office, the magistrate or RDO will issue proceedings for late registration of birth. GHMC is authorised to issue birth certificate only after receiving such proceedings, officials informed.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/83g3pf/article30687413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-FILE-NRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/nrc-fear-clamour-for-birth-certificates-grows-louder/article30687352.ece

264,2020/01/30,Hot Chip makes an Indian debut,"In the early 2000s, British band Hot Chip arrived on the scene with its infectious brand of synth-pop. Over the next decade, it had hits like ‘Flutes’, ‘Ready For The Floor’ and ‘One Life Stand’, besides making waves with out-of-the-box videos.

With the group members, led by vocalists and multi-instrumentalists Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard, working on solo projects and collaborations, Hot Chip was less prolific for a while. In June last year, the band returned with the album A Bath Full Of Ecstasy, where it has worked entirely with external producers in an attempt to create a new sound.

For synth-pop fans in India, the good news is that Hot Chip will be playing at the 13th edition of Sulafest, Nashik, this weekend. The event line-up will also include Mumbai duo Salim-Sulaiman, Delhi-based Hindi rock group The Local Train and Dutch-New Zealand genre-blending band My Baby. The Hindu spoke to Taylor on the upcoming show and new album. He says, “Though I have visited India, this is the first time Hot Chip will be playing here.”

Festival bound

The gig will feature seven musicians, most of who play multiple instruments. Using a football analogy, Taylor says, “There will be four up front and three for the back formation, though Rob (Smoughton) will sometimes come forward from defence to shoot penalties.” The set will comprise a mix of older hits and songs from the new album. Taylor points out, “We often modify the songs from the way they were recorded in the studio. Sometimes the original versions sound flat when played live.”

From the new album, Hungry Child and Melody Of Love were released as singles. The former won the best independent video of the year at the AIM Independent Music Awards. “Our videos are responses to the music, and we let the directors interpret them. For songwriting, Joe and I work on the basic melody and structure, and then everyone pitches in with ideas,” Taylor explains.

Evolving sound

When asked how Hot Chip has adapted to constant changes in dance music over the years, Taylor says the group creates music based on what’s influencing them, right from different musical styles to relationships to politics. “I don’t think we consciously try and adapt to fit in the changes, but if we’re inspired by something new, it will have an impact on us,” he adds.

A Bath Full Of Ecstasy comes four years after the last Hot Chip record Why Make Sense. In the interim, the musicians collaborated with known acts like Katy Perry and LCD Soundsystem, besides working on solo projects. “For the new album, these experiences played a role. We wanted to push ourselves to make the best record, working with producers who hadn’t worked with us before,” says Taylor.

265,2020/01/30,Patterns of rhythm,"At the Ganpati festivities in Pune in September last year, an American joined in and played with the street drummers. Nobody seemed to know he was Greg Ellis, renowned percussionist who has also worked in 150 Hollywood scores including The Matrix: Reloaded, 300, Iron Man, Body Of Lies and Argo.

Though he follows various global drumming styles, Ellis is particularly fond of Indian rhythms, having played with tabla maestros Ustad Zakir Hussain and Bickram Ghosh. However, in his stage set-up, he uses the nagara, introduced to him by Nathu Lal Solankey. Ellis will be the special guest at A Homage To Abbaji, to be held on February 3, as a tribute to tabla doyen Ustad Allarakha on his death anniversary. “Right now, I am very confident, but I may have my OMG moment on the day of the show,” he jokes during the interview.

Global influences

Ellis normally plays the western drum kit, but his set at the show will include world music instruments like the cajon, udu, frame drum, darbouka and ashiko. He says, “I have amassed a collection of hundreds of percussion instruments from all over, and I play them all. Maybe not in the traditional manner but I respect the culture they come from and why they exist in the first place.”

As a child, Ellis first picked up the classical trumpet. He got interested in drumming after playing in a marching band. His initial taste revolved around rock bands like Boston, Led Zeppelin and Van Halen. Ellis elaborates, “I also got into progressive rock and my biggest influence was Neil Peart of Rush, who we lost recently. Listening to Rush opened me to odd time signatures and complex patterns of rhythm.” The young drummer started playing professionally at the age of 20 after moving from the San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles. The percussionist says, “It was only at 26 that I got into global percussion after reading the book Drumming At The Edge Of Magic by Mickey Hart (of The Grateful Dead).” He eventually started the projects Vas and RhythmPharm.

In sync

Ellis met Zakir Hussain through Hart, who was producing an album for the Japanese taiko drum group Kodo. He recalls, “I knew Zakir was on the album but I didn't know I would be playing with him. I was initially intimidated but when I met him, he made me feel that if I was in that room, I belonged there. He’s a very giving musician who [has] always encouraged others to excel.”

On collaborating with Kolkata-based Bickram Ghosh, Ellis says, “I first worked with him in the first Rhythmscape album 20 years ago. With the equation we share, we say that we are one drummer with four arms. When I visited their place, I also had a chance to be guided by his father Shankar Ghosh.” The musician explains working on film projects is special as you play in accordance with the visual. “I was lucky to work with Alexandre Desplat, who composed the music for Argo. It was nominated for an Oscar. My other favourites are 300 and The Matrix: Reloaded,” he adds.

The percussionist is especially looking forward to the barsi tribute as he wants to give something back and be part of the celebration to honour the incredible legacy of Ustad Allarakha. “India has meant a lot both musically and personally,” he asserts.

266,2020/01/30,What an idea!,"“Khayal is the brand Ambassador of Hindustani music in present times,” declared Shekhar Sen, Chairman, Sangeet Natak Akademi, during his inaugural address at the recently held national seminar on ‘Khayal and Allied Forms’ organised jointly by the ITC-SRA (West) and Indian Musicological Society in association with Music Forum and the NCPA in Mumbai.

Hindustani music, like any other classical performing art tradition, has evolved in the perspective of the cultural and political history of the country and bears the impression of every age it has witnessed. The evolution from the pristine Prabandh-Gaan and the devotional Dhrupad-Dhamar to the latter-day ornate and romantic Khayal and the allied forms were also the result of socio-political changes. Temples were the nucleus of arts in ancient India. Music and dance were associated with the daily rituals of the temple as an offering to the presiding deity, prevalent in Haveli Sangeet to date.

Focus on entertainment

When the patronage shifted from temples to the princely courts, the element of entertainment crept in, although Dhrupad remained the dominant form until Khayal came into prominence. Tansen, the Dhrupad singer adorned the court of the Mughal emperor Akbar as one of the nine jewels of his court and Raja Man Singh of Gwalior was a great patron of Dhrupad. With the emergence of Khayal in the court of Sultan Husain Sharki of Jaunpur, music obviously changed through assimilation, adaptation and creation, keeping its roots strongly embedded in tradition.

Freedom to improvise

The erudite scholar Thakur Jayadev Singh had arrived at the conclusion that Khayal actually sprouted from the ancient Rupak-Alapti mentioned in “Sangeet Ratnakar”. Maintaining the purity of raga and tala, the gradual unfolding of alap and the frequent return to the mukhda (the opening line of the song) repeated after each elaboration, are common features of Rupakalapti and Khayal.

It seems that the rigidity of the austere Dhrupad with lofty lyrics sung within the strict tala circle, devoid of flippant embellishments, gradually gave way to the creativity of musicians in Khayal, an Arabic word meaning an idea, thought or imagination. Khayal provided greater freedom for imaginative improvisations within the frame of a given raga and tala. Thus ornamentation in music assumed a significant role and Khayal became the most popular form of Hindustani music.

Pt. Umakant Gundecha establishing the link between Dhrupad and Khayal mentioned the important fact that the Prabandh-Gaan brought the concept of ‘Sam’ and ‘Aavartan’ (the circular journey of a tala from ‘Sam to ‘Sam’). He also maintained that Khayal followed the alap, jod and drut alap structure of Dhrupad. Gwalior Gharana, for instance, was affected by the alapchari and Jaipur gharana by the jod-ang of Dhrupad. Pt Vijay Kichlu accepted the fact that Agra Gharana actually originated from Dhrupad itself, hence the ‘Nom Tom’ Alap is prevalent till date.

Germination of gharanas

When the Mughal empire fell, musicians found refuge in several smaller states which gave them shelter, security, and honour. The individual creative genius of great masters created specific singing styles that gave birth to different gharanas of Khayal singing. Most of these gharanas are known by the name of the cities they were localised, such as Gwalior, Agra, Jaipur, Patiala, Rampur, Saheswan, Kairana, etc. Khayal was believed to be a contribution of Amir Khusro but the seeds of Khayal existed in ancient types of musical compositions such as the five types of ‘Geeti’ or singing styles mentioned by Sharngdeva in his “Sangeet Ratnakar”.

Khusro seems to have made a substantial contribution in shaping the Qawwali-based Khayals, from which emerged the Qawwal Bachche Gharana of Khayal. Ud. Iqbal Ahmed Khan linked Dilli Gharana to Amir Khusro and sang a couple of Khayal bandishes composed by him. Shirky rulers of Jaunpur also popularised Khayal. Sadarang (Nyamat Khan) and Adarang (Feroz Khan), the prolific composers who flourished under the rule of Mohammad Shah Rangile, composed hundreds of bandishes of vilambit and drut Khayals, popular even today.

Pt. Vidyadhar Vyas underlined the Ashtaang-Gaayaki and demonstrated allied forms like the tap-Khayal, Khayalnuman, Tarana, Sargam-geet and Chaturanga, explaining a bit about each one of them. Vidushi Ashwini Bhide Deshpande talked about and demonstrated the achhobh (rare) ragas and compositions of Jaipur Gharana. Talking about Patiala Gharana, Pt. Ajay Chakraborty emphasised the importance of ‘sur’, the true musicality and reiterated it could be inculcated in the next generation from an early age.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/efm6a/article30692674.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC0301,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/what-an-idea/article30692679.ece
267,2020/01/30,The talking tabla of Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri,"Like a migratory bird, tabla exponent Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri arrives from the US during the musically hot season of winters in India where a hectic schedule awaits him with a bagful of events centred on either his solo, accompaniment or workshop every year. This season is no exception – what with his scintillating solo during the mammoth Chowdhury House Music Festival, his edifying art of accompaniment during the day long musical to celebrate the birthday of Swami Vivekananda at the Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Kolkata, and a bunch of others.

His guru, Santosh Krishna Biswas, has become immortal only because of the unparalleled stature of his disciple as a performer, guru and administrator of internationally acclaimed institutions in the US and Switzerland. Almost every big classical event in India has featured him. More importantly, a lovingly organised soiree in Kolkata this year was dedicated to his guru .

Interestingly, the young Swapan started learning the art of tabla at a time when several luminaries such as Ustad Karamatulla Khan, Guru Jnan Prakash Ghosh were at the peak of their creativity and fame. Almost all aspiring musicians of that era strived to learn from them to win their blessings.

What led him to Santosh-babu who was not an insider of the 'hallowed zone' of the golden era?

“You see, I was a pampered son of a medical practitioner and a vocalist mother – both of whom loved music but never thought of etching a career out of it,” says Chaudhuri. His father had learnt flute from the legendary Pannalal Ghosh and had composed music for several dramas and acted too. “Like all educated and well placed Bengalis of their generation, they too believed that music was an essential part of good grooming. This feeling was nurtured by the local club where my father met Santoshbabu who played tabla rather well and who happily agreed to join in the riyaaz sessions of my mother (Meera Chaudhuri who was an AIR artiste). They became great friends even before I was born,” recalls the musician.

Very naturally, Chaudhuris initiated their little son to vocal music and discovered his latent talent. Encouraged, they requested this dear friend who hailed from a conservative family like their’s, had similar values and yet who was a brilliant disciple of the famed Hirubabu, to teach tabla to their son when he was barely five. A reticent Santoshbabu did not wish to lay so much emphasis on music as he strongly believed that academics should come first. But the prodigious traits of little Swapan inspired Dr Chaudhuri to persuade him, and he relented.

There is a faraway look in his eyes when the master reminisces, “Since this house in South Kolkata, built in 1904, was close to the club, I debuted in cultural events organised by its members initially and very soon got noticed by connoisseurs. Many advised me to swap guru for a celebrity name but I stuck to him. I started discovering my guru and understood his depth of knowledge much later. He always told to me to imbibe knowledge from all sources but direct it and develop according to my own inclinations.”

Edited excerpts:

Your guru was a banker and you graduated in Economics. Is there any connection between maths and the art of tabla?

If there is anything beyond science and maths – it is music. Maths is a mere tool. In the beginning, one needs to count the beats and then gradually start feeling its rhythm within. It is very logical. How does a musician measure shruti? One cannot, yet one can feel its presence. The logic says that it has to be like this and the singer does it according to his perception. In the case of rhythm, the dividing bars of a tala give a canvas to build a crescendo. The temple cannot be linear.

Mathematically, the ninth beat in teental and jhaptal should be the same. But their placement varies within the bars of each tala; so does their importance. Each has a special chhand. By counting it you get only a straight line – not the gait or pulse of a tala cycle. This applies to Indian concept of tala cycle only. Earlier in the West there used to be talas having only four or six beats and that too in linear order, but not now. Influenced by Indian and Brazilian rhythm concept, they are developing poly rhythm, albeit in fast tempo.

The concept of vilambit is typically Indian. Apart from a few African mnemonics, the concept of bolbani is Indian too.

Indian music is rooted in spirituality and you are a devoted musician. When you play tabla what helps you to connect with the Supreme Being?

We have 27-30 bolbanis, may be more. I am doing a research work on the origin of these bols. Till now, I can say that they all came from Vedic ‘chhand’ (rhyme) and ‘beej-mantra’ (root Mantra). Tabla actually speaks the bols. Strictly speaking, tabla is not a percussion instrument. I call it a very sensitive melodic instrument because it needs fine tuning constantly. A perfectly tuned tabla can cast its spell. Purity of sound has its own impact that transcends the mind from earthly to ethereal level.

Name a few of your favourite musicians who make your role as an accompanist enjoyable!

I enjoy the company of all, even of those who are not taaldar or layadar. The reason is because I don’t need to show my superiority; instead I need to help them by following the rules and regulations related to the art of accompaniment. When I play solo, I take the command. But even there I never feel like proving a point. I simply play to share the delight of music-making.

Many greats chose the US as their work-field for several reasons. What was your aim?

Once I reached there to honour the offer given by Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, I felt that this music should be all over the world, more so because great musicians like him struggled to spread it. Thanks to their endeavour, it is much easier for the present generation of musicians to perform before knowledgeable listeners. Indian music has made an entry in the general stream of the educational curriculum of US. The fact is that the West looks up to Indian culture and philosophy with great respect because this is still living. They are learning Sanskrit, Vedic chanting, spirituality and music which is a very important part of Indian culture and philosophy. Unfortunately, our contribution in this direction is not counted by many.

How do you plan your day out there?

Since I work till midnight, I get up at 8 a.m. normally and sit for riyaaz. In the US, nobody visits without prior intimation. So I continue undisturbed till noon. Then I cook my favourite (exotic Bengali) dishes such as mochar ghonto, shukto, shorshe-machh! I was initiated in this art by none else than Ali Akbar Khan saheb! Many of my disciples know about this passion of mine and the fact that I cook in large quantities. They arrive with their little containers to get a share. In Ali Akbar College, the teaching time starts from 4 p.m. The college time continues beyond the class, as I encourage interactions till late hours. I reserve the weekends for concerts.

What is the difference between Indian and American students and what is your teaching methodology?

I follow the same method as shown by my guru who believed that one has to come down to the level of a student to see, communicate and understand his psyche and then guide him up to another level. I am very warm, but when it comes to my subject – I follow strict discipline. Indian students are very talented, they are drawn to music. But since the path is not easy at all, they should pursue their studies as well. Instead of imitating others, one must follow one’s guru devotedly for a strong foundation – without which nothing works in the long run.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/3a7ywr/article30692597.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Pandit-Swapan-Chaudhuri,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-talking-tabla-of-pandit-swapan-chaudhuri/article30692598.ece
268,2020/01/30,"The award is for Kashi, says Pt. Chhannulal Mishra","It’s 7.30 a.m. and 83-year-old Hindustani vocalist Pt. Chhannulal Mishra is on his way to the Banaras Hindu University, where he would be felicitated for getting chosen for Padma Vibhushan, one of the highest civilian awards. “Since the announcement was made his phone has been ringing constantly and guruji is flooded with felicitation invitations,” says Aman Jain, who has been training under Mishra for the past five years.

“I am delighted not because the recognition has come to me. I am more happy that the award celebrates one of the world’s oldest living cities, Kashi. And I dedicate it to the beauty and timelessness of Indian classical music,” says Pt. Chhannulal Mishra. His first gurus were his grandfather Shanta Prasad and father Badri Prasad Mishra. Though he trained in Kirana Gharana under Ustad Abdul Ghani Khan, Mishra does not ascribe to the concept of gharana.

“I learnt in Kirana style but I live in Benaras. My music is a beautiful amalgam of what I was taught by my gurus and what I imbibed from Benaras that has been home to several stalwarts.”

Talking about why the city has three names, Mishra points out that Kashi denotes that it resides in Shiv’s Trishul, ‘Varanasi’ means from rivers Varuna to Assi and Benaras denotes how the ras (essence) of music will never diminish.

“I chose to live in Kashi because it is Shiv Nagari. The Lord preferred to move from Kailash and reside here. And it is from his damru that swar, laya and shabd flowed. Any wonder the city is the seat of culture and arts? I cannot imagine living elsewhere,” says Mishra.

But the veteran also rues that the flavour of shastriya sangeet is being lost with most youngsters taking the fusion route. “I can sing 11 types of thumri. Girija Devi worked hard to get thumri its due recognition and place in Hindustani music. Who wants to remember these pioneers? Thumri and other forms such as tappa, hori, chaiti and kajri are slowly fading away,” he says.

Mishra insists that when melody is sacrificed in the name of doing something new, it does not augur well for classical music. “Madhurta nahin hai toh sangeet mein jaan hi nahin hain (without melody music is dead). By collaborating with completely unrelated genres and styles most often these youngsters make the music complicated and inaccessible. Sahaj, saral aur sundar, yeh acche sangeet ka mool mantra hai (the mantra of good music is simplicity and beauty),” says Mishra, who feels that though the award has come late, Baba Viswanath has taught him to be content with what one gets in life.

He hums his favourite thumri, ‘Khele masaan mein holi.’ “Do you know why it’s a staple at my concerts,” he asks and gives the answer: “Because it signifies Varanasi, where the real and mythical and birth and death comfortably co-exist.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vxk5tc/article30692416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31FRCHHANNULAL2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-award-is-for-kashi-says-pt-chhannulal-mishra/article30692418.ece
269,2020/01/30,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly at the Grammys","The crème de la crème of the music industry took the stage on January 26, for music’s biggest night. Yet, it was not without strife. It was emotional. It was teary because while January 26 might have been the Grammys it was also the day we lost Kobe Bryant — one of the most famous basketball players in the world. Every moment, one could see the hint of Bryant and the tribute that the artistes paid to him, especially by host Alicia Keys’ performance of ‘It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday’ with Boyz II Men.

The Grammy Awards also took place hot on the heels of the shadow of a scandal when Recording Academy chief Deborah Dugan was removed 10 days prior to the event and her allegations of misconduct were left ringing in their ears. But the night also saw Billie Eilish sweep the biggest four awards of the night — Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Album of the Year and Best New Artist — a feat that hasn’t happened since Christopher Cross in 1981. In addition to this, she also took the award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Lil Nas X took the stage for an explosive collaboration of ‘Old Town Road,’ which featured Billy Ray Cyrus, Mason Ramsey, Diplo, Nas and K-Pop group BTS, who made their debut Grammy performance with the collab. Camilla Cabello performed a heart-wrenching song dedicated to her father and Lizzo’s stage proved exactly why she was the frontrunner with the nominations.

Unfortunately, the highs of the Grammys were just not enough to combat with the lows of it and the hard truth is that even for artistes within the industry, the Grammys is losing relevance. So it was another year of no-shows. I remember seeing the original seating plan which had Taylor Swift, Beyonce and Jay-Z among them and yet none of them turned up. Lady Gaga was conspicuously absent as well which makes you wonder exactly how the Grammys are going to recover when most of the top stars do not bother to attend.

When the nominations first came out, Twitter erupted and why was that? Fans were outraged by the complete shut-out that BTS faced despite breaking records and easily being eligible for any of the major categories. This was perhaps the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. News articles were so much bolder with outlines of how the Grammys were known for being racist and excluding deserving artistes based on their lineage and colour.

I love Billie and I’m proud of how much she’s achieved because she is a brilliant artiste. Yet, to many, it seemed that artistes of mixed race or a darker race were being slighted again. Still, Billie is young and she did not deserve the amount of hate she got online for winning all four major awards.

Another thing that just did not work for me — Aerosmith and Run DMC’s performance. This was something I was looking forward to and it was rather disappointing. On the whole, however, other than Alicia Keys doing a splendid job of being a host and proving why we still need hosts, the performances were the highlight. Demi Lovato performed ‘Anyone’ for the first time since her overdose in 2018 — a performance that brought tears to everyone’s eyes.

Tyler the Creator burned the stage and took home the Best Rap Album award as well. Billie Eilish showed her haunting vocals as she performed a stripped-down ballad, ‘When We Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?’ and Ariana Grande showed us a medley of her hits from 2019. The late rapper Nipsey Hussle received two awards posthumously for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap/Song Performance. Lil Nas X also bagged two awards for Best Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/32cbak/article30692320.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31FRGRAMMY2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-at-the-grammys/article30692322.ece
270,2020/01/30,‘The Stringmasters’ meet again,"Instruments Intertwined: Musicians Jayanthi Kumaresh and Anil Srinivasan join hands for Aalaap’s upcoming edition of The Stringmasters. Seven years ago, vainika Jayanthi Kumaresh and pianist Anil Srinivasan took the stage together for the first time. What followed was what the artistes call magical, so magical that they’ve continued to collaborate on diverse platforms ever since.

“It was in London, I remember. The synergy we found between the veena and the piano was a revelation even to us. It was like old friends meeting after a longtime,” recalls Jayanthi.

Performing all over the globe, this weekend sees them in Bengaluru, exploring further uncharted territory in the show, The Stringmasters. The concept by Aalaap’s Akhila Krishnamurthy, it debuted in New Delhi and celebrates the ‘intertwining’ of the two instruments.

“Both musical systems lend itself to exploration, when it comes to notes and developing ideas. This is what coming together means,” Anil explains.

“Our instruments represent two classical systems of thought and artistry. As both are string instruments, they have a natural resonance for each other that we discovered almost by accident, resulting in our collaboration. This performance will go beyond structural definition, this performance,” says Anil.

It’s only natural, then, that the creative output is presented as a kutcheri. After all, the format is where both are most comfortable, allowing them to integrate at the deepest and most intuitive of levels in order to explore what they call the instruments’ ‘design.’

“Design is a tricky word, with multiple connotations. Here, we aim to break barriers and draw audiences out of their artistic comfort zones. They might question what an instrument like the veena will do alongside a piano?,” smiles Jayanthi.

Joined by Giridhar Udupa on the ghatam and Pramath Kiran on the tabla and morsing, The Stringmasters will possibly see the artistes engage with the audience through some of their favourite ragams – Kaapi, Kantaamani, and Chakravaham. The goal, however, is to showcase a myriad of emotions through the repertoire that evolves on stage.

“Planning a concert can often cause the presentation to become too contrived. Art, you see, is something that happens naturally. When Anil and I take the stage, we tend to let the music speak, allowing the instruments to express as they are,” points out Jayanthi.

Anil can’t agree more. “Hopefully, what the audience takes away is an integrated and holistic listening experience,” he adds.

“Artistes like Anil and Jayanthi are rooted in the classical and yet are constantly looking within their music to engage with audiences in a genre-neutral ambience. For audiences willing to foray into arts, they are the perfect place to start,” says Akhila.

The Stringmasters will be held on February 1 (6:30 p.m.) at the Jagriti Theatre, Bengaluru.

271,2020/01/30,Vittal Rangan explains the importance of ‘tristhayi’ exercise,"Of this artiste who had over 60 concerts in 40 days this past music season, Aruna Sairam says, “He is an excellent violinist and the music world has great expectations from him.”

Ranjani and Gayatri state, “He first played for us as a young boy and was self-assured even then. He catches on very quickly even with rarely heard ragas like Basant Bahar, Haricharan and Deepali and maintains the energy of the concert.”

Twenty-five-year-old B. Vittal Rangan has accompanied numerous artistes from R.K. Srikantan, T.V. Sankaranarayanan and Neela Ramgopal to Sanjay Subrahmanyan, S. Sowmya and many more. Growing up in Bengaluru, he began with the harmonium, at age six, reprising what his mother, Chitra Bilvam, sang, and playing in neighbourhood bhajan sessions. Chitra, a graded vocalist of All India Radio, Bangalore, was a student of T.M. Thiagarajan at the Thiruvaiyaru Music College. Even as a child, Vittal could identify several ragas. Chitra enrolled Vittal in 2002 with senior artiste R.R. Keshavamurthy for violin lessons. Keshavamurthy guided Vittal awhile until he reached kirtanais. He heard veteran violinist A. Kanyakumari at a concert then and was struck by her clarity and ease of playing. “These aspects continue to amaze me,” says Vittal.

He began to train under Kanyakumari in 2003, having classes whenever she visited Bangalore or he travelled to Chennai. There were differences in bowing and fingering techniques, particularly with gamakams. “It was a challenge to unlearn. I went to Chennai for two intense weeks of daily classes. This was a significant turning point.”

Sahitya reflection

Kanyakumari focused a lot on reflecting the sahitya of the composition accurately. She also initiated Vittal into manodharmam early on. He first attempted phrases of Mohanam under her guidance (after learning Bhavanuta), which Kanyakumari asked him to try and further develop. “She corrected errors and made suggestions, also alerting me to repetitive phrases,” he explains. For kalpanaswarams, to return to talam, Vittal suggests that learners practise many different endings of varying counts. The initial step is playing swarams without any karvais and coming back to the starting point.

He listened extensively to vocal recordings and paid attention to how stalwarts had accompanied . He performed his first solo at age 13. Vittal deftly sandwiched school between violin sessions during Grades 10-12 too, fitting in 3-4 hours of daily practice. He passed all his Chartered Accountancy examinations in the first attempt and has been employed since. “The articleship period was tough – however, I somehow managed to work, study, practise and perform.”

Vittal particularly stresses the importance of the ‘tristhayi’ exercise, traversing multiple octaves from mandara sthayi to athi tara sthayi as seamlessly as possible. He repeated this 300-400 times daily. “It covers all tensions of the strings, warms up fingers and the instrument too — every note is equally spaced and sruti shuddham emphasised.” Vittal continues to do this exercise as a warm-up prior to every concert.

“There is an involuntary absorption process when accompanying,” says Vittal who plays for artistes across a gamut of patantaras and banis. “Learning occurs unconsciously and ideas can strike impromptu.” He accompanies Guru Kanyakumari regularly. “Playing with her is intense learning every single time.” Vittal also received guidance from his cousins Vishaka Hari and S. Saketharaman.

He stresses the importance of breathing technique. “Slow, steady breaths in synchronization with what is being played is most helpful. It gets the mind calm and is particularly useful during raga alapanas.”

Violinists can face interesting, unexpected challenges. Vittal recollects the first time he played for vocalist Abhishek Raghuram who sang a Pallavi in Kalyani. “It took me a while to figure out what talam the Pallavi was in.” He paid attention to the placement of the words and its spacing and played accordingly. “It was actually Rupakam but put in a different way, perhaps to more appropriately reflect the gait of those lyrics. Even if the talam is unfamiliar or put differently, the violinist still has to respond instantaneously but there might not be enough time to figure out that complexity and do the necessary mental calculations.” In such situations for kalpanaswarams with korvai and kanakku, Vittal suggests violinists pay attention to the point at which the vocalist embarks on the kanakku, using that as a baseline.

“ Without transgressing the Carnatic idiom, Vittal conveys original ideas in ragas, expanding my own horizons,” summarises Ramakrishnan Murthy.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pxbli5/article30692144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31frVittalRangan-PCRajappaneRajujpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vittal-rangan-explains-the-importance-of-tristhayi-exercise/article30692145.ece
272,2020/01/30,Bhavan’s Pongal festival featured senior musicians,"The 25th year Pongal Music Festival of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore, was celebrated recently with a series of music concerts by eminent artistes. The festival package began with Dr. R. Ganesh’s recital. Endowed with a quicksilver voice that traverses across the octaves with ease, and steeped in patanthara, Ganesh presented his concert with fascinating variations while rendering the kritis.

‘Innum en manam ariyada,’ (Charukesi) with swaras was the first in his package, which was followed by ‘Ganapathiye Karunanidhiye’ (Kharaharapriya). His raga vinyasam of Kalyanavasantham for the kriti, ‘Sri Venkatesam Bhajami’ with prayogas of all possible phrases cleverly varying their pace gave a fantastic colour to the raga exercise. ‘Dinamanivamsa’ (Harikhambodi) with swaras breathed eternal fragrance. The Mohanam exercise for the kriti, ‘Raaraa Rajeeva lochana’ with strands of enchanting sancharas had all the qualities of a well-composed symphony.

Sreenivasa Rao’s seasoned violin play during the solo versions of the ragas and swaras were enjoyable. Ganesh(mridangam) and Sethuraman (ganjira) were in charge of the laya wing playing their roles with complete competence.

Palghat Ramprasad’s kutcheri on the following day brought forth his vidwat and his sense of proportion in displaying his musical wares. His brisk opening of the ‘Sarasooda’ varnam in Saveri and ‘Paripalayamaam’ (Ritigowla) followed with an enchanting niraval and swaras gave it an added glamour. Begada raga portrait for the kriti, ‘Kadaikkann vaithennai kaanavendaamo’ was expansive. ‘Naadupai’ (Madhyamavati) was elegant in execution and sung with appropriate phrasings and rounds of manodharma. Purvikalyani alapana for the kriti, ‘Meenakshi memudham’ was marked by an uninterrupted flow of mellifluity and perceptive brilliance. Sampath (violin) faithfully followed the vocalist in the raga versions and swara sallies. Ananthakrishnan (mridangam) and Sreejith (ghatam) handled the laya wing with élan and played a lilting tani.

Vasudha Ravi’s tranquil rendition equalled by her manodharma added finesse to her presentation on the following day. She began with the Saveri varnam in two speeds. ‘Gam Ganapathe’ (Hamsadhwan) with swaras were animated versions. Her raga portraits of Ganamurthi for the kriti, ‘Ganamurthe’ and lathangi for the kriti, ‘Marivere’ with ample lengthy karvais were an exquisite portrait of the ragas.

Her Brindavanasaranga raga alapana, punctuated by rich raga phrases were refined presentations. It was an amalgam of delicate cadences and her crafted sangathis encapsulated the raga essence for the kriti, ‘Soundararajam bhajeham’ with swaras carrying the requisite azhutham. Sampath (violin) adapted quickly to the variety offered by the vocalist in sangathis and swaras. Ramani (mridangam) and Sreejit (ghatam) provided wholesome support.

The beauty and grandeur of Carnatic music rest on sahithya, sangita and voice. Archana and Samanvi fulfilled expectations on all the three fronts. The duo flagged off their concert with ‘Vanajakshi’ Varnam in Behaag. Vocal balance with good gana naya formed the core of the following kriti, ‘Nandakumara Krishna’ (Darbar) with a lively exchange of swaras. Archana’s raga vinyasam of Vagadeeswari for the kriti, ‘Paramathmudu’ shared later by Samanvi was replete with sancharas. Their combined essay of Brindavana Saranga for the kriti, ‘Soundararajam aashraye’ with swaras was a melodic exploration containing all the nuances, which was proof enough of their potential. Their joint exploration of Sankarabharanam didi justice to the raga.

Vittal Rangan (violin) was at his best in the delineation of the ragas and swara repartees. Nikshit Puttur (mridangam) and Unnikrishnan (ghatam) with their spontaneous rhythmic beats presented a brilliant thani.

Aiswarya Vidhya Raghunath delightred the audience with her evocative voice, tonal quality and raga bhava on the final day of the Pongal Festival.

Her opening ‘Sivaloganathanaikkandu’ (Chenjurutti) bore testimony to her vidwat acquired over the years. ‘Veeranavarabrova’ (Kalyani) with niraval at ‘Syamakrishnasodari’ and swaras showed her consummate command over laya. Begada alapana for the kriti, ‘Kadaikkann vaiththennai’ from the base to the tara sthayi highlighted the scintillating allure of the raga in a variety of sancharas that traversed the scale up to the tara sthayi with ease. Her Kharaharapriya raga delineation for the kriti, ‘Chakkaniraja’ underscored by raga phrases brought out Aiswary’as musical artistry. In sum, her session was a demonstration of the lively facet of carnatic music.

Sreeramkumar’s (violin) supportive role gave impetus to the vocalist’s musical instinct and his solo versions glowed with sancharas. Arun Prakash (mridangam) embellished the kutcheri with his rhytmic beats.

Well-aligned to sruthi, young musicians Rethika Saravankumar, Sreejith Ravi, Sriranjani Ramkumar and students of the Department Of Carnatic Music, PSG Arts College, regaled the audience in the junior slot. They were supported by Sivaramakrishnan, Guruvayurappan and Ganeshan (violin) and K.Mani, M. Ramachandarn (mridangam) and Arumugham (morsing).

On the opening day students of the Bhavan’s School rendered the Pancharatna kritis of Tyagaraja.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bhavans-pongal-festival-featured-senior-musicians/article30692102.ece
273,2020/01/30,Ginni Mahi’s fresh take on Punjabi music,"Exuberant, bold and bright, she appears to be the quintessential college girl who breaks into giggles while sharing chirpy stories. Unassuming yet self-assured, Ginni Mahi is a young musician who has steadily garnered a massive fan following with her fresh approach to Punjabi music. Slated to perform at the Udaipur World Music Festival organised by Seher (7-9 February 2020), she believes in balancing an entertaining act with meaningful messages for the audience.

People’s music

“What is folk music after all?” Quips the 21-year old vocalist as she bounces back the question, “This music is about and by ordinary people, it is about their lives.” Mahi believes it is important to understand the audience, their pulse, lives, everyday challenges and what matters to them. “Folk music is an integral part of people’s experiences, you don’t need to be educated or to understand the details of music to enjoy this. It is the rhythm of daily life, it is the melody one would like to hum while cooking in the kitchen, the lyrics that capture people’s culture. That is the music I want to make,” she emphasises quietly.

Based in Jalandhar, Punjab, and presently pursuing post graduation in music, Mahi shot to fame with her songs “Fan Baba Sahib Di” and “Danger Chamar” that squarely placed the ideology of BR Ambedkar within a spunky rendition of Punjabi music. “Baba Sahib talks about equality for all, specially the Dalit community and women. It is because of him that many of us are educated and have the rights that we may not have had otherwise.”

Her music reflects on social oppression through a tangential tribute to Ambedkar. “I am a big fan of Baba Sahib, he is the architect of our constitution and he is my idol,” says the youngster, “and that is simply why and how the song (Fan Baba Sahib Di) came about.” In 2016, the song went viral. Blending devotional music with crossover genres, hip hop beats and a powerful voice, the song set the style for Mahi.

This was followed closely by her next composition, ‘Danger Chamar’. Sporting swag in a funky music video, the youngster emerged as a promising singing sensation. Working with a team that carefully marks out everything from the theme of the song to her wardrobe in the video, Mahi believes discussions are as important as the final song itself. “The two important things that we look at are — time and trend,” she explains. “We think together as a team, talk about what the audience wants to listen to, select the songs that writers have sent in, and how do we want to present this. The concept for the music video is also very important and it is collaborative work.”

Breaking into a chuckle, Mahi confesses to being a prankster on the sets. “It’s true, I am mischievous. I make fun of things, I can be quite goofy, I just like to have fun!” She says muffling her guffaw, “That’s why people I work with love me, but they also get annoyed by me sometimes. The bottomline is that music is serious work, but it must always be fun.”

Base notes

Mahi’s family has been her pillar of support. “It is not easy for a simple girl like me to perform on stage in front of thousands of people. There are so many restrictions for girls even today, but my family is open-minded and supportive.” She recalls the global media forum in Germany in 2018 where she was among the youngest speakers. “To break out of our constraints and into the world requires family support, motivation, and I am so thankful that my parents have stood by me and guide me with such courage.”

She would hum songs to herself as a child. Her father, Rakesh Chander Mahi, consulted a friend who suggested a music teacher. “I was 12 years old when I gave my first stage performance of Punjabi devotional music,” recalls Mahi. “I was super nervous, I think I made many mistakes, but people gave me a lot of affection.” Gradually, she started performing in singing competitions and became more pre-occupied with notes, melodies and rhythms. “I would wake up at 5 a.m. for practice, without any pressure or goading from anyone.” she says. Her day still starts with the early morning riyaaz session.

Future flight

“I want to become a playback singer in Hindi films,” says the youngster. Addicted to music, she listens to old songs. Rhapsodising about the legends she says, “There is nothing like the old melodies of Punjabi music, they are so rich, no wonder the remixes of those are still the biggest hits.” Talking about her upcoming gig at the Udaipur World Music Festival, she exclaims, “It is such a grand platform, I will perform what the audience wants. Punjabi music is about observing people, creating something they would enjoy and then having them dance to your music!”

Her eyes light up mischievously when asked about other hobbies, “Food, I love chatpata food – golgappe, garam jalebi, and in the winters hot gulab jamun! Why don’t you come over for some, we could binge together after my next show?” She says with the disarming charm of an artist rooted in homegrown aesthetics and set to fly into promising pastures.

The three-day multi-venue festival in Udaipur will feature 150 artists from over 20 countries in Udaipur.)",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/nro7qr/article30692063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Ginni-Mahi3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ginni-mahis-fresh-take-on-punjabi-music/article30692064.ece
274,2020/01/30,Tunes from the desert land,"Our recent travel to Jaisalmer in Rajasthan gave us an oportunity to enjoy the soothing tunes of a wind instrument called Algoja.

Algoja falls under the aerophone category that is performed in pairs. It is an end-blown flute performed by Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Kutchi, Gujarati and Baloch folk musicians. It is also known as Alghoze, Jorhi, Pawa Jorhi, Do Nali, Donal, Giraw, Satara, Nagoze or Mattiyan.

Performed by the shepherds in Rajasthan and Gujarat, Algoja is particularly played by the Meo community of Alwar and Langa community of Rajasthan. In Jaisalmer, it is played by the locals while rearing their cattle .

It is usually performed as an accompaniment to folk dance and tribal songs. But sometimes Algoja is performed as a solo instrument too.

An important instrument in Baloch folk music, Algoja is a perfect choice on occasions such as weddings in Sindh and its tunes are believed to have

a therapeutic effect.

A pair of woodwind instruments, Algoja consists of two beak flutes. Earlier both were of the same length, but over a period of time the length of one of the instruments has been shortened.

Played at the same time, the flutes are either tied together with a lengthy cord or held together loosely in hands. And the pitch can be adjusted by applying beeswax.

There are two methods of playing the instrument — one in which both the flutes are used for playing a tune while in the other, one is used for melody and the other, to play the drone. And the holes in the instrument are arranged accordingly.

The number of holes in the flutes may vary. Sometimes it is five finger holes and a fipple on each flute or one flute can have 6-7 holes to play the melody while the other flute has the hole drilled in such a way that it can render only the drone. As both the flutes are designed to play the melody portions, they have an identical arrangement of holes.

It is difficult to master the instrument and one needs to have extreme breath control and practice.

Apart from the breathing technique one should be adept at the playing technique as well.

Researchers mention that Algoja has a rich history. They are of the opinion that the instrument originated in the Middle East passing through Iran and Turkey, before reaching Balochistan, Rajasthan and Sindh.

The performers rue that there are not much takers and that they do not earn enough for a decent living. Many of them have taken up different occupations, while some still continue to perform with an aim to keep the art form alive. Due to its limited scope, there are not many performers now and not many to teach interested youngsters. As it is difficult to get the instrument, performers make their own Algoja.

Despite the diminishing popularity among the folk community, the use of the instrument in a recent car commercial augurs well for its future. Hope more musicians take to it to keep this folk musical heritage alive.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/x492bo/article30692031.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/fr31Algoja2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tunes-from-the-desert-land/article30692032.ece
275,2020/01/30,Adherence to tradition marked Tyagaraja Aradhana in Coimbatore,"Music buffs were in for a rich aural treat at the 66th year celebration of Tyagabrahma Gananjali that took place at Kikani Vidya Mandir, Coimbatore. Concerts of eminent artistes were featured as part of the celebration.

Ramakrishnan Murthy’s musical wisdom was evident throughout the concert. Setting the tone of his kutcheri with ‘Sadguruswamiki’ (Ritigowla), ‘Nannu kannatalli’ (Kesari), which followed with swaras was a wholesome rendition. The latter reflected the bard’s fervent plea to Dharmambika to get him out of this life’s rut.

‘Entha vedukondu’ (Saraswathimanohari) with swaras sung in high and low ranges with ease gave the listeners a glimpse of his vision. ‘Eti janma’ in Varali was an esoteric version. His Khambodi version for the kriti, ‘Sree Raghuvamsaprameya maamava’ was a fine mix of his saadhakam and vidwat. Vittal Rangan’s (violin) essays were like a journey through a picturesque landscape either in raga essays or swara repartees creating a serene mood. Bharadwaj (mridangam) and Athreya (ganjira) embellished the session with exuberance and subtlety.

Impeccable rendition

Vijay Siva’s scholarly session was a fine blend of his sampradaya discipline in raga expositions and emphasis. ‘Nennarunchara’ (Malavi) with swaras set the tone of the kutcheri. His raga portraits of Hamirkalyani, for the kriti, ‘Abhimanamuleda’ and Manirangu for ‘Raanidhiradu’ were embellished with imaginative phrasings in a tone of intense devotion.

The raga alapana of Sankarabharanam for the kriti, ‘Etudanilachite’ was marked by picturesque prayogas and karvais softened by melodic graces.

The more he delved deep into the raga the more nuggets he brought out to enhance Shankara. Chandramouli’s sound playing of the solo versions and swaras was a crisp combination of the sensitivity and style of the framework of the ragas. K.V. Prasad (mridangam) and Krishna (ghatam) served their roles with complete competency including an exuberant thani.

Well-crafted sangatis

Sankari Krishnan’s resonant voice and zestful raga bhava coupled with her confidence and swanubhavam were received with wide acclaim.

The opening ‘Maakelera’ (Ravichandrika) with swaras setting the tone of the session was followed by a beautiful Pantuvarali raga format for the kriti, ‘Naradamuni’ with an amalgam of delicate cadences and well-crafted sangathis bringing out the essence of the raga. The Madhyamavathi raga vinyasam with long karvais was an exquisite portrait of the raga for the kriti, ‘Devasri thapastheertha pura nivasa,’ rendered with gusto. Kharaharapriya portrait for the kriti, ‘Chakkaniraja’ with evocative phrases was an impressive presentation with an exciting niraval. Ranjani’s (violin) support was wholesome in raga alapanas and swara repartees.

Manoj Siva (mridangam) and Subramaniam (ganjira) lent distinctive laya support with flashing patterns embellishing the songs.

The banding of Vittal Ramamurthy (violin) and V.V.S. Murari (viola) on the following day was noteworthy not only for unfolding the richness of ragas but also for their rendition and choice of songs shorn of frills. ‘Meru samana’ (Mayamalavagowla) with swara exchanges between the artistes was a grand display of classicism. ‘Entharo’ in Sree ragam with swaras was an inspiring presentation. Their raga alapana of Abheri for the kriti, ‘Nagumomu’ gave a succinct picture of the raga and the song itself was an evocative version. The songs played blended with the total harmony of the musical sounds of the viola and the violin. The other items on their agenda included ‘Bantureethi’ (Hamsanadham), ‘Syama sundara ranga’ and ‘Gaanamurthe.’ The laya beats by Mali (mridangam) and Suresh (ghatam) were equally enjoyable as there was total harmony in the rhythm that they played.

Scholarly interpreations

Ashwath Narayanan, disciple of P.S. Narayanaswami, has all the ingredients of an accomplished singer. His commitment to the core of Carnatic music with his heightened ability to consciously tap his manodharma linked to an obedient voice was the hallmark of the final day’s concert.

His opening ‘Enthanerchina’ (Suddhadhanyasi) was a heart-warming rendition paving the way for a scholarly interpretation of ‘Sri Raghukula’ in Hamsadhwani with swaras. His delivery of ‘Sree Rama Jayarama’ and ‘Kalalanerchina’ (Dheepakam) were soaked in divine ecstasy. Kiravani raga portrait for the kriti, ‘Kaligiyunte’ with karvais and intrinsically braided passages brought out the musician’s potential.

Rahul (violin) responded with fluid ease in the melodic segments during his solo versions and swara sallies. The percussion support of Sumesh Narayanan (mridangam) and Alathur Ganesh (ganjira) in the laya wing was of a high order that included a lilting and an exuberant thani.

276,2020/01/30,Kochi’s maker of mridangams - Shiju Sebastian,"The heavier a mridangam is, the better it sounds says mridangam-maker Shiju Sebastian. It took him around 10 years to learn the trade, which he started learning as an 18 year-old. He has been practising the trade for a decade now. “My father and his father before that have all been in the same trade. I learnt it from my father’s brother,” the 38 year-old says.

Each mridangam is hand-made, the only ‘machines’ used, he jokes, are the pair of pliers and hook. His workspace on the first floor of his house in Mamangalam, in Kochi, is strewn with the percussion instruments. He repairs tablas as well. Each in a different stage of either repair or in the process of being manufactured.

There is no one size fits all for these: each instrument is personalised based on the specifications of the mridangist — on the kind of sound he prefers. Although Shiju has assistants to help him with the making of each, the ‘finishing’ — tuning of the instrument — is by him. “This is the most important aspect of making the instrument, this or any. After all, finally it is about how it sounds.” He has learnt the instrument so it helps him tune it and set the shruti (pitch).

His family is among the very few in the city which work with the instrument. He says there are a couple of others in the city, not his family, who are also in the trade.

He sources raw material — wood and leather — from Chennai, Kottayam and Varanasi. The ideal wood for the purpose is either of jackfruit or cassia fistula (kanni konna), the heavier the better. A mridangam can weigh anywhere between five to 15 kilos, dependent on the weight of the wood and can cost around ₹9,000 - ₹20,000. There are lighter mridangams too, made of fibre. “Those are for those who travel, it is lighter on the wallet as well. Imagine paying for excess baggage!” he says. A single instruments takes up to week’s work, from shaping it to tuning it.

The leather used is also chosen carefully; it is chosen based, again, on client specifications. “It depends on its thickness, there is no textbook or guide to picking the ‘ideal’ piece. One, literally, goes by touch. Softer the skin, the naadam (sound) will be higher, he says.

Shiju doesn’t know how his family came to this trade, all he knows is that he is the fourth generation craftsman and also that faith has nothing to do with it. “It is about music, that doesn’t come into this at all. Some musicians, based on their beliefs, perform pujas and take the instrument to temples. Then there are those who, when they buy their first mridangam give me a dakshina (offering of beetle leaf and nut).”

Since he learnt the mridangam hasn’t he wanted to play the instrument professionally? Shiju laughs and says, “Not really, I didn’t have the time since I was busy working with mridangams. I like doing this.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/hbdff1/article30691250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPSHIJU3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/kochis-maker-of-mridangams-shiju-sebastian/article30691251.ece
277,2020/01/30,Sanah Moidutty sings for Malayalam film,"Singer Sanah Moidutty has recorded her first Malayalam playback song for the film Varayan. She says the song was a chance she had been looking forward to. Although there had been offers and talks about collaborations for Malayalam projects, over social media, nothing materialised until now. She landed the song as her name was suggested to the makers of the film by Satyam Audios which is involved in the film. “I do my covers in Mumbai. I don’t have a network in Kerala. I am being noticed, and am speaking to composers. It seems to be positive,” she says over phone from Mumbai. “And I definitely want to do more films in Malayalam.”

Sanah who has made a name for herself, among the Malayali audience, for singing covers of Malayalam songs. She has also sung for Hindi films and for composers such as AR Rahman and Vishal & Shekhar and films such as 24 and Meri Pyaari Bindu and numerous stage shows.

The singer who decided on a career in music out of love for it, had no idea how or where it would take her but she has done well for herself gradually working her way up. Besides Hindi and Malayalam, she has sung in Marathi, Tamil, Bengali, Punjabi, and Telugu among other Indian languages. She has finished recording the song, which she says was a good experience.

“The music is by Prakash Alex, I am lucky to have got this break; the arrangements and the lyrics are good. I hope the audience likes it,” she says. Fluency, while singing, was not a problem for the Mumbai-bred Malayali. “Singing is not like speaking, fluency is not an issue there.”

Sanah sees this opportunity as an opening to the entire film industry in the south. “I have noticed that for my songs – Malayalam and Tamil – Malayalis like the Tamil songs a lot and vice versa. There is a connection between the two and I am looking forward to it leading to something.” The process of singing covers and originals, she says, is very different. The former is more independent as opposed to the latter which has many inputs.

Her plans for the year include making more covers; she confesses she is not as prolific as she would like to be.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/pwm988/article30690246.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpsanahjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-singer-makes-her-malayalam-film-debut-in-varayan/article30690247.ece
278,2020/01/30,CAA protests find the support of Chennai's rappers,"Arivu, the rapper, is on a high.

His latest track, ‘Sanda Seivom’, raked up over 11,000 Instagram TV views in six days. On YouTube, the song has been viewed over 53,000 times since its release on January 14.

The song, which expresses solidarity with nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), also evokes the principles of unity and rationality combined with the spirit of Tamil pride. “I first performed it at a protest in Chepauk, the day after I had written it. A lot of local musicians and artists were present, and I sung it to the beats of the parai. Only much later did I decide to turn it into a rap [song],” says the musician, who has also composed songs for the Tamil film industry, as part of The Casteless Collective.

Mind matters

In the nationwide context, Arivu is not alone. Protests that have extended for days in various cities are attracting spirited indie artistes like moths to flames — like Shahroz Ahmad in Delhi and Ronny Sen in Kolkata. While many among them exude pure defiance, or even anger, in their compositions, others are taking the Arivu route — lyrics with heightened socio-political awareness and historical context set to a beat that is very raw. Because what good is protest music if it does not keep you moving and motivated?

Arivu

In Chennai, however, the situation has been a little different. Protesters are having a tough time finding space where they are allowed to protest peacefully. Nevertheless, music has still managed to hit the streets, mainly via the city’s determined hiphop community.

“We are not social rappers. We are just rappers. We rap about social issues only if it really hits us, if it makes us feel something. And this issue definitely made us feel,” says Vaughn Pinto, one of the two rappers of the one-year-old hiphop crew Voltage B.

The crew, which includes three beatboxers, recently found itself at the forefront of dissent in Anna Nagar Tower Park. They put together Chennai’s edition of the All India Human Rights Cypher, an initiative which brought together musical talents in 11 different cities to sing their way to protest. “It was originally supposed to happen in 15 cities, but a few had to drop out because of political tensions, police issues and scared families. That, more than anything, spurred us to go ahead with this,” adds Vaughn.

So on a Sunday afternoon earlier this month, Anna Nagar Tower Park saw a gathering of what Vaughn describes as “Chennai’s entire underground hiphop community, as well as beatboxers and breakers [break dancers].” Those present included rappers like Sam Dot, Devoid, Rapbot VK, YashX, Asal Kolaar and Jackie Ranka, besides other artistes like the Underdogz, Dudez in Madras, PEACE Hip Hop and FWPT.

The music included not only songs of dissent written long before the CAA issue came up, but also compositions tailored particularly to the current political scenario. “A social activist also brought in experts who gave us some education about the Act. Everyone was welcome, including people supporting CAA. We were open for debate,” says Vaughn.

For Varun Kumar aka Rapbot VK, an event like that is simply par for the course. “My genre is protest poetry,” says the rapper, who has lived in Chennai for over a year, and brings out music in Hindi. For instance, one of his songs called ‘Aatmahatya’ was about the suicide rate, especially student suicides. Varun points out that Kashmir, the economy and poverty were also brought up at the event in addition to CAA. “I performed my original ‘Bazaar’ that I had released last year. I also performed a song I had written a day before the event. It talks about the problems that the Government could have been focusing on instead of this, like the economy and corruption,” he adds.

It is a number that he also performed at an open mic a week ago at Goddy’s in Nungambakkam. This was a different event from that at Anna Nagar: not all the performances were contentious and each piece was rehearsed and deliberate, as against the spontaneous spitfire of four to eight lines that spilled into each other back at the cypher.

“It doesn’t matter,” says Varun, adding, “What matters is how far your message reaches.”",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/tgdmfc/article30689926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ARR9801-1-01-01,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/chennais-hiphop-musicians-and-their-songs-of-dissent/article30689932.ece

284,2020/01/30,Prof. Joseph is a picture of quiet determination,"When he describes what a group did to him 10 years ago, chopping off his right hand, there is no despondency in his voice or fear in his demeanour.

The immediate impression that Prof. T.J. Joseph gives is that of a man of quiet determination. The listener is carried away by the fact that 10 years down the line, his attackers have failed, and Prof. Joseph has overcome great adversity, setting an example for all of the triumph of human will.

Prof. Joseph, now retired from Newman’s College, Thodupuzha, was in Kochi on Wednesday to introduce his recently released autobiography Attupokatha Ormakal (Memories that cannot be chopped off). The title does not hide anything. It is a graphic description of what happened to him. The book describes the central scene of action in blood-curdling detail with all the smoke, blood and cries of despair.

Prof. Joseph was attacked and maimed in July 2010 by a group which felt that he had offended Muslim religious sentiments while setting a question paper. The book, he said, was meant to make his stand clear on the issues involved. He felt he was still being misunderstood by some. As a teacher, he had set a question paper, which caused misunderstanding, leading to all that followed.

He said he had written the book with his left hand, and that it took him some time to practise writing. But it was done in good time. He has recovered from the attack, but after battling both official antagonism and great physical pain.

285,2020/01/30,"Fishers welcome fair price, but call for clarity on policies","Fishers have welcomed the promise in the Governor’s policy address on Wednesday that the Government will take steps to ensure fair price for fish catch but have called for clarity on fisheries policy issues.

The Governor’s address in the Assembly stopped short of calling fishers to be all things to all men, but unions came out against a lack of clarity between “practices and promises”.

There is a gap between the official Government stand that there was not enough space for more fishing craft in the State and the promise to finance fresh gear and craft, said V.D. Majeendran of Swathanthra Matsya Thozhilali Union. He added that the issues needed to be discussed in the open so that all parties concerned could express their views.

Charles George of Matsya Thozhilali Aikya Vedhi said while the Government had ruled that marine fisheries sustainability would be affected seriously by the addition of more craft, there is the Governor’s statement promising money for new craft and gear. “These issues should be clarified,” he said.

The Governor praised fishers citing social media posts during the August 2018 floods in the State. “My Government proposes to make fishermen owners of their crafts and gears by providing interest-free loans to the Joint Liability Groups [JLG] of fishermen for acquiring the desired crafts and gears,” the Governor said. He went on to add that the interest accruing on the principal would be borne by the Government on condition that the JLGs thus formed would repay the loans without default.

The Governor also underscored the Government’s decision to enact a law for enabling availability of quality fish to consumers to encourage the sale of fish in hygienic conditions and to enable fishermen to get a fair price for their catch.

The Government must strengthen the cooperative sector to help fishermen get better price for their catch, Mr. Charles said, pointing out that the apex cooperative, Matsyafed, should play a bigger role in the issue.

The Government also plans to offer modern technical training to all fisheries stakeholders to equip them to undertake innovative projects in a timely manner, the Governor said.

He also announced the expansion of the Suchitwa Sagaram project involving fishermen at Neendakara for removal of plastic waste from the sea. It will now be expanded to include Munambam, Beypore and Puthiyappa harbours.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/fishers-welcome-fair-price-but-call-for-clarity-on-policies/article30687904.ece
286,2020/01/30,Civic body faulted for not taking steps to arrest pollution,"The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) has issued a letter to the Maradu Municipality, stating that the civic body is yet to take earnest steps towards checking dust and sound pollution at the apartment demolition sites in accordance with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016.

The modifications suggested by the board towards control of dust and sound pollution are not complied with, said the communication issued to the Municipal Secretary. It is in violation of the relevant provisions of the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016.

Surveillance teams at the PCB’s regional office in Ernakulam had visited the sites on January 25 to ensure whether the civic body had complied with the directives issued on January 13 and 17 satisfactorily. “But it is regretted to note that you have not taken any earnest steps towards providing sufficient control measures as stipulated in Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules,” said the letter issued by the board on Tuesday.

Lorries carrying steel rods from the blast sites were seen on access roads, where no vetting of surface areas was carried out as per inspections conducted by the board. Local residents had also complained about pollution caused by the transportation of debris by lorries during night hours, it added.

On authorising the private agency entrusted with debris removal, board officials said they had inspected a site at Kumbalam, and that it was found satisfactory. The company plans to set up a crusher at the site to process concrete debris. The land is spread around two acres. Waste that cannot be recycled will be used for basement filling. The final authorisation on the Kumbalam site will be issued by the PCB head office in Thiruvananthapuram, they added.

Meanwhile, Maradu Municipal Chairperson T.H.

287,2020/01/30,Flyover stalemate casts shadow over traffic on bypass,"Even as PWD officials have exuded confidence in completing work on the six-lane flyovers at Vyttila and Kundannoor latest by April, attention has shifted to Palarivattom, where vehicles have to jostle for space to cross the junction. The four-lane flyover at the junction has been out of bounds for vehicles since May 2019 after it developed cracks beyond permissible limits.

Apprehensions are rife that the traffic bottleneck at Palarivattom will become acute owing to the additional inflow of private vehicles into the bypass once the two flyovers are opened. It will severely choke movement of all vehicles, including inter-State and inter-district services, along the NH Bypass.

Official sources said half the work to rehabilitate the girders of the ‘damaged’ flyover could have been completed by now but for stakeholders challenging the rehabilitation work in the High Court of Kerala. Part demolition of the flyover and rebuilding work were to begin on October 1, 2019 and get over by July 2020. However, with nothing happening in the past four months, the Government is in a fix, they added.

They wondered why the previous UDF Government excluded the project to widen 400 metres on Civil Line Road, located on either side of the Palarivattom Bypass Junction, although it was part of the flyover project.

On its part, neither the PWD nor the State Government has initiated steps to develop alternative corridors like Thammanam-Pullepady Road which lies south of Palarivattom. Vehicles can reach the city and return without waiting on end at Palarivattom through the road. Neither has Pipeline Road located north of Palarivattom been developed and tar-coated for use by cars and smaller vehicles. The road linking Vennala with Seaport-Airport Road is in bad condition after being trenched for laying cables.

In the meantime, PWD officials said work on the Vyttila flyover’s approach portion on the Aroor side was almost complete. Painting has begun, while tarring will start in a month. Work on the slip road, followed by the construction of ‘touch piles’ to build a retention wall will get over shortly on the Palarivattom side. Similar work has begun on the Aroor side of the Kundannoor flyover.

The sources added that the two contracting firms were trying their best to complete the flyovers by the end of March. The deadline for the Vyttila flyover had expired in May 2019, while the Kundannoor flyover is expected to adhere to its March 2020 deadline.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/peoeax/article30687867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30-KI-PALARIVATTOM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/flyover-stalemate-casts-shadow-over-traffic-on-bypass/article30687868.ece
288,2020/01/30,Plastic ban: many buyers yet to toe the line,"The number of customers carrying cloth bags while on shopping has not picked up as expected despite the ban on single-use plastic, according to traders.

“If we take 10 persons, only two or three bring cloth bags as an alternative to plastic carry bags. The rest either buy cloth bags kept for sale or ask us to wrap the products using newspaper,” said a shop owner at Edappally.

Traders said that it might take some more time for people to get accustomed to the fact that single-use plastic could not be used. “They still ask for plastic carry bags. We have now pasted stickers saying that single-use plastic carry bags are prohibited. The price range of cloth bags and reusable carry bags are displayed,” said a manager of a retail chain at Edappally.

However, enforcement agencies pointed out that there was an increasing awareness among traders not to sell or use single-use plastic. “We had not acted stringently against violators as the Government had initially given a relaxation upto January 15. But many shop owners are now seen informing customers that they have to either buy cloth bags or carry it with them in view of the ban on single-use plastic bags,” they said.

Owners of vegetable and meat stalls continue to provide single-use plastic covers to users fearing that they may lose business. “The customer, who still asks us for plastic covers, may not come to us again once we say no to single-use plastic. So the authorities should either come up with reasonably-priced eco-friendly alternatives instead of plastic bags,” said a vegetable vendor at Aluva.

The ban, imposed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, disallows manufacture, storage, marketing and use of single-use plastic products. No trader is authorised to sell them in markets.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/plastic-ban-many-buyers-yet-to-toe-the-line/article30687866.ece
289,2020/01/30,Non-woven bags stand in the way of plastic ban,"A spike in the use of non-woven bags made of polypropylene fabric and sold under the tag of ‘cloth bags’ in Ernakulam seems to have hit efforts to shift to eco-friendly carrybags following the ban on single-use plastic products.

Several shops in the district continue to sell non-woven bags as cloth bags despite the ban. The situation has forced the Government to conduct a campaign to drive home the message that non-woven bags cannot be used as an alternative to plastic bags.

According to the Plastic Waste Management Rules - 2016, polypropylene figures under the category of plastic. An order issued by the Environment Department dated December 27, 2019 pointed out that a fine of ₹10,000 would be charged for use of polypropylene bags for the first time followed by penalty of ₹25,000 and ₹50,000 for subsequent uses of the banned item.

“Many shop owners and consumers in the district were found using non-woven bags as a replacement for single-use plastic. Bags made of polypropylene fibre cannot be recycled and are harmful to the environment,” said Sujith Karun, district co-ordinator, Haritha Keralam Misison.

Representatives of the mission said there was a lack of awareness among users about non-woven bags made of polypropylene fabric. It is made using spun and bond polypropylene fibre, and it is soft and air-permeable. Non-woven bags are made of non-biodegradable plastic. They are prepared on a machine by spreading rolls of plastic.

Non-woven bags became popular after manufacturers made thousands of such bags after the Government announced the ban on single-use plastic from January 1. In fact, the manufacturers were cashing in on the increasing demand for cloth bags following the ban.

Traders also stocked non-woven bags under the impression that they came under the category of cloth bags. Shop owners had no option but to sell them to consumers who asked for carrybags. “They are also cheaper than original cloth bags which are sold in the range of ₹6 and upwards. A non-woven bag made of polypropylene is priced less than ₹1,” said officials of the Environment Department.

290,2020/01/30,26 buildings get solar panels under Smart Cities mission,"As many as 26 public buildings in the city have been fitted with solar panels under the Smart Cities mission.

Once commissioned, the project could lower public spending on electricity and reduce carbon emissions from energy production by around three tonnes per day, when compared to emissions from thermal power generation.

The panels have been installed on 21 buildings of the Kochi Corporation and five Government buildings. They include the corporation office, town hall, fire station at Gandhinagar, Ernakulam General Hospital, old age home at Thevara, Government Girls’ High School, Edakochi, Government Higher Secondary School, and Maharaja’s College. The panels on top of the town hall have the highest generation capacity of 80 kilowatts (kW), followed by the General Hospital which can now generate up to 70 kW. Altogether, the panels can generate around 3,000 units or 1000kW daily, provided the skies are clear. Production of one unit of thermal power can release an estimated 1 kg of carbon dioxide, according to officials of Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML).

So far, the project, totally worth ₹5.7 crore, has been commissioned only at the fire station and the General Hospital, officials said. The panels had all been installed by September last year but are still awaiting clearances from the Electrical Inspectorate. “All sites generating solar power over 10kW require the inspectorate’s clearance. The panels have been installed on several old government buildings where the existing electrical systems were weak. Additional systems had to be installed to connect the buildings to the solar panels, and there was a lag in getting clearances,” CSML officials said.

After approval from the inspectorate, some buildings are awaiting inspection and approval from the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB).

The panels with a capacity of 40kW at the fire station were commissioned in August last year. “The fire station was generating a monthly electricity bill of around ₹25,000. In the past few months, that amount has come down to zero. The power generated exceeds its demand, and the surplus is exported to the grid,” a CSML official said.

CSML hopes to commission the panels on all sites by March. The solar panel project is one of the few projects that CSML has managed to complete at least to a degree since the special purpose vehicle’s inception in 2016.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/brhop4/article30687847.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30KI-Solarcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/26-buildings-get-solar-panels-under-smart-cities-mission/article30687848.ece
291,2020/01/30,Agro processing plant to have its own bottle-making unit,"The Nadukkara agro processing plant near Muvattupuzha, engaged in pineapple processing, will soon have its own plastic bottle-making unit as part of efforts being made by the management to improve the profitability of the unit.

The unit is likely to be established by the end of February, with ₹4.5 crore being set apart from Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana funds, company sources said.

They added that the bottle-making plant, now being assembled, would have the capacity to manufacture 90 bottles per minute. The facility will be utilised to produce bottles to package the JIVE brand of fruit drinks. Work for other companies requiring plastic bottles will also be taken up at the unit, sources said.

Eldho Abraham, MLA, who is also a board member, said the Government was making efforts to turn around the unit, and the bottle-making unit is part of the programme.

He added that efforts were also being made to make available working capital for the company to augment its operations. The financial obligations of the Nadukkara plant to the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam have been addressed, and it will now be possible to leverage the fruit processing company’s landholding to make working capital available.

Replacing old machinery is another area the management is focusing on to enhance the operations of the fruit processing unit, the MLA said. It is estimated that around ₹10 crore may be needed to replace old machinery.

Meanwhile, there is a proposal to return the company to farmers on a 70:30 basis with the Government holding a smaller share. A senior Government official has been entrusted with the task of looking at the proposal, and once the recommendation is received, it will go to the State Cabinet for approval, Mr. Abraham added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/agro-processing-plant-to-have-its-own-bottle-making-unit/article30687820.ece

293,2020/01/30,A psychological thriller,"‘Yamuna,’ a 90-minute solo act was an English play, served in an Indian way. The context was Indian but importantly, the delivery of the monologue had a natural, conversational style, much like “I will speak in English since you prefer it.” Interestingly this is script-writer-director Vedarun Rajkumar’s first full-length play in English, the others having been in Tamil. The dramatisation included the mono-acting technique, which is predominantly used in Indian classical dance.

‘Yamuna’ is about a young woman’s journey, about abusive relationships and the guilt high achievers carry with them. Yamuna is a Math prodigy and a talented Bharatanatyam dancer, who is obsessed with symmetry in science, art and beyond. Having grown up in Chidambaram, she is attached to the temple deity, Nataraja. She has a childhood friend Natraj, who seems to dominate her memories of childhood and growing years. The friendship grows into a teen romance and her dependence on him increases. A tragedy changes her life forever — her father dies on her 18th birthday. Her mother turns on her — accusing her of being a curse to the family, of ‘eating up her twin in the womb...’ etc. Natraj leaves town for college, his selfish, insecure personality already palpable.

Complex problem

Yamuna cuts all ties and leaves town, starting a new life teaching dance and studying mathematics, while financially supporting her mother. Six years pass and Natraj re-enters her life. Old flame still flickering, she agrees to be the ‘face’ for his business since he cannot afford a celebrity. They marry and are happy, until Natraj’s business crashes. Yamuna’s guilt compels her to stick with him, and to help him, no matter his behaviour, until ultimately she snaps out of it, when she finds the solution to a complex mathematical problem in her dream.

Vedarun’s script alternated between the emotionally intense autobiography, information about mathematicians like Galois, Mathematical theories, the allusions to symmetry in dance, in life, and periodic philosophical interjections.

Figuring out the devil was his favourite, sample this: ‘Devil they say is in the details, what an obnoxious phrase. God, girls, is in the details. Devil built his palace of mediocrity in the absence of detail. Devil savours lethargy... ’ There were more references to the devil along the way, but Yamuna concluded the play with her final, ‘The devil is not in the details, the bloody devil is in believing your own lies.’

The language was dramatic — while teaching Nataraja’s Ananda Tandava in class Yamuna says, ‘No matter what fire consumes your heart right now or what flames burn your soul at this moment, focus only on the pleasant smile on his face…’ Vedarun’s script also teased the viewer about Natraj — was it the friend/ husband or the deity Yamuna was referring to? There were also lines that could physically hurt you — picture Yamuna's mother hysterically weeping one moment, and in the next, as a voice over, she turns to Yamuna saying, ‘Happy Birthday Yamuna... you are a curse…’ The under currents were powerful.

Preethi Bharadwaj as the naïve, hopelessly romantic Yamuna carried this layered, complex script with agility, perfect articulation and intensity. She was dressed in a plain black kurta-churidar and was de-glamourised to the point of wearing spectacles. The rest of the stage was in black as well. Minimal props, subdued mood lighting (Gowtham) and sensitive live keyboard accompaniment (Bhadri Narayan) tiptoed around the emotional upheavals as though stepping on eggshells. Creatives were by Akila Venkat and Rohit Bhasi. Yamuna was a psychological thriller with a happy ending.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/hf9ltp/article30692755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31FRYAMUNA1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a-psychological-thriller/article30692757.ece
294,2020/01/30,Nanjil Nalini’s lifelong commitment to acting,"The news of her mother’s demise did not stop Revathi from completing the schedule her troupe had committed to. Much in agony, she enacted her role in the play ‘Ponniyin Selvan’ at the Corporation Kalai Arangam in Coimbatore, before leaving for Chennai, where her mother Nanjil Nalini, renowned theatre and film artiste, passed away. She politely but firmly brushed aside the suggestion to leave immediately. Prakash Kutti, producer of the play, at once started looking for flight bookings, offering to even cancel the show. But Revathi was determined. She appeared in both back-to-back shows that afternoon before leaving for Chennai.

“I wondered what my mother would have done in these circumstances. She would have definitely finished her assignment, whatever the situation. Such was her passion,” says Revathi. “It was a commitment and she wouldn’t want to disappoint the audience,” she adds.

“It is a huge blow to me because I have never been separated from my mother. She was one of the finest actors on stage and cinema besides being an excellent dubbing artiste. Recently, she came back to stage — after 20 years — to act in the play ‘Karnan.’ We were planning to celebrate her turning 75 but fate had other plans,” expands Revathi.

Born in Thakkalai in 1944, Nalini started acting at the age of 13 and continued till her last breath. She acted in number of drama troupes, including Vairava Nadaga Sabha, S.S. Rajendran, T.K. Shanmugam (TKS) and ‘Major’ Sundararajan. She later started Revathi Fine Arts in her daughter’s name. She made her silver screen debut in ‘Enga Oor Raja.’ The association continued with Annai Abirami, Thanga Pathakam and many more. She acted with Rajinikanth in Dharma Yudham, Kamal Haasan in Aadu Puli Aattam and Sathyaraj in Rickshaw Maama. She has acted in more than 100 films and on stage remains as one of the actors who have crossed thousands of performances on stage.

From the State Government’s Kalaimamani, which she received from the then Chief Minister MGR, in the presence Governor Prabhudas Patwari, she bagged all the awards named after some of the stalwarts of Tamil cinema, Aringar Anna award, Sivaji Ganesan, Kalaignar, Selvi Jayalalithaa and AVM awards to name a few. ‘Mandhira Vasal,’ ‘Azhagi,’ ‘Krishnadasi,’ ‘Valli,’ and ‘Soolam’ are some of the TV serials in which she played major roles.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/1my3md/article30691944.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31frNanjilNalinijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/nanjil-nalinis-lifelong-commitment-to-acting/article30691945.ece
295,2020/01/30,"We are not just a nation, but a great civilisation: Feroz Abbas Khan","Talking to Feroz Abbas Khan gives you hope. A promise that darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can. After a hugely successful run of “Mughal-e-Azam”, the master theatre practitioner has adapted yet another tragic tale of love. This time he has found inspiration in Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet”. Called “Raunaq & Jassi”, after a couple of preview shows in Mumbai, the musical will have its Delhi première in February end. Starring Neha Sargam, Omkar Patil, Mahendra Singh and Sonal Jha in lead roles, the play has been adapted by noted playwright Iqbal Raj.

Over the years, the master theatre practitioner has given us many socially relevant plays such as “Tumhari Amrita”, “Saalgirah”, “Agent Ramlal” and “Gandhi Virrudh Gandhi”. When he turned to a Broadway-like musical “Mughal-e Azam” in 2016, one wondered whether we had lost one more artist to the market forces. But belying most reservations, Khan managed to keep a socially conscious heart throbbing beneath the grand sets and Manish Malhotra-designed costumes.

Here again, in times of Romeo squads, he promises to see the Bard’s tale with Jassi’s point of view. “This is a conscious effort because this century belongs to women. Traditionally, only men have had the choice to choose and reject. The onus of nurturing a relationship always fell on women. Of course, there is parity when it comes to passion and negotiation but Jassi is not chained by the so-called maryada and demands choice in love,” says Khan.

Edited excerpts:

You seem to have found a formula for reinventing the classics!

I do not have a formula nor do I desire one. I have many questions and I am trying to find answers to them in stories that have endured time and transcended space. A familiar classic is a huge excitement and challenge, which drove me to “Mughal-e-Azam” and now “Romeo and Juliet”.

Why have you set it in Punjab? Is there a personal association or the fact that it is the land of many tragic love stories that made it a fertile ground for exploring a classic…

Yes, .the land of Punjab resonates with so many love stories and you can smell the earth, hear the sounds of poetry and music and intimately relate to the lovers... I suppose the popular culture has bombarded us with these stories so often that you now have a familiar relationship with them.

Tell us about your association with Shakespeare in general and “Romeo and Juliet” in particular. What is in it that keeps it fresh for adaptation?

My favourite works of Shakespeare are “King Lear” and “Coriolanus” among many others. Initially, it was very difficult to relate because of the language, which is also its most beautiful part. We didn’t study Shakespeare in school so I first approached it as stories, then read in simple English and then delved into it savouring the language and beautiful dramatic construction. It was a reluctant journey that ended up as a transformation.

On the surface, every other Hindi film looks like ‘Romeo and Juliet’ in various shapes, sizes, and tastes. However, as you delve deeper, you realise that it is so layered and a masterpiece unmatched by anything the world has experienced. I found Juliet’s voice very powerful and nuanced and as a result, ""Raunaq & Jassi"" is seen through Jassi’s eyes.

How have you approached the classic?

This is neither a translation or a faithful adaptation, it is a re-imagined piece written in verse which is original and addresses the contemporary concerns of the society. Iqbal Raj has written a play that will find its place amongst the rare treasures of theatre writing in India. We are not revisiting a classic for a museum trip, “Raunaq & Jassi” is about the times we live in with a strong indictment of hatred and celebration of Love.

A lot is being said about the lyrical dialogues of the play. Was Chetan Anand’s Heer Ranjha an inspiration?

Since the play is in verse, “Heer Ranjha” will be the obvious reference, which was beautifully written by Kaifi Azmi. Iqbal Raj has given us a very fresh and new language in theatre that is elegant, layered, meaningful, dramatic and economical.

For instance, “Rab ko bhi mana lenge, do dil milkar unhe jeene ki dua denge” or “Mohabbat Ki Maange Garib Hoti Hain...Dil Todne Ki Bhi Tehzeeb Hoti Hai” .

Tell us about the form and set, is there a contemporary ring to it? We have heard of a romantic balcony!

The style of the production is impressionistic, like the paintings of Monet and Van Gogh. It has a simple but evocative set and the balcony is right there in the middle and becomes the central motif. It is a witness to all that is happening in and around.

In times of anti-Romeo squads, what is the role of Jassi?

These squads cannot deter nor defeat Jassi. She is today’s woman who demands choice in love and is determined to exercise this freedom.

Tell us about the music and cast...Neha Sargam was the find of “Mughal-e-Azam”

The music is the authentic and traditional, from the Punjab of the ‘50s, that is sung live. Neha is a special talent with deep sensitivity and rare truth. She was my first choice for Jassi and she owns the part.

What is the fundamental difference between directing a musical and a play like ""Tumhari Amrita"" or ""Agent Ramlal""? Did you have to learn/ unlearn certain things while making this shift?

“Tumhari Amrita” is a very minimal production that defies all theatre conventions with two people just sitting and reading letters and the audience is mesmerised by the language, performance, truth, purity, and simplicity of this theatre experience.

“Salesman Ramlal” is my favourite work and it affected me deeply. Satish Kaushik performance will be etched in our memory. Arthur Miller’s original classic “Death of a Salesman” is a seminal piece of theatre and we were very mindful of our responsibility to respect the original and yet appropriately adapt it for our times and place. It was driven by powerful performances and very minimum technical fuss,

However, a musical needs to have the scale and all the rasas. It is Natyashastra in action. The productions are big and it is life on stage, supersized!

In a politically volatile atmosphere, why have you turned your gaze on romantic musicals and love stories?

Theatre as agitprop has its limitations and gets called out. However, when it is camouflaged as a powerful love story and as a metaphor it affects the audience deeply. They are caught unaware despite their political or social leanings and humanity touches them. Engaging with the converted is not enough. Shakespeare for most of his life was disruptive. Theatre is the most effective and powerful when it doesn’t speak directly. In fact, in times of hatred, love stories must speak loud.

In times of OTT platforms, when it is becoming increasingly difficult to hold audience attention, “Mughal-e-Azam” broke many myths. What has been your experience?

I believe that the more digital we get, the more the audiences will crave to see live human beings and live performances. “Mughal-e -Azam” brings three generations to spend time together. It has brought communities together and every performance is the celebration of our syncretic culture on stage and in the audience.

The idea of a shared, syncretic past seems to be losing its shine in the present scenario?

I am an optimist and I believe that the idea of India still shines bright in the hearts and minds of the majority of its people. Yes, it is under attack and forces of hate are gathering traction with social media and compliant mainstream media as foot soldiers but eventually, their hollowness and phoney claims will be exposed. We are not just a nation but a great civilisation which is reflected in our constitution.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/n8r4ss/article30691917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DSC04038---Copy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/we-are-not-just-a-nation-but-a-great-civilisation-feroz-abbas-khan/article30691919.ece
296,2020/01/30,A Koodiyattam fete at Panjal revives its heritage as a cultural space,"About 29 kilometres North-East from Thrissur lies Panjal, a village that bridges the past and the present. Amidst agrarian villages nourished by the Nila, and imbibing the culture of both Palakkad and Thrissur, this place, its hues and life, is a favourite to many a scenarist and filmmaker. Panjal has always been associated with Vedas and Vedic rituals and it is believed to be an ideal place for performing various Athiraathram, ancient Vedic rituals.

It has also nourished traditional art forms such as Koodiyattam. The Lakshmi Narayana temple that stands facing the Athiraathram ground still reverberates with memories of Chakyars and their performances. The Koyappa Chakyar family in particular, had their Adiyantiram here.

The satire and the subversion of power relations in Chakyars’ Prabanda (narratives) could be seen carried forward in the works of native writers like Thuppettan. Nellikkattil Mamunnu Neelakantan Namboothiri, the present manager of the temple, recalls how there also existed a tradition of ‘Bharatam Vayana’ by Bharatabhatteri, a way of reading the Mahabharata for the devotees.

A group of enthusiasts and artistes came forward to revive this space and its heritage by restaging the annual performance of Koodiyattam, which was there until the 1980s. The fact that the event was revived in January, has great significance as well as it is the centenary of the late Painkulam Rama Chakyar’s arangettam (maiden performance on stage). By choosing the road not taken, he took bold steps to bring the art form outside the precincts of temples, to present before an international and eclectic audience. Commemorating the master thespian, a nine-day Koodiyattam festival, ‘Narmanavaham’, began by felicitating his disciples Kalamandalam Rama Chakyar, Kalamandalam Girija and Painkulam Narayana Chakyar.

As the name suggests, ‘Narmanavaham’ was more a celebration of the Vidushaka of Koodiyattam. In the performance of Kulasekhara’s play Subhadradhananjayam, focus was given to ‘Purushartha koothu’ performed as the ‘Nirvahanam’ of the vidushaka. The Purusharthas namely Vivadam, Vinodam, Vanchanam, Ashanam and Rajaseva were narrated respectively by Painkulam Narayana Chakyar, Margi Madhu, Ammannur Kuttan Chakyar and Kalamandalam Rama Chakyar. After six days of Purushartha, the first act of the play was performed for three consecutive days.

While Margi Sajeev Narayana Chakyar, Ammannur Rajaneesh Chakyar, and Kalamandalam Rama Chakyar played Kaundinya during each of the Koodiyattam performances, Nepathya Yadu Krishnan, Kalamandalam Jishnu Pratap and Kalamandalam Sangeet enacted Arjuna, and Kalamandalam Haritha and Aparna Nangiar essayed Subhadra. The artistes were well-accompanied by the percussionists, whose zealous and untiring management off the stage, brought together actors of different schools, a practice that is rare in Koodiyattam.

Focus on vidushaka

The focus on vidushaka was highlighted through comprehensive talks on the topic by M V Narayanan, C K Jayanthi, and A N Krishnan. The organisers intend to continue the performance every year in the temple’s Oottupura involving actors from different schools, thus making it a real tribute to the renaissance man of the art, Painkulam Rama Chakyar.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/mqayo3/article30690891.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvfPanjal,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/narmanavaham-a-koodiyattam-fete-in-memory-of-guru-painkulam-rama-chakyar/article30690895.ece

These moments play up in our everyday lives and through many facets — family, friends, work, ideas, beliefs, gender, region, customs, and traditions. Are we really left out or could we have made more of an effort? Did we unknowingly exclude someone or some idea? We don’t often get the chance to reflect on these moments or hear different perspectives,” says artistic director of First Drop, Radhika Jain. “As social animals, humans love to be connected, be part of a community. And yet, there are moments when it is not so simple.”

298,2020/01/30,Why Hyderabadi brides are flocking to this traditional trousseau maker,"Izzath Uroosa is making frantic calls to her lace suppliers. “Gold lace, half inch width. White embroidered lace for borders,” she instructs her errand boy, gives him money and returns to her calls with her suppliers clearly, not willing to compromise on the order a bride placed. Banjara Hills resident, 58-year-old Izzath Uroosa is the person to turn to for traditional Hyderabadi wedding trousseau. She doesn’t call herself a designer, she prefers “traditional trousseau maker”. Izzat says, “It is not very difficult to bring out modern styles. Designers do a very good job of it. But to find a traditional trousseau maker isn’t an easy task,” she says.

What makes Izzath popular with her clients is she takes pains to give exactly what her customers want. “Every bride knows what she wants. They want to look their best and also wear the most unique clothes in terms of design and cuts so I wouldn’t want to disappoint them even the slightest,” says Izzath whose traditional Hyderabadi clothes like garara, sharara, khada dupatta are unmatched.

Izzath began her boutique initially taking orders from friends and family. She learnt quite a lot of work like embroidery from her mother. “I learnt it for myself. As it happens in a family, if you oblige one relative, you cannot say no to another. Soon, almost everyone in our family started coming to me with orders for traditional wear,” says Izzath.

So most wedding orders where the bride wants to dress up traditionally in the khada dupatta with khada pants and kurta come to Izzath’s little boutique.

Observing how younger women were ready to experiment with blouses of different kind, Izzat was ready to introduce them to the traditional ones. “Khada dupatta was earlier worn with kurtani and choli by the women of the house. Seeing the style come back, women (other than brides) started to order for special occasions. To make them affordable, I introduced cotton khada dupatta sets and the customers are more than happy,” she confirms.

Izzath takes orders for embroidery, apart from making peshwas and angarakha, which, one can say, she has revived. “The angarakha style was forgotten. I started pushing it by assuring the brides-to-be that it would be a hit. Because I have made a commitment, I would meet that at any cost. The brides and the families love it now,” she says.

Running a successful venture is all about meeting the deadlines too.“My team is committed to deadlines and I am glad over the years I am able to make them understand what I want without having to visit their units every single time,” she says.

Izzath also shares with pride about reviving the abrakh work. “Abrakh is a kind of crush style with glitter and starch. Abrakh is mica that is used with starch as a dying process. Because of the tedious process, we don’t see them in the market. I didn’t want the tradition to die. After I introduced it, orders from young women started pouring in,” she says happily.",fashion,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/mzs4yt/article30691904.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IZZATHUROOSA,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fashion/izzath-uroosa-hyderabadi-traditional-wear/article30691905.ece

According to the organisers, it will be a continuing project helping women make use of the available raw materials in their own surroundings to design craft items and explore their marketing scope. Support will be extended to them for effective marketing with the help of professional agencies.

The municipal authorities said the participants would be offered training in craft design using the abundantly available natural raw materials such as cane, bamboo, coconut shells, and leaves. The sessions will be handled by two expert craftspersons, they added.

Financial assistance for such trained group of craftspersons to start joint ventures too will be considered on completion of training for the remaining batches. Along with craft design, the club will explore possibilities in similar self-employment projects to cover more LIFE beneficiaries.

Meanwhile, LIFE Mission officials said local bodies had the freedom to choose any creative project to find a sustainable source of income for the beneficiaries. The State Government will come up with more such adoptable projects on completion of the ongoing house construction under the scheme, they informed.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/life-beneficiaries-to-be-trained-in-handicrafts/article30696081.ece

According to a bulletin released by the Health Department on Wednesday evening, 166 people from the district had reported to the health authorities with a travel history to the infected countries. Of them, 164 are under surveillance at their homes. So far, the body fluid samples of three persons have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

301,2020/01/30,Govt. mulls wildlife safari park at Kannavam,"The State Government has proposed to establish a Tiger Rehabilitation Centre for immediate treatment of injured tigers and for their permanent rehabilitation, Governor Arif Mohammad Khan, has said.

In his address to the Assembly, Mr. Khan said that conflicts between humans and large carnivores had increased in Wayanad and adjoining areas, partly due to an increase in the tiger population in the last decade.

He said that the Government also proposed to establish a Wildlife Safari Park at Kannavam, Kannur, to be a centre of excellence in nature conservation along with sustainable tourism. For the conservation of valuable marine and aquatic biodiversity, the Government would declare specific protected marine areas as Community Reserves along the coastal and marine areas, Mr. Khan said.

He said that the work on the state-of-the-art Elephant Rehabilitation Centre for ensuring the welfare of captured and captive elephants in the State was progressing well. Kerala was the first State to complete the DNA profiling of captive elephants with details of owners, implantation of microchips for identification and measurements of the size and weight, he said.

The Government has proposed to set up a high-end cyber forensic lab to provide technical assistance to the investigators for collecting and analysing digital evidence using modern technologies. This was after the illegal wildlife trade had reached an unprecedented scale and much of it was happening on online marketplaces, he said.

The Governor said that the Forest Department planted 60-70 lakh seedlings every year. As of now, these seedlings were raised in polythene bags or in plastic root-trainers. The Government proposed to shift to plastic-free, compostible containers for seedlings. With a view to ensuring that forests and its fauna were free from the menace of dumped waste, a three-year project called Green Grass had been sanctioned. Nearly 1,900 tonnes of waste had been removed from identified dumping sites.

While bringing teak plantations of the State under improved management for higher productivity and quality, he said that the plantations that werr of poorer quality and located in disaster-prone areas, wildlife corridors, river sides and degraded areas would be reverted to natural forests. Similarly, to ensure water, ecological and climate security, all the plantations of eucalyptus and acacia would be phased out and the area reverted to natural forests.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/729mqe/article30688007.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25KI-TIGER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/govt-mulls-wildlife-safari-park-at-kannavam/article30688001.ece
302,2020/01/30,"State can take back probe against Alan, Thaha: intellectuals","A group of writers, academics, intellectuals, journalists and activists has claimed that the Kerala Government is empowered to ask the Centre to transfer back to the State police the ongoing probe by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) against Alan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal, CPI(M) workers arrested under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for suspected Maoist links.

Functionaries of the Alan-Thaha Human Rights Committee told the media here on Wednesday that the arrest of the two youths was an example of the “wanton misuse of UAPA provisions”. The committee has prepared a petition highlighting its demand with signatures from people such as eminent filmmaker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, writers N.S. Madhavan and K.G. Sankara Pillai, and veteran journalist B.R.P. Bhaskar.

Azad, convener of the committee, claimed that the NIA taking up the probe should not be seen as the end of the road in the case. “The amended NIA Act has a provision that allows the State Government to conduct the investigation even in the case of offences scheduled under the Act. Section 7 of the Act relates to the ‘power to transfer investigation to the State Government,” he said. Mr. Azad said that Section 7 (b) allowed transfer of the case to the State for investigation and trial.

He claimed that Alan and Thaha were arrested not on the basis of their involvement in any criminal activity or any complaint. “Are they the only Maoists in the State?” Mr. Azad asked. He accused senior CPI(M) leaders and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of behaving like court witnesses with their frequent statements to help the NIA probe.

K. Ajitha, women’s rights activist, who is the vice-president of the committee, asked why the Chief Minister was not opposing the UAPA with the vigour with which he was taking on the Citizenship Amendment Act. The committee is planning to hold a protest in Thiruvananthapuram on February 12 and meet Mr. Vijayan to hand over a memorandum in this connection.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/state-can-take-back-probe-against-alan-thaha-intellectuals/article30687998.ece

At its meeting held on Wednesday, the Syndicate also passed a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act, calling it discriminatory in nature and against the values upheld by the Constitution. The members claimed that the academic community was concerned about the implications of the Act. A cultural festival would be held in March to highlight secular values.

The meeting also decided to seek legal opinion on the recommendation of action against the chairman of the undergraduate board of studies.

310,2020/01/30,HC confirms conviction by CBI court,"MADURAI

Confirming the conviction and sentence imposed on a Senior Railway Employee by a court hearing CBI cases, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday lamented that corruption had ruined the system.

The court dismissed the criminal appeal filed in 2014 by P.V. Reddy, a Senior Divisional Engineer, against the three-year rigorous imprisonment imposed on him by the CBI Court in Madurai. He had demanded bribe from a contractor who was engaged to carry out civil works at Srirangam railway station.

Justice B. Pugalendhi observed that despite the implementation of the Prevention of Corruption Act, corruption had become a common affair. Nobody had a sense of fear of law, the judge said.

Taking into account the fact that a senior officer was involved in corruption, the judge said higher officials must act as an example to their subordinates in discharging their duties. If the higher officials themselves committed mistakes, they would lose the moral right to question their subordinates. Ultimately the system would fail.

In 2008, the officer, who was the head of the Civil Engineering Section in Tiruchi Division, authorised the tender for civil woks at Srirangam railway station and demanded bribe from a contractor.

After the contractor expressed his inability to pay the bribe of ₹3lakh, as demanded by the officer, he was threatened. The amount was reduced to ₹1 lakh after the contractor pleaded with the officer. The CBI registered a case against the officer based on a complaint filed by the contractor.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-confirms-conviction-by-cbi-court-madurai-srirangam/article30695431.ece

320,2020/01/30,Paddy farmers seek relief,"A section of farmers from Nilakottai taluk complained of false smut attack in rice, caused by a fungus, in which grains turn powdery and yellow before withering off. They said the disease has affected paddy at the yielding stage and sought relief from the government.

Submitting a petition to the Collector M. Vijayalakshmi at the grievances meet, a farmer from Vilampatti, S. Rajendran, said the fungal attack was reported in KO-52 and MGR100 varieties. “Paddy cultivation is taken up on about 1800 acres getting irrigation from the Periyar-Vaigai channels in Nilakottai taluk. This year the crop season was a bit delayed as water was released in August, not in June. So, there was rain during the flowering stage and the winter set in even before grains could mature. Excessive dampness has caused the disease,” he said.

He said that 40 grains in every 400 grains are found to be affected. “The yield has come down. Last year, I reaped 3.5 tonnes of paddy from my field. This year, I have managed only two tonnes so far. Farmers have suffered losses up to ₹ 10,000 an acre. The profit margin has shrunk,” he said.

However, an official from the quality control wing of the Agriculture Department who had visited the farms in Nilakottai, said the false smut infestation is known as ‘Lakshmi disease’ as it is an indication of a bumper crop. “The disease occurs only when there is a surplus yield. In order to contain its occurrence, we recommend a liquid to be sprayed before the grain stage. It is a problem of plenty and does not affect the yield.”",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/paddy-farmers-seek-relief/article30693909.ece

When the election for Kovilpatti panchayat union, with 19 wards, was held on December 30, the ruling party candidates won five wards while the DMK emerged victorious in eight wards. The remaining wards went in favour of Communist Party of India and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (one each) and independents (four). While two independents supported the AIADMK, the remaining two backed the DMK.

The AIADMK fielded S. Kasthuri as its candidate for the post of chairperson and the DMK fielded Poomari. But, the election, which was scheduled for January 11, was postponed to January 30 as Returning Officer Jayaseelan was hospitalised. So the election was held on Thursday with Assistant Director of Panchayats, Umashankar, being the Returning Officer.

When Mr. Umashankar declared Ms. Kasthuri winner as he polled 10 votes, DMK panchayat union councillors and councillors supporting the DMK opposed it saying that they, with the support of the CPI and two independents, would have won the post. They were arguing with the Returning Officer but the police evicted them from the office. So, they staged a dharna in front of the office.

When Ms. Kanimozhi arrived, the protest assumed more vigour. She asked Mr. Umashankar about the rationale behind the election of Ms. Kasthuri. She claimed that the DMK was enjoying the support of 10 of the 19 councillors while the AIADMK had the backing of only nine councillors.

When the Returning Officer was firm in his decision that he had conducted the election in a fair manner and his declaration was final, the MP along with the cadre and the councillor blocked traffic on Kovilpatti – Pasuvanthanai Road.

“The election has been conducted in an unfair manner. DMK members and the councillors who supported the DMK have voted in favour of our candidate. We demand recounting of votes polled in the election. I’ve spoken to our party president (M.K. Stalin), who will take the final decision. We’ll challenge this in the court of law,” said Ms. Kanimozhi whose protest continued for more than three hours.

Meanwhile, officials had to put on hold the indirect election for the vice-chairman post as the DMK councillors and members supporting the DMK continued their protest even after the prescribed time of 3.30 p.m.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/aiadmk-wins-kovilpatti-pu-chairmanship/article30693796.ece

324,2020/01/30,Narikudi Union chairperson elected by draw of lots,"An independent councillor, M. Panchavarnam, who was backed by the ruling AIADMK, won the indirect election to the post of chairperson of Narikudi Union, through a draw of lots on Thursday. Violence had marred the indirect election midway on January 11.​

​While DMK had won six out of the 14 seats in the union, the AIADMK won in five seats and Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam in one ward. Two posts of councillor went to independent candidates.​

​The post of chairperson of Narikudi Union was reserved for Scheduled Caste women. However, as none of the victorious women councillors from AIADMK belonged to the Schedule Caste, the ruling party extended its support to M. Panchvarnam who won from ward number 11.​

​In the indirect polls for the post of chairperson held on January 11, both Panchavarnam and DMK candidate S. Kaleeswari polled seven votes each. Following this, the Returning Officer, V. S. Venkateswaran, had announced that the winner would be declared through a draw of lots.​ However, AIADMK councillors objected to this, leading to violence in which Deputy Superintendent of Police, G. Venkatesan was hacked by an armed gang. The election process was then stopped. ​

​Subsequently, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court ordered that the rescheduled election process should be confined to drawing of lots. Amidst tight security provided by a strong posse of police, led by Additional Superintendent of Police, Marisamy, the draw of lots was conducted on Thursday and Ms. Pachavarnam was declared elected. ​

​Meanwhile, in the other Panchayat union of Watrap near Srivilliputtur where violence was reported on January 11, AIADMK candidate Sinthu Murugan was declared winner unopposed.​ However DMK candidates won in the other two unions of Sattur and Rajapalayam. While K. Nirmala won in Sattur, G. Singaraj emerged victorious in Rajapalayam.​

325,2020/01/30,Madurai Kamaraj University to re-advertise for registrar post,"Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) will call for a re-advertisement to the post of Registrar of the university as all candidates have been found unsuitable by the Syndicate, said Vice-Chancellor M. Krishnan here on Wednesday.

This announcement was preceded by a day-long interview process where an eight-member selection committee consisting of experts interviewed 16 candidates.

After the interview, the experts met with members of the Syndicate to decide on the next Registrar. They could, however, not arrive at a conclusion.

The Vice-Chancellor, who headed the selection committee, said though all candidates had sound academic credentials, many were unable to answer questions on the university’s administration. “Most candidates did not know details of statutes and acts of the university.”

A senior official from the university privy to the syndicate meeting said candidates were unaware of the process of applying for the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) ranking. They were also unaware of the events happening at the university. “Most were ill prepared,” he added.

The re-advertisement process comes after initial scrutiny of applications were completed in July last. Since then, there have been at least three occasions when the interviews were postponed.

Mr. Krishnan said each time the interview was postponed, it was due to administrative delays. “We also have important people in the panel. The decision must be agreed upon by the Syndicate. Following due process causes procedural delays.”

A senior member of the Syndicate said that apart from discussions regarding the registrar post, the unauthorised entry of a distance education centre owner in to the room of Controller of Examination O. Ravi was also discussed. “We have decided to seek legal opinion and then proceed,” the member said.

Medical service

With the Syndicate’s approval, MKU would start an emergency medical service on the campus in a couple of weeks. Any victim of road accidents would be treated at the medical facility first.

The chain organised on the 72th death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi was from the RTO office to Government Wenlock Hospital.

Earlier, forum members staged a dharna in front of the office of Deputy Commissioner and expressed concern that those who justified the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi are now being elected as the representatives of people.

There is a need to create awareness on the importance of the Constitution and Mahatma Gandhi to the present and future generations, they said.

In a separate event, people under the banner ‘Team India’ organised a variety of activities to oppose the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi and to save the Constitution.

Artists, writers, and activists participated in it. Senior writer Sara Aboobacker inaugurated the events.

The club started as a Facebook group after the release of the first edition of the book A Birder’s Handbook to Manipal. It is now a formal group of over 500 like-minded members that meet at least once a week for bird walks.

The Manipal Bird Day was an annual event dedicated to celebrating birds in Manipal. This daylong event brings together a large number of birders from Manipal, Udupi, Mangaluru, Mysuru, Bengaluru, and other places. Around 200 people gather and are split into different teams and visit the assigned regions and count as many birds as possible.

This non-competitive event focuses on spreading awareness about the diverse avifauna around. The next step was to involve a higher number of local and young birders.

Speaking on the occasion, Manjunath Hebbar, president, district unit of the federation, said the government had allotted land at Nada village in Kundapur taluk for the construction of a rehabilitation centre for endosulfan victims of Udupi district in 2017. But there had been no action on it since then. It was essential that the government and the district administration accord priority to the construction of this centre as it would help the victims.

The government should increase the present monthly pension being given to the victims in two grades, from ₹1,500 to ₹3,000, and from ₹3,000 to ₹6,000. They should also be provided the necessary equipment on time and not be made to wait for the same, he said.

The pension for disabled persons had not been given properly for the last three months. This had caused them hardship. The government should release it immediately. It should bring in a system to ensure that pension is paid by the 15th of the month, he said.

A separate counter should be provided for the disabled in offices in populated areas. The monthly maintenance allowance for them should be increased.

Brent was down 35 cents, or 0.6%, at $59.46 a barrel by 0225 GMT, having risen 0.5% on Wednesday. U.S. crude was down 30 cents, or 0.6%, at $53.03 a barrel, after dropping 0.3% in the previous session.

Still, oil prices have steadied in recent days after a rout that pushed them to three-month lows and the market is trying to assess the damage to economic growth and demand for crude and its products.

“There isn't a compelling case crude needs to go lower until we know more about how bad the demand destruction from the coronavirus epidemic is going to be,” said Stratfor oil analyst, Greg Priddy.

A second flight of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started, landed in Japan on Thursday, with nine showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK reported. Infections in China have passed 7,700.

The World Health Organisation's Emergency Committee is set for another meeting later on Thursday to reconsider whether the rapid spread of the virus should now be called a global emergency.

337,2020/01/30,Coronavirus | Highly irresponsible on the part of AYUSH Ministry to prescribe Unani medicines,"At a time when the number of novel coronavirus cases has crossed 7,700 — with deaths at 170 in China alone — and with the virus having spread to 20 countries/regions, the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) has once again resorted to dishing out a dangerous prescription to people who might be infected with the virus.

In a press release circulated on Wednesday, the Ministry recommended certain Unani medicines for “symptomatic management of novel coronavirus” and certain Ayurveda and homeopathy medicines to help prevent coronavirus infection.

Nearly a month after China intimated the World Health Organization about the novel virus, no drugs to specifically target the virus are currently available and no candidate drugs are at any stage of clinical trial.

In the absence of specific drugs to treat the novel coronavirus, patients are only provided with symptomatic treatment, including making sure that patients get enough oxygen so that they survive long enough for the immune system to fight the disease on its own.

Not only is the recommendation by the Ministry highly irresponsible and dangerous but it also runs counter to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s current practice of quickly isolating even suspected cases to prevent the spread of the virus and providing them with symptomatic treatment if found infected.

None of the medicines mentioned in the release has ever undergone any form of clinical validation. They have not been tested on people infected with the novel virus to study their ability to provide any kind of relief or prevent infection, either. Yet, the AYUSH Ministry has no hesitation in recommending the untested medicines to treat the virus, about which not much is known so far.

Symptoms not listed

Even as the Ministry issued a prescription to symptomatically manage infected people with Unani medicines, it has not cared to list out the symptoms that people infected with the novel virus exhibit or mention which medicines should be taken to treat which symptom.

People infected with the novel virus exhibit a wide range of symptoms. While most people exhibit milder symptoms akin to common cold such as fever and cough, about one in five manifest severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure. Much like in the case of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome caused by another coronavirus, some patients have been said to have had gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea.

By listing out the Unani medicines and asking people to use them for symptomatic management of the infection, the AYUSH Ministry is in fact encouraging people to self-medicate, which by itself is alarming. The press release is a mishmash of information put together in haste. While detailing Ayurveda medicines, it clearly states that the “advocacy is for information only and shall be adopted in consultation with registered Ayurveda practitioners only”, but no such cautionary note is found for Unani and homeopathy medicines.

With no evidence that the medicines would indeed provide even symptomatic relief, self-medication outside the healthcare system would put close contacts at grave risk of getting infected. After all, human-to-human transmission from infected cases to close contacts has been documented in China and other countries and even fourth-generation transmission has been recorded in Wuhan city, the epicentre of the disease outbreak in China.

Is the AYUSH Ministry aware of the kind of precautions that need to be taken while attending to people with the infection? Is it even aware that 16 healthcare workers who had been wearing all the mandatory protective gear while treating the infected cases fell ill themselves?

So when a passenger exhibiting symptoms suggestive of infection with the novel coronavirus is found at one of the 20 airports where thermal screening has been undertaken, will she be immediately quarantined and admitted to a hospital for further testing/treatment or will she be allowed to exercise her freedom to be treated at home with Unani medicines?

This should be reminder that the Health Ministry and AYUSH Ministry cannot afford to work at cross purposes.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i0meeo/article30683169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/coronavirus-highly-irresponsible-on-the-part-of-ayush-ministry-to-prescribe-unani-medicines/article30692601.ece
338,2020/01/30,"Gandhi, the dissident","Future generations will remember 2019 as a Gandhian year. From Hong Kong and Algeria to Catalonia and Iran, citizens across the world took to the streets in 2019 to express their discontent and push for change. While in Chile, people protested against the rising cost of everyday amenities, in Lebanon demonstrators held regular protests against the government’s plan to impose a new set of austerity measures. The year 2019 was also marked by unprecedented action to combat climate change, especially by the young. We often forget that Mahatma Gandhi’s writings were full of thoughts on the environment, especially when he affirmed that “the earth provides enough to satisfy every man’s needs, but not every man’s greed.”

Revaluation of values

An unflinching truth-seeker, Gandhi changed the face of non-violent protest around the world. His tactics of non-violence are still heralded by those who seek to inspire change without inciting violence. Gandhi appears to many as a spiritual man who tried to find a harmonious balance between a contemplative life and a life of action, but actually both as a thinker and as a practitioner he had a dissident mind. When we talk about Gandhi as a dissident mind, we refer to him as a non-conformist person who lived and thought in a way that was different from other individuals. As a non-conformist, Gandhi was someone who had the desire to excel. In other words, as a dissident mind he had the quality of excellence. For the ancient Greeks, excellence was considered as a moral virtue. For Socrates, dissidence was an exemplary act of excellence. What differentiates Gandhi from other political leaders is this Socratic sign of dissidence based on a public act of questioning. In a Socratic manner, but in his own way, Gandhi had an examined life. His examined life was an end in itself, but it was also a way to put into question the truths and beliefs that were at the foundation of modern life. Therefore, as a dissident mind, Gandhi brought about a revaluation of the values of his time.

There is, in sum, a general agreement between Gandhi’s commitment to the idea of truth and his clear commitment to fight injustice. Gandhi refused categorically to violate his philosophical principles. Over decades, this Gandhian moment of dissidence has been endorsed by all those who have maintained that unjust laws of a state or a community are contrary to the higher law of moral conscience. It is by referring to this higher law that Gandhi put truth and non-violence above the power of empires and masses. Gandhi was, therefore, the unrivalled master of civic philosophy and the master thinker of revolution against conformism and complacency in modern times. For this, he was more than a simple “engaged Mahatma”. As a citizen-dissident, Gandhi was a committed gadfly who was available to others and engaged in a dialogue with them. Therefore, what Gandhi continues to teach non-violent protesters is that citizens should be present in the public space where dialogue and dissent can defeat fanaticism and violence. Thanks to the Gandhian legacy of dissent, critical questioning continues to remain the only urgent action needed by humanity today. Gandhi also continues to teach us the role of moral conscience in resistance against injustice. For him, the voice of conscience transcends that of the state. Therefore, he presents us with a comprehensive vision of moral conscience as a pathway to self-rule, self-transformation and compatibility between freedom and righteousness.

Contribution to the world

Here again, we can evaluate the broader contribution of Gandhi to disobedient movements around the world. Gandhi has been an inspiration to several generations of non-violent freedom fighters. From Martin Luther King Jr. and the Dalai Lama to the young activists of the Tahrir Square in Egypt and Otpor in Serbia, and for all those fighting against all forms of injustice, Gandhi has been the most celebrated political thinker of the 20th century. Since his death, Gandhi has been considered as a great figure of dissent, whenever and wherever there has been a question of transition from authoritarianism to democracy or simply the process of democratisation of democracy.

Gandhi remains our contemporary, mainly because his dissident act of questioning continues to be different from our habitual practices of asking questions. Actually, Gandhian dissidence is a moment of political crisis, which helps us to create moments of rethinking the political. Gandhian dissidence is, therefore, crucial at a time when the projects of critical thinking and democratic questioning have retreated. It is time once again for a dissident thinker and practitioner to make us uncomfortable about our everyday beliefs and certitudes.

339,2020/01/30,A road map for robust trade ties,"Soft power rather than hard economics has traditionally been the driving force behind India-Australia relations. Cricket is a dominant theme that connects the two countries. The Indian diaspora in Australia is a vibrant community that plays a robust role in connecting their country of adoption with their country of origin.

Trade relationship

The challenge before the two nations is transforming these people-to-people contacts into a trade relationship. The trade between the two countries has been at a modest $31 billion, largely composed of resources like coal and other minerals. Negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement, which began in 2011, have not moved forward significantly. The problems faced by the Adani Group to begin work on a coal mining project in Queensland did not go down too well with investors from India.

Yet, there have been conscious efforts from both sides for a deeper and broader engagement on trade. One of the most widely commended initiatives has been the Australian government’s release of an India Economic Strategy 2035 Report prepared by Peter Varghese, a diplomat and former Australian High Commissioner to India. It observes that no single market over the next 20 years will offer more growth opportunities for Australia than India. It lays down a comprehensive road map for strengthening Australia’s trade engagement with India.

Meanwhile India-Australia trade has been steadily evolving into a new architecture underpinned by developments in digital technology, the rise of a younger generation of entrepreneurs, and a noticeable shift in the trade basket from resources to services. Technology and young entrepreneurship make a formidable combination and should set the agenda for the future of bilateral trade relations. About 80% of the Australian small and medium-sized enterprises are managed by young professionals.

This is not just a demographic shift. There is a qualitative change in the way young people look at things. Young Australians, like young Indians, carry the compelling vision of 21st century globalisation, multiculturism and quality education. What adds strengths to this process is a great deal of social engineering, people-to people contacts, and knowledge partnerships. From this heady mix, the young can see issues like immigration and outsourcing with far more equanimity than the older generation. Young Australians are thus emerging as great champions of India-Australia trade relations.

There is also recognition that Australia is a laboratory of ideas, innovation, technology-led growth and university-industry partnerships. India is a large and demographically young market with a love for innovation and an appetite for new products and services. These synergies should add momentum to a growing engagement in trade relations.

A weak spot

The weakest link in India’s exports to Australia is in merchandise. India needs to look at three broad areas. First, despite globalisation, markets are country-specific and culturally sensitive. Indian companies will need to invest a little more in market research on Australian consumer expectations and lifestyles before their products can successfully penetrate the Australian market. Second, Australia is a brand-conscious market while India has not created a single consumer brand of international acceptance. Only when India’s textiles, leather products, cars and two-wheelers, kitchen equipment and other products are visible across the world’s shopping malls and supermarkets displaying their own brands that India will be recognised as a major player in the global markets. Third, innovation is emerging as the single-most important factor for sustained success in every sphere. Cricket, for instance, has incorporated the 20/20 format. Such innovations have kept the game alive and popular. Global trade cannot be different.

340,2020/01/30,Keeping the cow and brahmin apart,"When singer, writer and activist T.M. Krishna realised that nobody spoke about mrdangam makers, he knew that he had failed them too. In his first book, which examined caste in Karnatik music, he had not explored the world of the makers or the maker–player dynamic. The mrdangam, a two-faced drum, is the primary percussion instrument used in Karnatik music recitals and Bharatanatyam performances, he writes in his new book, Sebastian & Sons: A Brief History of Mrdangam Makers. The mrdangam’s body is a hollow, resonating chamber made from the wood of jackfruit trees, and its two tapering ends are covered with layers of cow, buffalo and goat hide. Thereby hangs a dark tale of caste discrimination and other slights. An excerpt:

There is a general belief across the globe, and even among many Indians, that Hindus do not eat beef. Yet, there is evidence that there was considerable beef-eating in the Vedic period and later, including among brahmins. Many Hindus continue to eat beef, especially among the dalit communities but not restricted to them. Besides, India is among the world’s top five beef exporters. That the cow is an unslayable holy animal is a modern brahminical concept, not one necessarily shared by the larger population. But the brahmin castes, who have had an outsized impact on policy and in constructing cultural norms when compared to their size in the population, have established this untruth as a sacred universal, so much so that it found a place in the Constitution of India. Although this provision is only in the Directive Principles, which means it is not enforceable by any court, the cow still finds special mention. And over the years, many State governments have brought in laws that banned or regulated cow slaughter.

Difficult questions

Born in a traditional Palakkad brahmin family, Palghat Mani Iyer went through a period of battling a contradiction: an instrument that necessitated taking the life of three animals — most crucially, of the holy cow — was his very life. Although Iyer believed that the mrdangam was a vedavadyam (a Vedic instrument), he asked himself whether it was right to kill a cow to construct it. In search of self-reconciliation, he decided to approach the Shankaracharya of Kanchi Mutt. But Iyer hesitated: was it not inappropriate to pose such a question to the pontiff? Unsure, he resolved to instead speak to C. Rajagopalachari, whom Mahatma Gandhi called his conscience-keeper. Through friends, he reached Rajagopalachari and asked him this question.

Rajaji, as he was known, gave him a pragmatic answer by quoting a proverb: ‘Don’t look for the source of a river or the antecedents of a saint’. In other words, he asked Mani Iyer not to seek difficult answers. How convenient! It is the maker who plays the role of an intermediary for the artist, veiling the origins and allowing the latter to seek comfort in such a proverb.

The cow is removed from the artist’s sight. Since the killing and skinning happen beyond his circle of existence, he can act as if it does not happen. The maker stands at the threshold, keeping the cow and the brahmin apart, helping the latter maintain his ‘purity’. So, the maker is vital for the player, yet his role also keeps the maker ‘polluted’ and unequal. Once the blood is removed, the skin is cleaned and cut in shape, then dried and finally brought to the artist, it has been transformed through the labour of the makers into a resource, a lifeless ingredient. To Ravikumar, the maker, the skin itself has life; one to which no negativity is attached because it comes alive through shruti. But he either did not acknowledge, or did not see fit to speak the hard truth: that it is the maker — he, and others like him —who give the skin life after death. I had to intervene and remind him.

Offending whiff

At any rate, the irony does not escape the makers, even if the players fail to see it. As a maker told me, ‘We talk about goats and cows. Most artists are brahmins. They don’t like the smell and don’t know anything about how we process the skin. But the instrument will be in their pooja room. The makers are not given that respect.’ Another said, ‘When I work on the mrdangam, I use my legs to hold it. But you take the same mrdangam inside your room and worship it.’ (The legs and feet are, of course, another source of ritual pollution in the brahminical worldview.)

To maintain an unblemished image, artists need to distance themselves and their audience from these realities. The conservative audience of the sabhas must not get so much as a whiff of the abattoir.

There might have been a trigger to the existential crisis that Mani Iyer confronted. Alkattan, Parlandu’s [who ruled the mrdangam making industry] cousin, was considered an expert at choosing skins and made very good varus. I have not been able to ascertain how exactly Alkattan is related to Parlandu. In such situations, the English generality ‘cousin’ always comes to the rescue. Iyer gave Alkattan a job. He said he wanted top-draw cow skin, no compromises and the cost did not matter. Alkattan said it would cost Rs. 100. Iyer gave him that amount immediately, in advance, and headed out to a restaurant around 3 or 4 p.m. When he returned, he found Alkattan standing outside his house, cow in tow. Iyer was startled, to say the least. Alkattan informed him that this cow had great skin, but the seller wanted Rs. 120, and so he wanted to check with Iyer before completing the transaction. Iyer was shocked. Almost certainly, this would have been the first time he had to make a decision on the slaughtering itself, and take responsibility for something that was thus far hidden. He just shooed Alkattan away, and demanded that he take the cow with him. This incident from Iyer’s life is a universal condition — I am certain that no mrdangam artist would like to be placed in a similar situation. Skin just drops down from the heavens, as far as they are concerned.

Both Mani Iyer and Palani Subramania Pillai really tried understanding how skins are chosen by the makers. They would still only look at skin that had been sanitised by the maker, but they had started buying larger quantities of processed skin for storage in their mrdangam rooms. Needless to say, all of this was purely born out of the need for a special and specific sound — an obsession with the instrument.

341,2020/01/30,Compromising scientific curiosity for marketability,"At the recently concluded 107th Science Congress in Bengaluru, the customary inaugural address by the Prime Minister reflected the government’s take on how science should be conducted in India. This was conveyed when he said young researchers should “innovate, patent, produce, prosper”.

The present government has been directing laboratories and other research centres to earn their own revenue from external sources by marketing their expertise and investing the surplus to develop technologies for national missions. This policy position can be traced to the ‘Dehradun declaration’ prepared by the directors of the CSIR labs in 2015, where it was decided to market patents as a means to self-finance research. This market-driven revenue model is expected to encourage the research centres, including the universities, to reorient themselves to conduct what is marketable.

This trend towards commercialisation of science started much earlier. In the 1990s, CSIR director general R.A. Mashelkar mandated labs to generate intellectual property and file patents. Consequently, there has been a steady decline in government expenditure in higher education and research, reflecting this changed stand on making the government labs financially autonomous and leaving their fortunes to be determined by the market forces. There is a genuine concern among the researchers and academics that this transformation will have serious repercussions for India’s competence in research.

History of the debate

The modern debate about basic versus applied sciences was started in the early 1940s by British physicist John D. Bernal who proposed that science should serve the nation and the material needs of its citizens. A main tenet of this argument was that scientists should first pass the test of whether their chosen research topics would be beneficial from the perspective of societal needs. But Bernal’s ideas were promptly opposed by a group of researchers, led by the zoologist John R. Baker by forming the Society for Freedom in Science. In an article published in the journal Nature in 1944, the Society emphasised that scientific life should be autonomous and workers should be given enough freedom to choose their own problems.

Meanwhile, in 1945, Vannevar Bush, Director, Office of Research and Development, published his vision of research freedom in a publication titled “Science, the Endless Frontier”. This was submitted to the then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt, ultimately leading to the establishment of the National Science Foundation. Under the chapter ‘Freedom of inquiry must be preserved’, he wrote that, “Scientific progress... results from the free play of free intellects, working on subjects of their own choice, in the manner dictated by their curiosity for exploration of the unknown”. He continued: “The publicly and privately supported colleges, universities, and research institutes are the centers of basic research... As long as they are vigorous and healthy and their scientists are free to pursue the truth wherever it may lead, there will be a flow of new scientific knowledge to those who can apply it to practical problems in Government, in industry, or elsewhere”.

This vision was the guiding principle of science governance in the U.S. and Europe, in general during the last century. But cut to the “Horizon 2020” the European Union framework programme for conducting science. Taking a cue from Bernal’s vision, the scientific research as presented in this document could be viewed as a political and economic instrument.

Thus, it appears that scientific research world over is under the threat of increasing commercialisation, primarily spearheaded and fast-forwarded by the new age politicians. The implicit assumption is that the research institutes and universities in course of time will transform into something like service centres that will be more equipped to address the economic growth and social needs. By encouraging intellectual property and by creating spin-off companies, many centres of learning are busy attempting to recast their images to meet such demands.

Dismal R&D spending

Science is essentially an end-product of human curiosity and a desire to understand the world. Thus, an increasing emphasis on immediate applicability of science should not be allowed to steal the space of curiosity-driven basic science which can be sustained only by direct government funding.

Further, the question is whether a blind and hasty copying of this Bernalian model of science will be beneficial for scientific growth in India. We must first assess the objective conditions of higher education and research institutions. Where do we stand in research and development (R&D) in comparison to other countries?

Besides the 40 CSIR laboratories and a few premier research institutions like the Indian Institute of Science and the Indian Institutes of Technology, there are over 600 universities, meeting the educational requirements of about 29 million students. But hardly any international-level research is done in the universities. Our impact on global science continues to be minimal, except for a few isolated bright spots.

Government spending in R&D has continued to remain static for about a decade, at a paltry 0.9% of the GDP, as compared to China, whose spending during the 2000-2017 period grew at an average of 17%, its growth being more than that of the U.S. The situation is so dire in India that even the country’s premier technology colleges, the Indian Institutes of Technology, are reaching out to their alumni for funds. As for developing self-financing models for government labs, the government should tread its path slowly and selectively looking at the strengths and weaknesses of each of the institutes. It will be counterproductive to implement a one-size-fits-all solution in a hasty manner. The immediate priority in this regard should be to increase the government funding in higher education and R&D. The forthcoming Union Budget will provide an excellent opportunity to make this long-standing demand a reality.

342,2020/01/30,Planned injustice: On Donald Trump’s peace plan for Israel and Palestine,"For any peace process to be successful, the first step is to take all conflicting parties into confidence. By that standard, U.S. President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Israel and Palestine is a failure from the start as the Palestinians rejected it even before the proposals were unveiled. The Palestinians believe that Mr. Trump, whose administration recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017, is not an impartial negotiator between the two sides. And the plan Mr. Trump unveiled on Tuesday in the White House seems to be confirming Palestinian concerns. Mr. Trump has thrown his weight behind the two-state solution. But to achieve the solution, the plan overly favours the Israeli positions and demands excessive concessions from the Palestinians. According to the plan, Israel can annex the Jordan Valley as well as the Jewish settlements on the West Bank. It also recognises Jerusalem as the “undivided capital” of Israel, while the Palestinian capital could come up in the eastern outskirts of the city. It proposes to enlarge Gaza and swap the Arab-populated towns in southeast Israel with Palestine for parts of the West Bank. In effect, the Palestinians would lose roughly 30% of the West Bank, their claim to Jerusalem and the right to return of refugees. In return, they will get an independent state in a shrunken West Bank and an enlarged Gaza connected through a tunnel that would practically be encircled by Israel.

Explained | Trump’s Israel-Palestine peace plan

It is true that the Palestinians’ negotiation powers are at their weakest point. Their leadership is divided and the support they once enjoyed in Arab nations is also eroding. Representatives of the UAE, Bahrain and Oman were present at the event in Washington in which Mr. Trump unveiled the plan. Egypt also offered its support, while Saudi Arabia cautiously welcomed talks between Israel and Palestine. But on what conditions? It’s hard to overlook the injustice in demanding that the Palestinians accept further annexation of the West Bank. Issues such as the status of Jerusalem and the right to return of refugees, an internationally accepted right, and the final borders should be resolved through talks, not by dictating terms to one party. Even to achieve statehood under the proposed conditions, the Palestinian Authority (PA) is required to crack down on Hamas and Islamic Jihad (which is practically impossible as both operate from Gaza and the PA runs only West Bank territories), stop supporting families of those jailed or killed by Israel and stop challenging Israeli actions on international fora. It is virtually impossible for any Palestinian leader to sell these proposals to a people who have been resisting Israel’s occupation for decades. Under the current conditions, it looks more like a plan for further annexation of territories by Israel than one that seeks constructive and lasting peace.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/planned-injustice-the-hindu-editorial-on-donald-trumps-peace-plan-for-israel-and-palestine/article30686558.ece
343,2020/01/30,A mindset problem: On rural jobs scheme fund crunch,"It needs no reiteration that the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has acted as insurance for landless labourers during crop failures, agrarian crises and periods of a stressed economy. With the ongoing economic slowdown resulting in depressed rural wages and the lack of adequate opportunity to work, the MGNREGS has provided much needed succour and this explains why demand for it has peaked in the last few months across various parts of the country. The report that 15 States have already overshot budgets for the scheme’s implementation and many have not been able to pay wage dues should be a cause for concern. Compounding the situation is the fact that the Centre is on the verge of running out of funds. This problem was not unexpected. While in absolute terms, the allocations for the scheme in the budget presented in July 2019 were higher compared to the previous financial year, the outlay fell in relative terms as a percentage of the overall allocations. The outlay was also lower than the actual expenditure in the previous year, which indicated the importance of the scheme in arresting rural distress.

MGNREGS has been in place for more than a decade. The present Central government’s approach has been to treat it as a secondary scheme that cannot be done away with. Several studies have pointed to its effect on the lives of the rural poor by providing employment in the agricultural off-season, offering alternative jobs during years of lean agricultural growth and as a safety net during crop failures. Researchers have also found that a large proportion of those availing the scheme are from the 18-30 age group, which suggests that this has addressed the problem of youth unemployment, which according to official statistics has peaked in recent years. Besides, other studies have also shown that MGNREGS has improved agricultural productivity where it has been implemented properly. The scheme, by now, should have been an ideal vehicle for rural development and not just a fallback option. It could also involve rural workers in skilled work and pay them more wages for asset creation beyond just roads, wells and check-dams. A change in mindset is therefore key in not just tiding over problems such as funding and wage-delays, but also in using them as an opportunity to address the slowdown. Economists have pointed to a slowing of rural consumption, which has also dragged down the economy. By paying wages adequately, and on time, to rural workers, the government could allow for more spending and consumption and stimulate the economy. A more meaningful allocation for the scheme in the budget is therefore a much needed imperative.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-mindset-probleml-the-hindu-editorial-on-rural-jobs-scheme-fund-crunch/article30686582.ece

The Doddakallasandra Lake Protection Committee has also made similar allegations, following which Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) officials, on Thursday, inspected the site.

The committee had complained to the Board alleging that untreated sewage from an apartment complex close to the lake was being discharged into it.

BWSSB officials said it will write to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) to test the quality of the discharge.

Jagadeesh Rao Vade of the Doddakallasandra Lake Protection Committee said that they would also follow up with the KSPCB. “The untreated sewerage that is being let into the lake has spoiled the health and hygiene of the lake apart from disturbing its flora and fauna,” he said.

KTCDA to inspect lake

To complicate matters, the real estate company that developed the apartment complex has offered to rejuvenate the lake under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).

A senior official of the Karnataka Tank Conservation and Development Authority (KTCDA) told The Hindu that they would inspect Doddakallasandra lake in the first week of February. “We are inspecting the lake based on the objections we received by the local RWAs. We will take a final call before handing over rejuvenation of the lake under CSR,” the official said.

Meanwhile, after an FIR was filed against two of its engineers, the BWSSB has plugged the sewage inlet to Chunchaghatta lake in J.P. Nagar 7th phase. “Our sewage lines were damaged during the bund work and, hence, sewage overflowed into the lake.

345,2020/01/30,Thousands form human chain to mark Martyrs Day,"More than a thousand people participated in a human chain and sang the national anthem at 5.17 p.m. on M.G. Road on Thursday to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and “reclaim Gandhiji’s India” on his 72nd death anniversary. Mahatma Gandhi was shot in Delhi during evening prayers at 5.17 p.m. on January 30, 1948. Human chains were formed in various places in the city, including in front of Town Hall.

346,2020/01/30,‘It’s time to dissolve BBMP and appoint administrator’,"Observing orally that it is time for the State government to dissolve the elected council of the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for its failure to take quick measures to stop illegal disposal of garbage and appoint an administrator, the Karnataka High Court on Thursday gave two weeks to the government to intervene in BBMP’s affairs to ensure proper disposal of garbage as per the law.

As the Advocate-General assured the court that the government will intervene in the BBMP’s affair and sought two weeks’ time, the court refrained, for the second time, from passing an interim order to restrain the BBMP from granting permission to put up certain categories of new constructions for a specific period till infrastructure is created for lawful disposal of waste.

The court, in its October 15, 2019 order, had cautioned that it may have to impose restrictions on new constructions as BBMP lacked facilities for lawful disposal of waste while asking the government to examine whether there is a case to dissolve the BBMP for its failure to enforce Municipal Solid Waste Rules, 2000 and Solid Waste Management Rule, 2016 and the other rules framed under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar made these observations after expressing dissatisfaction over the action taken by the BBMP. The bench pointed out that the Bombay High Court had passed an order staying permission for new constructions in Mumbai city for failure of the Mumbai civic body to effectively dispose waste, and the Supreme Court had approved the order of the Bombay High Court.

The bench directed the BBMP to place data of daily collection of municipal waste from January 1, 2019 to January 31, 2020 while observing that no clear data is available on generation and disposal of municipal waste in the city. Though the BBMP claims that 4,200 metric tonnes of waste is generated in the city, it has admitted that only 1,500 metric tonnes of waste is being disposed as per the law and the remaining waste is illegally dumped in quarry pits. However, the petitioners claimed that the waste generated is higher than the claim made by the BBMP.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/jzh3r7/article30694886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGQUARRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/its-time-to-dissolve-bbmp-and-appoint-administrator/article30694887.ece

348,2020/01/30,Human chain planned to mark Martyrs’ Day,"To commemorate Martyrs’ Day, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, several organisations are organising a human chain across the State on Thursday to promote brotherhood and unity in the country.

The human chain will be formed around 4 p.m. simultaneously in all districts and taluks, said noted writer K. Marulasiddappa, who is part of Souharda Karnataka, one of the organisers.

“Several like-minded organisations, including Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, Dalit Sangarsha Samithi and Sufi Santara Sangha, apart from intellectuals and progressive thinkers, artists and social activists have extended their support to our efforts.

349,2020/01/30,Namma Metro commuters seek more amenities,"As Namma Metro ridership increases — it currently stands at around four lakh — commuters say the existing infrastructure has failed to keep up. While conversion of trains from three to six coaches has gone a long way in ensuring ease of commute, other problems like lack of proper signage, long queues at security points during peak commuting hours, and escalators that are often switched off remain unaddressed. People have been taking to social media to voice grievances.

Many commuters say the signage on platforms don’t properly indicate as to which exit gate opens to which road. Vaishan P.N., an advocate, said, “There should be signage pointing to the direction of the exit. At the Central College Metro Station, one exit is towards the college and the other towards the City Civil Court in the opposite direction. But there is no marker or board to help commuters,” he said.

Confusion overs stations

The closest metro station to K.R. Market is the one at Chickpet, and not the K.R. Market metro station. However, the station next to Victoria hospital has been named K.R. Market station. K.R. Market metro station is nearly a kilometre away from the market building, whereas the Chickpet station is less than 300 metres. The security guard at the exit of the metro station admitted that hundreds of people alight at the K.R. Market station and ask for directions to the market.

“It seems that the authorities have named stations without foreseeing problems which people might face. Chickpet station should ideally be renamed as Chickpet/K.R. Market station and the existing K.R. Market station can be named after Victoria Hospital,” said Ramaprasad K., a regular commuter on the Green Line.

Long queues

During peak hours, there are long lines of commuters at check-in points and ticket counters. At a few stations like M.G. Road (Church Street gate) and Baiyappanahalli (Old Madras Road gate), the queues at times spill onto the roads. “At the Baiyappanahalli station, there are two metal detectors and 2-3 lines for check-in. During peak hours, the number of check-in lines should be increased to four lines at least” said Nirmala C. a regular commuter.

Sneha Tiwari, a resident of K.R. Puram, had a similar complaint. “The authorities should increase the number of ticket counters at the Baiyappanahalli metro during peak hours. Ticket-buying time sometimes takes more than the travel time.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/4alwpu/article30689755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29BGMETROINFRASTRUCTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/namma-metro-commuters-seek-more-amenities/article30689756.ece
350,2020/01/30,BMRCL to test National Common Mobility Card; roll out by March,"The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited is installing Automatic Fare Collection systems on a trial basis at Baiyappanahalli, Mysuru Road and Majestic stations to facilitate the introduction of the Cental government’s ambitious ‘One Nation One Card’ policy.

This National Common Mobility Card will allow holders to use multiple modes of transport such as metro and buses operated by the Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, and for paying parking fees and toll, besides for purchases at retails stores.

However, people will be able to utilise the card to its maximum potential only after transport corporations start updating their existing systems. BMRCL Managing director Ajay Seth told The Hindu that facilities will be made available for commuters travelling from Mysuru Road to Baiyappanahalli on Purple Line by March end.

“The One Nation One Card is a policy that enables passengers of various modes of transport to use a single card. After Delhi, Namma Metro is developing engineering capabilities to introduce the card; and banks will issue these cards.”

Of the over four lakh commuters who use Namma Metro services every day, 62% are using the smart card. BMRCL, which has issued more than 10 lakh smart cards (closed-loop cards), maintains that passengers can continue to use these cards.

BMTC to float tender in 15 days

The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation is also gearing up to introduce common mobility cards on a large scale, and will draw upon lessons learned in its past attempts to issue open-loop smart cards.

A few years ago, even before the One Nation One Card policy was mooted by the Centre, the corporation had tied up with a private bank for a similar project. In January 2017, it started the test trial of the cards on two AC bus routes, but failed to introduce it on a large scale owing to glitches.

Now, the BMTC is planning to float a tender to reintroduce smart cards that can be used in other modes of transport. BMTC MD C. Shikha said, “Electronic Ticketing Machines we are currently using meet the specifications for introducing of national common mobility card. Now, our expert team is working on how introduce the card and also consulting with BMRCL. In 15 days, the corporation will float a tender.”

352,2020/01/30,Patient climbs stairs two days after double knee replacement,"It took Shihan Hussaini several years to come to terms that he needed bilateral knee replacement if he wanted to walk again.

The 61-year-old martial arts instructor, who is known for his dangerous stunts, said when he nailed himself to a cross, he had not anticipated the repurcussions.

“As I had nailed my feet too, I could not walk well after that. For three years I had difficulty in walking. I could stand only for 10 seconds. I consulted doctors in London and the US through my students. Even here I consulted several doctors,” Mr. Hussaini said.

But orthopaedic surgeon A.B. Govindaraj gave him the confidence to go ahead with total knee replacement and he decided to have both knees operated on at the same time. Two days after the surgery he climbed stairs.

Mr. Hussaini told media persons, “It is a rebirth for me. I am standing before you seven days after surgery. I plan to drive 15.5 km to my home in Besant Nagar from here.”

Dr. Govindaraj, senior consultant and clinical lead, Orthopaedics, MGM Healthcare, said bilateral knee surgeries are about knee balancing. “The most common reason for the procedure is severe arthritis. Pain worsens with weight-bearing activities such as standing and walking.”

Patients “relatively younger, healthier, non-obese individuals with stiffness, pain and limitation of activities” are ideal for double knee replacement surgery, he explained. Shihan Hussaini with his sportsman-like fitness regime “fulfilled the criteria and made the job easier for us,” Dr. Govindaraj added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/patient-climbs-stairs-two-days-after-double-knee-replacement/article30693280.ece
353,2020/01/30,Chinmayi Sripaada submits nomination to contest in Dubbing Union elections,"Singer and dubbing artiste Chinmayi Sripaada submitted her nomination to contest for the post of president in the upcoming elections for the South Indian Cine Television Artists and Dubbing Artistes Union on Thursday morning.

Ms. Sripaada initially faced stiff resistance from several members of the union, who created a ruckus at the union building premises where she had gone to submit her nomination. “There was a lot of yelling and questions raised as to why I was there. Their contention was that I should not be at the premises because I was banned and hence, not a member,” she said.

Ms. Sripaada however stated that the Madras High Court had given an interim injunction which clearly says that she is still a member of the Union until final orders are passed. “I still have every right that a member does and this includes visiting the dubbing union building as well as contesting in the elections,” she said, speaking to The Hindu.

A life-member of the union, Ms. Chinmayi had been removed from the union by its then president Radha Ravi on the grounds that she had allegedly violated a by-law of the union. Her removal in November 2018 had coincided with her being in the forefront of the #MeToo movement in Tamil Nadu and she had then said that there was no prior intimation from the union about the action taken against her.

For contesting the elections, she has been joined by several other members of the dubbing union who have gone through similar issues in the past. “These members too have raised questions in the past about the functioning of the union and have had action taken against them including being banned,” she said. The faction is contesting under the name of ‘Ramarajyam’- which is the name of the first full length Tamil dubbed film released in 1947.

Financial mismanagement is one of the issues which Ms. Chinmayi said needs to be addressed within the union.

354,2020/01/30,Actor and singer T.S. Raghavendra no more,"Actor, playback singer and music director T.S. Raghavendra, who excelled in cameo roles, died on Wednesday night. He was 75. He is survived by his wife and singer Sulochana, and daughters and playback singers Kalpana and Prasanna.

“For many years he worked as a composing assistant for music director M.S. Viswanathan. He would beautifully imitate actor Sivaji Ganesan while performing on stage,” said cello player V. Sekar.

His training in classical music came in handy in the film world. He acted as father of actor Revathi in the film Vaidehi Kaathirunthal and rendered Carnatic jathis for the song ‘Azhagumalar Aada’. He acted in many films of K. Balachandar and in Sindhu Bhairavai, he starred in the role of a magistrate and his argument over the difference between raga Aarabi and Devagandhari continues to remain a memorable scene. In the film Chinnathaayee, he rendered the lines, ‘Naan Erikkari Melirunthu’ along with K.J. Yesudas and Swarnalatha with the effect of a counterpoint.

“The fastest made-in-India 3 millionth export roll-out is a significant milestone as it showcases the global success story for brand Hyundai. We started our export operations in 1999 and created many milestones,” S.S. Kim, Managing Director and CEO, HMIL said.

HMIL began exporting cars in 1999 with its first batch of 20 Santros to Nepal and reached its first milestone of exporting 1,00,000 cars in four years and 10 months in October 2004.

358,2020/01/30,R.K. Nagar bypoll bribery case: Madras High Court lets litigant seek CBI probe,"The Madras High Court on Wednesday permitted N. Maruthu Ganesh of the DMK to amend the prayer in his writ petition and seek a CBI probe into the 2017 Radhakrishnan Nagar bypoll bribery case, in which Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami, Education Minister K.A. Sengottaiyan, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar and others were allegedly involved.

Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha allowed the amendment petition and ordered notice to the CBI after recording senior counsel P. Wilson’s submission that though a police complaint lodged at the instance of the Election Commission (EC) had an annexure of documents containing names of individuals to whom a total of ₹89.65 crore crore had been supposedly given to be distributed to the voters, the FIR did not contain even a single name.

Further, the police had allowed the FIR to be quashed by a single judge of the High Court at the instance of a petition filed by Tiruttani MLA P.M. Narasimhan after he was summoned for an inquiry in connection with the case. Even the EC was kept in the dark, because it was not made a party to the quash petition, and the police too had chosen not to go on appeal to the SC.

Recalling the history of the bypoll bribery case, he said that it dated back to April 2017 when T.T.V. Dhinakaran, now a leader of Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK), contested as an AIADMK candidate from the seat vacated due to the death of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa in December 2016. During the course of the campaign, the Income Tax department conducted a search at the residence of the Health Minister.

Simultaneous searches were also conducted at 21 places connected to him in Chennai and 11 outside Chennai. During the raids, the I-T sleuths had reportedly recovered a total amount of ₹4.71 crore from the Minister, his father, actor-politician R. Sarathkumar and few others and also seized some incriminating documents. The seizures were conveyed to the EC which rescinded the bypoll election notification on April 9, just three days before polling.

The commission also lodged a police complaint which resulted in registration of an FIR without naming anyone as accused. When things stood thus, Mr. Ganesh had filed a writ petition in the High Court in 2017 to restrain the EC from conducting a bypoll once again in the constituency without ensuring penal action against those who were involved in bribing of voters in April. However, no interim orders were passed in the case and so the byelections were held in December 2017.

Subsequently, when the writ petition was heard in 2018, the petitioner as well as EC were shocked to know that the FIR itself had been quashed at the instance of an AIADMK MLA. Hence, he immediately filed a petition seeking the court’s permission to amend his prayer and seek a CBI probe into the entire issue.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cmn0dt/article30687675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Radhakrishnan-Nagar-bypoll-bribery-case,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rk-nagar-bribery-hc-lets-litigant-seek-cbi-probe/article30687690.ece

360,2020/01/30,A first-person take on Gandhi’s assassination,"Film-maker Bharatbala, who has embarked on a 1,000 short film challenge that involves untold stories about India, has released an eight-and-a-half minute film, The Assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, on the occasion of his 72nd death anniversary on Thursday. It has been posted on YouTube.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Bharatbala said he wanted to tell the story of Gandhi’s assassination through two people — his personal secretary Kalyanam, 98, and Sarla Mehta, 91, who lived at the Sabarmati Ashram from the age of six — who were there at the scene.

“The episode is well known, but I told myself: let me find people who were closest to Gandhi. I found five people but realised that these two could actually recount what happened on that day in first person... I knew that the story was coming together,” he said.

Mr. Bharatbala said that he had found Ms. Mehta and Mr. Kalyanam in many archival photographs of that fateful day. “It is one thing to read about it on Wikipedia, but it is worth our time to listen to them reminiscing about the day. They both knew Gandhiji so well,” he said. Did the two know each other? “It is possible as they both lived in the ashram at the same time but I didn’t want to connect the dots,” he clarified.

The film-maker said three stories that didn’t make it into this film would be released as separate films.

“The other three people got left out because they weren’t connected to January 30 but their stories are interesting — for example, one man walked from Bhubaneswar to Sevagram in Wardha because Gandhiji had called him,” he said. Mr. Bharatbala is currently working on developing a full length feature and has already completed 65 films out of the planned 1,000 short films.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/qh3q8m/article30687651.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30THBALAa,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-first-person-take-on-gandhis-assassination/article30687652.ece

By not seeking diagnosis early, people were coming to doctors at an advanced stage, said S.M. Chandramohan, president of the 8th Asia Pacific Gastroesophageal Cancer Congress.

“In India, the five-year survival rate is only around 27%, whereas in countries where there is regular screening, it is 60%,” he said, adding that a majority of Indians come late to doctors. The average time from the first symptom to consulting the doctor is around four months, Dr. Chandramohan said. The Congress will be held in the city from February 6 to 8 at Sri Ramachandra Institute for Higher Education and Research. There will be two special sessions. Cancer and suicide survivors will share the dais with medical experts and speak of their life-experiences.

363,2020/01/30,Doctors perform minimally invasive surgery on Australian girl,"Doctors at Apollo Hospitals recently performed a minimally invasive, double curve correction surgery on a 13-year-old girl affected by Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis, an abnormal sideward curvature of the spine. The surgery was performed using the non-fusion anterior scoliosis correction technique, doctors said.

Two years ago, the mother of the girl from Brisbane, Australia, noticed a change in her postures. Initial treatment with bracing had no success, and surgeons advised surgical correction. The family began a worldwide search for surgeons performing non-fusion surgeries and approached Apollo Hospitals, Sajan Hegde, consultant spine surgeon, head of orthopaedics, Apollo Hospitals told reporters on Wednesday.

“Traditional surgery will require insertion of rods. Though the spine is straightened up, it is rigid,” he said. In this, metal implants are attached to the spine and then connected to two rods. These implants would hold the spine in a corrected position until the instrumented segments fuse as a single bone.

He said that the girl had a curve in the upper and lower part of the spine. In non-fusion anterior scoliosis correction technique, the spine deformity is corrected but not fused. “In a few weeks, the girl can get back to school and take part in sports,” he said. He added that they also used special anaesthesia to deflate both the lungs during the surgery.

366,2020/01/30,Special classes ahead of board exam sparks concern among teachers,"A purported move to hold special classes for students of Class VIII after school as well as conduct short tests for them ahead of the public exams in a few districts sparked concerns among teachers in the State.

For the public exams, students of Class VIII have been told that they will be tested on the portions of all three terms. This is a departure from how their annual exams were conducted till last year, when they were tested only on the portions of the final term.

A circular prepared by district-level educational officials instructs teachers and heads of schools to set aside one hour after school hours and administer tests for 30 marks on the first and second term portions as well as hold classes to revise portions.

“We haven’t got the circular yet and no information has been intimated to us. But to ensure students of Classes V and VIII do well in their exams, we have already been conducting classes for them,” said a teacher from a school in Erode district.

Minister for School Education K.A. Sengottaiyan was, however, quick to clarify and said that no compulsory classes will be held for students of Classes V and VIII after school hours. “Any special classes or added coaching will be given only during the school hours and students who need any extra help can ask the teachers themselves.

Mr. Krishnaswamy was a student of the first batch of the film institute and studied cinematography and sound engineering. His initial work was with Gemini Studios as an assistant cameraman for films such as Chandralekha and Avvaiyar.

His first production, the 1956 award-winning Tamil film Ondre Kulam, was named by former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K. Kamaraj and dealt with untouchability as its central theme. Among his other films as a producer were the Sivaji Ganesan and Sowcar Janaki starrer Padikadha Medhai.

He also went on to produce documentaries and shows under his banner Enkay Visions for television and among them were the popular TV shows Mel Maadi Kaali and Sir, Post. Mr. Krishnaswamy had several firsts to his credit and founded the Cine Technicians Association (CTA) of South India. In a 2001 interview to The Hindu, he said that though the working conditions of big film studios were good, the same could not be said about the smaller ones.

To raise funds for the association, Mr. Krishnaswamy was instrumental in organising a celebrity cricket match, which saw several Hindi stars like Dilip Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Nargis, Shobhana Samarth, Nimmi, Nirupa Roy, David and Dev Anand play against Sivaji Ganesan, Akkineni Nageshwara Rao and Gemini Ganesan among others.

371,2020/01/30,‘Formulate new water policies’,"New technologies alone will not solve growing water problems. There is a need to formulate new policies and regulations to move forward towards water security, said Trevor Birkenholtz, associate professor of Geography, Pennsylvania State University, on Wednesday.

Speaking to The Hindu, on the sidelines of a session on ‘Water in the Hydrosocial Cycle’, organised at the U.S. Consulate General, Chennai, he said drip irrigation was one of the best technologies introduced to conserve groundwater resources. It has enhanced food productivity in many parts of India, but has not decreased groundwater use, he added.

Mr. Birkenholtz has worked extensively on the transformation of groundwater-based irrigation and water use, and the spread of water supply technologies in arid and semi-arid zones of India. Farmers may be given incentives to crop varieties that need less water. Water scarcity is a human-produced problem and there is a need to democratise the approach towards it and learn about it through others’ expertise, including citizen science, he said.

Elaborating on the hydrosocial cycle, he said: “It is a process through which water and the society make and remake each other, over time. It is about how water is produced and also produce social circumstances.”

Water must be treated as intrinsically human and as a part of people’s life, to move towards a water-secure future. Payment for ecosystem services, wherein landowners are provided incentives for ecological services, must be considered, he said.

A paradigm shift from the present practices is key to future urban development. For instance, instead of draining a huge volume of floodwater through stormwater drains, open spaces must be part of urban planning.

Drawing examples from California, he said water saving devices, particularly in commercial establishments, would help conserve resources.

About 40 students and faculty members, from different educational institutions, attended the session, hosted by the Amercian Center and the U.S.-India Educational Foundation.

373,2020/01/30,"‘Completion certificate not enough, project must be usable’","The Tamil Nadu Real Estate Appellate Tribunal has ruled that completion certificate alone is not sufficient to construe that a housing project is ready for use and pointed out that completion of a project should mean that the property was in a usable condition by the buyer.

Tamil Nadu Real Estate Regulatory Authority had allowed buyers to withdraw their complaint based on a settlement with Pacifica (Chennai project) Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd and Sylvanus Builders & Developers Ltd. However, it directed that the project in Kancheepuram district be registered under RERA as an ongoing project, against which the builder moved the appellate tribunal. In the appeal, the builder stated that the completion certificate for the project was issued by the Pudupakkam panchayat office.

The appellate tribunal noted that the panchayat president had relied upon the Directorate of Town & Country Planning (DTCP) planning permission, Mamallapuram Local Planning Authority (MLPA) and Pudupakkam panchayat building permit, but had not relied upon the certificate of the architect or structural engineer/licensed surveyor associated with the project and photographs which were mandatory requirements for issuing completion certificate as per RERA rules.

Hence, it noted that completion certificate issued by the panchayat president was certainly not reliable. The appellate tribunal also noted that it had every authority to go into details even in the case of grant of completion certificate, and it could not accept the same when it the project was not complete.

375,2020/01/30,Time to prioritise education and health,"In recent months, the government’s macroeconomic policy has acquired a new salience in the context of reversing the current slowdown. The policy currently being pursued is intended primarily to incentivise potential investors by facilitating ease-of-doing-business and making large-scale concessions to the corporate sector. In this context, the government is taking credit for the relatively higher, though by no means spectacular, flow of foreign private capital and the progress of India in the ease-of-doing-business rankings. Further, tax concessions given to the corporate sector in the last budget are estimated at more than ₹1.40 lakh crore.

Besides these, the remaining limitations on foreign investment are being relaxed or removed. In the process, the conditions laid down for these investments to serve social objectives and help in indigenisation are being jettisoned. But in spite of these measures, and amidst the absence of demand, there is little evidence of any significant increase in investment by the private sector.

Call for more liberalisation

However, economists who are in favour of the above development strategy would like the government to go further and implement other items on their reform agenda, such as labour market liberalisation and removal of constraints on acquisition of land for industrial purposes. These economists brush aside the negative impact such reform measures are likely to have on the incomes, living conditions and the economic security of the workers and the agricultural class. Moreover, the policy of freedom of hiring and firing of labour will be counterproductive as it would squeeze demand further in a situation of huge demand deficit.

Some of the economists in the above category are also advocating acceleration of investment in infrastructure. No sensible person will oppose additional efforts to build infrastructure which continues to remain awfully deficient in our country. But, while talking about infrastructure, these economists mean only physical infrastructure and that too only large projects in the field of transport and energy. They hold no brief for investment in human infrastructure, particularly in education and health. Besides, we must remember that investment in physical infrastructure is not as labour-intensive as that in other sectors and that large-scale projects in this field have long gestation periods.

Social sectors and demand

Abhijit Banerjee, a co-winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, has been one of the few economists making a case for transferring income to the poor who are likely to spend the additional income to buy goods and services, an enhanced production of which offers the best chance for reversing the current slowdown. In this connection, he has singled out the mechanisms of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and direct income transfers. But, even he has not mentioned the potential of investment in social sectors for creating demand in the short run by way of opening avenues for large-scale employment, and imparting competitiveness and sustainability to the Indian economy in the medium and long run.

It is widely recognised that the social sectors in India are grossly underfunded. No mainstream economist or policymaker has come out with a suggestion for enhancing expenditures in these sectors. On the contrary, they have made expenditure in social sectors conditional upon higher rate of growth. Most mainstream economists and policymakers also believe that public expenditure in social sectors can only have a long- term impact on growth, and what is now needed is macroeconomic policies which can have immediate or very short-term impact. This belief is deeply flawed, as it can be demonstrated that increased public expenditure in social sectors in the magnitudes required for meeting the constitutionally mandated objectives can have short- and medium-term effect of enhancing employment, generating demand and attracting investment.

RTE and teacher employment

Let us take the example of the impact of investment in school education on employment and, hence, demand creation. The Right to Education Act (RTE) sets out the objective of universalising elementary education in five years. The National Education Policy, 2020 states that the Act “will be reviewed... to ensure that all students... shall have free and compulsory access to high quality and equitable schooling from early childhood education (age three onwards) through higher education (i.e. until Grade 12)”. We, at the Council for Social Development, have calculated the magnitude of demand creation by meeting just one condition for realising this objective, i.e. employment of teachers. We have arrived at a figure of 5.7 million teachers by taking as the base the total number of children going to school from the 2011 Census; adjusting it appropriately for rate of growth in population since then; dividing these numbers by the pupil-teacher ratios fixed for each level of schooling; and deducting from it the number of teachers currently employed, obtained from the Unified District Information System for Education data. (As there is no fixed pupil-teacher ratio for children in the 3-6 years age group, we have assumed a ratio of 10:1).

The recruitment of 5.7 million additional teachers over a period of, say, five years, can create huge scale demand. And, this is only one factor essential for universalising quality school education. There is also a large gap between requirement of infrastructure in the schools and that available and built recently. According to government data, only 12.5% of the schools covered by the RTE Act were compliant with RTE norms, most of which are related to infrastructure. Meeting these norms has the potential of creating employment on a large scale.

Education and employability

Similarly, in the health field, there is a vast number of vacant posts for professionals at these levels. There is a huge deficit of paramedical workers, middle-level health workers, nurses and trained doctors. This is evident from the long queues of patients in the ill-equipped and inadequate primary health centres and government hospitals.

The fact that health and education are of instrumental value in driving growth, creating employment and improving people’s well-being is widely recognised but often forgotten when it comes to making investment in these sectors. Education has a crucial role to play for an individual in gaining employment and retaining employability. If we compare 2011 and 2017 data released by the Labour Ministry, the gap in educational attainment emerges as the single most important factor separating the gainers from the losers of the higher rate of growth during this period.

Health and education have been widely recognised as public goods. In most developed and several developing countries, these services are either provided or are heavily subsidised by the state. Unfortunately, in India, we find the opposite trend of the state withdrawing from the provision of these services and consequently their rapid privatisation. In fact, the government has a well-entrenched policy of encouraging privatisation in both health and education. But, privatisation in these sectors has not led to efficiency or improvement of quality. It has only destroyed public sector institutions, promoted greater inequality and pushed the poor out.

The gestation period of projects in social sectors is not as long as it is made out to be. After all, in the RTE Act, a gestation period of only five years was envisaged for universalisation of elementary education. It is therefore time for reprioritising education and health in the scheme of development strategy and the allocation of budgetary resources.

It brings untold misery to the victims and odious publicity to Islam. Islam does not permit forcible conversions, rather it encourages conversion by persuasion and exemplary conduct.

The vituperative, vitriolic and virulent comments of some of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have transgressed the bounds of basic decencies of a civilised society. Clearly, the verbal shockers by these self-styled patriots are symptomatic of the degeneration of the political discourse. Union Minister Anurag Thakur at an election rally in Delhi egged on the crowd to respond with goli maaro (shoot them down). Meanwhile, BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma addressed the Delhi people, likening the Shaheen Bagh protesters to criminals who will “enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters and kill them”. He also characterised Arvind Kejriwal as a “naxal” and a “terrorist”. Earlier the BJP’s Kapil Mishra had likened Delhi Assembly election to an India-Pakistan cricket match. It is significant that these leaders did not even get a rap on the knuckles from the BJP’s top brass. It is time the common people consider boycotting these hate-mongers.

380,2020/01/30,‘Jojo Rabbit’ movie review: Taika Waititi's Oscar contender is one of the best films of the year,"Apparently, Rabbis use the results of a circumcision as earplugs; Jews are scaly because a man of the race mated with a fish. They have horns and can read minds and are the worst of the worst. That is the ridiculous anti-Semitic garbage that Nazis propagate in Jojo Rabbit. It’s funny no doubt, but in line with the extent of lies those in power can impress upon fragile minds. With his new film, New Zealand darling director Taika Waititi (Thor Ragnarok, What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople) definitively proves that comedy is a powerful tool that can elucidate and satirise a complex issue like intolerance. Based on Christine Leunens's book Caging Skies, Jojo Rabbit is hilarious, poking merciless fun at Adolf Hitler and fascism.

Jojo Rabbit Director: Taika Waititi

Cast: Roman Griffin Davis, Thomasin McKenzie, Taika Waititi, Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant, Alfie Allen, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson

Storyline: Ten-year-old Jojo’s faith in Nazism is shaken when he meets Jewish Elsa, who’s being harboured by his mother.

It’s the fag end of World War II and ten-year-old Johannes ‘Jojo’ Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis) is overzealous about his patriotism to the Aryan race. A part of the Nazi youth group, he spends his days with other young fascists, his loving mother Rosie (Scarlett Johansson) and an imaginary friend version of Adolf Hitler (Waititi). After being bullied because of his inability to murder a rabbit, the young protagonist is nicknamed Jojo Rabbit. Embarrassed, he accidentally sets off a hand grenade on himself. Injured and recuperating from his wounds, including a limp — “it’s only hurts 80 per cent, so I’m almost better” — Jojo finds a Jewish girl, Elsa hidden within the walls at home. Striving for lofty literary results — a book titled, Yoo-hoo, Jew — he interrogates her to document the ways of the Jew which leads to some comically atrocious revelations.

With a generous, never-gratuitous, smattering of whimsy and humour throughout, Waititi’s narrative unravels as seamlessly as the loose hold that Nazism has on Jojo. As the imaginary Hitler, Waititi is in his own skin: playing the silly, pulling faces and talking nonsense. As his redemption arc unfolds, Jojo’s sincerity and innocence remain unwavering, wonderfully captured by the director. As Rosie, Johansson gives yet another brilliant performance of the year after Marriage Story. Her maternal love and kindness is so palpable that it’s almost a heart-warming choke hold. But, the clear winner of Jojo Rabbit is Waititi’s ability to translate the absurdity of the power-hungry. Off note, is a lengthy hail-Hitlering scene involving the Gestapo with a skyscraper-tall Stephen Merchant and his beatifically malevolent smiles.

Waititi’s WWII is sanitised with mere glimpses of the atrocities committed upon Germany’s people. But aggressive depictions of brutality and violence alone cannot convey the horror and pain of tragedy. In using comedy, the director snares a lure that’s just about enticing enough for a sneak-peek, but before you know it, you’re entirely invested. So much so that it would take someone really heartless to remain unmoved.

381,2020/01/30,"‘The Gentlemen’ movie review: Guy Richie’s latest is stylish, but also over-the-top and predictable","Drugs, bling, henchmen, betrayals and slow-motion shots in a gangster film? Groundbreaking. Guy Ritchie’s latest, The Gentlemen is an over-the-top and predictable film. The plot is outlandish, the narrative is gimmicky, visuals are dramatic, the acting is loud, the accents are caricature-like and the testosterone is oozing. But they all come together in a witty manner, if not stunningly original.

The beginning of The Gentlemen sets the tone for the next hour and a half — it's a film that puts style over substance. Richie’s kitschy gangster cat-and-mouse chase doesn’t pretend to be smarter than it is. The focus of the film is on how to tell a story than the story itself, and it succeeds in that motive. Hugh Grant opens the film as a slimy tabloid journalist, out to blackmail a marijuana kingpin, and assumes the role of a narrator. Through a film-in-a-film narrative, we enter a world of drug smugglers, beefy henchmen, black teens making rap videos, shiny cars, underground marijuana labs, and of course, Chinese bad guys. The narrative often wallows in its excesses, making inside jokes and tributes to gangster films, throwing around racially impudent nicknames, and celebrating the ‘boys will be boys’ world of big guns and cars. I understand its an old-school gangster film but we can definitely have better female characters than the utterly inconsequential Michelle Dockery as Rosalind.

The Gentlemen Director: Guy Ritchie

Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Henry Golding, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong, Eddie Marsan, Colin Farrell and Hugh Grant

Story line: A drug kingpin wants to retire, but attracts blackmailers and crooked businessmen.

After a confusing first half-hour, there is some fun to be had and that’s mostly due to the film’s one-liners and eccentric characters. For instance: “In France, it’s illegal to call a pig Napoleon, but that’s not gonna stop me.” Like this one, Grant gets to utter the most amusing lines and emerge as the most memorable character in the film. After playing the cover boy of romance for several years, it’s rather funny to see Grant play a wacky, twisted character. Matthew McConaughey plays a drug lord with the same old brooding looks and minimal expressions. When it comes to the stoic face, Colin Firth does it better. Crazy Rich Asian’s Henry Golding and Charlie Hunnam are easy on the eyes, but Jeremy Strong is impressive as the sophisticated and delicate billionaire, interested in buying McConaughey’s ganja business. What the film lacks in novelty, it embellishes with details and quirks. Although I can’t help but lament over the lack of originality in concept, The Gentlemen is a classic case of mediocrity done well.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/5n7ftt/article30695485.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31bm-pg-5-The-Gentlemen,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/the-gentlemen-movie-review-guy-richies-latest-is-stylish-but-also-over-the-top-and-predictable/article30695486.ece
382,2020/01/30,Sarod maestro Manik Khan gave the audience at Kerala Kalamandalam a taste of his talent,"Mid-noon is an odd time for a classical music concert by a musician irrespective of his calibre. It is also seldom cherished even by ardent rasikas. However, maestro Manik Khan transported his small group of listeners into the melodic realm of the sarod at a concert on the Nila campus of Kerala Kalamandalam.

Seated on a small dais in the historic hall of the campus where the institution had its humble beginnings decades ago, Manik started with an alap of raga Gaud Saranga. The selection appeared most befitting since it is usually played during the third prahar (12 to 3 pm).

Gaud Saranga is noted for its vakra scale, which makes use of the two Madhyamas. The raga belonging to the Kalyan thaat creates an air similar to Kedar and sometimes to Behag. Though Sudha Madhyamam is a prominent note, one could see how the meends played by the musician ended at Panchamam and Gadharam. Manik’s explorations of the raga brought out its multiple shades. His agility while sliding the board, pressing the tense strings, produced a sound of high resonant quality.

Notes of sringara

Soft was the use of the plectrum. Though strange to the ears, one could feel a mood of sringara that the raga created. The way the musician negotiated the meandering scale with uncanny ease was commendable. However, the alap was not as extensive as in most Hindustani concerts for want of time. Still it was an exposition of Manik’s mastery over the instrument and the evocation of the raga.

After the alap, he took a composition in Kafi, presumably of his father’s. The raga is sampoorna with Gandharam and Nishadham being komal (Sudha). Kharaharapriya is its Carnatic equivalent. But true to the typical Hindustani practice, an occasional touch on the Anthara Gandharam enhanced its aesthetic appeal. Chandrajit’s accompaniment on the tabla in vilambith tempo of Teen taal was delectable. His beats on the tabla were noted for their clarity and perfect sruti alignment.

The rendition progressed through madhya tempo to reach the drut when a dialogue opened between the sarod and the tabla. This spoke for the dexterity of the tabla artiste who faithfully reproduced the varied phrases performed by Manik on the sarod. Applause from the audience was spontaneous for both the above exercises.

The arrangement for the concert seemed impromptu. Manik could have been provided with a separate microphone the absence of which made his explanations inaudible. The youngest son of the late sarod legend Ustad Ali Akbar Khan, Manik is presently on a tour of India. He is on the faculty of Ali Akbar Khan College of Music in San Rafael, California.

A long-time friend of Kalamandalam from the US, Graeme Vanderstol was instrumental in bringing the sarod maestro to the institution.

Screening of documentaries

Two documentaries were screened before the concert. The first documentary was on Kathakali, which Vanderstol had produced based on the recordings of the Ramayana play staged in the US five decades ago, in which veteran Vazhenkada Kunju Nair had portrayed Rama.

The second one was on Killimangalam Vasudevan Namboothiripad, a scholar of repute who had played a pivotal role in enriching the academic areas of art forms in Kalamandalam during its initial days.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/7dha73/article30683999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvfManikKhan2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/reviews/manik-khans-spellbinding-sarod-recital-in-thrissur/article30684000.ece
383,2020/01/30,Vipanchika Mahotsavam in Kochi celebrated the music of the veena through recitals and seminars,"The veena’s ability to reproduce Carnatic music gamakas in its purest form makes it a connoisseur’s delight, though there are certain limitations such as low note-sustenance. Vipanchika Mahotsavam in Kochi celebrated the music of the veena through two main concerts and lecture demonstrations.

Saraswati Rajagopalan’s musically rich concert on the first day was proof of her mastery and classicism. A disciple of K S Narayanaswamy and a top grade artiste of All India Radio, Saraswati presented two melakarta ragas that are rarely performed, Dharmavathi and Sarasangi, as her main focus. The main raga for the concert was Dharmavathi, a raga that is suited for instruments but not a favourite with vocalists.

Her detailed raga delineation established the contours of the raga in the first few phrases before she moved to a bhava-laden elaboration of rishabham and nishadam. Saraswati’s technique was accentuated in the tanam section in which she played dense passages maintaining a round rich tone. She moved on to Mysore Vasudevachar’s kriti ‘Bhajanaseyarada’ set in Roopaka tala. Though her improvisation passages stood out, her kriti renditions were quite cursory. This was seen in ‘Saraswathi namostute’ (Saraswathi raga), ‘Manavyalakim’ (Nalinakanti) and ‘Marivere’ (Anandabhairavi).

Prolific musical expressions

The artiste switched between the vocal and instrumental styles with ease when she played Sarasangi. In the alaapana, she played prolific musical phrases featuring the gamakas and rounded up with jharus. Dynamic kalpana swara essays, with due emphasis on laya aesthetics and mathematical permutations, followed her rendition of ‘Jaya jaya padmanabha murare’. Support from Palakkad Jayakrishnan on the mridangam and Velattanjoor Sreejith were commendable. Except for Saraswati Rajagopalan’s ‘Akhilandeshwari rakshamam’ in Dwijavanthi, Muthuswamy Dikshitar’s chowka kala kritis, which are usually a vainika’s choice, were not featured in this recital or the next day’s concert by R S Jayalakshmi.

Jayalakshmi in her concert combined melody as well as instrumental nuances characteristic of the veena. It was a display of skill all along as she started with brisk renditions of Sahana varnam and ‘Vinayaka ninnuvina’ in Hamsadhwani. Routine phrases were eschewed and even masked when she played an opulent Kalyani alaapana in a bright tone. The alaapana had the peaks in appropriate places with added subtleties.

Jayalakshmi’s grand daughter, Charulatha Chandrasekhar who is gaining attention on concert circuits and is often hailed as a prodigy, was not limited to a supporting role. Charulatha played a few tanam phrases well, not letting the tempo lag. Tyagaraja’s ‘Etavunara’ was delectable in style and presentation. However, the concert could have fared better with at least a few slow-paced renditions.

The taniyavarthanam by Alleppey Chandrasekharan on the mridangam and Vazhapilly Krishnakumar on the ghatam did not fail to impress with their spontaneous tuning, interaction and synchronisation. Jayalakshmi and Charulatha had ‘Janani ninuvina’ (Reethigowla), ‘Brovabharama’ (Bahudhari) and ‘Raghuvamsa sudhambhudhichandra’ (Kathanakuthoohalam) as their other selections.

384,2020/01/30,Experienced artistes came good at a Kathakali festival in Thiruvananthapuram,"The highlight of the inaugural piece of a seven-day Kathakali fete was the appearance of doyen Kalamandalam Gopi as Nala in the first three scenes of the first part of Nalacharitham. His presentation of the character was, as usual, spot on. In fact, many in the audience reminisced Gopi’s aesthetic visualisation of the pivotal soliloquies of Nala (‘Kundinanaayaka…’) even during the golden days when the legendary Kalamandalam Krishnan Nair reigned over the stage.

Rajeevan, Vipin, Shanmukhan, Arun and Aromal, all alumni of Kalamandalam, commendably essayed the roles of Hamsam (the Golden Swan), Narada, Damayanti and her maids respectively. The outstanding musical rendition of the play led by Pathiyoor Sankarankutty was supported by Kalamandalam Krishnadas (chenda) and Kalanilayam Manoj (maddalam).

Select scenes

On the following evenings, select scenes from the third part of Nalacharitham, Dakshayagam (by Irayimman Thampi), Lavanasuravadham (by Palakkattu Amrita Sasthri), Balivadham and Thoranayuddham (both by Kottarakkara Thampuran ) and Devayanicharitham (by Thazhavana Govindan Asan) were staged showcasing the histrionic talents of actors such as Kalamandalam Balasubrahmanyan (Bahuka), Kalamandalam Krishnakumar (Daksha), Sadanam Krishnankutty and Kalamandalam Rajasekharan (Hanuman and Seetha in Lavanasuravadham), Kalamandalam Ramachandran Unnithan (Baali), Kalamandalam Sreekumar (Ravana in Thoranayuddham) and Etumanoor Kannan and Margi Vijayakumar (Kacha and Devayani).

The fiesta offered a number of memorable moments. The scenes in Nalacharitham depicting the interaction of the Hamsam with Nala, and then with Damayanthi and her maids, was one of them. Bahuka’s ‘aattam’ that narrates the hero’s journey from the forest to the court of King Rithuparna was well-delineated by Balasubrahmanyan.

In the staging of Dakshayagam, Krishnakumar did a fine job depicting the different stages of Daksha’s animosity towards his all-powerful son-in-law, Siva, even while his heart brims with affection for his daughter, Sati.

Evocative acts

Baali’s subtle humour, even in the midst of his wrath towards Sugreeva, his step-brother, whom he counts as just a deceitful weakling, was evident. The sibling rivalry between them comes to an end when Baali, breathing his last, entrusts his wife and son to Sugreevan.

Krishnankutty’s Hanuman in Lavanasuravadham was majestic but playful and his humorous encounter with Kusa and Lava, the valiant sons of his master, was essayed well. So was Seetha’s heart-rending response to Hanuman’s incidental report that his master was keen on the proper conduct of the ritual Aswamedha yagam (horse-sacrifice), which necessitated the presence of the organiser-in-chief’s wife.

Kalamandalam Pradeep as Hanuman in ‘Thoranayudham’ | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Kalamandalam Pradeep, who donned the role of Hanuman in Thoranayudham, came up with an interesting portrayal of the adventures of Hanuman who crosses the ocean in search of Sita. His escapades in Ravana’s kingdom, his interactions with Ravana himself and his humility during his meeting with Seetha were all essayed deftly by Pradeep.

Kacha teasing Devayani and their bantering was the highlight of Devayanicharitham.

The contribution by the team of vocalists and percussionists and by the make-up and costume artistes helped in making the fete a success. Plays like Nalacharitham and Devayanicharitham require that the musicians be sensitive to the varying moods on stage.

Rendition of Nalacharitham by Sankarankutti and that of Devayanicharitham by Kottakkal Madhu left nothing to be desired. Madhu embellished with appropriate sangatis all the crucial syllables in the play text. He was able to portray the mental state of the character through his rendition.

The percussion was led by veteran chenda artistes such as Unnikrishnan, Krishnadas, Balasundaran, Ravisankar and Venumohan, all alumni of Kalamandalam, and Kalabharathi Unnikrishnan and Sadanam Ramakrishnan while Kalamandalam Achytha Variar, Margi Rathnakaran, Margi Ravindran and Kalanilayam Manoj were on the maddalam.

The make-up part of ‘aaharyam’ led by Margi Raveendran Nair was flawless in all respects.

385,2020/01/30,‘There’s a camaraderie in the kitchen’,"The mutual appreciation that radiates from Mary Sue Milliken and Asha Gomez is palpable. The two chefs are meeting for the first time on Indian soil to discuss their guest stint with The Hindu. Milliken recounts how the two met for the first time, “We were in Palm Springs together, at a James Beard Foundation, a sort of convening of chefs who are interested in working in advocacy and working to support the Sustainable Development Goals that intersect with the food systems in many ways.” There’s a palpable excitement in the air as they speak, with each interested to explore Mumbai with the other before donning their chef coats.

The two women also happen to be celebrity chefs, Milliken for her restaurants across Los Angeles and Las Vegas, in addition to the five cookbooks she has written and her appearance on Top Chef Masters and Gomez for culinary studio in Atlanta, The Third Space, her cookbook and her turn on David Chang’s popular Netflix special, Ugly Delicious.

First-time partners

They’ve never cooked together, but will be doing so for the first time this weekend at Magazine Street Kitchen. While Milliken is known for her Latin fare, Gomez has come to prominence for her South Indian food, though their menu for the weekend draws on their travels and interests. So, you can expect a paella of chicken and seafood from Gomez and a passionfruit and lobster agua chile from Milliken to highlight two dishes.

When asked if they would be helping each other in the kitchen, Gomez, who is the more animated of the two, says, “It all kind of came together beautifully,” before adding, “there’s a camaraderie in the kitchen as chefs, I don’t like to feel isolated.” Milliken who’s had a day to acclimatise to Mumbai interjects, speaking to Gomez, “I saw some green chickpeas that we can use in the paella, it will be delicious. I do that at home sometimes.” These musings punctuate the conversation, which makes this interviewer more of an interloper during a friendly chat.

Food advocates

Milliken and Gomez are in the country as part of a larger trip organised by Share Our Strength. Says Gomez in her Southern drawl, “We’re both really passionate about the advocacy work that we do. In the US right now, chefs have really taken on advocacy.” As part of their trip, they’re going to be meeting with chefs in the country and seeing how their funding of Akshaya Patra (via Share our Strength, where Milliken is on the board) is impacting the lives of children across the country. The duo unsurprisingly is excited to see how food is cooked at the scale demanded, with Gomez explaining, “Their kitchens put out upwards of 100,000 meals a day.” They’re looking for lessons to take back home, where, as Milliken explains it, “Kids, by the time they get to school – their palates are conditioned to only want to eat sugar, fat and salt. Food that is really just not healthy.”

For the next few days though, there’s an excitement to explore the city, from its food offerings to its markets, docks and tourist sights. Gomez says the inspiration for her aforementioned paella came from the fact that, “Bombay is such a great seafood city.” She’s especially looking forward to her visit to Sassoon Dock. Milliken’s Border Grill may serve up ‘Modern Mexican’, but as she makes clear during our conversation, her cooking is defined by her travels. She’s always excited to go beyond the fare she’s learned while travelling through Mexico, from the capital Mexico City to Pueblo and beyond. Before Mumbai, she was in Cairo and she looks at travel as a way to explore the world and the food being served by different cultures.

Gomez, who’s carved an identity for herself as a first-generation immigrant from Kerala is seeking to broaden her culinary horizons and synthesise the inspirations and techniques she’s learned while travelling the world. Both see this weekend’s pop-up as a part of that journey, extending from India back to their kitchens in the US.

386,2020/01/30,This Chennai restobar serves bubblegum and 'kadala mittai' flavoured cocktails,"“Friendu, love-matteru, feel ayitaapla, half saapita cool ayiduvaa pulae...”

For most fans of Tamil cinema, an instant grin would break out remembering the famous dialogue from Vijay Sethupathi’s Idharkuthane Aasaipattai Balakumara. That is exactly what The Cycle Gap wants Chennaiites to do: smile and bask in nostalgia, surrounded by all things that resonate with the city’s vibe. Posters of movie dialogues, motorbike parts hanging on a wall, a pool table, and all things quirky make up the resto-bar’s atmosphere.

“Your neighbourhood pub next-door,” is how one of the four partners, Raghu Raman, describes The Cycle Gap, which opened its first outlet in Anna Nagar two years ago.

The Adyar branch, just under two months old, seeks to give customers more of the same.

“The feeling we are aiming for is ‘glocal’. Be it ambience or drinks and food, they are global flavours with a smattering of local influences,” adds Raghu.

Take for instance, the kadala podu cocktail, our favourite among what the mixologist serves us. On the rocks, this is a drink you would sip leisurely: strong, with a kadala mittai-infused bourbon, it delivers quite a kick. An after-taste of roasted peanuts is a stand-out feature here, as is the clothes peg attached to the glass to hold up a little bag of peanut barfi. Another hit is the ‘Milo ma’ cocktail — a glorious concoction of bourbon and everyone’s favourite childhood drink.

The food menu has a ‘specialty’ page, that is street food-themed, in tune with everything else here. Like the thallu vandi they use to cart and serve food on busy nights. The potlam chicken varuval (chicken masala wrapped in banana leaf) is tender and has the right amount of spice to balance the hit from cocktails. However, the sumptuous-sounding kozhi vada (chicken-flavoured dal vada) turns out bland and lacks crunch.

Meanwhile, cocktails keep flowing: silver pigeon is an amalgamation of sugarcane juice and jeera water with vodka, which is subtle and soothing. The palm toddy, a refreshing mix of chilled coconut water and rum, has ice fruit jubes at the bottom, which fuse with the drink to produce a unique colour. Surreal.

While service is uniformly efficient, the best part of the night is salsa and bachata dancers sashaying around (every Thursday). The pub has special nights for two-piece bands, standup comics and DJs too.

Back to the food: annanas paneer tikka comes with a sweet chutney. The pineapple yoghurt mix though, isn’t spicy like the menu promises, and in fact, quite bland. But the beer-battered mushrooms it accompanies more than make up for it, and there is plenty to go around.

For the main course, the thin-crust chicken pizza made with in-house dough is delicious, but not filling. So we order a couple of soft rotis and a solid, simple chicken makhani with generous chunks of meat to comfortingly end the night.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/j2xwfj/article30693926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31MPreviewBoomboomerjpg1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/local-cocktail-flavours-at-chennais-new-bar/article30693928.ece

The union has declared that if their demands on wage revision are not met, the employees would start an indefinite strike on April 1.

Besides January 31 and February 1, they have announced a strike on March 11, 12 and 13. The strike call has been backed by 10 lakh bank employees and officers represented by All India Bank Employees’ Association, All India Bank Officers’ Confederation, National Confederation of Bank Employees, All India Bank Officers’ Association, Bank Employees Federation of India, Indian National Bank Employees’ Federation, Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress, National Organisation of Bank Workers, and National Organisation of Bank Officers.

Devidas Tuljapurkar, convener, UFBU, said in Maharashtra around 40,000 employees in 10,000 branches of 20 public sector banks, private banks, foreign banks and two regional rural banks will participate in the strike.

“The wages are revised on the basis of the unions’ demands in discussion with the IBA. For about more than 27 months, bankers have not come forward with respectable offer on wage revision and improvements in service conditions,” Mr. Tuljapurkar said adding that the unions are also demanding weekly off on all Saturdays.

The UFBF convenor said even after the Ministry of Finance advised bank managements to expedite and conclude the 11th bipartite wage settlement till November 2017, IBA did not make any offer till May 2018. After 30 months, IBA made an offer of 12.5% hike even when the government cleared a hike of 15%.

Mr. Tuljapurkar said that the employees have been overburdened with all the flagship programmes of the government. like Jan Dhan Yojana, Mudra Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana. and others as they are centered around the bank.

388,2020/01/30,Ministry of Shipping puts over 200 ports in quarantine mode,"The Union Ministry of Shipping has directed all States to put 204 minor and 12 major ports in quarantine mode to screen for the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) on ships docking from China.

The directive, issued by Abhishek Chandra, Director (Sagarmala), Ministry of Shipping, has warned the virus could have an “adverse impact” on India’s maritime economy. An immediate screening, detention and quarantine system should be put into effect including at the 65 EXIM cargo ports for disembarking seafarer and cruise passengers, the Union Ministry warned States on Wednesday.

As part of the quarantine facilities, the ports will have to immediately set up an isolation ward in their in-house hospitals. The quarantine ward could also be set up in a separate building whenever the need arises. The collection of throat swab will be done by district authority, while the port management will put in place a standard operating procedure for disease surveillance for the vessel and crew.

“The ports will have to obtain a self-declaration from the arriving crew and passengers. Additionally, you should install thermal scanners and provide N-95 masks for the disembarking seafarer and cruise passengers,” Mr. Chandra said in the letter to chief secretaries.

Most non-major ports in the country are now in the administrative control of the respective maritime States, while the ministry will hold a conference with all chief secretaries on Thursday. The Shipping Ministry has already appointed a nodal officer to coordinate with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on the issue. As a precautionary measure, the Union Port Health Organisation under the ministry had on January 23 issued a warning note to all shipping agencies in the country, directing them to submit a maritime declaration of health for vessels coming from China and Hong Kong.

On January 17, the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had told State governments that while the risk of global spread of the virus remains ‘low’, the Indian government was using this as an opportunity to review their preparedness and identify core capacities in the areas of surveillance, laboratory support and infection prevention. “All ports must take necessary steps and submit an action-taken report within 24 hours,” Mr Chandra said in his letter.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ministry-of-shipping-puts-over-200-ports-in-quarantine-mode/article30687735.ece

390,2020/01/30,"Woman uses fake PAN, Aadhaar to finance DSLR camera","Vashi police are on the look out for a woman who used a forged PAN and Aadhaar card to procure loan from Bajaj Finance to purchase a DSLR camera and cheated the finance company and the shop owner.

The case was registered last week by Rajendra Sharma (28), who runs a shop, Mango Plus, in Sector 30, Vashi, that sells cameras, mobile phones and accessories. The complainant has alleged that on May 8, 2019, one Pranita Pravin Kale visited his shop to purchase a camera and selected a Nikon Camera worth ₹1.40 lakh. Ms. Kale said that she would pay ₹35,000 in cash and would opt for EMI through Bajaj Finance to pay the balance.

She submitted her PAN and Aadhaar cards and a cancelled Punjab Natinal Bank cheque in the name of Filza Enterprises. On June 8, Mr. Sharma received a call from a Bajaj Finance executive saying they ad not received the the monthly instalment of ₹8750 from Ms. Kale. Mr. Sharma tried calling her number, but it was switched off.

The documents mentioned her residence address in Dighe, but when Mr. Sharma and a Bajaj Finance executive went there they found that she did not stay there.

“The cheque was drawn in the name of Filza Enterprises. They found the address of Filza Enterprises in Koparkhairane and went there.

391,2020/01/30,Mumbai Bagh shows no signs of relenting,"Close to 72 hours after it started, the sit-in on Mordell Road at Mumbai Central is still going strong with women managing their family and the protest for the third consecutive day on Wednesday. The agitation has gained popularity as Mumbai Bagh since it is similar to the month-long protest being held at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi.

Among themselves, they arranged for chairs for the elderly, and flasks of tea with paper cups were passed around throughout the day. Bamboo shoots bearing the Tricolour, which was earlier seen in the hands of the protesters, became permanent fixtures by evening.

The agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) started around 11 p.m. on Sunday with women gathering outside Arabia Hotel near Nagpada. The gathering soon took the form of a relay protest, with women relieving each other and men providing support. By Tuesday afternoon, at least 500 women had turned up, and the road was filled with women and children holding placards and the Tricolour. One such protester, Asma Khan, said she had been coming from the first day after tending to the needs of her family, which includes her five children.

“Women had not come out on the roads in such large numbers for issues like triple talaq and the Ayodhya verdict, but this is a matter of life or death. The Mumbai Bagh protest is a clear message that we will not leave here till the government recalls the CAA,” Ms. Khan said.

She also said, “The very road on which the protest is happening has been left half-constructed for a year and the government is spending money for unnecessary purposes.”

Meanwhile, many people, a majority of whom were college students, started volunteering for the protesters. Binte Muhammed (21), a student, said, “My future depends on the Constitution and if the Constitution is not safe there is no future. Home Minister Amit Shah’s statements were the reason that this protest started.”

Senior citizens too have been participating. Nasra Shaikh (60), a cancer patient, said she came to the protest on Monday afternoon and had been home for only four hours since then. “I went home around 5 a.m. and returned before noon after finishing the household chores and a two-hour nap. Although I am afflicted with cancer I will not stop protesting as long as I am capable,” she said.

Several people were seen cheering the protesters and educating them about various problems the people would face on account of the CAA and the NRC.

“The Home Minister should be ashamed of making such statements against the people of his own country. These two people in the government have lost their mind and trying to harm the Constitution, but now it is the time for Muslims to educate everyone about the laws,” Aamir Edresy, president of the Association of Muslim Professionals, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mlaqp4/article30687722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mumbai-bagh-shows-no-signs-of-relenting/article30687718.ece
392,2020/01/30,Abortion amendment: Mumbai doctor has reason to celebrate,"A Mumbai-based gynaecologist will cherish the Union Cabinet approval to raise the upper limit for abortions to 24 weeks from the current 20 weeks. Dr. Nikhil Datar has been fighting for this for over a decade.

In 2008, Dr. Datar was the first to approach the Bombay High Court on behalf of a woman seeking an abortion at 24 weeks on the ground of foetal anomaly. He thereafter filed a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court demanding that the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act be amended.

The highlights of the amendments approved on Wednesday include enhanced upper gestation limit for aborting pregnancies to 24 weeks for special categories of women, and no upper gestational limit for terminating pregnancies with substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by the medical board. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare believes this is a step towards safety and well-being of women and promoting safe abortions.

“The 20-week deadline caused a phobia which often led to abortions on suspicion of anomalies. The Cabinet’s decision will not only reduce unsafe abortions but it will also save many normal foetuses from being aborted on such suspicion,” said Dr. Datar, who has been receiving congratulatory messages since the news appeared on social media on Wednesday.

According to Dr. Datar, most foetal abnormalities are diagnosed before 20 weeks but abnormalities in the heart, brain and genetic abnormalities get detected only after 20 weeks.

“Sometimes, a suspicion of abnormality is raised before 20 weeks but till the time it is confirmed with additional investigations, the pregnancy crosses the 20-week cut-off. This fear of abnormality getting detected post 20 weeks has pushed women to take hasty and ill-informed decisions. In the bargain, there is a chance of losing normal foetuses too,” said Dr. Datar.

“The extension will particularly help women from low socio-economic strata who cannot access healthcare services in a specific time frame and end up in a Catch-22 situation when there is a seriously malformed foetus that is past 20 weeks,” he said.

Dr. Datar has been involved in more than 120 abortion petitions filed in various courts since 2008. “The Cabinet’s decision is a well-informed one and it is a big victory for the movement of women’s rights and empowerment,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/h7h6qb/article30689563.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30bm-Dr-Datar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/abortion-amendment-mumbai-doctor-has-reason-to-celebrate/article30687715.ece
393,2020/01/30,Iqbal Mirchi assets: ED gets to interrogate DHFL promoter till January 31,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday told the special Prevention of Money Laundering Act court that ₹12,773 crore was siphoned off from Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL) as loans for one lakh fictitious individual customers using 79 firms which were linked to promoters of the non-banking finance company.

ED claimed that the information surfaced while it was investigating the case of money laundering by gangster Iqbal Mirchi. This was stated by the ED in court during the hearing for extension of custody of DHFL promoter Kapil Wadhawan. The court extended his custody till January 31.

ED further claimed that the money diverted was also given to Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited to purchase properties belonging to underworld gangster Iqbal Mirchi. The central agency also said that apart from the loan amount given to Sunblink, loans to the tune of ₹685 crore was extended Faith Realtors, ₹510 crore to Marvel Township, ₹215 crore to Able Realty, ₹392 crore to Poseidon Realty and ₹352 crore to Random Realtors between 2010-2011.

Five companies, which were under the control of Mr. Wadhawan, were integrated with Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited last year, ED said claiming further that it had found digital evidences during the search conducted at DHFL office premises. The agency argued that it needed the custody of Mr. Wadhawan to confront him with the evidence.

Defence counsel Amit Desai questioned the link drawn by ED between DHFL and the money laundering case related to Iqbal Mirchi, and claimed that they were two different cases and had no connection.

Mr. Desai also pointed out that two key conspirators — Dheeraj Wadhawan and Sunny Bhatija of Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited — were never arrested in the case, and said the loan granted to the five companies had nothing to do with the transaction related to Sunblink Real Estate Private Limited.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/iqbal-mirchi-assets-ed-gets-to-interrogate-dhfl-promoter-till-january-31/article30687673.ece
394,2020/01/30,Police deny permission for QAM’s Pride March,"Since 2008, Mumbai has been celebrating the queer community with an annual Pride March on the first weekend in February. But for the first time now, the Mumbai Police have denied permission to the community to assemble at and march from August Kranti Maidan.

“The police are saying they have information from their sources that there is most likely to be a pro- and anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) clash during the parade,” said Sakshi of Gaysi, a collective of and for queer women, and a member of Queer Azaadi Mumbai (QAM) comprising several queer groups, which organises the march. “Hence, in order to protect us and the queer community in the city they are taking this action.”

Ms. Sakshi said the move is disappointing especially when officials cite safety as the primary reason for denying permission and cancelling the march. Besides, the march will require additional permissions to display political sloganeering during the rally that also ends at August Kranti Maidan.

A letter, signed by senior police inspector Rajendra Mohite, Gamdevi police station, said, “We have received information to indicate that slogans will be raised and placards displayed against the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) during the march. Hence, permission for the march is denied, and doing it without permission would amount to a congisable offence. Please note that action will have to be taken if the rally is still held.”

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) Rajiv Jain said Humsafar Trust — a queer organisation instrumental in QAM — had submitted an application seeking permission for the Pride March like every year. “We learned from our sources that they also intend to raise other issues and verified the information with them. When they confirmed this, we told them that they could only protest these issues at Azad Maidan, as it is the legally designated space. They agreed with us and on Wednesday gave us in writing that they would be holding a rally at Azad Maidan,” Mr. Jain said.

But equal rights activist Harish Iyer, also a key member of QAM, said the community had not agreed to such stipulations, adding the suggestion was offered by the police. “We can’t have a Pride March at Azad Maidan. I think the fight to mainstream minorities’ causes is a lifelong one and the queer community doesn’t only exist in the margins or the forefront.”

Mr. Iyer said they also exist in the intersections of caste, creed, and religion. “The CAA and the NRC or any issue that affects anybody also affects queer people.”

Ms. Sakshi and Mr. Iyer confirmed that the community is currently reaching out to political parties for help and could also approach court as last resort. Any decision on the march will be taken on Thursday.

395,2020/01/30,"Two dead, seven hurt as car rams into police vehicle in Ghatkopar","Two people were killed and seven others injured after the driver of a car lost control and rammed into a stationary police vehicle in Ghatkopar in the early hours of Wednesday.

According to the Pant Nagar police, the incident occurred around 1.15 a.m. on Wednesday near the Ramabai Colony in Ghatkopar when Sachin Dhamale (38), an Antop Hill resident, was on his way home with eight other members of his family in a Maruti Eeco.

“The family had gone to Thane to attend a family function on Tuesday morning. Dhamale, who was driving the car, suddenly veered sharply to the left and rammed into a patrolling vehicle, which was stationed outside the Ramabai Colony,” the police said.

The impact of the collision left the car completely damaged. However, since there was no one inside the patrol vehicle at the time, no police personnel sustained injuries. The policemen, who were standing close to the vehicle, informed the control room and ambulances were rushed to the spot. All the occupants of the car was taken to the Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar where Dhamale and his father Vishnu (62), were declared dead before admission. The police said that the father and son were in the front seat while the rest of the members were in the rear seats.

“Prima facie, it seems that Dhamale became drowsy and lost control of the vehicle. We are awaiting an official report from experts with the Regional Transport Office and have also sent his blood samples to check for traces of alcohol,” said senior police inspector Suhas Kamble, Pant Nagar police station.

Based on preliminary inquiries, Mr. Kamble said that Dhamale has been posthumously booked for causing death and injury and endangering the life and personal safety of others under the Indian Penal Code and the Motor Vehicles Act. The police will soon file a summary report in court seeking closure of the case as the accused is already deceased, the police officers said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-dead-seven-hurt-as-car-rams-into-police-vehicle-in-ghatkopar/article30687642.ece
396,2020/01/30,"Boy dies after falling into engine duct of boat, owner booked","A passenger boat owner has been booked by Nhava Sheva police for negligence, after a 10-year-old son of an Air Force sergeant, fell into the engine duct of the boat while going towards Gateway of India from JNPT.

A case was registered on Monday by Sergeant Harvinder Lakhpat Singh (35), after his son Karandeep succumbed to injuries on Sunday. The incident happened on Saturday when Mr. Singh, his wife Amrit Kaur (35), Karandeep and younger son Arjundeep (7) were going to Gateway of India from JNPT where Mr. Singh, originally from Kanpur, has been staying in the township since last six months.

Mr. Singh had taken official permission to travel to INHS Asvini Naval Hospital in Colaba for treatment of back pain. The family hired a passenger boat from JNPT jetty around 10.15 a.m. Half an hour into the journey Karandeep asked for some chips which were being sold at the snacks centre in the boat.

Mr. Singh gave him some money and asked Karandeep to buy it. “While he was walking towards the centre, he fell into an engine duct. On hearing his cries when Mr. Singh rushed there, he saw that the boy had fallen over the engine shaft. Someone from the boat immediately switched off the engine. They arranged for a speed boat and took the boy to Bhaucha Dhakka and from there in a private vehicle to INHS Asvini hospital,” Pramod Jadhav, senior police inspector, Nhava Sheva police station said, adding, “The boy had banged his head while falling. He was under treatment but succumbed to his injuries the next day.”

A case of causing death by negligence was filed against the owners of the boat. “We will be recording the statement of the boat staff to find how the boy fell. There is a steep set of stairs going down to the engine shaft. It is possible that the boy might have tried to peep, lost his balance and fell. We have also asked the owners of the boat to come to police station with the registration papers,” Mr. Jadhav said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/boy-dies-after-falling-into-engine-duct-of-boat-owner-booked/article30687626.ece
397,2020/01/30,"Mumbai and its guardians, through a lens","The landmarks of Mumbai as well as their guardians, the Mumbai Police, form the subject of this year’s Mumbai Police calendar.

Shot by photographer Pravin Talan, the calendar was unveiled by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray at the Mumbai Police’s annual Umang festival on January 19. From the recently re-introduced mounted police unit to a policewoman kissing her baby, each page of the calendar evokes a varied response.

“The calendar is more about Mumbai and its relationship with the police force. While talking about Mumbai, we cannot forget its heritage monuments and the variety of people that stay here. Every picture has a different and a well-known landmark in the background while the police are seen doing what they do best,” Mr. Talan said.

The calendar includes a picture of a woman and her daughter in an early morning workout on Marine Drive, while a policeman is seen patrolling on a Segway bike. “This itself tells many stories. The bike talks about how the police have been adopting newer technologies for policing, the citizens and high-rise buildings in the backdrop signify that the city feels safe and the birds flying around describe the freedom of flight,” he said.

Many pictures do not tell stories directly, he said, such as one where a policewoman is standing in a market during Christmas or another where policemen are standing guard during a religious gathering. Both the pictures are meant to signify that the mere presence of police at the right time is enough to secure the city.

“One of the pictures that garnered a lot of praise was of a policewoman holding her child and kissing her forehead, which aims to bring out the mother within the police officer. It shows a mother's love even as she is fulfilling her duty as a guardian of the city,” Mr. Talan said.

Other pictures include those of Belgian Malinois sniffer dogs used by the Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad and the Quick Response Team practising a river-crossing exercise. “The Mumbai Police are well known for their rapport with the people, which is shown in a picture of Versova fish market, where a policewoman is engaged in a light exchange with fish sellers. Another picture shows a policewoman holding an awareness session for young women,” Mr. Talan said.

Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve said, “Mumbai Police love, understand and care for Mumbaikars, and draw their strength from the indomitable spirit of this city. Safeguarding and managing this maximum city is a colossal task. This calendar captures the moods of Mumbaikars along with the men and women from the Mumbai Police that serve and secure them.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/wt9cps/article30687645.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30bm-Mumbai-Police-Calendar-2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/the-city-and-its-guardians-through-a-lens/article30687625.ece
398,2020/01/30,"Bharat bandh: train held up at Kanjurmarg, 52 arrested","Nearly 60 people held up a local train at Kanjurmarg station for around 15 minutes on Wednesday as part of the Bharat bandh declared by the Bahujan Kranti Morcha against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens. Around 52 people, including 13 women, participating in the rail roko were arrested.

According to Government Railway Police (GRP) officials, the protesters climbed down on the tracks around 8 a.m. and detained a slow local bound for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Angry commuters who were stuck at Kanjurmarg clashed with the protesters. The agitators raised slogans and waved the national flag.

The GRP arrested the protesters and charged them under sections pertaining to unlawful assembly and wrongful restraint of the Indian Penal Code and Section 147(a) (obstructing the running of a train) of the Indian Railways Act.

Handcarts were off the road at Bhendi Bazaar during Bharat bandh on Wednesday.

Officials from the Railway Protection Force (RPF) said they sent reinforcements from Ghatkopar station to manage the protesters. “The agitators had hidden their flags while entering the stations and around 20 of them had come to Kanjurmarg by train. We had deployed additional manpower at Thane station in anticipation of a similar incident,” an RPF official said.

Nearly 22 slow services had to be cancelled due to the rail roko and trains on the Central Line in the morning peak hours ran nearly 30 minutes late. The rail roko was the only major law and order incident during the bandh in the city.

Police officials said there was a minor incident of protesters not allowing autorickshaws on the east side of Bandra station. Mumbai Police spokesperson, DCP Pranay Ashok, said all police stations across the city had deployed additional personnel but there was no law and order incident reported anywhere.

In Palghar, protesters tried to block the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway near Vasai. In Thane district, impact of the shutdown call was felt mainly in Bhiwandi, Mumbra and Ulhasnagar.

Shops and offices remained closed in Muslim-dominated areas in Dongri, Byculla, Nagpada, Mahim, Bandra-Behrampada, Kurla Pipe Road, Kasaiwada, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Malad-Malwani and Vikhroli in Mumbai city, the police said.

399,2020/01/30,Teenager from Dahisar quarantined,"A 19-year-old from Dahisar suspected to be exposed to the novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection was quarantined in Kasturba Hospital on Tuesday night.

While more than 4,600 travellers have been screened at the international airport in Mumbai, 10 patients have been quarantined in Maharashtra so far, including six in Mumbai, three in Pune and one in Nanded. State officials said samples of six patients are negative and reports of the other patients are awaited.

The teenager admitted to Kasturba has been living in Shanghai since August last year. In the first week of January, he travelled to Changsha city by air where he stayed for two days and then visited Zhangjiajie by train before returning to Changsha. In mid-January, he travelled to Shenzhen and Guangzhou. He returned to Mumbai on January 16. Doctors said that he has complained of nasal congestion.

According to civic health officials, three of the Mumbai patients have tested negative for the second time when their repeat samples were collected as per protocol. They are likely to be discharged soon. and will be advised to remain at home for another week.

401,2020/01/30,Meet Bengaluru’s King Richard who travels the world on his motorcycle,"With a name like King Richard, it is perhaps fitting that this 44-year-old Bengaluru-based businessman should be traversing the world on his royal steed of choice: a Triumph Tiger XCX motorcycle.

It was about five years ago that Richard got hooked on to riding motorcycles.After meeting some European riders who had done world rides, Richard came to the conclusion that he too could be part of that club. “I checked and found that very few Indians had done a world ride and so I decided to be one of them.”

In 2018, Richard with his friend Manjunath, did their first world ride visiting 21 countries from Bengaluru to London in 72 days.

The second world ride (that Richard is currently in the middle of) started on August 7, 2019 in New York. The countries he has covered so far are USA, Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Argentina. Richard plans to return to India from Perth in the first week of March after riding through Australia.

With so many months of travel and meeting so many people, it must be hard to pick a few as the most memorable, but Richard counts completing his ride in South America at Ushuaia as one of them.

The End of the World

“Ushuaia, called the End of the World, is located in the southernmost tip of South America. The roads to Ushuaia go across Patagonia and they are dangerous due to strong winds. When I was riding, the motorcycle was pushed about two to three kilometres away from the intended route. Nothing can compare with my pride on unfolding the national flag (for photos) in the presence of many people who were waving at me and cheering.”

Another memory that he cherishes is being taken in by strangers. “There is one person who was exceptional. We met our Facebook friend Don in person for the first time in Ecuador. Don helped us get our visas and when we got to his house, we were given a warm welcome by his entire family. He even arranged for my stay with his cousin and his family in Peru for New Year’s.”

But with the good times there were also many challenges, starting with difficulty in getting custom clearance for the motorcycles on day one itself. Other experiences that have left a mark include getting caught in the protests at Ecuador against austerity measures.

“On entering Ecuador, we were at the scene of a protest. People were throwing stones, burning tyres and had blocked the roads with huge rocks and trees. We didn’t know Spanish and they didn’t know English. We had to signal our request to allow us to go. This meant clearing the road, crossing with our motorcycles and recreating the blockades. Then we continued into Peru and on the second day, my friend and co-rider, Vijay, had a fall and badly injured his ankle. I had to bring him back to India for treatment. After his treatment was done, I returned to Peru and restarted my ride.

Stating that he has felt like giving up during challenging times, Richard says, “But then I have gathered myself and started thinking of alternative ways to move on.” He adds, “My family has been immensely supportive of my passion and encouraged me. Without their support, it would have not have been possible for me to do this kind of a ride.”

As for advice that he can pass on, he says, “My trip is self-financed; there are no sponsors. What I would tell others who are interested in doing this is that great planning (includes checking visa requirements for each country, climatic conditions, knowing basic bike repairs) makes for a great ride. It doesn't take a lot of money but you need good planning. When you do a ride, you feel rejuvenated. And don’t let the hurdles stop you. Never give up.”",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/f129e/article30693332.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29bgmkingrichardmotorcyclist3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/meet-bengalurus-king-richard-who-travels-the-world-on-his-motorcycle/article30693335.ece
402,2020/01/30,A longing for the mountain life,"Fernweh. Google translates this German word as wanderlust. But the English equivalent does not quite convey the meaning in its entirety. It is not just a lust for travel. Fernweh, a compound of the ‘fern’ (far) and ‘weh’ (pain), expresses an emotion that is slightly more complex. It is the longing you have for faraway, even unvisited, places.

The first time I experienced fernweh — or, at least, my earliest memory of it — was in the early 2000s, when Cartoon Network broadcast the English version of the animé Heidi, Girl of the Alps. Isao Takahata’s show, premièred in 1974, was based on Johanna Spyri’s children’s fiction book — published in two parts in the 1880s. Its portrayal of Dörfli, an unassuming settlement in the Alps — with its expansive meadows, grazing cattle and pristine skies — is chiefly responsible for bringing several hundred thousands of Japanese tourists to Switzerland every year. The unhurried happening of pastoral life in the show stirred within me an irrational longing to live in the mountains.

I stopped, not deliberately, romanticising the hills after the transition from childhood to adolescence. Ruskin Bond’s writings on Dehra, much later, rekindled daydreams of settling down in a hill station. But the animé about the rosy-cheeked little girl was, however, largely forgotten.

Then, a trip to Theog last winter, made me reminisce about Heidi and the effect her life in the Alps had on mine.

Theog, on Google Maps, resembles a rough sketch of an upside-down human leg. From the Town Hall of Shimla, a 28-kilometre drive through National Highway 5 (shrouded by the deodars of the Shimla Reserve Forest Sanctuary), will take you there. My cab driver says that even the abundance of lodges, motels and hostels is not enough to accommodate the constant inflow of tourists to Shimla. The bazaars and roadside vendors selling tea and Maggi decrease as you enter Theog, situated 2,310 metres above sea level.

Theog is one of those places whose natural beauty is not blemished by excessive tourism. Its quiet existence above Shimla has so far been largely unnoticed. It isn’t one of the places that is usually featured on the ‘10 best summer destinations in India’ type listicles.

Apart from the Hatu Mata Mandir (a Maa Kali temple) on the summit of Hatu Peak and the Taj Theog Resort & Spa (surrounded by broadleaved oaks and rhododendrons), there aren’t other landmarks here.

At 3,400 metres above sea level (equalling almost half the altitude of Everest), the vistas on offer at Hatu are worth a journey of a thousand miles. The majesty of the Himalayan peaks humbles you.

It isn’t, however, the remarkable sights that I cherish the most about Theog; it is the relaxing ones. They reminded me of Heidi’s life at Dörfli.

Four kids scampering through the woods, followed by a brown pup. A man driving his daughter to school in a weathered old red Maruti 800 with a few baskets of vegetables in the backseat. The amused smile of an old lady as she watched me descend a small rocky slope extra cautiously. The houses, made of wood, stone and slate. Apples within hand’s reach hanging on unfenced orchards. These sights conveyed to me the spirit of the place.

I might never visit Dörfli. But the profound longing I had for it was cured, albeit temporarily, by Theog.

403,2020/01/30,Singapore is on its way to becoming a promising art destination,"Think Singapore and the first thing that comes to mind is the merlion spouting water from its mouth. Then come the glitzy shopping malls, the crowded hawker centres and sprawling botanical gardens. But the fact that Singapore is emerging as an art destination that might soon rival Paris and London, is perhaps one of the world’s best-kept secrets...for now.

The city-state, which celebrates its bicentennial (2019-2020), is home to at least 50 museums, the largest of which is the National Gallery Singapore with over 8,000 artworks. The exhibits are not limited to white cube galleries, but spill over to the streets in the form of graffiti, street art and at least six light festivals throughout the year. The art scene here has something for everyone, from the mildly interested to art aficionados. There are installations in commercial centres, running trails and public parks — the Empress Lawn and Esplanade Park on the Central Business District were integral part of this year’s Singapore Art Week (SAW), an annual visual arts festival. First celebrated in 2013, SAW was started to promote the rising art scene in the country. Since then, every January, the nine-day festival sees a blend of exhibitions, art fairs and talks spread across the city.

As we cross the scenic Esplanade Park, I am surprised to see the number of youngsters who have turned up for guided tours, many with professional cameras and mini tripods. “We call them Instagram boyfriends,” says my guide. “They have infinite patience and can contort themselves to get the perfect shot,” she adds, grinning. Who can blame them? Eye-catching installations set to the backdrop of the tree-lined Queen Elizabeth Walk and the emerald-green Singapore river... if this is not Instagram-worthy, what is?

We stop at The Arts House, a premier art space located at the heart of the Civic District. Built in 1827, it served as the Parliament House of the country until late 1990s, and now hosts art exhibits and concerts. In fact, the old Cabinet room is a part of British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare’s ‘Justice For All’ installation, its chair cushions draped in vivid shades of Indonesian and African batiks. This is part of a larger pattern. Singapore has made it a point to wear its colonial history on its sleeve — many of the city’s most vibrant art exhibits are housed in unexpected places closely connected to its past. One of the country’s notable art spaces, Gillman Barracks, is a British military camp that was set up in 1936. It was restored as Singapore’s Contemporary Art Enclave in 2012. Twenty Twenty, a pop-up contemporary art space near the hip Jalan Besar area, was a ship repairs factory in the 1930s but in its present avatar, showcases works of predominantly female artists.

Stroll out of The Arts House in the Downtown Core of the city, and you will be greeted by the imposing National Gallery Singapore, with numerous Corinthian and Ionic columns lining its façade. This building too has a back story. The 64,000 square metre visual arts institution is housed in what was once two buildings of great public importance in the history of modern Singapore — the City Hall and the Supreme Court. On any given day, the National Gallery is teeming with activity — in addition to regular exhibitions on South Asian modern art, it hosts the Light to Night Festival which lights up nights with projection mapping, food stalls and live music, and a Children’s Biennale which aims to nurture interest in art through interactive kid-friendly exhibitions.

“The idea is to make art a part of everyday life,” says Khairuddin Hori, curator of Atypical Singapore, a travelling contemporary art and augmented reality (AR) technology show. “My aim is to make every project an experience for the visitors. It is not just putting together often cryptic paintings and installations; I want to bring the visitor on a journey, give them various doors to access the art and ways to bring home the art,” he says. Hori, former Deputy Director of Artistic Programming at Palais de Tokyo in Paris, had travelled with his team of seven emerging Singaporean artists to Moscow, Yangon, New Delhi and Bangkok before putting up the show in the National Design Centre in the city.

Art here is not just for enjoyment; it is also educational, and perhaps, a tool in nation-building. “We want to teach people about the environment and sustainable development through art and technology,” says Kay Poh Gek Vasey, Chief Connecting Officer of Meshminds, a creative technology studio. One of their projects involve Singapore’s ‘Changi tree’, which was considered a landmark due to its height before it was cut down during the Second World War. The project attempts to visualise the evolution of Singapore through the rings of the tree trunk and draws attention to the importance of trees as markers of time. The team incorporates Facebook’s Spark AR platform to bring art to life. Scan the QR code adjacent to the installation with a smartphone, and the vertical two-dimensional cross-section of the tree comes to life in 3D, with spiralling texts on each ring representing a historical event.

This marriage of art and technology is an idea that you encounter time and again in Singapore. Overlooking the Marina Bay is the stunning lotus-shaped ArtScience Museum, which acts as an incubator for projects involving art, science, technology and culture. In one of the permanent exhibits ‘2219: Futures Imagined,’ the museum attempts to imagine how Singapore would look like in 200 years, contextualising the predicted effects of climate change and rising inequality. Through five installations set in different periods of times, the work is more of a hat-tip to the resilience of our species rather than dystopian art. In a particular installation, we are taken on a tour of a public housing apartment in Singapore where the kitchen shows how pets and cockroaches provide protein for daily diets as cultivable land becomes a luxury. Told with a liberal sprinkling of satire, the narrative questions the perils of over-dependence on engineering solutions to problems without sufficient investment in human development.

We all know of Singapore as the land of never-ending economic and infrastructural development. But what artists here are trying to say, says Honor Harger, the Executive Director of the ArtScience Museum, is that at the end, what will survive is not the material developments that we made, but the stories we tell and the art we make.

Inaugurating a seminar on “Promoting mental health education for government school teachers, counsellors and NGOs,” the Chief Minister said in the current budget the government had set aside 8% of funds for the education sector.

Higher allocation

He said the budgetary allocation for education was higher than any other State governments. Of the 30,000-odd government employees, more than 9,000 are teaching staff. In the coming years, more thrust would be given to the education sector.

Urging school teachers and counsellors to reach out to students in distress, he said children, who were victims of parental problems face lot of mental stress.

The teachers and counsellors should intervene and solve their problems, he said.

The programme was organised by Puducherry Women’s Commission in coordination with National Commission for Women. Director of School Education P.T.

407,2020/01/30,Migratory birds give Oussudu lake a miss this year,"Birdwatchers have noted a significant dip in the migratory species of birds at the Oussudu lake, a biodiversity hotspot and important avian sanctuary on the Coromandal coast, this year.

“We were disappointed to observe that at least 20 commonly seen bird species were missing during the count. Last year, we sighted about 75 species while this year, the count which is still being tallied and finalised, is only around 55,” said Arun Nagalingam, organiser, Pongal Bird-Watching Programme 2020.

“Distressingly, we did not spot a single flamingo this year,” he said.

The birdwatching and Pongal Bird Count 2020 was hosted by various NGOs and environmentalists comprising Har Gobind Khorana Science Centre, Universal Eco Foundation and Senthamarai Foundation.

The event was part of a number of awareness campaigns aligned to various biodiversity and environmental conservative initiatives and activities, including a painting event for children.

The Oussudu lake, which has been notified as a wetland of national importance under the National Wetland Conservation Programme of the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and also declared one of the 93 significant wetlands in Asia by the Asian Wetland Bureau, is home to about 166 bird species.

Birdwatchers cite various reasons for several bird species skipping the wetland habitat, which range from increasing human presence in the area, development of roads, rise in traffic and depletion of fruit-bearing trees.

The bird watch and bird count initiative attracted more than 120 students from various schools and colleges. A group of experienced birders, environmentalists and ecologists led a sensitisation programme on the importance of the exercise and the important role of birds in the sustenance of the ecosystem.

Awareness session

They also took questions from participants with regard to birding and its importance on the ecological balance. An awareness session on the dire need to discard plastic from day-to-day usage and its hazardous impact on the environment and ecosystem was also explained.

A team led by environmentalist Bubesh Gupta displayed various charts, pamphlets and photographs with relevant details of variety of birds, their sounds, behaviour and lifestyle to emphasis their contribution to the balanced ecological system.

Balaji, founder of Senthamarai Foundation, presented the systematic procedure of birding and explained the detailed procedure that every participant should follow such as entering the details like name, photograph and the sound of any bird which is recorded and referred internationally. This record maintenance will be of immense importance for researchers on birds, their behaviour and their unique identifications for future references.

During the programme, participants observed various birds through special binoculars and recorded their sounds with microphone devices.

They later took a pledge to be birders and contribute towards registering the information of various birds wherever they travel in future. Some of the 53 species of birds commonly seen in Ossudu lake included Little Cormorant, Grey Pelican, Painted Stork, Open Billed Stork, White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, Pond Heron, Purple Swamp-Hen, Jacana and Kingfisher.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/e8du0z/article30687190.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30PONDYBIRD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/migratory-birds-give-oussudu-lake-a-miss-this-year/article30687192.ece

416,2020/01/30,CM: State scenario is favourable to industry,"Utilising the entrepreneurship skills of the youth effectively can create miracles, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.

The transformation of the youth from jobseekers to employers will add strength to the Rebuild Kerala initiative, the Chief Minister said, inaugurating ‘Enlight 2020,’ an entrepreneurs development club conclave at Uday Palace Convention Centre here.

The Kerala scenario is now favourable to industry, the Chief Minister said. The LDF government amended seven laws and ten rules for ensuring ease of doing business.

The aim is to make Kerala one of the top five industry-friendly States in the country. That the Ascend investors’ meet held in Kochi earlier this month attracted investments to the tune of ₹1 lakh crore proves that industries are ready to come to Kerala, he said.

417,2020/01/30,Govt. cautioned against going ahead with Census,"The State government should go ahead with the Census proceedings only after ensuring clarity on whether the Census data will be used for updating the National Population Register (NPR), T. Arif Ali, general secretary of the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind has said.

At a press meet here on Wednesday, he lauded the government for taking a stand against implementing the NPR and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

“Even while lauding the government, it has to be said that they have to take a more stringent stand against implementing the NPR. We are now hearing that the government has decided to cooperate with the Census. However, in a scenario where there is confusion on whether the data will be used for the NPR also, the government should go ahead with it only after bringing some more clarity on the same,” said Mr.Ali.

To a question on the Left Democratic Front’s opposition to involving the Jamaat-e-Islami in the ongoing protests against the CAA and NRC, he said that it is an issue related to the electoral politics of Kerala, to which the organisation is choosing not to respond at this juncture. On Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar’s comment that women need not shout slogans, raise clenched fists and get on the streets to protest like men, he said that such opinions will not affect the movement in any manner.

Leadership

“This is a protest movement which has from the beginning been led by students and women. It is not easy for any political or religious leader to take over the leadership of this movement, nor do those who are part of this movement prefer such a leadership.

Varadharaju categorically stated that on the basis of the investigation conducted so far in the case, the murder of Vijay Raghu was committed due to “previous personal enmity” that had been simmering since January last year between the victim and Babu alias ‘Mittai’ Babu.

The enmity started from the time ‘Mittai’ Babu and Vijay Raghu lived in the same neighbourhood at Pensioners Street in Varaganeri, the Commissioner said. The accused belonged to different religions, Mr. Varadharaju said, but emphatically ruled out a communal angle to the murder.

Babu initially had a tussle with Vijay Raghu’s close relative Krishnakumar, which was also due to personal enmity, Mr. Varadaraju said without elaborating further. Citing information gathered in the investigation, the Commissioner said there was no point in giving a “colour” to the murder case. The investigation was continuing to determine if more persons were involved in the murder case, Mr. Varadharaju further said.

Vijay Raghu the BJP’s Palakkarai zonal secretary was murdered on January 27 at around 6.15 a.m. when he was issuing tokens to two-wheelers in Gandhi Market.

To another query whether the name of Babu was Mohamed Babu, the Commissioner made it clear that as per his school certificate, Babu was the son of Mohamed Hussain. Babu was a history-sheeter and had been detained under the Goondas Act in 2019 for his repeat offences before his release early this month. Mr. Varadharaju said there was no case registered against Vijay Raghu.

It was Babu and Hariprasad who were at the murder spot, while the other three accused were part of the conspiracy and assisted by staying put at Vazhakkai Mandi nearby. After committing the offence, the two accused fled to different places, Mr. Varadharaju said.

Based on the complaint lodged by the victim’s brother Senthilkumar, the Gandhi Market police had registered it as a case of murder. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was added to the case and the probe was conducted by the Assistant Commissioner of Police, Fort Range who was nominated as the investigation officer. Five special teams were constituted to apprehend the accused. A two-wheeler was also seized by the special team.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/t7e5gk/article30691765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30JANTH-BJPMURDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/police-arrest-three-more-youth-for-murder-of-bjp-partyman-in-tiruchi-rule-out-communal-angle/article30691766.ece

422,2020/01/30,Avoid cultivating water intensive crops in summer: farmers’ welfare association,"With the storage position in the Mettur reservoir raising hopes of a full-fledged kuruvai crop later this year after a long gap, the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association has urged farmers to avoid cultivating water intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane by tapping the groundwater in the delta region this summer.

Expressing concern over the recent trend of raising paddy during the summer in some parts of the delta, Mannargudi S.Ranganathan, general secretary of the association, said such practice threw the traditional cropping pattern into disarray and would affect prospects of crops in subsequent seasons such as kuruvai, thaladi and samba.

It would affect the groundwater resource and lead to shortage of drinking water as was the case a few years back.

His warning comes in the wake of many farmers taking up ploughing after samba harvest, apparently to raise an additional crop during the summer.

It also comes in the backdrop of calls from a few farmers’ organisations seeking continued release of water from Mettur Dam.

“The closure of the Mettur Dam for irrigation is a right decision. Dabbling in water intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane during summer will completely deplete the groundwater and tell upon kuruvai, thaladi and samba crops,” he told The Hindu.

The kuruvai crop could not be raised over the past eight years in most part of the delta region due to poor storage in the Mettur Dam in June when the reservoir is usually opened for irrigation.

This year, the healthy storage position is expected to help farmers cultivate paddy in the kuruvai season.

From time memorial, farmers have been following the monsoon for cultivation. “The recent desire to have additional crop during summer has made the cropping pattern erratic. Nowadays, the kuruvai season goes beyond June-July and short duration kuruvai varieties are raised as late thaladi. The samba season also extends beyond January and continues into February,” he said. This made it very difficult for insurance companies to fix crop insurance premium and compensation for losses based on test harvests.

“I ask farmers to desist from cultivating water intensive crops such as paddy and sugarcane. Instead, they can go for pulses and vegetables, which are short duration crops and require very less water,” he said. He also called upon the government to issue an advisory to farmers and warn them against going for water intensive paddy crop during summer. It can even issue an order.

Summer cultivation also leads to a shortage of drinking water, he said citing the experience in the Needamangalam belt in Tiruvarur district a few years ago.

“Many farmers had gone for a summer crop then, tapping groundwater using very high powered motor pumpsets. As the water table depleted, households started facing a drinking water shortage leading to protests by women. It led to a situation wherein paddy fields were being irrigated with groundwater, farmers had no water to drink at their homes,” he recalled.

Observing that farmers are known for their pragmatic approach, he said they should be careful in preserving water resources and not create new crop seasons. “We should follow the established cropping pattern of kuruvai, thaladi and samba seasons. The cropping pattern should always be based on the monsoon and geography and not on whims and fancies of farmers,” Mr.Ranganathan observed.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/6b1xwh/article30689250.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/28TYCITY-HARVESTaasdasdasd,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/avoid-cultivating-water-intensive-crops-in-summer-farmers-welfare-association/article30689247.ece

424,2020/01/30,Focus on building a harmonious world,"The emphasis of the ninth Jesuit Alumni National Congress 2020 at St. Joseph’s College earlier this month was on inner peace, and building a harmonious world.

The national congress on ‘Jesuit Alumni Networking for a Harmonious World’ lasting three days witnessed 650 delegates from across the country reiterating their commitment towards checking deterioration of human values and saving the poor from all sorts of oppression.

On the first day, Rev. Fr. George Pattery, Provisional of South Asia, emphasised on Athma Santhushti (inner peace of soul) by healing the poor, irrespective of their nationality and other identities with a profound sense of global citizenship.

Delving into the topic ‘Media and Networking,’ R. Vijaya Sankar, Editor, Frontline, traced the utility of the press and media in upholding social justice and equality with freedom of expression.

Hyper commercialisation of media has led to suppression of real social issues, he said.

Member of Parliament, Tiruchi, S. Thirunavukkarasar, spoke on the potential for the district to turn into the second capital of Tamil Nadu.

On the final day, S. Chenthil Kumar, alumnus of St. Joseph’s College, was elected president of JAAI. Addressing the valedictory session, V.

426,2020/01/30,Indian Super League | Nishu thunderbolt stuns Hyderabad,"Nishu Kumar’s thunderous long-ranger and Gurpreet Sandhu’s heroics in goal earned Bengaluru FC (BFC) a nervy 1-0 win over Hyderabad FC at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Thursday.

Nishu sent BFC ahead as early as the seventh minute, beating custodian Laxmikanth Kattimani with a right-footed drive from the edge of the penalty box off a corner from Dimas Delgado.

But it was Gurpreet who ensured that BFC hung on to the lead that sent the reigning ISL champion second in the table with 28 points, two shy of FC Goa and one better than ATK.

First, he saved a penalty near the half-hour mark from Marko Stankovic before parrying away a shot from 10 yards out off Liston Colaco in the 90th minute.

Set-piece

Earlier, after Nishu had opened the scoring following yet another neatly-worked set-piece routine, Hyderabad was handed a lifeline when the referee adjudged Suresh Wangjam to have impeded Marcelinho from latching on to a through ball from Nikhil Poojary.

The linesman initially appeared to disagree with his superior but the referee stuck to his decision following a brief discussion.

Making a mess

Stankovic, though, made a mess of the chance, sending a weak low shot that Gurpreet saved by diving to his right.

The ball then fell to Brazilian Bobo whose strike aimed at the top corner was turned away by Gurpreet for a corner. The resultant tension between the two sides simmered for the rest of the half as the game witnessed a series of verbal duels.

Looking sharp

The home side managed to shrug it all off and returned for the second half looking sharp. Striker Deshorn Brown, on any other day, could have easily scored three and substitute Ashique Kuruniyan sent a chip over the onrushing goalkeeper agonisingly wide.

New signing Nili Perdomo even hit the post from close range late on and it was sheer luck that BFC didn’t pay for its rank profligacy.

429,2020/01/30,Tough task for Chennai City FC,"Defending champion Chennai City FC will have to dish out something extra special if it has to get past a mighty Mohun Bagan in the Hero I-League clash scheduled to kick off at the Nehru Stadium here on Friday.

The Mariners are in top form this season, having won six out of the nine matches they have played so far. Interestingly, the team has also scored the most number of goals (17) while conceding only seven. Chennai City, on the other hand, has won just two and is precariously placed (ninth) on the points table.

Obviously, everybody expects it to be a cakewalk for the the visiting side.

“We are going to play against a team that will have to win if it needs to stay at the top. They are the favourites and so there’s not going to be much pressure on us,” Akbar Nawas, Chennai City’s head coach, said.

“Mohun Bagan is a complete team and is good in both defence and attack. It has got a good coach and works very hard. It has also got a good bench. It is now up to us to go out there and open the title race by winning it,” he added.

He said the match will serve as the best platform for his players to prove a point. “We should step up and show what we can do. I have told my boys to enjoy the game, but play to win.”

The defeat at the hands of East Bengal last week must have hurt the team much. “We were unlucky. If only we had the chances we would have won the game. When I went through the video clippings it was clear we did well. We had so much positives in the game and, videos don’t lie,” he said.

After the game, the team did some analysing too. “We looked into every single detail in that match. I did some pep talk as well with the players and tried to motivate them. We need to work on a lot many thing but I have belief in my players, the Club and in what we do. Maybe it is just taking some time,” said Akbar.

“Also, whenever there is a defeat you can only go up,” he quickly added.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/tough-task-for-chennai-city-fc/article30693570.ece
430,2020/01/30,Real Madrid and Valencia advance in Copa del Rey,"Real Madrid advanced to the quarterfinals of the Copa del Rey with a 4-0 win over second-division club Zaragoza on Wednesday.

Defending champion Valencia needed a penalty shootout to avoid elimination against third-division club Cultural Leonesa, which had stunned Atlştico Madrid in the round of 32.

Real Madrid took the lead in the sixth minute with a close-range strike by defender Raphael Varane after a low cross by Toni Kroos, who also set up Lucas Vŕzquez’s 32nd-minute goal from inside the area. Vinţcius JŴnior added the third in the 72nd and Karim Benzema the fourth in the 79th to seal the victory for the visitors at the La Romareda Stadium in northeastern Spain.

Madrid, seeking its first Copa title since 2014, has reached the quarterfinals in three straight seasons. It was eliminated by Barcelona in last year’s semifinals.

The Copa del Rey is the only title missing for Zinedine Zidane as Real Madrid coach.

Zidane rested some players ahead of Saturday’s derby against Atlştico Madrid in the Spanish league, including Casemiro, Gareth Bale and Francisco “Isco” Alarcūn. Benzema started on the bench, with Vŕzquez, Vinţcius JŴnior and Luka Jovic playing in attack.

The win extended Madrid’s unbeaten streak in all competitions to 20 matches. It hasn’t lost since a league match at Mallorca.

Zaragoza had been playing well and entered Wednesday’s match sitting fourth in the 22-team second-division standings. It is looking to return to the top tier for the first time since the 2012-13 season.

The Copa is being played in single-elimination games this season, except in the semifinals.

Valencia scrapes through

Valencia beat Cultural Leonesa 4-2 win on penalties following a 0-0 draw after extra time.

Valencia goalkeeper Jaume Domenech saved the first two penalties he faced in the shooutout, and playmaker Dani Parejo converted the decisive spot kick to send the visitors through.

Cultural Leonesa, which was trying to reach the last eight for the first time, had one of the game’s best scoring chances when Juliŕn Luque’s shot from inside the area hit the crossbar in the first half of extra time.

Cultural Leonesa eliminated Atlştico Madrid 2-1 in the previous round.

431,2020/01/30,Bala Devi the first Indian woman to sign up for a foreign football club,"Indian women’s football star Ngangom Bala Devi has become the first Indian woman to earn a professional football contract abroad after signing for Scottish giant Rangers FC.

The move, facilitated by Bengaluru FC which entered into a two-year collaboration with Rangers last September, was announced at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium on Wednesday.

The 29-year-old from Manipur has put pen to paper on an 18-month deal after a successful trial last November and will don the prestigious No.10 jersey at the Glasgow-based side.

First Asian

She will become Rangers’ first-ever Asian international footballer.

“Bala will be a key player for us,” said Rangers legend Mark Hateley, on the occasion. “She has earned the right. We don’t give that shirt that easily! She impressed us all. Amy McDonald (Women’s and Girls’ Manager) was all praise.

“Gregory [Vignal] (coach) was waxing lyrical about her and he is someone who has played at the highest level with France and Liverpool. He could spot the talent in just 10-15 minutes.”

Bala Devi’s distinguished international career began when she was called up to the senior Indian team aged just 15. She is now the current top-scorer for India, netting 52 times in 58 games, and is also the top international goal scorer in the South Asian region.

She was named the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Women’s Player of the Year twice — in 2015 and 2016 — and has been the top-scorer in the Indian Women’s League for the past two seasons.

“I am very excited with this move,” said the Manipur Police Sports Club footballer. “I just want to work hard and make the country proud. I want to also inspire the next generation of kids.

“From childhood I always believed that I could play abroad. In Scotland [during the trial] I was confident and even scored twice. I have played for India for 14 years and for my state for 17 years. I have also played in Europe on two occasions. I am sure I will do well.”

May be a game-changer

The move, according to Bengaluru FC CEO Mandar Tamhane, could be a game-changer for Indian women’s football ahead of the FIFA U-17 World Cup which India will host.

“One of our key points of collaboration was to develop women’s football and this is the outcome of that,” he said.

“Getting the work permit is always tough. But Rangers was committed enough to invest in a legal team to complete this.

“We got letters of support from Praful Patel (AIFF President), Bhaichung Bhutia, Sunil Chhetri, Bembem Devi, Renedy Singh and the Scottish authorities were unanimous in their approval.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hmm44h/article30686711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30-BALA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/bala-devi-signs-up-for-scottish-giant-rangers-fc/article30686712.ece

436,2020/01/30,U.S. Consulate officials explore investment options in Vizag,"U.S. Commercial Consul for South India Manoj Desai, Commercial Specialist Theodore Immanuel and Political Economic Specialist Siba Prasada Tripathy on Wednesday discussed the opportunities for investment in Visakhapatnam with Dronamraju Srinivasa Rao, Chairman of Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA).

“Investment opportunities in various sectors are being considered. The tour is aimed at meeting the officials concerned and explore the feasibility for investment in various areas,” a statement quoted Mr. Desai as saying.

Mr. Desai said India and the U.S. have trade relations for several decades and several Indians are running big companies in the U.S. Referring to human resources, he said Andhra Pradesh has a good pool of educated youth.

Stating that bilateral trade agreements would benefit both the countries, Mr. Desai said that the city was favourable for making investments.

However, the issues pertaining to infrastructure, corporate social responsibility and labour rights would also be kept in view.

Master Plan

Mr. Srinivasa Rao briefed the visiting team on the big developments on the anvil including the city being mooted as the Executive capital of the State and international greenfield airport proposed at Bhogapuram. “A Master Plan with a validity 2041 for the VMRDA spreading over 6500 sq km is being prepared. It is likely to be ready by March. The region is poised to witness growth with the government’s plans for making it education, medical and tourism hubs,” said Mr. Srinivasa Rao.

He also apprised the team of big projects on the cards including planetarium, natural history museum, naval integrated museum. “The Master Plan roads are also being laid. Infrastructure and development projects worth about ₹1,000 crore are under way as part of the Smart City Mission,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/kbr9hr/article30687306.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VZ2USCOMMERCIALCONSULARFORSOUTHINDIAMANOJDESAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/us-consulate-officials-explore-investment-options-in-vizag/article30687307.ece
437,2020/01/30,"Land pooling exercise flouts norms, alleges CPI(M)","Alleging that the State government has launched land pooling exercise in violation of rules, CPI(M) leaders on Wednesday said that that YSRCP government was following the footsteps of the TDP in this regard.

The party leaders said that the government was planning to acquire huge tracts of land for implementation of the ‘Navaratnalu’ and the Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Development Authority (VMRDA) has already issued a notification for acquisition of land under the land pooling scheme (LPS).

The land pooling exercise is being done as per the GO 72 issued on January 25 and it was in contrast to the GO 294 issued on November 21 last year.

Government Order

“The GO 294 clearly indicated that all assigned land alienated to others which is contrary to the provisions of Section 3 of Andhra Padesh Assigned Lands Act, 1977, government land under illegal occupation, land involved under litigation, endowment land and all land classified as water bodies shall not be covered under the land pooling scheme. However, the GO 72 violates all these provisions,” CPI(M) State secretariat member Ch. Narasinga Rao told the media.

Party’s District Committee secretary K. Lokanadham said about 4,663.63 acres have been identified in the Visakhapatnam division for land pooling scheme, of which 1,740.79 acres are under assigned land, 460.42 acres under A.P. Assigned Lands Act and 1,847.76 are under encroachment.

In Anakapalle division, about 1,452.87 acres have been identified, of which only 140.93 acres is vacant land, while the rest are under the specified categories, claimed CPI(M) City Committee secretary B. Gangarao.

Dig at Vijaya Sai

“When the TDP government was trying to acquire land at Mudapakka under the LPS, YSRC MP V. Vijaya Sai Reddy called it illegal. The same party, after coming to power, has changed its stand and is treading the same path the TDP did,” alleged Mr. Narasinga Rao.

The party leaders also pointed out that both the SITs constituted to probe into the land scam allegations have identified about 1.06 lakh acres of government land.

“Why are not they taking those land for the welfare schemes, instead of targeting the land belonging to the poor?” asked Mr. Narasinga Rao.

“Moreover, as per the Land Acquisition Act-2013, land pooling is illegal. The government can acquire the required land as per the LA Act and pay compensation as prescribed,” he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/3njrk4/article30687290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30VZ3CPMLANDPOOLINGISSUE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/land-pooling-exercise-flouts-norms-alleges-cpim/article30687291.ece
438,2020/01/30,‘Pangat: A Feast’ is an empathetic treatise on Marathi cuisine,"If you have read Saee Koranne-Khandekar’s Crumbs! or followed her Instagram and Facebook pages, you would know what to expect of her latest, 213-recipes-strong Pangat: A Feast (Hachette India), which went into reprint within a fortnight of its release in November.

The story is important for Saee, and that shines through in this treatise on Maharashtrian cuisine that taps into the history, geography, culture and tradition that played a role in the development of numerous sub-cuisines within one State, interwoven with a story, sometimes two.

The idea for the book, which discusses the food of various regions in Maharashtra, and Angat Pangat, the Facebook group Saee and some friends formed to popularise Maharashtrian cuisine, happened almost simultaneously, and drew on each other with the common goal of demystifying Marathi food.

Recipes come from her lived experience: her grandmother and mother’s cooking, her own, visits to people’s homes and khanavals (loosely translated into house of eating). Probably why in his foreword, Pushpesh Pant writes: “…part autobiography merging into cultural-social history generously sprinkled with folklore and rare nuggets dug from the rich mines of literature”.

Saee writes with empathy, but also brings in the distance required to write objectively. Edited excerpts from an interview:

There is a lot of you in the book, but almost equal amounts of history and theory too. How did you put it together?

For the longest time, I was torn between figuring out how it should not sound like an encyclopaedia on food, or a listing of facts. When a book is heavy on detail, the storytelling does tend to get compromised, and I did not want that. For me, food is always connected to the personal, and I cannot approach it any other way. About a year-and-a-half into the writing, I gave up the idea of structuring it, and allowed it to flow the way it would organically. Thankfully, my editor Poulomi Chatterjee told me not to reason, and to just write what came naturally.

Often, one’s innate understanding of a particular cuisine translates into a familiarity while writing. How did you avoid that?

It took effort to write with empathy, and not familiarity. The idea was to give a broad perspective. For instance, I have limited exposure to tribal cuisine, and therefore, limited authority to write about it. So, I decided to view it all from the academic perspective, but bring in people wherever possible. That is how the chapter on Konkan Muslims came about — through a friend’s wedding and the unusual feast we ate there.

You have also written about the diaspora, for instance, the Maharashtrian community in Mauritius.

Because of my background in Literature, I am fascinated by the literature of the diaspora, and found a direct connect to food too. People who move away from the homeland adapt, but retain the soul of their cooking. In Mauritius, they make an aamti not using tur dal, but the more commonly available chana dal.

At its heart, Pangat is also a cookbook. How did you list recipes: with precise proportions or in a narrative style?

Despite being a writer of cookbooks myself, I am unable to understand why they ‘Frenchify’ everything to the minutest ingredient. This does not work for Indian cooking. I think cookbooks should aim to educate the reader or cook so they can explore a cuisine, rather than give them a temporary recipe to follow. You have to equip them with the knowledge that will allow them to question and understand ingredient choices. For example, why kokum? Is it for sourness? If yes, can’t you replace it with raw mango, tamarind or lemon? But, in a sol kadi, it has to be kokum. The idea is to nudge a novice cook in the right direction.

This is not to say precision is bad. Use that format while writing textbooks for culinary schools, not for cooking enthusiasts.

How did you decide on the ratio between stories and recipes?

I struggled and then gave up. There were portions that stood on their own, even when academically written. Others needed personal stories; that’s how the wedding story came in. When you read the recipe, you will make the connect. Likewise, when I speak about Koli fisherwoman Vatsala and curtains of bombil, or the gluten-based halwa of Bene Israel cuisine, you get a fair idea of the atmosphere the chapter is set in.

439,2020/01/30,A living dialogue,"The modern acting hardly brings forth a creative and nuanced interpretation of the text and no longer reacts creatively to fictional stimuli. It fails to stay away from mimicry, imitation and exhibitionism and the pithy observation of the reputed critic Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, “We have actors but not the art of acting”, has become a lived reality. It prompted a celebrated theatre personality and author Parveen Shekhar to jog our memory about a fast-dwindling romantic art, theatre.

“Theatre is more than a career or an activity that facilitates entry to television and film. It is a creative exploration of the self, and a quest for starting a living dialogue with all that enriches ephemeral and eternal world,” articulates Parveen Shekhar in his adroitly conceived book,”Rang Srijan” recently published by Aashu Prakashan, Allahabad.

The gracefully slender book carrying a well thought out blend of insightful articles, reportage, features and conversation with prominent playwrights theatre practitioners engages intellectually with the nagging questions raised by a medium that offers tremendous potential for creativity. It is theatre that invests words with feelings through the prism of action, gesture and intonation. The first chapter “life via theatre” opens new possibilities and perspectives on an art form that stands independent of the written word.

Parveen is of the view that the sensitive world of theatre is alien to concepts such as “restriction”, “prohibited” and “no entry”. and it puzzles many to find someone in a rehearsal in a fast-paced world where the threat of identity crisis looms large. Parveen rightly asserts that it is an art exclusively linked with live performance. Here everything owes its existence present whereas in television and films it is contrived reality. The delusion and deception of theatre unravel multi-layered and immeasurable truth.

Parbhat Singh's introduction aptly sums up the central premise of the book by raising some pertinent questions. What is the underlying intent of drama? Is it entertainment, livelihood, preaching, popularity, propagation of ideas or a weapon or gratification of the soul or a quest for being human? To equate theatre with soul-stirring exercise is a romantic concept and both Parveen and Parbhat are in awe of it hence an objective appraisal of a distinct theoretical framework remains elusive.

The second chapter candidly spells out the contours of performing, entertaining and acting and it mentions that enthusiastic engagement of film stars with theatre is not more than a self-promotion activity. In no way, it betrays their dramatic prowess or bears testimony to tremendous public acceptance of theatre. Sometimes, the inner urge for acting seeks immortality through theatre but in many cases participation also affirms the presence of ever-increasing ambition. Politics aside, we fail to find awe-inspiring personalities in the realm of literature, culture and art hence we look up to film stars who hardly adhere to Brecht's “alienation effect” that urges the actors, “to make the spectator adopt an attitude of inquiry and criticism in his approach to the incidents portrayed.”

Elucidating the various layers of passive receptivity engulfing the spectators, Parveen points out that they are continuously fed on cinematic fantasy and reality-cruelty of TV shows and they have become the ‘third kid’ living in a space occupied by the Indian Premier League, “Big Boss and the like.

The author does well to separate the theatre goer from the mass audience of films.Parveen sounds convincing when he mentions, “Theatre itself is an enormous activity where the spectator feels emotionally attached with the dynamics of stage business but he remains active as he becomes a viewer, observer, amusement seeker and social activist simultaneously.” Theatre, he says, instils a strong sense of felt experience but it does not benumb the decision making ability.

Parveen brings together many anecdotes astutely and the fifth chapter titled, ‘sensitivity of folk and folk of sensitivity’ discusses Ram Leela which is deeply entrenched in our collective cultural consciousness. For the author, Ram Leela is not a performance it is a lived reality and ordinary Indian finds himself fully identified with the emotional and spiritual predicaments of Ram. The unforgettable tale may not usher in any substantial moral, social and political revolution but it is the most effective weapon for preserving sensitivity and human compassion.

Parveen discusses the works of Bhisham Sahni, Vijay Tendulkar and Shiv Murthy with critical acuity. The author has a vibrant conversation with prominent authors such as Shamsur Rehman Farooqui, B.V. Karanth, Raj Bisariya, Bhanu Bharti and Ratan Thiyam, covering a wide range literary, cultural and social concerns.

Seldom does one find perceptive discussion on the art of theatre in Indian languages and Parveen Shekhar skilfully tries to supplement that has been left out.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/a-living-dialogue/article30694727.ece
440,2020/01/30,Krishna Kumar’s book takes a critical look at the world to offer solutions,"Entrepreneurs are “trial and error” people, says Krishna Kumar, co-founder and CEO of Green Pepper, a Kochi-based boutique strategic consulting firm. “Less than 1% makes it big in the entrepreneurship game. Some quit, some thrive, some stay, some drag,” says Krishna, who has published his first book, Between Genes and Memes — Life Beyond Hunts, Harvests and Hashtags.

The book, which is philosophical in treatment, has been largely drawn from Krishna’s experience as a consulting entrepreneur and his many interactions with CEOs, leaders, investors, and risk-takers. “What I learnt from these people is that essentially, it is the life philosophy that holds them higher than their business acumen.”

An avid blogger, Krishna says most of the material for the book has come from his blogs.

Edited excerpts from an interview

Why a book on philosophy?

Philosophy is all about wisdom derived through critical thinking, which drives our decisions, habits, and results. This book is a laboratory of such thought experiments and a DJ mix of philosophical perspectives from deep conversations and experiences with leaders.

Many would say philosophers over centuries were mostly financially unsuccessful and lived miserable lives. That perception makes it an unattractive thing. Philosophy is not for losers, it is for all.

So, the book is for anyone trying to maintain their space in this world?

We are shifting from teamwork to specialist jobs; full-time jobs to the gig economy; company branding to personal branding. Never before in history, as individuals, have we faced so much pressure.

We have now moved from thinking about mere survival to the richer meaning of existence. This book is for everyone who wishes to see life differently — entrepreneurship, leadership, education, internet, meditation and more.

Did you follow any particular writing routine?

I write in the form of tweets whenever an idea strikes. Then it becomes a blog. Creating a book out of my blogs was a challenge. It took a lot of time to create a coherent flow.

Writing, to me, is unadulterated self-expression. The emotions are real. My writing routine generally involves a long walk and coming back with an idea to write. Even in the midst of chaos, I write. They are small islands of meditative moments I get during the day.

Who are your influences?

Modern science has changed the way we look at philosophy. We are equipped with better answers and solutions to the existential questions. Thinkers like Yuval Noah Harari, Steven Pinker, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Naval Ravikant, Jordan Peterson and James Clear — have influenced me heavily.

I’ve been reading philosophers like Plato, Marcus Aurelius, Immanuel Kant, Albert Camus, Friedrich Nietzsche and many more. I find Alain de Botton’s ‘School of Life’ videos enriching.

Critical thinkers look at the world to offer better solutions. The proceeds of the book will be used to create free educational content on critical thinking.

What are you working on now?

The next book is coming in 2020. It will be another version of this book, but deeper. If you write 100 words a day, in 7 months, you have material for a 200-page book. The next 3 months are for refining and brutal editing. That is the formula.

Published by Recto and Verso, the book will be launched in Amazon, Flipkart, Storytel by February 10. An audiobook is also on the anvil.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/krishna-kumars-book-is-shaped-by-his-tweets-and-blogs/article30692438.ece
441,2020/01/30,"Between tradition and wisdom, the poet speaks","Poet H.S. Venkatesh Murthy is the chairperson of the 85th Sahithya Sammelana, at Kalburgi, beginning February 5. He is gearing up to address lakhs of Kannadigas, but he is also speaking of ‘mouna’, and ‘ekanta’. Why do we hear only the conch that declares war, and why not the silence that exists before it is blown -- he asks. A true blue poet that he is, he speaks the language of poetry even when he speaks of politics. As someone who sees himself as continuing tradition, he can never separate from himself Adiga, Bendre, Putina or Kumaravyasa. So even when he tells you that every child in Karnataka should study Kannada, he will say it with a line from one of his favourite poems, using metaphors. Venkatesh Murthy believes that language which binds communities, finds its finest expression in poetry and hence he believes that just like the poet can get under the skin of language, he can grasp the subtle feelings of people and be their voice. He is the poet, and the perfect teacher, as he toggles between slipping into quietude and spreading the fragrance of great poets.

Excerpts from an interview with the poet.

The 85th Sahitya Sammelana will take place at Kalburgi. What is the importance of a Sahitya Sammelana to a society?

The Kannada Sahitya Sammelana is very special, it is a Kannada pageant so to say. Thousands of people congregate for the Kannada language. It has no other interest: not of religion, caste, or politics. The Kannada land and Kannada language are the only interests that drives the Sammelana. It is also an occasion to reawaken Kannada pride in the people of this land. Since people gather in large numbers, it is also an opportunity to physically see the Kannada community. It should not be reduced to a fair, it is an utsava, a pageant, procession.

If Utsava and outwardliness (bahirmukhate) form one part, silence and inwardliness (antarmukhate) form the other. We should not lose interest in either. Being part of a community and being alone, both shape the writer. Samsara makes your experience rich, but you also need aloneness to detach from it and look at this world objectively. Truth is important both for us, and the spiritual seeker. But the difference is that for them the destination is important, for us, the process is important. The path is the experience, and literature captures that experience. To burn in the “Vyakta Madhya” (the middle path that is knowable), is the most important in the process of seeking truth.

In this journey towards truth, you take your past along. Without memories, there is neither life nor literature. The present where the past and future find a place is the moment of literary creation. This becomes the voice of the community, and gradually the creator disappears. A Sahitya Sammelana rekindles the spirit of the past, and gives voice to the dreams of the future.

If it is language, land and people that are being celebrated, shouldn’t we call it Kannada sammelana? C.P. Krishna Kumar who chaired the Sahitya Sammelana in 2011, said it should be rechristened as Kannada Sammelana.

Language has no existence of its own. Only when two people talk to each other language is born. The varnamale is not language. The highest manifestation of language is in literature, particularly in poetry. A language therefore, is a vessel of meanings. You touch it and it begins to resonate. Pu.Ti. Narasimhachar called poetry “Ananda Granthi”, ananda here does not mean pleasure, it refers to a rasa sthithi. Therefore, it is through language that one bathes internally. Vyasa, Valmiki, Kumaravyasa, Pampa etc are the writers who facilitate this inner bathing. They make sure that our sensibilities are nurtured in a way that keeps us human. So the Kannada kavya tradition is like an ocean, and the poets who respond to this tradition from their own time zone is the wave from today. A new note to an ancient music. What I write is my contribution to the present and future, even as I hold a mirror to the past. What we do in the present is to reorganize/reset tradition. It is like Pampa looking into a mirror today, and adjusting his hair.

Since literature captures life, it is Kannada Sahitya Sammelana.

You have said that the writer is the coming together of ‘lokanta’ and ‘ekanta’. It is also the coming together of ‘sadya’ and ‘shashwata’. In other words, this mega event is to uphold the community spirit, but over the years it is all about celebrating individuals. The controversies around the choice of the chairperson is also perhaps coming from here.

Let me look at it differently. The community wants to speak, and they do so through the writer. He gives expression to their dreams, desires, opinions and aspirations. He becomes the language through which they speak, and he thereby preserves both the Yugadharma and Atmadharma. To use an example from music, it is like chorus singing. You can hear the numerous voices in it, but you also hear it as one. Like VIBGYOR. So when the poet speaks, the common man feels: “I wanted to say this, but Bendre said it!”

However, as you say, today’s emphasis is on separateness. Red is different, blue is different etc. We have lost the ability to coalesce everything into a single colour. Mix or mishra is always beautiful, it is sad that we no longer seem to appreciate it.

We had writers like Rajaratnam, Aa. Na. Krishna Rao, and Ma. Ramamurthy who literally waited on Kannada all their lives. They called themselves ‘paricharakaru’, took Kannada across the length and breadth of the state. We had writers like V. Seetharamaiah, and T.S. Venkanaiah who through their lives gave us the model for a Kannada way of life, the Kannada emotional world etc. It is true of Shivaram Karanth and Masti as well. They lived a life larger than their own, constantly energising the Kannada community. We have lost those people, and we have lost that Kannada world too.

Creation is as important as transmission. So in our Kannada literary world, the creators and transmitters have co-existed. For instance, Kuvempu created, B.M. Shri transmitted. In our own times, it was A.K. Ramanujam who took the vachanakaras and contemporary writers to the larger world. While there is the deity who resides in the sanctum sanctorum, we have deities who come out for festive processions as well. We need people who sit in the dark and meditate for light, and we need people who go from house to house distributing light as well. Literature has to spread through resonance. Rajaratnam and V. Seetharamaih believed in the resonance method. Bendre and Adiga did the same. Pu.Ti. Na on the other hand was such an introvert, that he chose the reflective method. Even in a public speech, after the opening line, ‘Dear Friends’, Putina would speak only to himself, slipping into his personal world of Valmiki, Vyasa, Vedanta...

Today, we have drowned ourselves in cacophony, both the soft tones of the ‘bhavageethe’ and the majesticity of the ‘yakshagana’ are drowned in this noise.

Almost in every Sahitya Sammelana the agenda is to ‘Save Kannada’, and that Kannada should be the medium of instruction. Why is it that we have not been able to influence a sound policy decision?The government apart from shutting down schools, is also not sure if Kannada should be the medium of instruction.

I know for sure that in Karnataka the emphasis should be on Kannada. We have to give it supremacy. Without speaking or thinking in Kannada, you cannot create the language. A language has to be put to constant use, it has to be born again and again from time to time. Sambhavami Yuge Yuge.

The other thing is as the late U.R. Ananthamurthy emphatically maintained all his life, common schools are the only hope. Primary schooling has to be done in Kannada. Only regional language learning gives you experience, else you will only be a storehouse of data. English can be taught as a language, but Kannada must be made compulsory. The language of the streets has to become the language of education.

And as far as government policy on mother tongue is concerned, it is the problem of becoming cosmopolitan. Look what has happened to Mumbai, where is Marathi? Similarly with Bangalore. Also, now parents can decide what language their children should learn, and they can even go to court. But a more serious problem is that our children also go to English schools, it scares me. Do you remember Adiga’s line “Tanna Kishkindege Taane Pahare”? We build walls for protection and they become our prisons. This has to be discussed at the national level.

Isn’t it sad that Halegannada, Kumaravyasa, Pampa... are all confined to research students?

We have to get children hooked on to the taste of Kannada, we have to work like the teaser of a film. A few years ago, a group of professionals came to me with the desire to study halegannada. I devised a programme for them and for three odd years we did it every month. There is no meaning in hopelessness. Each of us have to do our bit. You cannot sit in your ivory tower and expect Bhuvaneshwari to sort it out.

Rajarathnam was a foot soldier who travelled tirelessly, but I tried it in St. Joseph’s college where I taught. We should all do it in our own spheres.

As the chairperson of Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, what do you consider your inheritance and what is your responsibility?

Whatever I have received (Pitrarjita) and whatever I have earned (Svayarjita) forms my inheritance. Pampa, Ranna, Bendre, Kuvempu, Adiga, Kanakadasa, Sufis, Tirumalamba, Janakamma... all of this is my inheritance. This is my inheritance and that of all Kannadigas as well. My responsibility is to make this inheritance my nityakarma (daily routine). To think, to read, to experience and to dream in Kannada. It is not even ‘read’, it has to be the ‘parayana’ (recitation from memory) of Kannada. Because Kannada was recited, our farmers could speak of Sarvajna, Kanakadasa, or Nijaguna Shivayogi like their own. All these memories are getting eroded, there is a strange forgetfulness (vismarane) that engulfs us now.

All the past masters are looking at the present with curiosity, we have a responsibility to fulfill. Won’t my grandfather ask me, “I bequeathed my property to you, what have you done with it?”

I remember your peom, Americadalli Billu Habba?

Yes. Let the Krishnas and Balaramas of this world go to Mathura and showcase their talent, but as in the poem, I want to ask, “when will you come back to Dwaraka?” Only the old remain in Dwaraka. To use Ekkundi’s line: “Amma, Nimma manegalalli kandirenu kandana?” If you don’t mind the language of metaphors, that mother is Kannadavaa, as well as Bharatha Mathe.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/q8046c/article30690848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGF2,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/between-tradition-and-wisdom-the-poet-speaks/article30690856.ece
442,2020/01/30,What to do on a Sunday at Cubbon Park,"Skating classes

Where: Near State Central Library

Founder of Bengaluru Skaters, Divye Karde says, “People in India mostly pick up the skates for competitive events; nobody does it for fun.” This led him to start the group in 2017 to promote freestyle, fitness and recreational skating, and for free. Stating that there are nearly 500 people who are a part of the group on the Meetup app, Divye says, “We have had people whose childhood dream was to learn skating and they learnt with us.”

The group meets from 8 am to 1 pm with students’ ages ranging from four to 50. “Initially, it was aimed at adults because there are coaching classes for children but adults don’t find a safe and judgement-free space to learn. However, we do see many children because people are more concerned about their children learning to skate.” As for who train the students, he says, “There are 10 to 15 people who are equipped to teach. I’m always there to help as well. It is free for all, learn at your own pace.”

As for potential students, RSVP on the Meetup app or just turn up at the park.

Standup comedy

Where: Near KSLTA

Suno Bey comprising engineers-turned-comedians Debasish Rath, Rishabh Kanishka, Jitesh Hingorani, Sid Agarwal and Kritesh Singh was started one-and-a-half years ago. The collective has been performing and organising free open mics at the park since the beginning, come rain or shine. Says Debasish, “I don’t think there is anything more happening on a Sunday morning than Cubbon Park. We do two or three rounds of open mic, starting at 8.30 am. It is a true open mic because it is not curated; anyone can perform. Just walk in, touch base with one of us, say ‘I want to perform’ and wait for your turn.”

Where: Near State Central Library

Started by Manmeet, Let’s Laugh Together organises free open mics at Cubbon Park on Saturday and Sunday. Says Somnath Padhy, who has been doing standup full time since 2016, “There are open mics through the week but those are ticketed and comedians who are a little experienced participate in those. With Let’s Laugh Together, very new comedians have an opportunity to try out their material. There is no pressure.”

Cultural programme

Where: At bandstand

Says Deputy Director of Horticulture Department (Cubbon Park) G Kusuma, “The Horticulture Department organises cultural programmes at bandstand from 7 to 8 am. Usually, from 8 am to 9 am, the programme is organised by Department of Women and Child Welfare. The departments conduct the programmes in coordination with Universal Art Foundation, a private foundation.”

As for the purpose behind holding these programmes, she adds, “It’s held to entertain the public and to have a pleasant atmosphere.”

Dog park

Where: Near State Central Library

Come morning, and you will see dogs of all breeds and sizes being led (or leading their pet parent) towards an enclosed area near State Central Library. The Dog Park is an informal space where dogs can gambol, nose around and play to their heart’s content. The only requirements being that your pet can handle that many people milling around and most importantly, is friendly with other dogs.

Skateboarding classes

Where: Near KSLTA

Amit Subba of Holystoke Collective has been teaching skateboarding at the park for the last three years. “I was part of Holystoke Collective, which was promoting skateboarding in India. They started teaching skateboarding and I also got into it.” Says Amit, “It is not just children who want to learn. I have students aged five to 45 and even 60. For example, some people always wanted to try it out but never got that opportunity. It is late but never too late.”

While classes usually last an hour (they are held at different locations across the city), it is two hours at the park, 8 am onwards. “It is nice; it is morning and it is fresh. Everyone ends up doing it for more than two hours. Even I don’t realise sometimes.” laughs Amit.

443,2020/01/30,Tinkle turns 40,"“The festivities have just begun,” exclaims Savio Mascarenhas. The group art director of Amar Chitra Katha (ACK) Private Ltd is gearing up for the 40th special birthday celebrations of Tinkle.

Sharing the news ahead of coming to participate in the Children’s Art Fest 2020 in the city, Savio says. “From this January, each issue of Tinkle will have an activity and a single piece of jigsaw puzzle. Readers have to collect the pieces, complete the jigsaw picture and send it to us by November, when we have the final celebrations. A line-up of new activities will follow,” he says. For instance In ‘Spot the 40’ activity, readers have to spot the number 40 on Tinkle’s cover page.

Having begun his career as a copy writer in advertising, Savio joined Tinkle as an illustrator and then became an art director. “It has been a fantastic journey; this is my 26th year here, ” he smiles.

Tinkle’s YouTube videos are in sync with the changing times. He says, “Ever since we launched the channels last year, they have become popular.” In the 40-second animated video, Savio teaches basics of drawing. Be it the fun-loving Shikari Shambu or the village simpleton Suppandi - making of these comic characters get a digital display.

From creating Mopes and Purr, a dog-cat detective duo, to Shambhu and Suppandi, Savio has a come a long way. The huge demand for Suppandi stories encouraged Savio to create Suppandi 48, a magazine for comic lovers. “We created another character Super Suppandi, which existed in Suppandi’s mind.” It is a challenge and pressure to satisfy their loyal readers. “Characters and storyline evolve and change based on feedback . One such character created was Dental Diaries and the comedy horror segment.”

He admits that growing is tougher and it’s challenging to bring children closer to books as they get distracted by the digital world. “We try our best to be contemporary and today’s kids want stories with mysteries and adventures. There has been a fall in reader numbers as their time is now taken up with devices. But our storytelling sessions and workshops help us to increase our readership.” Savio keeps coming to Hyderabad to participate in session at ACK Learning Centre in Jubilee Hills.

He however shares that ACK does not want to go the digital way as they want children to buy books to read. “During our interactions with parents and teachers, we extol the joys of holding a book and reading. Many parents believe reading from a book is a necessity and if they do not want to give their child a device, the word of caution has to come from them.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/bqmwvv/article30691385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym29savio,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/amar-chitra-katha-ack-private-ltd-gears-up-for-the-40th-special-birthday-celebrations-of-for-tinkle/article30691387.ece
444,2020/01/30,Shaheen falcon spotted at an apartment in Thiruvananthapuram,"When Gopal Krishnakumar, a student of Christ Nagar College, Maranalloor, woke up to strange noises outside his bedroom window, he assumed it was the usual ruckus created by pigeons that infest his apartment complex at Mannanthala. As the commotion persisted, he walked over to the window and was surprised to see a bird slightly larger than a crow sitting on the ledge, making a meal of a pigeon it had caught. As it looked different from the common birds of prey like Kite, he called over his parents to show them the ‘visitor’. The bird appeared to be totally nonchalant about all the attention it was receiving, and when the sliding window was opened to take better pictures using the mobile phone, it just gave a piercing stare and continued with its breakfast.

When Gopal’s father, C Krishnakumar, my colleague at the Asian School of Business, Trivandrum showed me the pictures, I literally jumped off my seat — for, the bird was a ‘Shaheen Falcon’ also known as Indian Peregrine Falcon, the fastest bird in the world! The Shaheen Falcon (scientific name: Falco peregrinus peregrinator) is a subspecies of the Peregrine Falcon and usually feeds on small and medium-sized birds. What makes it unique from other raptors is the characteristic hunting style — called the ‘stoop’ — the bird does a high speed dive from a great height and strikes its prey at a very high speed, often in excess of 300 kmph! Now remember that this is the typical speed of a bullet train and almost three times the speed of a cheetah!

While migratory species of Falcons like Amur Falcon and Peregrine Falcon have been sighted on the outskirts of the city, this is perhaps the first reported sighting of a Shaheen Falcon from the city. A quick check in Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s eBird database revealed no past reports and most of the senior birders in the city also confirmed the same. Peregrine falcons are usually found along mountain ranges and river valleys, but it is not unusual to find them in cities, especially in high rises where they are able to find prey like pigeons and other small birds very easily. They usually build their nest in the mountain cliffs, which also serve as ambush points for them to wait for the prey and launch the aerial assault after spotting the same.

The distinguishing mark that separates Shaheen Falcons from Peregrine is the white colour around their throats. The bird is usually spotted alone and Peregrine falcons are known to mate for life — like hornbills.

Gopal’s sighting has created a buzz among bird watchers in the city and you might actually find most of them with their heads turned upward to get a glimpse of the rare avian!

445,2020/01/30,Novel coronavirus: WHO to reconvene Emergency Committee meeting today,"The World Health Organization will be reconvening the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on Thursday (January 30) to decide whether the current outbreak of novel coronavirus constitutes a ‘public health emergency of international concern’. The WHO announced the decision last night.

The Emergency Committee last met on January 22-23 to decide if the outbreak was a public health concern. But the WHO did not declare it as a public health emergency then due to a split verdict of the committee.

There have been at least 7,711 cases reported from all the 31 provinces in mainland China so far. The number of deaths stand at 170. There were 1,737 cases and 38 deaths reported from mainland China on Wednesday, according to the China’s National Health Commission.

There have been around 70 cases recorded from 15 countries. Most cases reported from other countries have been in people who have travelled from China, particularly from the city of Wuhan, which is the epicentre of novel coronavirus outbreak.

“But some person-to-person transmission in three countries outside of China has been recorded. This potential for further global spread is why I called the emergency committee,” Director-General of WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in another tweet on Wednesday.

“People who have contracted new coronavirus are showing a wide range of symptoms. Of known cases, most people exhibit milder symptoms, but about one in five 5 people have severe illness, including pneumonia and respiratory failure,” he tweeted.

He also apologised for the mistake the WHO had committed in communicating global risk assessment. On January 27, the WHO updated the global risk assessment from moderate to high retroactively from January 23. The update to global risk was mentioned in the footnote on the WHO’s Situation Report.

“WHO deeply regrets the error in this week’s situation report, which inserted the word “moderate” inaccurately in the coronavirus global risk assessment. This was a human error in preparing the report. I have repeatedly stated the high risk of the outbreak,” Dr. Tedros tweeted.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/no8a5d/article30689863.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH30CHINA-HEALTHWHO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/novel-coronavirus-who-to-reconvene-emergency-committee-meeting-today/article30689864.ece
446,2020/01/30,Coronavirus | What's new in the China virus outbreak,"Scientists have identified the illness as a new kind of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some of which cause the common cold. Others have evolved into more severe illnesses, such as SARS and MERS, although so far the new virus does not appear to be as deadly or contagious.

Symptoms of the new virus include fever, cough and shortness of breath.

What's new

- The virus has killed 170 people, and the virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak.

- World health officials expressed worry that the virus is starting to spread between people outside of China. Meanwhile, scientists said there is evidence that the virus has spread person-to-person among close contacts since mid-December. They estimate that each infection led to 2.2 others on average, suggesting considerable effort may be needed to control its spread.

- Several countries moved to bring residents home from China. About 200 Americans flown out of Wuhan on a plane chartered by the U.S. government were undergoing three days of monitoring at a Southern California military base. In Tokyo, the second group of Japanese evacuees arrived aboard a government-chartered flight. The European Union was working to bring back 600 citizens from 14 countries.

- Sporting events in China were postponed and Olympic qualifying tournaments were moved elsewhere. The country’s women’s soccer team was quarantined in Australia ahead of an Olympic qualifying tournament. None of the players has shown symptoms.

- Airlines around the world suspended or significantly cut back service to China.

- A family of four Chinese tourists in the United Arab Emirates became the Mideast’s first cases of the virus.

- The outbreak kept many indoors and at home in China’s capital during what is usually one of the busiest periods for tourism. Beijing cultural landmarks such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City closed to visitors, while shopping malls, restaurants and subway stations were nearly empty.

- Villages on the outskirts of Beijing closed themselves off to outsiders, with residents blocking roads with piles of earth and standing guard to prevent outsiders and their vehicles from entering.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7co414/article30644936.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS-24jan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-whats-new-in-the-china-virus-outbreak/article30689611.ece
