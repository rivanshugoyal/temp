0,2020/01/25,"Premier Badminton League | Chirag, Rituparna shine for Pune 7 Aces","Helped by sprightly performances from Loh Kean Yew and the doubles duo of Chirag Shetty and Hendra Setiawan, Pune 7 Aces ensured a winning start to its campaign against Mumbai Rockets in the Premier Badminton League here on Saturday.

The sharp Yew beat P. Kashyap 15-7, 15-14, unsettling him with his quick reflexes. The Aces had been leading 2-0 before this contest, and Kashyap’s upset served as the final nail in the coffin.

The contest had been set up by a win in three games by Chirag and Setiawan, who combined well to post a comeback win over the South Korean pair of Kim Gi Jung and Kim Sa Rang. Chirag and Setiawan led early in the first game but lost momentum soon after to go down 15-14.

“The first set we tried to keep the shuttle low and we were able to do that and we led 10-5 in the first game. Unfortunately, we lost the momentum from there and they came close,” Chirag told Sportstar.

But they didn’t allow their opponents to settle into a rhythm in the next two games. Chirag manned the backcourt, a role different from usual as he plays on the front with Satwiksairaj Rankireddy, his regular doubles partner. By the end of the third game, they were regularly winning points via the smash. Eventually, they won 14-15, 15-5, 15-6.

With her assured, all-around play, Rituparna Das doubled Pune’s lead with a win in three games over Shreyanshi Pardeshi. Pardeshi put up a spirited performance but in the end proved second-best to a sharper opponent.

She retrieved well early on and managed deft touches at the net to win a number of points, but Rituparna was more in her element in the second and third games; her attacking play was more effective. Commenting on the contest, Rituparna said: “The strategy was to push her back and make her move, to push her back and then to hit a cross-court smash.”

Rockets, however, made it 4-2 with Lee Dong Keun’s 15-7, 15-13 win over Kazumasa Sakai.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/ss46qg/article30654251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26PBL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-chirag-rituparna-shine-for-pune-7-aces/article30654253.ece
1,2020/01/25,"Chess | Praggnanandhaa, Gukesh register impressive wins","India’s young guns R. Praggnanandhaa and D. Gukesh posted impressive wins in the fourth round of the Masters category in the 18th Gibraltar Chess festival here as Georgia’s Ivan Cheperinov jumped into sole lead with an all-win record.

Praggnanandhaa, who suffered a shock loss to compatriot P.V. Nandhidhaa in the opening round, has bounced back in style and on Friday won his fourth-round match against Russian Voldar Murzin, like him a teen prodigy, to take his tally to three points.

Gukesh put it across Dutch player Peter Lombaers in 36 moves to join Praggnanandhaa on three points.

Another Indian to shine was young GM Vaibhav Suri (Elo rating 2593), who held world No. 7 Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France, Elo 2770) to a creditable draw.

The top-seed Shakriar Mammedyarov (Azerbaijan) dropped half a point in his game against Leondro Krysa of Argentina.

The top-rated Indians in the event, B. Adhiban and K. Sasikiran had mixed luck. The former was forced to share the point with compatriot M.R. Lalith Babu while Sasikiran defeated Azerbaijan’s Woman Grandmaster Gunay Mammadzada in 41 moves.

There were also wins for Indians players S.L. Narayanan, S. Ravi Teja and Shardul Gugare.

Narayanan is among a bunch of 12 players in joint second with 3.5 points.

Cheperinov continued his superb start as he pushed his pawn to attack on the kingside and was rewarded when he broke through on the ‘h’ file in his fourth round match against Maksim Chigaev of Russia in 30 moves.

Promising Indian junior Divya Deshmukh went down to defending champion Tan Zhongyi in the women’s event.

Important results: Round 4: Shakriar Memmedyarov (3) drew with Leondro Kyrsa (3.5); Maxim Vachier-Lagrave (3) drew with Vaibhav Suri (3); B. Adhiban (3) drew with M.R. Lalith Babu (3); K.

2,2020/01/25,Chess | Anand adds to Firouzja’s woes,"Viswanathan Anand punished a passive streak from Alireza Firouzja in 47 moves to complete a hat-trick of defeats for the Iranian youngster in the Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Saturday.

In this Nimzo-Indian game where, in an unusual sequence, Firouzja moved his king nine successive times, Anand progressively improved his position and forced his hapless rival to resign.

Moves to joint-sixth

Anand’s 11th-round win, his second in the competition, raised his tally to 5.5 and kept him in the joint-sixth spot.

For Firouzja, who led the event in the early rounds, the defeat followed his losses to Magnus Carlsen and leader Fabiano Caruana.

With two rounds to go, Caruana (8) enlarged his lead to one point after beating last-man Vladislav Kovalev.

Carlsen (7) stayed in the second spot after being held by Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda.

3,2020/01/25,Olympic boxing qualifier moved from Wuhan to Jordan,"An Olympic boxing qualifier, which was cancelled in China following the outbreak of a deadly virus, will be held instead in Jordan, officials said Friday. The International Olympic Committee’s Boxing Task Force (BTF) announced that the Asian/Oceania qualifying event for this summer’s Tokyo Olympics will be held in Amman from March 3-11.

“The event, originally planned to take place in Wuhan, China, from February 3-14, was rescheduled after the joint decision by the BTF and the Chinese Olympic Committee to cancel the competition due to the developments regarding the coronavirus outbreak reported in the Chinese city,” said an IOC statement.

“After a careful review of all alternatives, the BTF approved the proposal of the Jordan Olympic Committee today, in order to confirm the competition dates and location as soon as possible, in the best interest of the athletes preparing for the qualifier.” Boxing was almost excluded from the 2020 Olympic programme after a series of scandals.

The amateur boxing body AIBA was stripped of the right to organise the Olympic competition and replaced with the special task force.

Wuhan was also supposed to host China, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia for the Group B Asian women’s football qualifiers from February 3-9.

However, the tournament will now be held on the same dates in the eastern city of Nanjing.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/olympic-boxing-qualifier-moved-from-wuhan-to-jordan/article30654030.ece
4,2020/01/25,Indian women fail to book Tokyo berth,"India’s chances of securing a women’s team slot in this year’s Olympic Games in Tokyo ended after 24th-ranked France handed out a 3-2 defeat in the first playoff match in the World Team Qualification Tournament here on Saturday.

India, ranked 23rd, was humbled mainly due to two stellar performances from 195th-ranked Marie Migot. In her first singles, she brought down 61st-ranked Manika Batra and then returned in the tie-decider to beat 121st-ranked Ayhika Mukherjee.

The results: Women Playoffs: France bt India 3-2 (Stephanie Loeuillette and Yuan Jian Nan lost to Ayhika Mukherjee and Sutirtha Mukherjee 7-11, 11-6, 12-10, 4-11, 8-11; Marie Migot bt Manika Batra 11-7, 3-11, 11-9, 3-11, 11-7; Yuan Jia Nan bt Sutirtha 11-7, 11-8, 11-6; Stephanie Loeuillette lost to Manika 7-11, 10-12, 4-11; Marie bt Ayhika 6-11, 11-8, 5-11, 11-9, 11-9).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/indian-women-fail-to-book-tokyo-berth/article30653260.ece

Saif Sheikh shot the second best score of 118 in qualification, like Ahvar and Namanveer Singh Brar who placed third. He had also won the shoot-off to decide the shooting positions for the final.

In the absence of some of the best shooters in the event like Manavjit Singh Sandhu, Kynan Chenai, Prithviraj Tonaiman and Vivaan Kapoor, Manavaditya Singh Rathore was quite sharp as he top scored in qualification with 121, which included two perfect rounds on the day.

In the final, however, he finished fifth, while Jungsher Virk placed fourth, after having shot 119 like Shamsher Singh Chauhan, who placed sixth.

Asian Games silver medallist Lakshay Sheoran shot 117 and missed the final by one point.

Jungsher managed to win the junior honours, as he beat Shardul Vihan 1-0 in the shoot-off after the two were tied on 44 in the final.

In women’s trap, Rajeshwari Kumari continued to put up high scores, in qualification, and went on to clinch the top spot with a 44-43 triumph over Sabeera Haris.

Rajeshwari shot 117 following a steady series of 23, 23, 23, 24 and 24.

6,2020/01/25,Shooting | Apurvi wins another gold,"It was another golden performance by Apurvi Chandela as she beat Xu Hong of China by 1.8 point in the women’s air rifle final of the H&N Cup here on Friday.

Qualifying in fourth place with a high score of 631.2, Apurvi shot 252.5 in the final.

After two golden efforts in the last competition in Austria, this was further proof of Apurvi sound preparation for the Olympics.

Apurvi was scheduled to shoot one more competition in Munich, but Rakesh Manpat, Apurvi’s mentor for some years, has suggested that she rest and recover for the selection trials to be held in Thiruvananthapuram.

Rakesh felt that the purpose of the European trip had been well served and Apuriv needed the rest and recovery to improve on her high scores.

Shriyanka Sadangi, who shot better than Apurvi in qualification for a score of 631.8, finished fourth behind Romane Matte of France.

Qualification topper Maria Martynova (632.1) of Belarus, finished eighth.

In men’s air rifle, Divyansh Singh Pawar (628.4) and Deepak Kumar (628.1) were unable to make the final, and finished 24th and 28th respectively, which provided a hint about the high quality competition.

Divyansh had won two competitions like Apurvi in Austria.

The results: Women’s air rifle: 1. Apurvi Chandela 252.5 (631.2); 2. Xu Hong (Chn) 250.7 (631.0); 3. Romane Matte (Fra) 227.8 (630.7); 4.

7,2020/01/25,Two teams from TN for senior Nationals,"For the first time in the history of Tamil Nadu Table Tennis Association, two teams will be sent for the senior National championships to be held in Hyderabad from January 27 to February 2.

One State team (by the A.V. Vidyasagar group) and the other (by the J. Selva Kumar faction) will take part in the senior Nationals. Both teams are approved by the Table Tennis Federation of India (TTFI).

While Vidyasagar’s team is named TNTTA, Selva’s is termed ‘Tamizhaga Table Tennis Association’.

In fact, in December last year, the Supreme Court had allowed the interim orders passed by the Madras High Court in April in favour of TNTTA run by Vidyasagar to continue to be in force until the disposal of a suit that involves a dispute between the two factions. A Bench, comprising Chief Justice S.A. Bobde, Justice S. Abdul Nazeer and Justice Sanjiv Khanna, directed the High Court to dispose of the suit filed by Vidyasagar within 12 months.

The Supreme Court, according to M.P. Singh, secretary of TTFI, will hear the case on January 27 on the plea as to whether two teams can participate in the event or not.

“It is a sad day for TN, the State Association, the players and the sport itself,” Singh told The Hindu on Saturday.

TNTTA team: Men: Nitin Thiruvengadam, E. Prabhakaran, S. Nikhil, Ananth Devarajan, S. Preyesh.

Women: N. Vidya, Seraha Jacob, Sharmitha, Santhana Ishwarya, P. Pavithra. Coaches: A. Srinivasa Rao, B. Bhuvaneswari, R.S. Raja.

8,2020/01/25,RFI EGM approves ammendments,"The extraordinary general body meeting of the Rowing Federation of India held here on Saturday approved the two amendments which were necessitated after the Union Sports Ministry de-recognised it for contravening the Sports Code with regard to electoral process.

Mr. C.P. Singh Deo, former president of RFI, told The Hindu that the agenda of the meeting was to amend the constitution with regard to two issues — restricting the number of voters to two in the electoral college instead of the previous three and also barring any proxy voting.

“The general body, which had a full house, passed these amendments unanimously without any dissenting note,” he said.

“Now, we will send the minutes of the meeting to the Union Sports Ministry and the Indian Olympic Association duly informing that the elections will be held in the mid-February,” Mr. Singh Deo said.

“Effectively, there are no issues now with either the Sports Ministry or the IOA. Today’s meeting should set the ball rolling for the smooth elections,” he concluded.

It may be recalled here that the RFI decided to convene Saturday’s meeting in the wake of the Sports Ministry de-recognising it and also asking the IOA to run the show for an interim period.

And, significantly, the RFI also decided early this week to lift the ban on 2018 Asian Games gold medallist Dattu Bokanal as it had also become a bone of contention between the Federation and some bigwigs in the IOA.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rfi-egm-approves-ammendments/article30652932.ece

10,2020/01/25,"Australian Open 2020 | Nadal, Halep roll on as shocks rattle Melbourne","World number one Rafael Nadal and Wimbledon champion Simona Halep dodged an exodus of seeded players as the shocks kept rolling at the Australian Open on Saturday.

A day after Serena Williams and title-holder Naomi Osaka fell by the wayside, second seed Karolina Pliskova crashed out to leave another gaping hole in the women’s draw.

Pliskova and Osaka’s exits mean two of the top three women’s seeds are out of the running, clearing obstacles for the likes of Halep and 2016 winner Angelique Kerber.

Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic, the sixth seed, won only one game against Estonia’s Anett Kontaveit, the world number 31, as she bombed out 6-0, 6-1.

Croatian 19th seed Donna Vekic also crumbled to lower-ranked opposition when she lost 7-5, 6-3 to Poland’s Iga Swiatek, who is returning from a stress fracture in her foot.

Nadal took the court against fellow Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta after staying up to watch Roger Federer’s late-night thriller with John Millman, which went to a fifth-set tie-breaker.

“I watched it until one o’clock — it was impossible to sleep watching this match,” he said.

But he showed no signs of tiredness, racing through 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 in just 1hr 38mins in what he called his “best match of the tournament so far, without a doubt”.

“I’m improving every day, so super-happy. I did well on my serve and hit good forehands down the line, which is a key shot for me,” he said.

‘Super salty’

Nadal, 33, who can equal Federer’s record 20 Grand Slam titles with victory in Melbourne, will now meet either Karen Khachanov or Nick Kyrgios — the outspoken Australian with whom he has a running feud.

Kyrgios, who labelled Nadal “super salty” last year, and mimicked his serving routine during his second-round win, will face his biggest test yet against the Russian 16th seed, who won their only meeting in Cincinnati last year.

Halep put away Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva 6-1, 6-4 to reach the last 16, where she will play Belgium’s Elise Mertens, who won in three sets against CiCi Bellis -- ending the American’s Grand Slam return from long-term injury.

She shrugged off the departure of some of the tournament favourites, saying defeats can happen to anyone.

“It’s just a tournament, and I’m sure that for you guys (media) it’s a little bit of shock when the top-10 players are losing, but it’s life and we cannot be 100 percent every day,” she said.

Kerber beat Camila Giorgi 6-2, 6-7 (4/7), 6-3 to set up a meeting with Russia’s 30th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, who knocked out Pliskova 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/3).

“I was about 40 per cent today of my game,” said Pliskova, who was at a loss to explain her lack of form. “I don’t know. I was just down.”

In other results, Austrian fifth seed Dominic Thiem came through 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-4 against Taylor Fritz, and Russia’s Andrey Rublev beat David Goffin 2-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) to continue his unbeaten start to the season.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ne1vp6/article30651242.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NADAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-2020-nadal-halep-roll-on-as-shocks-rattle-melbourne/article30651243.ece
11,2020/01/25,Brazil tennis player Joao Souza gets life ban for match-fixing,"Brazilian Joao Souza has been banned from tennis for life after being convicted of multiple match-fixing and other corruption offences, the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU) said on Saturday.

A TIU investigation found that the 31-year-old had committed several anti-corruption breaches between 2015 and 2019 including fixing matches at ATP Challenger and ITF Futures tournaments in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Czech Republic.

“The player is permanently ineligible to compete in or attend any sanctioned event organised or recognised by the governing bodies of the sport,” TIU said in a statement.

Souza, who had been provisionally suspended since March 2019 pending completion of the investigation, was also fined $200,000 following a disciplinary hearing in London on January 14.

The TIU said Souza had not reported corrupt approaches, had failed to co-operate with their investigation, including destroying evidence, and “solicited other players to not use best efforts” in matches.

Souza reached a career-high singles ranking of 69 in 2015 and is currently ranked 742.

However, Giorgi cut out the misfires and dialled in her groundstrokes in the second set, striking a forehand winner in the tie-break to level the match.

Russian Pavlyuchenkova battled to a 7-6(4) 7-6(3) win over the second-seeded Czech, who joined defending champion Naomi Osaka and 23-times Grand Slam winner Serena Williams in making third-round exits.

Pavlyuchenkova had a 4-1 lead in the first set and a 2-0 lead in the second before being taken to tiebreaks but won the key points to clinch victory in two hours, 25 minutes.

14,2020/01/25,Google to test more desktop Search design after backlash,"After facing backlash from its users, Google announced on Twitter that it will test more variations and changes to the desktop search results.

Last week, Google introduced a new design for desktop Search that adds site favicons to every result which did not go well with users.

A ‘favicon’, also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page.

In a tweet, Google said it has heard the feedback from users.

“Last week we updated the look of Search on desktop to mirror what’s been on mobile for months. We’ve heard your feedback about the update. We always want to make Search better, so we’re going to experiment with new placements for favicons,” the tech company tweeted late Friday.

“Our experimenting will begin today. Over the coming weeks, while we test, some might not see favicons while some might see them in different placements as we look to bring a modern look to desktop Search,” Google added.

Not just SEOs and SEMs but a wider set of searchers and Google users criticized the desktop Search changes.

17,2020/01/25,"Facebook, YouTube content moderators asked to sign PTSD forms","Content moderators at Facebook and YouTube in Europe and in the US have been asked to sign forms detailing that the job may cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

According to The Financial Times and The Verge, global professional services firm Accenture which provides content moderators for big tech firms has asked them to sign a form, explicitly acknowledging that their job could cause post-traumatic stress disorder.

Accenture runs at least three content moderation sites for Facebook in Europe, including in Warsaw, Lisbon and Dublin.

A similar document was also provided by Accenture to workers at a YouTube content moderation facility in Austin, Texas.

Accenture said the wellbeing of workers was a “top priority”.

“We regularly update the information we give our people to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the work they do,” the company said in a statement.

“According to an employee who signed one of these acknowledgment forms, every moderator at the facility was emailed a link and asked to sign immediately,” the report said.

The Accenture form says workers might review “disturbing” videos and that moderating “such content may impact my mental health, and it could even lead to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

Both Facebook and Google said they did not review Accenture’s new form.

Facebook is facing lawsuits from former content moderators over a range of mental health issues in California and Ireland.

Case of PTSD and other mental health issues have been on the rise among content moderators.

The Verge’s probe last month into Accenture’s Austin site described hundreds of low—paid immigrants toiling in, removing videos flagged for extreme violence and terrorist content.

“The moment they quit Accenture or get fired, they lose access to all mental health services. One former moderator for Google said she was still experiencing symptoms of PTSD two years after leaving,” the report claimed.

19,2020/01/25,"China toll hits 41; virus detected in Australia, EU","The death toll from China’s coronavirus outbreak jumped to 41 as the Lunar New Year got off to a gloomy start on Saturday.

Australia on Saturday confirmed its first four cases, Malaysia confirmed three and France reported Europe’s first cases on Friday, as health authorities around the world scrambled to prevent a pandemic.

The U.S. is arranging a charter flight on Sunday to bring its citizens and diplomats back from Wuhan, the central Chinese city that is the epicentre of the outbreak, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Xi holds meeting

China’s President Xi Jinping, saying the country is facing a grave situation, held a politburo meeting on measures to fight the outbreak, state television reported on Saturday. The death toll in China has risen to 41, authorities reported on Saturday, from 26 a day earlier. More than 1,300 people have been infected globally, most of them in China, with the virus traced to a seafood market in Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife.

Hu Yinghai, deputy director-general of the Civil Affairs Department in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, appealed for masks and protective suits. “We are steadily pushing forward the disease control and prevention... But right now we are facing an extremely severe public health crisis,” he told a news briefing.

Vehicles carrying emergency supplies and medical staff for Wuhan would be exempted from tolls and given traffic priority, China’s Transportation Ministry said on Saturday.

Wuhan said it would ban non-essential vehicles from its downtown starting Sunday, further paralysing a city of 11 million that has been on virtual lockdown since Thursday, with nearly all flights cancelled and checkpoints blocking the main roads leading out of town.

Authorities have since imposed transport restrictions on nearly all of Hubei province, which has a population of 59 million.

The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

In Australia, three men, aged 53, 43 and 35 in New South Wales were in stable condition after they were confirmed to have the virus after returning from Wuhan earlier this month.

A Chinese national in his 50s, who had been in Wuhan, was also in stable condition in a Melbourne hospital after arriving from China on January 19, Victoria Health officials said.

State-run China Global Television Network reported in a tweet on Saturday that a doctor who had been treating patients in Wuhan, 62-year-old Liang Wudong, had died from the virus. It was not immediately clear if his death was already counted in the official toll of 41, of which 39 were in Hubei. U.S. coffee chain Starbucks said on Saturday that it was closing all its outlets in Hubei for the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, following a similar move by McDonald’s in five Hubei cities.

Protective suits

In Beijing on Saturday, workers in white protective suits checked temperatures of passengers entering the subway at the central railway station, while some train services in eastern China’s Yangtze River Delta region were suspended, the local railway operator said.

The number of confirmed cases in China stands at 1,287. The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, and the United States. There are fears the transmission could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel during the Lunar New Year holiday, although many have cancelled their plans.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/tnj78x/article30653941.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26-CHINA-WUHANVIRUS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-toll-hits-41-virus-detected-in-australia-eu/article30653942.ece
20,2020/01/25,Democrats wrap up case against Donald Trump,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyers were preparing to deliver his first full-throated defence on Saturday in the Senate’s historic impeachment trial, after Democratic prosecutors spent three days making their case for his removal from office.

Capping 24 total hours of arguments, Democrats told the 100 Senators that Mr. Trump abused the power of the presidency in pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that would help him politically, and then sought to block efforts by Congress to investigate.

Democrats said they had met that burden of proof, as lead House impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned that Mr. Trump would remain an “imminent threat” to American democracy if he stays in power. “This is Trump first, not America first,” Congressman Schiff told the chamber. “I ask you, I implore you,” he added, addressing Republicans who hold the power to allow witnesses to testify, against Mr. Trump’s wishes. “Give America a fair trial,” Mr. Schiff said. “She’s worth it.”

‘Not impeachable’

Mr. Trump has signalled he remains in tight control of his party, with many Senate Republicans expressing public support for the President despite a vigorous, comprehensive case outlining his misconduct. “I don’t believe anything they’ve said so far is impeachable,” Senator Rick Scott told reporters.

“I’m looking forward to the White House tomorrow starting to set the record straight, because this has just been partisan.”

Democrats argued that Mr. Trump’s refusal to allow top officials to testify and to supply subpoenaed documents to the Ukraine investigation supported the second charge against him, obstruction of Congress.

5 subpoenas blocked

Mr. Trump blocked the executive branch from responding to 71 specific requests for documents, including five subpoenas, related to his pressure on Kiev to help his 2020 re-election effort, Democratic impeachment manager Val Demings told Senators.

Mr. Trump also prevented 12 current and former administration officials, most of them subpoenaed, from testifying to the investigation, she said.

“President Trump’s obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was categorical, indiscriminate and historically unprecedented,” Ms. Demings said.

She said Congress could not afford to allow Mr. Trump to reject its powers in such a wholesale manner.

On Twitter, Trump dismissed the entire process. “The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats have gone crazy,” he tweeted. “They know it’s a con, but just can’t sell it! Public strongly against Impeachment.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/h6kaeo/article29559624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Adam-Schiff,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/democrats-wrap-up-case-against-donald-trump/article30653880.ece
21,2020/01/25,Trapped Wuhan residents stock up,"Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken city on Saturday, as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Lunar New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.

Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others.

AFP saw a steady trickle of cars approaching the roadblocks around 20 km east of the city centre on Saturday morning, only for police in fluorescent jackets wearing masks to tell them to turn around. The barricade, at one of the tolls for highways exiting the city, was blocked with red and yellow plastic barriers and cones.

“Nobody can leave,” a policeman told AFP.

AFP journalists only saw two vehicles allowed to pass the roadblock, including a white van which an officer said was “buying medicines” and would later return to the city. Authorities extended transport bans to 17 other cities around Wuhan in a gargantuan effort to control the SARS-like virus, restricting travel for around 56 million in Hubei province. While there are restrictions on anyone leaving Wuhan, a few people were allowed to enter the city through the barricade: Desperately needed medical workers whose holidays were cut short to help overwhelmed hospital.

An empty bus was allowed to pass the roadblock into Wuhan after showing documentation to the police at the roadblock.

22,2020/01/25,19 wounded as Iraq forces clear protest camps,"Iraqi security forces cleared anti-government protesters from streets and squares in Baghdad and the south on Saturday, stoking fears among demonstrators that their long-running reform campaign may be suppressed.

It came a day after populist cleric Moqtada Sadr announced that he would no longer back the youth-dominated movement, after he held his own mass rally that saw thousands pack the capital’s streets to demand U.S. troops leave Iraq.

By Saturday morning, security forces were using tear gas and live rounds to clear protest camps across the capital, leaving at least 19 protesters wounded, medics said. An AFP reporter saw baton-charging security personnel chase away a group of young protesters. A medic nearby told AFP she saw riot police set fire to large tents used as field clinics to treat wounded demonstrators.

The city’s military command announced it had retaken control of Ahrar Bridge, a flashpoint for clashes between security forces and demonstrators for months.

It also pushed protesters out of Tayaran Square and Mohammad Qasim highway, where new sit-ins this week were intended to pressure authorities into enacting long-awaited reforms.

By early Saturday afternoon, there were hit-and-run clashes in central Baghdad but security forces had not yet entered the main protests camp in Tahrir Square.

Young men had deployed around the square carrying black shields made out of metal drums, on which they had painted the words “Tahrir Shield Squad.”

An AFP photographer saw protesters in the camp dismantling wooden stalls and colourful tents they had set up months ago.Mr. Sadr, a militiaman-turned-politician, is notorious for switching political positions with dizzying speed. He backed the protests when they erupted in October and called on the government to resign — even though he controls Parliament’s largest bloc and other top posts. But last week, he called for a separate rally to demand 5,200 U.S. troops leave Iraq, after a U.S. strike on Baghdad killed top Iraqi and Iranian commanders earlier this month.

Thousands streamed into Baghdad for Friday’s rally and while Mr. Sadr did not attend, he hailed the turnout and said he would no longer be involved in the anti-government campaign.

The about-face prompted reports of protest camps being dismantled across the country. In Hilla, Diwaniyah, Kut, Amarah and the Shia shrine city of Najaf, tents were stripped down to their metal frames on Saturday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/oxw3y8/article30653732.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26-IRAQ-PROTESTS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/19-wounded-as-iraq-forces-clear-protest-camps/article30653733.ece
23,2020/01/25,Putin’s plan to change Russia’s institutions,"After Russian President Vladimir Putin announced major constitutional amendments and the resignation of the entire government of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that followed the announcement, Moscow’s political elite have found themselves in a new, rapidly spinning reality.

On January 21, Mr. Putin approved the new executive Cabinet proposed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Almost half of the Cabinet was changed with main reshuffles concerning the old political elite.

Economic Development, Education, Health, Justice and Sport and Culture Ministries got new Ministers, while the the key Ministers defining Russia’s security, defence and foreign policy retained their posts. Former Economy Minister Anton Siluanov will become a Deputy Prime Minister.

As Russia’s influential financial daily Vedomosti noted in its editorial, the changes in the government showcase the Kremlin’s desire for a more significant team upgrade than ever before, to fill the Cabinet with managers who have demonstrated their effectiveness in implementing strategic national projects, and to get rid of long-standing “irritants”.

Focus on development

As political analyst Evgeny Minchenko told The Hindu, the former government had grown highly unpopular and proven its inability to effectively implement the national development plan aiming at making Russia the fifth largest economy in the world, so-called ‘May Decrees’, announced by Russian President last year.

The new government under Mr. Mishustin, who headed Russia’s tax service before his appointment to the new post, will have a tough task to boost the country’s economy and improve the quality of life of Russians, who have started being more and more critical of the government in recent years.

Andrey Belousov, a close ally of Mr. Putin, will now head the economic block and will be responsible for implementation of the national development projects as Deputy Prime Minister. Mr. Belousov is a prominent advocate of high public spending and government intervention in the economy.

Mr. Putin’s plan is not just a change in the government. He has also proposed constitutional reforms aimed at weakening the powers of the President and boosting those of the Prime Minister and Parliament, which would be given responsibility to choose candidates for Prime Minister and the Cabinet. Mr. Putin has also suggested expanding the role of the State Council, which was previously not included in the text of the Constitution.

It took just five days for a working group on the constitutional reforms appointed on January 15 to come up with a Bill and submit it before Parliament. On January 23, the State Duma unanimously voted in favour of the Bill. To pass it, a second voting is required, which is scheduled for February 11.

The unprecedented speed with which the proposal turned into a full-fledged Bill suggests that the preparations have started long ago. Implementing the plan as soon as possible was important because of the upcoming 2021 legislature elections and the 2024 Presidential election.

It is unlikely that Mr. Putin would exit public life after he steps down from presidency in 2024. It is still unclear what path he would take. He could, according to analysts, become the Prime Minister as he did in 2008, or head the powerful Security Council, as did Kazakhstan leader Nursultan Nazarbayev when he stepped down from presidency last year.

“Putin’s casual suggestion that the status and role of the insignificant State Council should be enshrined in the Constitution can only mean one thing: he is preparing a new position for himself within that structure,” said Andrey Kolesnikov, a senior fellow and the chair of the Russian Domestic Politics and Political Institutions Program at the Carnegie Moscow Center.

He added that if the State Council gets emboldened, it could become sort of a parallel administration. Mr. Kolesnikov suggests a scenario where Mr. Putin becomes head of the State Council and “father of the nation”, while former Prime Minister Medvedev assumes the post of the President (as he did in 2008) and Mr. Mishustin remains the Prime Minister.

The speed with which Mr. Putin has started the preparations of the “transition of power” has caught both his rivals and allies by surprise. With Parliament giving quick approval to his plans, it’s only a matter of time before Russia’s institutions undergo a major reshuffle.

24,2020/01/25,The Minister is on paternity leave,"Even as the U.S. and Iran moved closer to war, bushfires ravaged Australia, ‘Megxit’ unfolded and Brexit loomed, Japan’s January headlines were dominated by a Cabinet Minister taking a couple of weeks of paternity leave.

Shinjiro Koizumi, the Environment Minister, has just become father to a baby boy. What’s causing all the fuss is his determination to take two weeks of leave to help with childcare. The two weeks will be spread over the first three months of the baby’s life. If necessary, Mr. Koizumi will work from home even on his days off, in addition to ensuring that the leave he does take avoids conflict with parliamentary sessions or Cabinet meetings. Given the 24/7 job that parenting a small child is, Mr. Koizumi’s pledge may come across as paltry. But in Japan, it is being touted as an almost a revolutionary step towards achieving work-life balance and redressing gender stereotypes.

The 38-year-old is in fact the first Japanese Cabinet Minister ever to have taken time off to be with his newborn, despite the fact that on paper, Japan has generous paternity leave laws. Fathers are ostensibly entitled to take up to a year off after the birth of a child (as are mothers), albeit on reduced incomes.

But only about 6% of eligible men working for private companies took parental leave in 2018, compared to over 82% mothers. Of those men who did take time off, more than 70% were away from work for less than a fortnight.

The reluctance to take paternity leave stems from a work culture that focuses on face-time, expects employees to prioritise work over family commitments and punishes those who do not fall in line. Some men who have braved social convention to take the leave legally allowed to them say that they were demoted, sidelined or otherwise bullied for having done so. The phenomenon has even given rise to a neologism: patahara, short for paternity harassment.

Two cases

There were two high profile cases of patahara last year. In one, an employee of Asics, a sports equipment manufacturer, took the company to court on the grounds that he had been arbitrarily transferred from his department and given ‘meaningless’ tasks after returning to work from a year’s paternity leave.

The other involved a Canadian, Glen Wood, who is suing his former employer, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities, for allegedly forcing him out of his job after he took a few months paternity leave to be with his infant. Both companies involved deny the accusations.

But regardless of the specifics of these cases, it is a fact that workplaces tend to assume that male employees will not share in the care of their children.

The negative implications of this attitude extend beyond the individual to the welfare of the country as a whole. Japan’s birth rate has been plummeting, as women increasingly decide against having children or even getting married.

Japan’s birth rate is at its lowest level since records began in 1899. The number of births in 2018 fell to 918,397 — a decline of 27,668 since the previous record low in 2017. By comparison, in the late 1940s, the number of births stood at about 2.7 million, according to The Asahi Shimbun newspaper.

The country’s fertility rate — the average number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime — also declined for the third year in a row by 0.01 point to 1.42. The level needed to maintain the population is 2.07.

Combined with the longevity that Japan is famous for, its declining population does not bode well for the future of the economy. There is already a severe labour shortage, with about 1.6 vacancies for every job applicant.

Domestic social media reaction to Mr. Koizumi’s decision has largely been positive. But for some, the idea of male employees taking paternity leave remains anathema.

“Koizumi’s an Environment Minister, right? A novice taking paternity leave... Well, whatever, but does he really love his work?” said one post on Twitter, summing up this attitude.

Mr. Koizumi himself appears sanguine as he rides out the storm. He has said that he hopes to inspire others to break taboos. “Unless we change the atmosphere, government employees presumably won’t start taking paternity leave,” he told a group of Ministry officials and reporters earlier in January. He added that he hoped for a day “when lawmakers’ paternity leave is no longer news.”

25,2020/01/25,All the President’s men and women,"The U.S. Senate’s impeachment trial of President Donald Trump entered a new phase this weekend with his defence commencing its multi-day response to the prosecution’s case. The Democrats, who are prosecuting the impeached President in the Senate, are represented by seven “House Managers”, all of whom are lawmakers. The Republican team is a mix of old faces and new.

Among the well-known names is Ken Starr, the former judge and independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton — first over a land deal and then an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s, which led to Mr. Clinton’s impeachment (Mr. Clinton was eventually acquitted by the Senate). Post-Clinton, Mr. Starr was in the news again in 2016 when he was fired as President of Baylor University for his handling of sexual assault cases related to Baylor’s football players. Mr. Trump had called Mr. Starr a “lunatic” and a “disaster” in 1999. Everyone seems to have moved on.

Next is Alan Dershowitz (in picture) an Emeritus Professor at Harvard Law School, a civil libertarian and criminal defence attorney (he defended football star O.J. Simpson in the 1990s against murder charges). Mr. Dershowitz, who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, has said he is defending Mr. Trump because the impeachment doesn’t meet constitutional standards. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Mr. Dershowitz wrote a book, The Case Against Impeaching Trump, and has argued that a crime is required for impeachment, a position not consistent with his own views expressed in 1998. Like Mr. Starr, Mr. Dershowitz also, controversially, helped defend Jeffrey Epstein, the now deceased billionaire-financier, convicted of sex offences. Mr. Dershowitz, sued by a woman who said she was one of Epstein’s victims, counter-sued his accuser last year.

Leading the defence is the low-profile White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who already made his début at the Senate trial with remarks on Tuesday, when the prosecution and defence battled it out over the organising resolution that would govern the rules of the trial.

Strong and silent

Mr. Cipollone was Mr. Trump’s replacement for Don McGahn, who became a witness in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. With a background in commercial litigation and in the Justice Department in the George H.W. Bush administration, Mr. Cipollone was described by Mr. Trump as a “strong, silent, type”. As White House Counsel, he wrote a scathing letter to Democrat House leaders, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in October, refusing to cooperate with the House on the impeachment inquiry.

The President’s personal attorney, Jay Sekulow, less of the “silent type” with his record of prime time television appearances and radio show hosting, is also part of the team. A well-known figure in Christian right circles, Mr. Sekulow founded Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism in the 1980s and was chief counsel at conservative organisation American Center for Law and Justice prior to becoming Mr. Trump’s attorney.

Also part of the team is Pam Bondi, who was Florida’s Attorney-General from 2010 to 2019 before she joined a lobbying firm in Washington DC. In contrast to Mr. Cipollone, Ms. Bondi has frequently appeared on national and Florida television channels and is no stranger to the spotlight.

Next, Jane Raskin. Ms. Raskin and her husband Martin Raskin ran a law firm in Florida before representing Mr. Trump in the Mueller investigation. Ms. Raskin also worked as a trial lawyer for the Department of Justice, in its Organized Crime and Racketeering Section’s Boston Strike Force. During this period, she worked with Mr. Mueller, who was at the U.S. attorney’s office in Boston at the time. Ms. Raskin was among the officials who resigned from the Justice Department in 1988 to protest alleged financial impropriety on the part of Attorney General Edwin Meese.

While there are quite a few seasoned television pros in Mr. Trump’s team, or perhaps partly for that reason, the President, known to have a penchant for optics, has been unhappy with the scheduling of his defence.

“After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud & deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer & their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Saturday.

26,2020/01/25,Always in attack mode,"With music from Wagner’s Lohengrin playing in the background, Roberto Alvim (in picture) read a message into a camera. “Brazilian art in the next decade will be heroic and national...,” said Mr. Alvim, sitting under a portrait of President Jair Bolsonaro. As the video, recorded by Brazil’s Special Secretary for Culture, was shared online last Friday, many were horrified to note that Mr. Alvim had paraphrased the words of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels with Hitler’s favourite opera in the background. But the Brazilian official dismissed it as just a “rhetorical coincidence”.

Reluctant to take any action against Mr. Alvim, President Bolsonaro let him go only after the Embassies of Israel and Germany blasted Mr. Alvim for using the toxic words of a Nazi to announce a $4.8 million initiative to promote Brazilian culture with conservative and religious themes. Unapologetic, Mr. Alvim left the post last week but not before sending a message in which he blamed a “satanic action” for his resignation.

Hardly a week passes here without a government official saying something that causes major embarrassment to the administration. Many statements, including those by Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, have been triggered by a belief in the government that it is fighting a “cultural war with Marxists” — a reference to the centre-left Workers’ Party, which ruled Brazil from 2003 to 2016. “It is extremely shocking to see top Ministers peddling stories that claim that ‘Nazism was a leftist movement’ and that ‘climate change is a Marxist conspiracy’,” says a European diplomat based in Brasilia. “You can’t attribute this to ignorance. This is all by design,” he adds, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Since coming to power in 2019, Mr. Bolsonaro has packed his government with the people who are deeply hostile to progressive ideas. Abraham Weintraub, the Minister of Education, leads the pack in attacking “communists”. In a speech in 2018, Mr. Weintraub said that communists “are the top of the country. They are the top of financial organisations; they are the owners of newspapers; they are the owners of large companies; they are the owners of monopolies...” After the speech made noise across the country, Gerd Wenzel, a columnist for Deutsche Welle, pointed out that Mr. Weintraub’s speech was “plagiarism from the 1930s in Germany”: he had just exchanged “communists” for “Jews”.

Brazil is the world’s fifth-biggest democracy and one of the top 10 economies. After years in recession, its economy has begun to show signs of recovery. But its reputation as a matured democracy has taken a serious hit, with the policies and pronouncements of its top Ministers. Just this week, Paulo Guedes, the Economy Minister who cut his teeth into unbridled neoliberalism in Chile during Augusto Pinochet’s brutal regime, blamed the poor for climate crisis. “Nature’s worst enemy is poverty. People destroy the environment because they need to eat,” Mr. Guedes said at a panel of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Outrageous comments

The problem certainly lies at the top. President Bolsonaro hardly let go off an opportunity to make outrageous comments to attack his “enemies”, which includes the media, and fire up his far-right base. In July, as the journalist Glenn Greenwald, co-founder of the news website ‘The Intercept’, began to publish reports that exposed a “collaboration” between a judge and prosecutors that led to the conviction of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Mr. Bolsonaro launched an attack on the American journalist, calling him a “trickster” and suggesting that he should be jailed or deported. (This week, Mr. Greenwald was charged with “cybercrimes” by Brazil’s federal prosecutors.)

In a country with so many social issues crying for attention, Mr. Bolsonaro always finds time to attack his favourite target: the indigenous tribes of the Amazon. On Thursday, the President said the indigenous people “are evolving” and they are “more and more human being like us”. On Friday, Sônia Guajajara, one of Brazil’s most prominent indigenous leaders, announced that she would sue Mr. Bolsonaro for the “crime of racism”. “We, the original inhabitants of this land, demand respect. Once again, Bolsonaro rips up the Constitution by denying our humanity,” said Ms. Guajajara. “We demand an end to such perversion.”

But with the Bolsonaro government showing no signs of giving up its anti-environment policies, more insults may be in store for these tribes.

27,2020/01/25,Hong Kong declares Wuhan virus outbreak an 'emergency',"Hong Kong on Saturday declared a new coronavirus outbreak as an “emergency” — the city's highest warning tier — as authorities ramped up measures to reduce the risk of further infections.

The announcement came as city leader Carrie Lam faced criticism in some quarters over her administration's response to the crisis.

Of the five people who have tested positive for the virus in Hong Kong so far, four arrived via a newly built high-speed train terminal which connects with the mainland.

That led to calls from some medical experts and politicians to limit, or even halt, arrivals from China, the epicentre of the outbreak with 41 people dead.

Ms. Lam held emergency meetings with health officials on Saturday morning after returning from Davos.

“Today I declare the lifting of the response level to emergency,” she told reporters.

Schools and universities, which are currently on a Lunar New Year break, would remain closed until February 17, Ms. Lam said.

All mainland arrivals to Hong Kong will now need to sign health declaration forms, she added, while public events including a new year gala and next month's marathon, would also be called off.

“We haven't seen serious and widespread infections (in Hong Kong), but we are taking this seriously and we hope to be ahead of the epidemic,” Ms. Lam said.

Ho Pak Leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong, said closing the mainland border would be the “single most effective measure” in containing the virus.

Transport links with the mainland should be re-opened “when the epidemic is controlled, when Hong Kong officials are awake, when there are enough masks and hand rubs for all Hong Kong citizens,” he wrote on his Facebook page.

Tragic past

Hong Kong has a recent experience of deadly viral outbreaks.

Nearly 300 people were killed by SARS in 2003, a tragedy that left a profound psychological impact on one of the most densely populated places on earth.

The city's ability to combat the crisis was hampered by moves in mainland China to cover up and play down the outbreak, leaving a lasting legacy of distrust among many Hong Kongers.

Animosity towards the mainland has intensified in recent years as Beijing tightens political control over the semi-autonomous territory.

The outbreak also comes at a sensitive time for Ms. Lam, who has record low approval ratings after seven months of pro-democracy protests.

“We must stand united so that we can prevent and control the disease,” she said, in a nod to the political unrest.

The often violent protests have battered Hong Kong's reputation for stability and helped tip it into recession, with the recent virus outbreak compounding the city's economic woes.

Hospitals are already struggling with the winter flu season, but officials are isolating anyone with a history of travel to central China and those exhibiting respiratory tract infections that look similar to the virus.

So far some 300 people have been tested and monitored for the virus. Quarantine centres have been set up in remote holiday parks for anyone found to have come into close contact with people who tested positive.

On Saturday, officials announced a newly built but still-empty public housing block would be used for medical staff on the frontline who did not want to risk returning to their families.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/xbu35u/article30652012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THHONGKONGCHINAOUTBREAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hong-kong-declares-wuhan-virus-outbreak-an-emergency/article30652013.ece
28,2020/01/25,China to build second new hospital to treat coronavirus cases as death toll rises to 41,"China on Saturday announced plans to build a second hospital within half a month to treat more cases of the deadly coronavirus as the fast spreading virus continues to wreak havoc in the country and abroad with 41 people dead and more than 1,300 infected, dampening the Chinese New Year celebrations.

The confirmed cases for the first time crossed the 1,000 mark and rose sharply to 1,287 as of Friday with 237 people in critical condition battling for their lives in China, the National Health Commission said on Saturday.

Almost all provinces, including Beijing, are reporting steady rise in the number of cases mostly of people who travelled from Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

The pneumonia situation had resulted in 41 deaths, including 39 in central China’s Hubei province and one in north-eastern province Heilongjiang, the Health Commission said on Saturday.

Additionally, a total of 1,965 suspected cases have also been reported, it said.

China on Saturday said it will build another 1,300-bed makeshift hospital in Wuhan in the next 15 days in addition to the 1,000-bed hospital being built in the city in 10 days, state-run People’s Daily reported.

The feverish pace at which the hospitals are being built indicate that China apparently is preparing to treat far more patients considering the speed at which the virus is spreading.

The virus has spread to Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Nepal, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and the United States as of Thursday.

Japan on Friday reported a second confirmed case.

A Chinese doctor reportedly died of the novel coronavirus on Saturday morning, the first fatality among health workers since the pneumonia-like illness first surfaced in late December, state-run China Daily quoted online news website Paper.cn as saying.

Liang Wudong, a 62-year-old doctor with the otolaryngology department who treats conditions in the ear, nose and throat at Hubei Xinhua Hospital, was suspected of contracting the new virus on January 16. The hospital that he works is in Wuhan.

On January 18, he was transferred to Hubei Jinyintan Hospital, which has received the majority of infected patients, and died at about 7 a.m. on Saturday, the report said.

Previously, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said on Tuesday that 15 medical workers were confirmed as contracting the virus, with one suspected case. One of them is critically ill, the China Daily report said.

Wuhan, the city of 11 million people, is where the virus is believed to have first emerged. The victims’ average age is 73, with 89 being the oldest and 48 youngest.

Also China’s National Health Commission has dispatched 1,230 medical staff to Wuhan to combat the novel coronavirus outbreak in the region.

Local media earlier reported that 450 military medical personnel have also landed in the city to offer support.

Also, the local government in Wuhan on Saturday has banned all vehicles, including private vehicles in downtown Wuhan to curb virus, a report by the Daily said.

The city along with 12 cities in Hubei province have already banned all public transport to prevent the virus from spreading.

At present, there is no cure for the virus which has pneumonia-like symptoms and is contagious among humans.

The virus has triggered a cause of concern for India too as many of the 700 odd Indian students studying in universities of Wuhan and Hubei provinces are still stuck up there.

The Indian Embassy has established hotlines to keep close contact with them.

The fast spreading virus dampened the celebrations of China’s Lunar New Year which began on Saturday.

In view of the virus scare, several cities, including Beijing, have cancelled special events. The festival is also known as the Spring Festival.

Large cultural activities during the spring festival in Beijing such as temple fairs were cancelled to prevent the spread of the virus.

China’s biggest city Shanghai raised the emergency response to public health safety to level 1, the highest, following Beijing, and Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, Anhui and Guangdong provinces as more cases were reported.

Beijing so far has reported 34 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, official media reported.

Amid the unknown virus wreaking havoc, Chinese and American researchers are working together to develop a vaccine against the deadly new strain of the coronavirus.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday stopped short of declaring the virus a global public health emergency, despite China’s climbing death toll.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7uhzsq/article30651374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-to-build-second-new-hospital-to-treat-coronavirus-cases-as-death-toll-rises-to-41/article30651870.ece
29,2020/01/25,Nepal can mediate between India and Pakistan: Kathmandu,"Nepal is a neutral country and can play a mediating role between India and Pakistan if necessary, a powerful government source said here on Saturday, delinking concerns about terrorism from the question of revival of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).

“Dialogue is a must in resolving differences and if necessary Nepal can mediate as we are independent, peace loving, friendly and neutral in the region. We love truth and facts and can be instrumental in finding a better solution,” said the highly placed source who also urged India and Pakistan to invest in direct channels of communication.

In this context, he reposed faith on the potential of the SAARC in addressing regional issues arguing that it would be better for the region to revive the SAARC, and in every meeting with India, Nepal has raised this issue. “There is no relation between SAARC and terrorism. Terrorism is a universal threat but we maintain there is no relationship between terrorism and the (future of) SAARC,” he said. The regional group has been stuck without the summit level meeting as India continues to blame Pakistan for promoting cross-border terrorism.

Kalapani issue

The Nepal government source also pointed out the need for dialogue between India and Nepal to deal with the border dispute in the Kalapani region in Uttarakhand. “We believe that together we can resolve any problem on the basis of facts, evidences, truth and address the issues that truth indicates,” said the official declaring that Nepal had “the courage to accept the truth.”

The official’s comments further added to the sentiments expressed by Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali who hinted to a group of visiting Indian journalists here on Friday that the example of India-Bangladesh border resolution could be attempted to firm up India-Nepal border as well. Nepal has invited all the SAARC heads of government for the April 2-4 Sagarmatha Sambaad along with 150 global guests to discuss climate change and the future of the region. Mr. Gyawali had welcomed the possibility of holding an “informal SAARC summit” on the sideline of the Sagarmatha Sambaad.

The high official also expressed concern about the future of the Nepali-speaking citizens of Assam who were left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the State. He argued that the Nepali speaking people of Assam had been living in the region for more than a century and Kathmandu considered them to be Indian nationals.

“The Nepalis who are in India (Assam) are not just Nepalis but are also of local origin. They are Nepali-speaking Indians. Not all Nepali speaking people are Nepali (citizens). There should not be any confusion on that. There were comments from Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Home Minister Amit Shah which showed that there will be no negative impact on them,” said the high official.

Editorial | Inclusion over exclusion: on Assam NRC

He also reminded that Nepal lost tracts of land to the colonial Indian State because of the 1815 Treaty of Sugauli. Nepal lost land both on the eastern and the western fronts, he argued, because of the agreement which defined the boundaries of the royal Nepali kingdom, the predecessor of the currently democratic country.

“However, Assam was never a part of Nepal. It was the house of the Nepalis and they became Indians. I think we can resolve this issue by dialogue if any problem arises,” he said arguing for fair treatment of the Nepalis of Assam who were excluded from the NRC exercise.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iwqa7w/article30651186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIAPAKISTANBORDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-can-mediate-between-india-and-pakistan-kathmandu/article30651187.ece
30,2020/01/25,Two Rohingya women killed as Myanmar army shells village: MP,"Two women, one pregnant, were killed and seven other people injured after Myanmar troops shelled a Rohingya village on Saturday, according to a lawmaker and a villager, two days after the U.N.s highest court ordered the country to protect the minority.

Maung Kyaw Zan, a national member of parliament for Buthidaung township in northern Rakhine state, said shells fired from a nearby battalion hit Kin Taung village in the middle of the night. Government troops have been battling ethnic rebels in the state for more than a year.

“There was no fighting, they just shot artillery to a village without a battle,” he told Reuters by phone, adding it was the second time this year that civilians had been killed.

More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims were forced to flee northern Rakhine state in 2017 after a military crackdown that the U.N has said was executed with genocidal intent.

More recently, the region was plunged into further chaos by fresh fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, a rebel group that recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority in the state. That conflict has displaced tens of thousands and killed dozens.

Of the several hundred thousand Rohingya still in Rakhine, many are confined to apartheid-like conditions, unable to travel freely or access healthcare and education. They are caught in the middle of the fighting, and travel restrictions mean they are less able to flee than Buddhist neighbors.

In early January, four Rohingya children died in a blast the military and rebels blamed on each other.

Two military spokesmen did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on Saturday's deaths.

Soe Tun Oo, a Rohingya villager living a mile from the village, told Reuters by phone two houses were destroyed in the explosion.

“The military always shoots heavy weapons They shoot heavy weapons around the area they suspect. It is impossible to flee to other places, even though we are scared.”

The Hague-based International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar on Thursday to protect the Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes, after west African nation the Gambia launched a lawsuit in November accusing the country of genocide.

A spokesman for the ruling party told Reuters the country was already protecting Rohingya, but the civilian government had limited power over the military.

Civilian authorities govern jointly with the military in an awkward constitutional arrangement that reserves great powers for the commander-in-chief.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/vtqvl7/article30540193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/10-krishnadas-RGC06VEJ8C4jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/two-rohingya-women-killed-as-myanmar-army-shells-village-mp/article30650727.ece
31,2020/01/25,Trump’s idea of executive power is also impeachment defense,"Donald Trump has always been a man of absolutes.

Something is the best or the worst, a person is a winner or a total loser, an event has never happened before, even when it has.

Absolutism was the unwritten credo of his career in business and is the guiding light of his presidency as he makes an assertion rarely heard from an American president- that he can do as he pleases.

Now that approach faces its ultimate test as a foundation of Trump’s defense in his impeachment trial, namely that he is cloaked with unrestrained authority. How that question is answered, both by the Senate in the impeachment trial and by voters in November, will define how Americans view the concept of presidential power.

Mr. Trump’s position reaches well beyond the charges of abuse of power and obstruction of justice made in the articles of impeachment the Senate is now considering. The views were outlined in papers by his legal team and are expected in arguments in the trial as soon as Saturday.

""I have the right to do whatever I want as president,” Mr. Trump declared last year, citing Article II of the Constitution. “It gives me all of these rights at a level nobody has ever seen before.”

Not since Richard Nixon told the interviewer David Frost, “When a president does it, it means it’s not illegal,” has a president come close to making an assertion of power as sweeping as Trump’s.

In their trial memo, Trump’s attorneys contend that the obstruction charge is not valid because he was asserting his legal right and immunity granted to him by his position, adding that to question that would cause “grave damage” to the separation of powers.

""President Trump has not in any way ‘abused the powers of the Presidency,’” they argued. “At all times, the president has faithfully and effectively executed the duties of his office on behalf of the American people.”

And his lawyers have said his election gives him the right to refuse subpoenas given to his cabinet and staff, to decline to hand over documents to investigators, and to shut down certain witnesses.

""In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his Administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances,” White House Counsel Pat Cipollone wrote to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, has urged senators to remember the Constitution’s framers sought to prevent a chief executive from wielding power as if it “was conferred upon him by divine right.”

The American Revolution was fought so that “no person, including and especially the president, would be above the law,” Schiff told the Senate on Wednesday. “Nothing could be more dangerous to a democracy than a commander in chief who believed that he could operate with impunity, free from accountability.”

That is not a view Mr. Trump shares. He has declared that he has an “absolute right” to wield executive authority at least 29 times since his election, according to an Associated Press review of his comments in Factba.se, which compiles and analyzes data on Trump’s presidency.

That included when he shut down the government over a border wall battle, threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border, fired Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, asked other countries to investigate corruption, shared classified intelligence with Russia and said he could pardon himself.

""Trump’s usage is, I think, novel - without precedent - in U.S. history of presidential rhetoric,” John Wooley, co-director of the The American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara, said in an email.

During his impeachment trial President Bill Clinton didn’t assert executive privilege nearly as much - he gave his DNA, handed over documents and allowed staff to participate. Republicans who controlled the House impeached him on the charges of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury in connection with his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. His defense was structured on inconsistencies in the perjury allegations and claims that the investigation had been tainted by political bias.

The Senate, which had a Republican majority, acquitted him.

""In essence, there was more evidence of a crime, perjury, but it was not serious enough to show he should be removed from office,” said Bill McCollum, a former Florida congressman who was the impeachment manager during the Clinton trial. “We are just looking at a very different scenario here.”

Many presidents have sought to strengthen their hands against Congress and the judiciary, despite George Washington’s warning, in his farewell address, against seeking “security and repose in the absolute power of an individual” leader.

Andrew Jackson - whose portrait hangs in Trump’s Oval Office - asserted in response to Senate censure that it was “settled by the Constitution, the laws, and the whole practice of the Government that the entire executive power is vested in the President of the United States.” His critics widely caricatured him as “King Andrew.”

Throughout the 20th century, presidents increasingly acted unilaterally as the executive branch grew dramatically.

""Most of the modern presidents have tended to take a pretty expansive view of the meaning of Commander in Chief powers,” Wooley said.

Franklin D. Roosevelt holds the record for issuing executive orders - more than 3,000 of them, an average of 307 per year - as he led the nation out of the Great Depression and through World War II. By comparison, Trump has issued 136, or 47 per year, which is more frequent than any president since Ronald Reagan, whose average was 48, the American Presidency Project database shows.

But no other president to appears to have declared that he was personally invested with such unlimited powers, according to database searches of The American Presidency Project and the University of Virginia’s Presidential Recordings Program, which also includes transcripts of the secretly recorded conversations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.

And while White House recordings show Lyndon B. Johnson asserting his war powers authority to send U.S. troops to Vietnam, “it is not Trumpian - it’s not a claim of, ‘I have the absolute right, the absolute authority,’” said Marc Selverstone, who chairs the Presidential Recordings Program. Johnson was “not making the kinds of claims President Trump is making,” Selverstone said.

Trump has also claimed absolute immunity from criminal investigations - he asserted it in his efforts to keep his tax returns from being revealed in court.

Trump has also said he could not be sued by a former contestant on “The Apprentice,” who accused of him of defamation. In those cases, his New York attorneys claimed he could not be charged with a crime.

Trump’s lawyers are also asserting there must be a crime for him to be impeached. But legal scholars say the Constitution’s standard of “high crimes and misdemeanors” for impeachment is vague and open-ended to encompass abuses of power even if they aren’t, strictly speaking, illegal.

Each side got 24 hours over three days to present their case. After the House prosecutors finished Friday, the president’s lawyers will follow Saturday. They are expected to take only Sunday off and push into next week.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/drww5c/article30300261.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Donald-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trumps-idea-of-executive-power-is-also-impeachment-defense/article30650628.ece
32,2020/01/25,Not meeting FATF obligations would be devastating for Pakistan economic reform program: U.S.,"Not meeting the obligations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) would have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s economic reform program, a top US diplomat said.

Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells made the comments on Friday, a day after Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the country should be taken off the FATF’s ‘grey list’ as it has made considerable progress on the requirements of the international terror financing watchdog.

Obviously, if Pakistan were not to meet FATF obligations or were to fail and be blacklisted, that would be devastating for Pakistan’s economic reform program and for its ability to attract investors, Ms. Wells told reporters here.

We’ve been pleased to see progress by Pakistan towards fulfilling FATF obligations, said Ms. Wells, who has just returned from her trip to the region, including a visit to Islamabad.

She was responding to a question if the funding by the International Monetary Fund could get affected if Pakistan does not meet the FATF regulations or the rules.

There is a meeting underway currently in Beijing where Pakistan is presenting its actions to the task force. So I defer to that task force to make its evaluation, she said.

But the more evidence of Pakistan’s seriousness in both documenting its economy and in shrinking the space for militants to be able to take advantage of Pakistan’s either banking system or territory, the more confidence that the international community and business community will have in working with Pakistan, Ms. Wells said.

A Pakistani delegation led by Minister for Economic Affairs Division Hammad Azhar is in Beijing to brief the financial task force about the steps taken by Islamabad to implement the recommendations made by the FATF.

The FATF in October last decided to keep Pakistan on its ‘Grey’ list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and others.

If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

Observing that FATF is a technical process, Ms. Wells said that there has been an action plan that was presented to Pakistan.

It’s a question of fulfilling the requirements that have been spelled out and that are asked of all countries in the international system. So it’s not a political process, but we certainly support and stand ready to assist Pakistan as it implements these obligations, she added.

The U.S., she said, welcomes efforts by Pakistan to meet its counterterrorism financing obligations under FATF.

We strongly encourage Pakistan to work with FATF and the international community to fully satisfy its action plan commitments, she said.

Completion of the FATF action plan is critical to Pakistan’s economic reform efforts, including its IMF program, as well as for demonstrating sustained and irreversible action against all militant groups based in Pakistan without distinction, she added.

We’ve seen obvious progress in our relations with Pakistan, from the high-level engagement such as the President’s (Donald Trump) warm and constructive meeting with Prime Minister (Imran) Khan at Davos to the restoration of the International Military Education and Training programs, she said.

Ms. Wells during her trip to Islamabad had extensive conversations on how the two countries can bolster their economic partnership where the US is Pakistan’s largest export market, largest trade partner, and historically one of its most significant investors.

There are obvious synergies in energy and agriculture, and opening Pakistan’s markets to American investments creates jobs and wealth without sacrificing standards or fuelling corruption.

We’re looking forward to welcoming 10 Pakistani buyer delegations to the US and five regional trade shows in 2020, which will build deeper relationships between US and Pakistani firms. Prime Minister Khan’s economic reform efforts contributed to the World Bank identifying it as one of the top 10 reformers globally in 2019, she said.

Responding to a question on China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), she said Pakistan needs to adhere to the buyer beware.

That Pakistan is a buyer, these are not — this is not grant assistance from China, it’s loans, often not with concessional financing. And Pakistan should beware of the terms, to make sure that they’re getting the most for their money, that brings the greatest economic prosperity, she noted.

This is Pakistan’s sovereign right to decide what investment it seeks and on what terms. And a friend of Pakistan, we certainly urge that they take on investment projects that create wealth, generate employment, and are sustainable, and think we have great options for the Pakistani market, she said in response to a question.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/7jcl3/article27893813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th13-US-WellsAGCL60DVS63jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/not-meeting-fatf-obligations-would-be-devastating-for-pakistan-economic-reform-program-us/article30650445.ece
33,2020/01/25,Coronavirus: First case of human-to-human transmission confirmed outside China,"The first confirmed case of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus outside China has been reported from Vietnam, according to information posted on the World Health Organization (WHO) website on January 24. The novel coronavirus infection has been confirmed in a person who has not travelled to any part of China but only came in contact in Vietnam with a confirmed case who had visited Wuhan.

When the WHO’s Emergency Committee met on January 22-23 to decide whether the novel virus constituted a ‘public health emergency of international concern’, only exported cases were reported from other countries, including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus in a statement after the Emergency Committee meeting had said there had been cases of human-to-human transmission in China, which appeared limited to family groups and health workers caring for infected patients. “At this time, there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission outside China,” he said.

In China, fourth-generation cases had been reported in Wuhan and second-generation cases outside Wuhan, the statement said.

According to the Situation Report-4 posted on the WHO website on January 24, there have been 830 confirmed cases in China and 25 deaths. But the National Health Commission statement on January 25 noted that more than 1,300 people had been infected globally and 41 had died. The total number of confirmed cases in China stood at 1,287.

“New epidemiological information reinforces the evidence that the 2019-nCoV can be transmitted from one individual to another,” the WHO Situation Report said. “During previous outbreaks due to other coronavirus (Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)), human-to-human transmission occurred through droplets, contact and fomites, suggesting that the transmission mode of the novel coronavirus can be similar.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/q54nob/article30650413.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1195831400,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-first-case-of-human-to-human-transmission-confirmed-outside-china/article30650399.ece
34,2020/01/25,Jaishankar calls on Brazilian President,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Saturday met Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro and discussed ways to deepen ties between the two countries in a range of areas, including trade and investment.

Later in the day, Mr. Bolsonaro and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold extensive talks following which the two countries are expected to ink 15 agreements to boost cooperation in a wide-range of areas like oil and gas, mining and cyber security.

Mr. Bolsonaro arrived here on Friday, accompanied by his daughter Laura Bolsonaro, daughter-in-law Leticia Firmo, eight ministers, four members of the Brazilian parliament and a large business delegation.

Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Jaishankar deliberated on ways to deepen overall bilateral cooperation including in areas like trade and investment, officials said.

The Brazilian president is in India primarily to grace the Republic Day celebrations on Sunday as chief guest and explore ways to boost trade ties with India at a time when both the large economies are hit by slowdowns.

India’s ties with Brazil, the largest country in Latin America, has been on an upswing in the last few years. The country has a population of 210 million with $1.8 trillion economy.

This is the first visit of President Bolsonaro to India.

Mr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, won a landslide victory in Brazil’s presidential election in October 2018 and took the reins of the country in January last year.

India-Brazil ties have been on an upswing in the last few years.

The volume of bilateral trade was $8.2 billion in 2018-19. This included $3.8 billion worth of Indian exports to Brazil and $4.4 million as imports by India.

Both the governments feel there is huge potential to enhance the bilateral trade further.

Major Indian exports to Brazil include agro-chemicals, synthetic yarns, auto components and parts, pharmaceutical and petroleum products. Brazilian exports to India include crude oil, gold, vegetable oil, sugar and bulk mineral and ores.

Indian investments in Brazil were around $6 billion and Brazilian investments in India are estimated at $1 billion in 2018.

Brazilian investments in India are mainly in automobiles, IT, mining, energy and biofuel sectors. India has invested in Brazil’s IT, pharmaceutical, energy, agri-business, mining and engineering sectors.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/m17mkx/article30489678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th05-kallol-IndGES6UL4O23jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jaishankar-calls-on-brazilian-president/article30650325.ece
35,2020/01/25,Malaysia confirms first cases of coronavirus infection,"Malaysia on Saturday said it had confirmed three cases of coronavirus infection, the first in the Southeast Asian country.

Health Minister Dzulkefly Ahmad said the three individuals infected were Chinese nationals and related to the 66-year-old man that was confirmed by Singapore health authorities to have tested positive for the virus.

The infected individuals were a 65-year-old woman, who is the wife of the man detected with the virus in Singapore, and their two grandsons, aged 11 and 2, Mr. Dzulkefly said.

The three have been admitted to Sungai Buloh hospital in Kuala Lumpur for treatment and were considered in stable conditions, the minister said at a news conference.

In a separate statement, Malaysia Airports said it has heightened screening of all passengers and crew arriving from China at gateway airports across the country to minimise the potential spread of the virus..

36,2020/01/25,Coronavirus outbreak: China deploys 450 military medical staff,"China deploys 450 military medical staff to virus epicentre, some with experience combating SARS or Ebola, to a central city stricken by a virus that has killed dozens of people, state media said Saturday.

The medics, who arrived in Wuhan on military aircraft late Friday, will be dispatched to hospitals with large numbers of infected patients, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The move marks a dramatic escalation in the central government's involvement to contain the virus, which has killed 41 people and infected 1,287 others across the country.

It also follows reports of bed shortages in hospitals designated to deal with the outbreak in Wuhan, which has borne the brunt of the health emergency.

The government has even started construction on a special hospital in Wuhan to deal with the virus, with plans to finish it within a staggering 10 days.

Xinhua said the military team is composed of experts in respiratory health, infectious diseases, hospital infection control and intensive care.

In a sign Wuhan authorities are feeling the pressure, Hubei governor Jiang Chaoliang said in a meeting Friday that Wuhan must “make every effort” to increase isolation places and beds.

Hospitals must also make sure patients are “admitted in time,” according to a statement on the government's website.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bawa4a/article30650079.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25REUCHINA-HEALTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-outbreak-china-deploys-450-military-medical-staff/article30650080.ece
37,2020/01/25,U.S. scientist pleads guilty to lying about China contact,"A scientist who once worked at a U.S. laboratory in New Mexico has pleaded guilty to lying about his involvement with a Chinese government technology program.

Turab Lookman (67), entered his plea on Friday during a hearing in Albuquerque after reaching an agreement with prosecutors. He is awaiting sentencing, which could include up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Lookman was initially indicted on three counts of making false statements. His attorney had said previously that prosecutors failed to prove his client had accessed or downloaded any high-level security information before he was fired from his job at the lab.

Authorities said Lookman came under scrutiny after he told a co-worker he had citizenship in four different countries — including India, where he was born. He also had been asked in a security-clearance questionnaire and later by federal officials if any foreign nationals had offered him a job or if he had applied for one. He falsely answered to all questions that he had not, authorities said.

According to an indictment, in one instance, a counterintelligence officer for the lab asked Lookman if he had applied for the China Thousand Talents Program.

Prosecutors have described Thousand Talents as a program established by China to recruit people with access to and knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property. For years, it was known as one of many of the country’s state initiatives aimed at reversing a decades-long China brain drain.

At Los Alamos, Lookman received at least two awards for his work.

38,2020/01/25,India’s ‘passive’ foreign policy yielding to one advancing its interests: U.S. official,"India is moving away from having a passive foreign policy to the one vigorously advancing its interests, a top American diplomat said on Friday, attributing the trend to New Delhi’s “broadening strategic horizons” over the past two decades.

It’s clear that India’s broadening strategic horizons over the past two decades have resulted in a shift away from a passive foreign policy to the one that advances Indian interests more vigorously, acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells told reporters at a news conference.

Ms. Wells, who has just returned from a trip to the region besides attending the Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi, said nowhere this shift is more visible than in the Indo-Pacific region.

Whether it’s in our growing maritime and naval cooperation, the Quad, India’s Act East Policy, there’s virtually no daylight in our approaches to the Indo-Pacific, she said. Deputy National Security Advisor Matt Pottinger’s remarks at Raisina Dialogue endorsing an Indo-Pacific region stretching from California to Kilimanjaro only further reinforced the strategic convergence, she added.

While in New Delhi, she had meetings with her Indian counterparts, which she said were focused on how to build on the diplomatic and defence gains achieved during the 2+2 ministerial dialogue last December.

With continued progress on defense cooperation, peacekeeping operations, space, counterterrorism, trade, people-to-people initiatives, and more, she said the quality and frequency of India-US naval cooperation, especially the information sharing, have reached unprecedented levels.

The two countries also remain focused on achieving a trade deal that promotes fairness and reciprocity, she noted.

The visit also offered an opportunity to hear more regarding developments with India’s Citizenship Amendment Act, which is undergoing, I would say, a vigorous democratic scrutiny, whether it’s in streets, by the political opposition, media, or the courts. We continue to underscore the importance of the principle of equal protection under the law, Ms. Wells said.

On Jammu and Kashmir, I was pleased to see some incremental steps, including the partial return of internet service in Kashmir, she told reporters.

She also described the visit by U.S. ambassador and other foreign diplomats to Jammu and Kashmir as “a useful step”.

We also continue to urge the government to permit regular access by our diplomats, and to move swiftly to release those political leaders detained without charge, Ms. Wells said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e41gzy/article30279291.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/alicejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indias-passive-foreign-policy-yielding-to-one-advancing-its-interests-us-official/article30650057.ece

The death toll from the virus rose to 41 on Saturday, with more than 1,300 infected globally, but most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in Wuhan, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings.

The IOC said in a statement on Friday the qualification event would take place in Amman from March 3 to 11.

“After a careful review of all alternatives, the BTF (Boxing Task Force) approved the proposal of the Jordan Olympic Committee today, in order to confirm the competition dates and location as soon as possible, in the best interest of the athletes preparing for the qualifier,” the IOC said.

Preparations for the boxing tournament at the Tokyo Olympic have already been upended after the IOC in June took over the competition and suspended the international boxing federation due to issues with its finances and governance.

The global boxing body has been in turmoil over its finances and governance for years with the federation $16 million in debt. It has also been split internally by an ongoing bitter battle over the presidency.

40,2020/01/25,Australia declares first confirmed case of coronavirus,"Australia confirmed its first case of the new coronavirus on Saturday in the state of Victoria, while the national government urged people not to travel to Hubei province in China, the epicentre of the outbreak.

A Chinese national in his 50s, who had been in the city of Wuhan where the virus first appeared, is in a stable condition in a Melbourne hospital after arriving from China on Jan. 19 on a flight from Guangzhou, Victoria Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told journalists.

“It is important to stress that there is no cause for alarm to the community,” Mikakos said.

Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer Angie Bone said the patient is not in intensive care.

“He is stable and not in a very serious condition,” she said.

The death toll from the virus rose to 41 on Saturday, with more than 1,300 infected globally, but most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in Wuhan, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings.

The virus has created alarm, but there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.

Australians were urged on Saturday not to travel to the Hubei province in China, with the government issuing its most severe travel advisory.

“Strict travel restrictions have been imposed in Wuhan and a number of other cities in Hubei province,” Australia's foreign ministry said in a statement. “If you travel to Hubei province at this time you may not be allowed to depart until travel restrictions are lifted.”

41,2020/01/25,"China coronavirus: death toll rises to 41, more than 1,300 infected worldwide","China said 41 people have now died from a new coronavirus that has infected more than 1,300 people globally, as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic. The total number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 1,287, the National Health Commission said in a statement on January 25.

The death roll has risen from 26 reported on Friday. All the latest deaths occurred in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak that has been in virtual quarantine as China scrambles to contain the virus spread.

The vast majority of the cases and all of the confirmed deaths to date have been in China, but the virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, France and the United States.

Human-to-human transmission has been observed in the virus, which health authorities believe to have originated in a market in Wuhan that traded illegally in wildlife.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an “emergency in China” this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern. However, the virus continues to spread globally.

Wuhan, a city of 11 million and the capital of central Hubei province, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan's airport have been cancelled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed similar lockdowns on more than 10 cities near Wuhan as part of the ongoing containment effort.

As Wuhan slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.

Hubei's health authority said on Saturday there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill.

Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said.

Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings and of the lockdown.

42,2020/01/25,Boris Johnson signs agreement for Britain to leave EU,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday hailed “a new chapter” in Britain's history as he signed its divorce treaty with the EU, clearing another hurdle before the country exits the bloc next Friday.

It allows Britain to end its decades-long membership of the European Union and leave its closest neighbours and trading partners after several years of domestic acrimony and delays.

“The signing of the withdrawal agreement is a fantastic moment, which finally delivers the result of the 2016 referendum and brings to an end far too many years of argument and division,” Johnson said in a statement.

“This signature heralds a new chapter in our nation's history,” he added on Twitter, alongside a photo of the occasion.

Johnson signed the agreement in Downing Street, seated in front of two Union Jack flags, with European and British officials who had brought it from Brussels looking on.

EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel had already put their names to the treaty overnight at a ceremony held behind closed doors in the early hours of the morning.

It will now return to Brussels, where the original will be kept in EU archives along with other international treaties, while three copies will be dispatched back to London.

On Wednesday next week, the text will go to the European Parliament for ratification and on Thursday diplomats from the EU member states will approve the deal in writing.

Then, on Friday, January 31, Britain spends its last day in the EU before leaving the bloc at 2300 GMT as clocks strike midnight in Brussels.

'Get Brexit done'

In another move to prepare Brussels for relations with Britain as an outside power, the European Commission named an ambassador — veteran diplomat Joao Vale de Almeida — to London.

Earlier before dawn, chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier had watched as European Commission president Von der Leyen and European Council president Michel signed the treaty in the Council's headquarters.

“Things will inevitably change but our friendship will remain,” Michel tweeted. “We start a new chapter as partners and allies.”

The former Belgian premier, whose council represents EU member governments, added, in French: “I'm keen to write this new page together.”

No reporters or photographers were allowed to witness the low key ceremony, despite news agencies offering to organise a pool.

Hours later Johnson signed the same document with a Parker fountain pen, as is traditional for ceremonial signings in Downing Street.

Staff including the prime minister's chief Brexit negotiator David Frost were present.

British voters backed leaving the European Union in a June 2016 referendum, and after lengthy negotiations and several delays Johnson's new government will finally “get Brexit done” next week.

Queen Elizabeth II gave her formal assent to the British withdrawal legislation on Thursday and the EU is now expected to complete the final formalities in the coming days.

11-month transition period

Britain will leave the institutions of the union, reducing it to 27 member states, but the withdrawal agreement provides for an 11-month transition period until the end of the year.

During this time, Britain and the rest of the bloc will continue to apply the same rules of business to avoid economic disruption while officials try to negotiate a broader trade deal.

Most experts regard the idea that London and Brussels could agree a comprehensive free trade agreement in that time as ambitious.

But officials have expressed cautious optimism that some kind of agreement can be reached.

Formal trade talks are not expected to begin until the end of February or even March, and in the meantime Barnier has been in intensive talks with EU member states on his negotiating mandate.

After the transition, Britain wants the right to set its own rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards.

But Brussels has warned that the more the UK diverges from EU standards, the less it will have unfettered access to Europe's huge single market.

43,2020/01/25,"Death toll hits 31 in Turkish earthquake; over 1,500 hurt","The death toll from a powerful earthquake which struck eastern Turkey rose to 31, officials said Sunday, as rescue efforts continued.

The magnitude 6.8 quake hit on Friday evening, with its epicentre in the small lakeside town of Sivrice in Elazig province but also affected neighbouring cities and countries.

The Turkish government's disaster and emergency management agency (AFAD) said 31 people died, the majority in Elazig but at least four in nearby Malatya, and 1,607 were injured.

Rescuers scrambled all of Saturday and searched Sunday to rescue people alive from under the rubble. The latest number of individuals rescued was 45, according to AFAD.

Nearly 80 buildings collapsed while 645 were heavily damaged in Elazig and Malatya, the agency said in a statement.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised Saturday that Turkey's housing agency TOKI would ""do whatever is necessary and make sure no one is left without a home"".

He attended the funeral of a woman and her son in Elazig Saturday, later visiting Malatya after cancelling a speech in Istanbul.

Freezing temperatures

Almost 24 hours after the quake, officials then rescued a woman and her two-year-old child in her arms alive, CNN Turk broadcaster reported. Over 3,500 search and rescue personnel were working in the region while tens of thousands of beds, blankets and tents have been provided, the presidency said.

The rescue efforts have been taking place in freezing temperatures as wood and plastic were burned to keep crowds warm. Hundreds of people anxiously waited on the other side of police barriers including a man who gave his name as Mustafa.

""I have three relatives in that building: one man, his wife and her mother,"" the 40-year-old told AFP. ""I was home during the earthquake. It lasted for so long, it was like a nightmare. I froze in the living room when it happened, my wife and our two children were screaming and running around,"" he said.

He added that some neighbours jumped out of the windows in panic as families including his were forced to spend Friday night on the streets. Rescuers cleared the rubble one bucket at a time surrounded by broken wooden beams and concrete.

'Screaming in terror'

Sivrice ⁠— a town with a population of about 4,000 ⁠— is situated south of Elazig city on the shores of Hazar lake -- one of the most popular tourist spots in the region and the source of the Tigris river. The lake is home to a ""Sunken City"", with archaeological traces dating back 4,000 years in its waters.

Among the 1,466 people injured were residents in other southeast provinces including Diyarbakir and Sanliurfa. Tensions were high as one resident accused the government of lying. ""They (the government) claim that only four people are trapped under the rubble. It is not true. I have five relatives in that building,"" Suat, a 45-year-old butcher, said.

""There are four floors and three flats per floor. If there were five people per flat, do the math. Why are they lying?"" Suat described the moment when the quake struck as he was at home in another neighbourhood and his children ""were screaming in terror"".

The Ankara public prosecutor's office said it had begun an investigation into ""provocative"" social media posts but did not give further details. Erdogan also told citizens to ""ignore gossip and negative propaganda"".

Tremor felt elsewhere

The tremor was felt in several parts of eastern Turkey near the Iraqi and Syrian borders as well as in Iran, Lebanon and Syria Officials said 72 buildings had collapsed while 514 were badly damaged and 409 had limited damage in the affected region.

The US Geological Survey assessed the magnitude as 6.7, slightly lower than AFAD, adding that it struck near the East Anatolian Fault in an area that has suffered no documented large ruptures since an earthquake in 1875. There have been 462 aftershocks including 14 that were above four in magnitude, AFAD said.

In 1999, a devastating 7.4 magnitude earthquake hit Izmit in western Turkey, leaving more than 17,000 people dead including about 1,000 in Istanbul.

Experts have long warned a large quake could devastate the city of 15 million people, which has allowed widespread building without safety precautions.

Such fears were acutely awakened in September last year when a 5.7-magnitude earthquake shook Istanbul, causing residents to flee buildings in the economic capital.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8fpdxr/article30648258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDTURKEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/powerful-quake-hits-eastern-turkey/article30648259.ece
44,2020/01/25,Nepal pitches for informal SAARC summit,"Nepal will be “happy” to host an informal summit of the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on the sidelines of the coming Sagarmatha Sambaad here.

Speaking to Indian journalists here on Friday, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali reiterated that Nepal would also work to build greater connectivity with China. “It will be fantastic. We will be happy to welcome all SAARC leaders and provide them with... [an opportunity] to discuss measures informally to develop cooperation,” he said.

This offer gives a chance to revive the forum, which has been unable to meet formally during the last four years because of the negative India-Pakistan relations. The SAARC summit could not be held in Islamabad in 2016 after India faced terror strikes blamed on elements in Pakistan.

Mr. Gyawali said Kathmandu had invited all SAARC heads of government for Sagarmatha Sambaad, the first edition of a multi-stakeholder dialogue, to be held from April 2 to 4 and argued that an alternative to the formal summit model could be explored. He said Nepal had served out its tenure as chair of the regional body and was “eager” to pass the position to the next in line, Pakistan.

“We are optimistic that an alternative way to revive the regional formation could be found,” Mr. Gyawali said, arguing that coordination at the regional level would be essential to tackle challenges before South Asian countries.

The offer of an informal summit is in line with the current global trend whenever a formal agenda could not be worked out because of the contradictory positions of the stakeholders.

Mr. Gyawali said Kathmandu wanted to broaden connectivity with China. “We want to build crossborder railways, highways, and port connectivity with China.” Nepal hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping in October when both sides sealed several agreements, including the one for a cross-Himalayan Keyrung-Kathmandu train project.

Mr. Gyawali referred to Nepal’s border dispute with India at Kalapani as a burden from history. “If India can resolve such issues with countries like Bangladesh, why can’t Kalapani be resolved,” he asked, advocating talks.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6izzu9/article30646584.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PradeepKumarGyawali-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-pitches-for-informal-saarc-summit/article30646568.ece

Addressing a media briefing in New Delhi on January 16, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said India will invite Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan along with other leaders for the annual meeting of council of heads of government of the SCO.

For the first time, India will host the annual meeting of the council of heads of government of the SCO.

During an interaction with reporters, when asked about Pakistan’s participation in the SCO summit to be hosted by New Delhi, Mr. Qureshi said, “We will have to wait for the invitation.”

The Indian government’s announcement on inviting Pakistan to the mega event came in the midst of frayed ties between the two countries over India’s withdrawal of special powers of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcate the state into two union territories.

India and Pakistan became full members of the China-dominated grouping in 2017.

Usually, the heads of government meeting of the SCO are represented by foreign ministers while a number of countries send their prime ministers also.

India has always been represented by the external affairs minister in the heads of government meeting, while the SCO heads of state summit is attended by the Prime Minister.

The SCO was founded at a summit in Shanghai in 2001 by the presidents of Russia, China, Kyrgyz Republic, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.

Kokkudi, Ariyalur district, January 19 : 1 dead, 24 injured

Kandupatti, Sivaganga district, January 19: 1 dead, 61 injured

As this goes to press, five men have been gored or trampled to death by bulls, and over a hundred left injured in Tamil Nadu, over just three days, while participating in jallikattu, the traditional bull taming sport that begins with the harvest festival of Pongal. Between 2008 and 2014, 43 people were killed and thousands injured in the State, according to the Animal Welfare Board of India.

Jallikattu, however, continues unabated and with full fervour.

It is 3 a.m. on January 17, the third day of jallikattu. It is still dark when dozens of bull rearers, from Madurai and several other districts of Tamil Nadu, gather with their prized beasts in Alanganallur. The bulls, some with flowers on their horns, line up at the vadivasal, or entrance to the arena.

Just beyond the vadivasal, the bull tamers, resplendent in neon green t-shits with the names of local politicians printed on the back, are getting a health check-up. “Breathe into the breathalyser,” M. Vinoth, a doctor, instructs them. “Now stick out your tongue. Did you have breakfast?”

7.30 am. It is already sweltering and huge crowds have gathered. The tamers take the jallikattu oath: “We promise not to hurt the animals and to treat the bull and each other with dignity,” they repeat after the district collector, T.G. Vinay. As soon as the oath is over, the thousands of spectators, many wearing caps and holding hand-fans, go wild. They shout, whistle and cling to the tall barricades. Tourists and VIPs watch from special galleries. A dozen ambulances, 25 veterinarians and 35 para-veterinarians are in attendance.

The bulls are released into the arena: some resist entering the barricaded space, while others charge in. The tamers must now hurl themselves on to the bucking bull and hold on to its hump. The man who retains his grip even as the animal spins three times wins the prize, which ranges from cows and cash to mobile phones, cars and flight tickets — all funded by sponsors. The owners of the bulls that manage to fight off the tamers also win prizes.

It is now past noon. V. Shridhar, 27, is contending with a particularly difficult bull that will not enter the arena. As he wrestles with it between the narrow holding area and the vadivasal, the bull gores him in the abdomen. A Red Cross team is just 10 feet from Shridhar but can’t reach him in the melee. When Shridhar is finally carried out on a stretcher, blood pours out of his wounds. By 1 p.m., he is declared dead.

Tamil pride

“The killer bulls are let loose into the ring, whose sharpened horns shine like Siva’s battle-axe / Then come the beating drums, sounding like thunder / Smoke goes up and dust is raised, maidens come and stand in a row.” This is a translation of a verse from Kalithogai, an anthology of ancient Sangam poems, which makes one of the earliest references to jallikattu. This translation, by poet M.L. Thangappa, is published in the book Tamil Characters: Personalities, Politics, Culture, edited by historian A.R. Venkatachalapathy.

Jallikattu indeed has a long history, and is today represented prolifically in popular culture, including cinema. It has come to be associated with Tamil unity, identity and pride. Which is why, when the Supreme Court banned it in 2014, on the grounds of animal cruelty, it triggered widespread protests in Tamil Nadu, culminating in a massive uprising in January 2017. Alanganallur was one of the epicentres. “We were alarmed,” says M. Rajasekaran, a bull rearer. “The event is central to our Pongal celebrations. Year after year, several hundreds of us rear bulls and treat them as part of our family. Karuppu, my bull, is my child.”

Protests raged in Chennai too. Lakhs of people — entrepreneurs, students, teachers, government employees — thronged Marina Beach for a week. ‘Save Jallikattu. It’s our culture,’ the posters read. Swapna Sundar is the author of Occupy Marina!, a book on the jallikattu protests in Chennai. “Here, the identity with jallikattu was metaphorical and symbolic rather than literal. The demands were not so much about livelihood — these were people assured of livelihoods,” says Sundar. “What drove them was a sense of their self-determination being denied, especially at a time that coincided with a political vacuum after Jayalalithaa’s death.”

Celebrating cattle

Jallikattu is part of an agricultural tradition, a celebration of traditional cattle, says film historian Theodore Baskaran. He recalls watching jallikattu as a boy growing up in Dharapuram town in Tirupur district. “I remember sitting on the school’s compound wall and watching the event unfold on the road alongside. The bulls were released, and the tamers would try to ride it holding on to the hump. It would go on for hours. Those days, the prizes were veshtis and towels, now of course it’s cars.” The interesting thing, he says, is that jallikattu is part of a tradition that anthropologists call the ‘little tradition’. “It is connected to the village deity, and not related to Vedic deities.”

Heeding the passionate protests, the Tamil Nadu Assembly, in January 2017, brought into force a new jallikattu law, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017, which effectively reversed the Supreme Court ban, although putting some regulations in place. The amended Act permitted jallikattu “with a view to follow and promote tradition and culture and to ensure preservation of native breed of bulls.”

The consensus was that the new, more rigorous, regulations would make the sport safe. The fresh rules required participants to be given a medical check-up before they enter the arena; for ambulances and doctors to be in place; for the arena to be surrounded by an 8ft double barricade so that the bulls don’t jump out and injure spectators. Responding to the Supreme Court’s 2014 verdict that the bulls are prodded, beaten and deliberately agitated before they are forced into the arena, the new rules mandated that veterinarians be present, and that the bulls not be physically abused or fed alcohol.

Yet, as critics point out, the sport continues to be dangerous to both people and animals.

J. Amalorpavanathan, former director of the Institute of Vascular Surgery, Madras Medical College, is concerned by the deaths and injuries that occur every season. “Any human interaction with a provoked animal is an invitation to death. We have seen everything from injuries to the bladder, bowel, liver and spleen to the rupture of lungs and major blood vessels in the body.”

Not so valid

As for the argument that it is necessary to preserve an ancient tradition, as Dr. Amalorpavanathan says, “Sati and untouchability were also practised in the name of tradition.” Sundar refutes also that the practice protects native breeds. “Honestly,” she says, “this is not valid at all. The basic foundation for [cattle preservation] is good agricultural and cattle science.” Other critics have described the sport as feudal, as excluding communities. Some have pointed to its patriarchal cult and the way it perpetuates hypermasculinity. “It reminds me of Roman gladiators thrown into the arena as the audience watched them getting gored,” says Dr. Amalorpavanathan.

Can greater safety regulations make jallikattu less dangerous?

Manuraj Shunmugasundaram is an advocate at Madras High Court. He thinks the cultural practice should be protected, but also regulated and independently audited. He believes the law must mandate the use of more sophisticated safety measures. Referring to the Tamil Nadu Regulation of Jallikattu Act, 2009, Shunmugasundaram says, “This law has safeguards to reduce injury to people and animals, but we are now in 2020, and it is the government’s duty to improve these provisions, to include better safety measures, perhaps protective gear, that are available today and that we did not have 10 years ago.”

As Dr. Amalorpavanathan says, “Society has to decide what it wants: a dangerous practice that passes off as tradition or human life.” Clearly, it’s time for the government to improve jallikattu safety regulations. While this can substantially reduce the risk of injury and death to humans, the fact remains that the sport is still innately cruel to the beast. Most human deaths and injuries are caused by bulls terrified by the noise and the crowds into which they are pushed out. On January 22, a panicked bull fell to its death when it raced blindly into a well in Tirupattur district. Pitting a petrified animal against several humans: does society really need such a sport?",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/5rsrnc/article30643193.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26SM1JALLIKATTU2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/jallikattu-five-dead-over-100-injured-in-three-days-this-dangerous-sport-needs-safety-regulations/article30643197.ece
47,2020/01/25,A lit fest for a republic,"Here’s a hypothetical situation for you. Suppose you’re an individual who works in a field connected to literature, journalism, history, sociology, cinema, theatre, economics or social activism. Say you do some kind of work that requires study and intellectual effort, possibly but not necessarily involving the publishing of written texts such as monographs, articles or books. Say you are a politician or a sportsperson. Now let’s say you have achieved a fair degree of success and renown in your field and that you are very aware of everything that’s going on around you.

Now, imagine that your country had a major literature festival that took place every year. There might, of course, be many smaller festivals but say this one was older and bigger than all the others, one of the biggest in the world, the Gargantua of all Lit Fests.

Who’s paying?

Say the Gargantua Lit Fest (GLF) took place in a city that was already a major tourist destination. The festival was free to the public; the programmes were great; it was attended by writers and thinkers and other important and interesting figures from around the world; even if the crowds got a bit enervating there were always many really interesting panels and discussions; and then, every evening, the live music turned the place into a party. Say you yourself had been invited to this festival a few times over the past 10-12 years. Say you’d gone and felt it was really worthwhile despite the cluster-cluck of celebrities, hangers-on who were just there to be seen, and so on.

Now, everyone knows there are no free cultural festivals. Someone has to pay for the whole set-up, the hiring of the venues, the stages and the shamianas, the air fares and the hotels, the folk singers and the rock bands, the food and the booze. Unless it’s a government footing the bill, we all know that this money usually comes from corporate sponsors.

We also know that every now and then, the world over, controversy erupts about who the sponsors are for various events and what corporate misdemeanours and skulduggery they may have committed. We know the arguments about whether participants are helping a particular corporation’s PR effort to cover up often quite huge misdeeds by taking part in the event.

My advice

We know people have boycotted festivals, groups have protested at the venues, with placards, posters, slogans and even by capturing the stage to broadcast their objections. We also remember that the protests haven’t always been about the corporate crimes; sometimes political or religious groups — who don’t care a hoot about the sponsors — have also jumped in to attack what is being said on the stage.

Hypothetically, let’s imagine we live in a country where a criminal political group has captured huge sectors of power including media houses and TV channels. One such channel — let’s call them Popular Entertainment Enterprise TV, or PEE TV — has been particularly disgusting in the way they have attacked anyone who dares criticise the regime, particularly in the manner they have propagated lies about young protesters standing up to the regime.

It has been proven beyond any doubt that PEE TV has tampered with both footage and sound to frame the student leaders of these protests, labelling them as ‘anti-national’, ‘terrorists’ and ‘tukde-tukde gang’. As a result one of the student leaders has had a serious attempt made on his life. Unrepentant, PEE TV has redoubled its efforts on the smear campaign. Let’s say you find the behaviour of PEE TV (and other such channels, like Repugnant TV) totally abhorrent.

Let’s imagine that PEE TV has been the sponsor for the GLF for the last few years but in the past few months the channel’s name has been absent from the festival’s publicity. Rumour has it that GLF has parted ways with PEE because of the channel’s odious policies. Now imagine that GLF invited you to be one of the star participants in this year’s festival and you’ve accepted. Suddenly, just a few days before the start of the festival, PEE TV is back as the headline sponsor; the festival is once again called PEE-GLF. What, then, do you do? Do you back out? Do you still attend?

I don’t see you asking for my advice, but here it is. Under normal circumstances there should be no hesitation — any event sponsored by PEE TV should be boycotted by anyone who has spoken out against fake news, communal poisoning and the vilifying of educational institutions. However, if the country was in a political meltdown then it might be time to rethink this.

Could those who are otherwise raising their voices against wrongdoing attend their sessions at GLF and make their revulsion for the sponsors and their ideology clear again and again, in unpredictable ways that would be hard to edit out of any footage? On T-shirts, on placards and on book covers. This is all complete fiction, of course, but perhaps it is interesting to imagine what such a literature festival might be like.

49,2020/01/25,A trip down memory lane,"It was a time to share memories of college escapades and achievements when 32 alumni of the Government College of Engineering in Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh, held their annual reunion in Tiruchi recently.

Aged between 78 and 82 years, the ‘old boys’ of the 1958-’63 batch of the college, also felicitated a senior batchmate, nonagenarian K Kuthbudeen (1948-’52), at a special function held in Breeze Residency last week.

The college, established in 1946, was a noted educational institution for young men in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. “Since the college is now in Andhra Pradesh, almost all the alumni belong to that state. I settled down in Tiruchi after working as plant manager in Neyveli Lignite Corporation. Our batch has been meeting annually since 2013. Last year, when we met in Tirupathi, we agreed to hold the next reunion in Tiruchi. Though it is a long way from home for many of the boys, they were happy to come along with their family members to Tamil Nadu,” said V M Habibullah, who organised the two-day event.

The reunion included a tour of the local sights and historic temples in and around Tiruchi. “Within two days, our Andhra friends managed to squeeze in visits to the Sriranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam, Jambukeswarar Temple in Tiruvanaikovil, Uthamarkoil, Samayapuram Mariyamman Temple, Big Temple and the Kallanai Dam in Thanjavur,” said Habibullah. “Some of them extended their stay up to the following weekend to include trips to Madurai as well.”

At the reception on Saturday, alumni association president G Sankara Reddy lauded his friends for making the Tiruchi trip a memorable one. “Despite our commitments and physical ailments, it is wonderful to see our friends make the effort to meet up every year,” he said.

In his address, Kuthbudeen recalled the humble beginnings of the engineering college. “The Second World War was coming to an end when the college was established, so the authorities were unable to do much at first,” he said. “The classes and hostel functioned out of an Army barracks in Anantapuram, and then in Guindy (Madras) and Coimbatore, before shifting to its current campus. Students faced many difficulties in the initial years, as there were no toilet facilities and one had to travel several kilometers to the nearby town to find a dosa for dinner, but we overcame all the problems.”

Kuthbudeen is the last son of Mohamed Pichai Rowther Ibrahim Khalifullah, a distinguished lawyer and councilor who worked as the Dewan at the court of Raja Rajagopala Thondaiman of Pudukottai from 1945-1947 before the amalgamation of the kingdom into independent India.

Associated with many leading engineering firms, Kuthbudeen spent over 20 years from the 1970s in Libya, as part of the team of Indian engineers in charge of the construction of a steel plant in the northwestern port city of Misruata.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/hwimb9/article30650389.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TYMPREUNIONMAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/society/a-reunion-for-the-1958-to-1963-batches-of-government-college-of-engineering-in-anantapur-andhra-pradesh-was-held-in-tiruchi-recently/article30650390.ece
50,2020/01/25,Tech revolution and the need to build trust in a post-Cambridge Analytica world,"As we step into the new decade, technology revolution is expected to be led by artificial intelligence. However, given its ability to impact consumers’ behaviour using data, experts feel stakeholders will need to work on building trust in a post-Cambridge Analytica world.

In a discussion with The Hindu on ‘Tech in 2020’s’, Jagish Mitra, Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Growth at Tech Mahindra, said the decade would see a lot more mix of technology and behaviour. “It [technology] will start impacting people’s behaviour much stronger. We saw some glimpses of that in the last decade, where people said you could define how people should vote, how people should buy.”

He added that people’s behaviour will start to get “manipulated” using technology, “in a good sense or a bad sense. It all depends on how we choose to do it... whether it’s the garments you wear, or the chair you sit on, or the house you sit in, [it] will still capture [data] and make it a lot more experiential for you. And therefore impact your behaviour,” he said, adding that issues like trust will need to be addressed.

Sangeeta Gupta, senior V-P and Chief Strategy Officer at industry body Nasscom agreed. “I think we need to build an environment of trust...the whole Cambridge Analytica, other data issues, have created a lot of distrust between technology companies, citizens and the government. I think that there needs to be more positive conversations on how to drive trust in tech in the 2020s.”

Ms. Gupta added, “If that basic value is not existing, we’ll always be trying to over regulate or under regulate or do things differently, but I would think trust is something that will be very, very critical as a core value the technology and its stakeholders need to drive in this decade.”

In terms of technology, Ms. Gupta said that this decade will be about intersection of technology with domains. For example, technology with healthcare. “There’s also convergence. It’s no more AI alone, but AI with quantum, with blockchain, with cybersecurity. Plus with 5G coming in, there will be a lot more change that takes place...potentially if the last decade was about enterprise innovation, this decade can be about more people oriented or citizen first innovation.”

From an enterprise point of view, Dharmender Kapoor, CEO, Birlasoft, believes that this decade will see entire business models being re-imagined with data playing a crucial role. “Technology is a given. Digital technology is already available and more superior technology will come, but businesses will have to work more efficiently on the data. Data is the new oil, but right now it is crude oil. We need more sophisticated data for artificial intelligence. Also, there is a need to look at data beyond your boundaries. I can predict within my business to a certain accuracy, but what if I can do more than that… behaviour of my competitor, behaviour of market, what if there is a flood? What if the economy goes down?”

According to Saurabh Moody, founder of analytics firm Alpha.ai, voice is the future. “Imagine you’ve got no interface, no buttons, nothing. It will be exactly like talking to a human... and this will also give you a flavour of decision making. When this particular system has been used by so many people across the world, it will bring you collective intelligence...and enable more personalisation.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tech-revolution-and-the-need-to-build-trust-in-apost-cambridge-analytica-world/article30654190.ece
51,2020/01/25,"Country will have 10,000 EV buses this year: Gadkari","The 1,300-km-long Mumbai-Delhi Electric Highway, to be built at an investment of ₹1,03,000 crore, would become operational by January 2024, Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari said.

Speaking at an event organised by TVS Motors Company here on Saturday, the Minister said the government could achieve a saving of ₹16,000 crore in land acquisition by routing the e-highway through villages where free land portions were available.

Continuing his push for an electric environment in the country, the Minister said oil imports currently cost the country ₹7 lakh crore per annum and on top of it, burning fuel caused a lot of pollution.

According to Mr. Gadkari, the country's auto industry, which directly and indirectly employs over 2 crore people, has a turnover of ₹4,50,000 crore.

“I am glad to see auto makers responding to the call we have been making for electric vehicles. The country has a surplus of electricity now and therefore we need to have EV buses, EV cars, EV trucks, EV bikes and EV scooters. We will have 10,000 EV buses this year.”

He said the government has an increased focus on alternate fuels like CNN, biofuel and others. “In Nagpur, we are currently running 100 buses on methane generated from sewage water. We will run another 400 buses here on biofuel,” the Minister said.

Mr. Gadkari said the government was also exploring jatropha-based biofuel for fighter jets. Currently, the government imports aviation turbine fuel worth ₹40,000 crore a year. “All these natural and biofuel based energy generation activities will create employment and income opportunities for a large number of farmers and tribals in India,” the Minister further said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/country-will-have-10000-ev-buses-this-year-gadkari/article30654170.ece

53,2020/01/25,Focus is now on domestic market: Tata International,"The leather division of Tata International Ltd. has drawn up plans to increase its share in the domestic market fourfold in the next three to four years by unveiling international products, says V. Muthukumaran, head, leather products, Tata International Ltd., in a conversation. Edited excerpts:

What was the impact of the economic slowdown on your business?

We have been posting good growth year-on-year as we exported nearly 95% of our products. So, there was hardly any impact of the economic slowdown on our business. We produced four million pairs of footwear in FY18 and this rose to 4.5 million in FY19. We will be manufacturing close to 5.5 million pairs this fiscal and our target is 7 million by FY21 and 10 million by FY23.

What will your capital expenditure be?

We will be investing close to ₹500 crore over the next five years on capital expenditure, to make synthetic and non-leather products and ladies shoes.

This calls for setting up new lines of production, upgrading existing ones and doubling the workforce at our Ranipet facility to 15,000 people. Right now, women employees comprise 80% of total workforce.

We have manufacturing facilities in Ranipet that make 5 million pairs of footwear a year, followed by units in Ambur and Chennai that make one million pairs each, respectively. Our unit in Chittoor in Andhra Pradesh is a small facility that makes 1,000 pairs of shoe uppers per day, which will be increased to 3,000 pairs per day. Over the next 3-4 years, one more unit might come up in Walajabad in Tamil Nadu. We also make garments, outsoles, leather articles and non-leather items.

Will you be focussing more on exports?

No. We are now contemplating an increase in our share in the domestic market from the current 5% to 20% in the next three to four years. This requires setting up new stores.

Right now, we have the first store in Indore and a second one will be opened in Chennai soon. Right now, we also have domestic presence in school shoes ‘Feetscience’ that sells two lakh pairs.

How do you plan to face intense competition from existing players?

We will be introducing ‘Saydo’ brand of comfort women shoes in India next year. Currently, it is being manufactured in India and Portugal and sold in Europe in limited numbers. Our idea is to increase its sales volume both in India and Europe. It is retailed between ₹2,500 and ₹5,000 a pair.

Tell us about Tata International’s various production capacities...

We produce five million pieces of leather articles, 50,000 pieces of leather garments, 8 million pairs of outsoles, 6 million pieces of leather footwear, 2 million pairs of non-leather footwear and 40 million sq.ft. of finished leather.

We are the third-largest exporter of leather and leather products, the second-largest exporter of finished leather and the second-largest exporter of leather footwear.

What will be the division’s turnover?

We are looking at achieving ₹1,000 crore this fiscal, which would be an increase of 15% over the corresponding period last year. We export products to 30 countries such as the U.S. and Australia and those in Europe. We are aiming at revenue of ₹1,500-1,600 crore, when the sales volume touches 10 million pairs per annum.

Your major clients?

55,2020/01/25,President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to the nation on the eve of 71st Republic Day,"Dear fellow citizens,

1.On the eve of our 71st Republic Day, I extend my warm greetings to all of you, in India and abroad.

2.Seven decades ago, on 26th January, our Constitution came into effect. Even before that, this date had acquired special significance. Having resolved to attain ‘Purna Swaraj’, our people had been celebrating ‘Purna Swaraj Day’ on every 26th January from 1930 to 1947. That is why, in 1950 we embarked our journey as a Republic on the 26th January, affirming to the principles laid down in our Constitution. Since then, every year we celebrate our Republic Day on 26th January.

3.The modern State comprises the three organs – Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, which are necessarily interlinked and interdependent. Yet, on ground, the people comprise the State. ‘We the People’ are the prime movers of the Republic. With us,the people of India rests the real power to decide our collective future.

4.Our Constitution gave us rights as citizens of a free democratic nation, but also placed on us the responsibility to always adhere to the central tenets of our democracy – justice, liberty, equality and fraternity. It becomes easier for us to follow these constitutional ideals, if we keep in mind the life and values of the Father of our Nation. By doing so, we will be adding a meaningful dimension to our celebrations of 150th birth anniversary of Gandhiji.

Dear fellow citizens,

5.The Government has launched a number of welfare campaigns, and what is especially noteworthy about them is the fact that citizens have voluntarily turned them into popular movements. The ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan’ has achieved astounding success in such a short time. The same spirit can be seen in other endeavours. Be it giving up cooking fuel subsidy or pushing digital payments, the common man has made the government programmes his own, making them truly effective. The success of the ‘Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana’ is a matter of pride, as the target of 8 crore beneficiaries has been achieved. With this, those in need have access to clean fuel. The ‘Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana’, that is, ‘Saubhagya’ too has brightened people’s lives. Under ‘Pradhanmantri Kisan Samman Nidhi’, more than 14 crore farmer families have become entitled to receive minimum annual income of Rupees six thousand. This has enabled the farmers who feed us to live a life of dignity.

To effectively meet the challenge of the increasing water crisis, the Ministry of Jalshakti has been created. Water conservation and water management are being given top priority. I am confident that, like ‘Swachchh Bharat Abhiyan’, ‘Jal Jeevan Mission’ too will take the form of a popular movement.

6.Along with the welfare of those most in need, every policy initiative of the Government is guided by the ‘nation-first’ principle. The roll-out of the GST has realised our vision of ‘One country, One tax, One market’. It is being complemented by the e-NAM scheme, which is strengthening the process of creating ‘one market for one nation’ and will benefit farmers. There is a consistent effort by the government to ensure overall development of each and every part of the country – be it Jammu-Kashmir and Ladakh, the states in the North-East or our Islands in the Indian Ocean.

7.Strong internal security is essential for the development of the country. Therefore, the government has taken several concrete steps to strengthen the internal security system.

8.Access to health and education are often considered the foundation of good governance. In both these sectors, we have come a long way in the seven decades. The Government has rightly focused its attention on the health sector, with its ambitious initiatives. Starting with the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, and expanding to the Ayushman Bharat, which is the world’s largest publicly funded universal healthcare programme, the Government has shown its care and concern for the well-being of the poor. Quality of healthcare has improved, so has its reach. The Jan Aushadhi Yojana has brought down the healthcare budget of common people in the country by providing quality generic medicines at affordable prices.

Dear fellow citizens,

9.The foundations of a sound education system were built in ancient times, with the setting up of great universities like Nalanda and Takshashila. In India, knowledge has always been considered more valuable than power, fame or riches. In our tradition, educational institutions are respected as temples of learning. When our land was pushed into backwardness after the long colonial rule, it was education that emerged as a path to empowerment. Even though the development of our educational institutions commenced soon after Independence, in an environment of scarcity of resources, our achievements in the field of education have followed a remarkable trajectory. Our endeavour is to ensure that no child or youth is denied education. At the same time, we need to strive to reach global education standards by continuous reform of our educational systems.

10.India is proud of the achievements of ISRO. They are making further progress in Mission Gaganyaan, and the nation excitedly looks forward to the Indian Human Space flight Programme gaining further momentum this year.

11.This is also the year of Tokyo Olympics. While India has traditionally done well in a number of sports, the new generation of players and athletes has brought laurels for the nation in more and more varieties of sports in recent years. At Olympics 2020, the Indian contingent will be backed by cheers and good wishes of millions of Indians.

12.Another source of pride for our country has been our diaspora. During my visits abroad, I have observed that Indians have not only brought prosperity to their adopted lands, they have also enhanced India’s image before the world community. Many of them have made great contributions in a wide variety of endeavours.

Dear fellow citizens,

13.I have nothing but unreserved praise for our armed forces, paramilitary and internal security forces. Their sacrifices to preserve the integrity and unity of our country present a saga of unparalleled courage and discipline. Our farmers, doctors and nurses, teachers who impart learning and values, scientists and engineers, alert and active youth, industrious members of our workforce, entrepreneurs contributing to our economic wealth, artists who enrich our culture, service sector professionals who have earned global appreciation, our fellow countrymen contributing in many other spheres of activity and specially our resilient daughters who have scaled new heights of achievements against odds - they all bring pride to our nation.

14.Earlier this month, I had the opportunity to interact with some achievers who have done commendable work in various fields. Working silently, they have made immense contributions to various fields including science and innovation, sports, empowerment of Divyang persons, farming and afforestation, women and child empowerment, education, healthcare, revival of old art forms and providing food and nutrition to the needy. For example, Sushri Aarifa Jan has revived the Numdha handicrafts in Jammu & Kashmir; Sushri Ratnawali Kottapalli has been serving patients suffering from thalassemia in Telangana; Shrimati Devaki Amma has developed forest wealth through her individual efforts in Kerala; Shri Jamkhojang Misao has improved the lives of many people through his community development efforts in Manipur and Shri Babar Ali has been providing education to underprivileged children in West Bengal since his childhood. There are numerous such examples, I have mentioned only a few of them. They exemplify that ordinary people can make extraordinary contributions. There are a large number of voluntary organisations too who have been contributing to the project of nation-building, and complementing the initiatives of government.

Fellow Citizens,

15.We are now in the third decade of the twenty-first century. This will be the decade of the rise of New India and a new generation of Indians. More and more of those born in this century are participating in the national discourse. With the passage of time, we are gradually losing living links with our great freedom struggle, but there is no reason to worry about the continuity of the beliefs that guided it. With advances in technology, the young minds of today are better informed and more confident. The next generation remains strongly committed to the core values of our nation. For our youth, the nation always comes first. With them, we are witnessing the emergence of a New India.

16.Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals remain relevant in our nation-building efforts. It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji’s message of truth and nonviolence, which has become all the more necessary in our times.

When fighting for a cause, people, particularly the youth, should not forget the gift of Ahimsa Gandhiji gave to humanity. Gandhiji’s talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong also applies to the functioning of our democracy. Government and opposition both have important roles to play. While giving expression to their political ideas, both must move forward in tandem to ensure that development of the country and welfare of its people are promoted consistently.

Dear fellow citizens,

17.As our Republic Day is a celebration of our Constitution, let me conclude with the words of its chief architect, Babasaheb Ambedkar:

[I QUOTE]

""If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also in fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is to hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives.” [UN QUOTE]

These words have always lighted our path. These words will continue to show us the way ahead to new glories.

Dear citizens,

18.The idea of world as a large well-knit family, captured in our message of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, strengthens our relations with other nations. We have been sharing our democratic ideals and the fruits of our development with the entire world.

We have a tradition of inviting foreign heads of states to participate in our Republic Day celebrations. I am glad that this year, our distinguished friend, The President of Brazil, Mr. Bolsonarowill take part in our Republic Day function tomorrow.

As India and Indians march forward, we remain committed to engaging the global community to build a secure and prosperous future for ourselves and for the entire humanity.

19.I once again convey my Republic Day greetings to all of you and I extend my best wishes for your bright future.

56,2020/01/25,"Low-speed mobile internet in Kashmir ‘temporarily’ suspended, to resume after Republic Day celebrations","Low-speed mobile internet was restored on Saturday in Kashmir after being snapped nearly six months ago, only to be “temporarily” suspended later in the evening, with officials saying the service would resume after the culmination of Republic Day celebrations.

Mobile internet was suspended in the wake of the Centre’s decision on August 5 last year to revoke Article 370 provisions that gave the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir special status. “The mobile internet services were temporarily suspended this evening ahead of the Republic Day functions,” an official said.

The service can only be used to access 301 websites approved by the administration, the officials said. “Mobile internet has been restored across the Valley. Only 2G services have been restored and only white-listed websites, excluding social media sites, can be accessed,” an official had said earlier in the day.

Restoring the service was the latest step towards easing the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir following the Supreme Court’s January 10 ruling asking its administration to review within a week all orders imposing curbs in the Union Territory. On January 18, the administration restored prepaid mobile services in the Valley and resumed 2G mobile data service on white-listed websites across the Jammu division.

Broadband and leased-lines still down

The 301 sites approved include search engines and those associated with banking, education, news, travel, utilities and employment. There was no word yet on resumption of high-speed broadband and leased-line services in the Valley.

A decision on that will be taken at an appropriate time after assessing the situation, officials said on Saturday. The 2G mobile internet services will be available on postpaid as well as prepaid phones.

Social media applications will continue to remain out of bounds for the Valley’s residents, according to a notification issued by the Home Department of the Jammu and Kashmir administration. Internet services, landline and mobile phones were snapped across Jammu and Kashmir on the eve of the Centre’s announcement to scrap special status of the erstwhile State and its bifurcation into Union Territories.

While most of the services except mobile internet were restored in Jammu within a week, Kashmir witnessed restoration of landlines and postpaid mobile services and internet facilities for essential services like hospitals in phases. Though the restoration of mobile internet was welcomed by people, many said it will not be of much help due to low-speed connectivity.

‘Cannot access websites’

Yawar Nazir, a resident of Srinagar city, said: “The restoration is welcome news. But what are we going to do with these low speeds in the times of 4G or 5G? We cannot access websites. It is taking ages to open a website.”

Another resident Mehraj-ud-din said the restoration of low-speed internet “meant nothing” for students. “The internet ban has affected our education. It has especially affected those who had to seek admissions and to take part in various examinations. Now, even as the internet has been restored, what good will come out of it as the speeds are very low. We cannot access most of the websites,” he said.

Another user Aaishan Ahmad said many people in the Valley were using social media platforms to be in touch with their loved ones abroad. “They will still have to go for expensive phone calls. Who can imagine such a thing happening in a digital age?” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/lmx27p/article30654493.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THJC-KASHMIR-25jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/low-speed-mobile-internet-in-kashmir-temporarily-suspended-to-resume-after-republic-day-celebrations/article30654435.ece
57,2020/01/25,SC affirms 3% quota for disabled in PSUs,"A three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court has granted relief to persons with disabilities across the country by allowing reservation in promotion in all groups for those employed in public sector jobs.

The Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman confirmed that 3% reservation should be given to disabled persons both in direct recruitment and in promotions.

The Bench, also comprising Justices Aniruddha Bose and V. Ramasubramanian, was answering a reference on the question whether the disabled, included under The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995”, were eligible for reservation in promotion.

“This judgment will open the doors for thousands of persons with disabilities who have been stagnating at the lower levels in public sector jobs, as their promotion to higher level posts was made difficult due to discriminatory policies,” advocates Rajan Mani and Ritu Kumar of the Disability Law Initiative, who appeared in the case, reacted.

The judgment confirms a 2016 verdict of the top court in Rajeev Kumar Gupta’s case that granted reservation in promotion to disabled persons employed in Groups A and B in addition to Groups C and D categories in the public sector.

The 2016 judgment had held that wherever posts were identified to be suitable for persons with disabilities, 3% reservation must be given. The government had however challenged the 2016 judgement, leading to the reference to the larger Bench.

The government had referred to the Indira Sawhney case, which had capped reservation at 50% and prohibited reservation in promotions.

But Justice Nariman countered that the Sawhney judgment only pertained to the Backward Classes. It has no relevance in the case of persons with disabilities.

The Constitution only prohibits preferential treatment on the basis of caste or religion. Here, reservation is contemplated for disabled persons.

The rule of no reservation in promotions laid down in the Indra Sawhney judgmeny has clearly and normatively no application in this case.

Similarly, the top court said, “A perusal of Indra Sawhney would reveal that the ceiling of 50% reservation applies only to reservation in favour of Other Backward Classes under Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India whereas the reservation in favour of persons with disabilities is horizontal, which is under Article 16(1) of the Constitution.”

Justice Nariman pointed to how the 1995 law emphasises that “employment is a key factor in the empowerment and inclusion of people with disabilities”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jz1pdd/article30654117.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26DISABLED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-affirms-3-quota-for-disabled-in-psus/article30654118.ece
58,2020/01/25,J&K police top gallantry medal list,"The Jammu and Kashmir Police received the highest number of 108 gallantry medals on the occasion of Republic Day, followed by 76 medals by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Union Home Ministry announced on Saturday. A total of 290 gallantry awards were announced.

Of the four President’s Police Medal for Gallantry, three were bagged by the J&K police and one by the CRPF.

Medals for CRPF

The CRPF was decorated with 75 police medals for gallantry and one President’s medal posthumously for CoBRA commando Utpal Rabha. Rabha was killed in an encounter with Maoists in Jharkhand in June 2018 and his citation said that he displayed “extraordinary valour” during the gun battle.

Among the Central forces, the Border Security Force (BSF) got nine police gallantry medals, followed by the Sashastra Seema Bal (four) and the Railway Protection Force (one).

Service medals

Overall, 1,040 police medals have been declared that includes 93 distinguished service medals and 657 meritorious service medals.

59,2020/01/25,"Remember the gift of Ahimsa, says President Ram Nath Kovind","President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday, in his address to the nation on the eve of the 71st Republic Day, reminded citizens, particularly the youth, the importance of non-violence while fighting for a cause and the need to adopt constitutional methods in pursuit of social and economic objectives.

Though the President did not make any reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), his comments are to be read against the backdrop of the nationwide protests against it.

“When fighting for a cause, people, particularly the youth, should not forget the gift of Ahimsa Gandhiji gave to humanity. Gandhiji’s talisman for deciding whether an act is right or wrong also applies to the functioning of our democracy,” he said.

“It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji’s message of truth and non-violence, which has become all the more necessary in our times,” he said.

People power

He said the modern Indian state comprised three organs — legislature, executive and judiciary — that were interlinked and interdependent, but it was the citizens who made up the state.

“We the people are the prime movers of the Republic. With us, the people of India, rests the real power to decide our collective future,” he said.

Mr. Kovind stressed that the government and the Opposition had important roles to play, and “while giving expression to their political ideas, both must move forward in tandem to ensure the development of the country.”

Mr. Kovind stressed how Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals were more than relevant in the present times, and pointed out that the Constitution not only guaranteed rights to every citizen but also placed a responsibility to follow the tenets of democracy — justice, liberty, equality, fraternity.

“It becomes easier for us to follow these constitutional ideals, if we keep in mind the life and values of the Father of our Nation,” he said. “Mahatma Gandhi’s ideals remain relevant in our nation-building efforts. It should be part of our daily routine to introspect on Gandhiji’s message of truth and non-violence, which has become all the more necessary in our times.”

The President said the third decade of the 21st century will be the decade of the rise of New India.

“More and more of those born in this century are participating in the national discourse.

60,2020/01/25,NGO moves Supreme Court against order on AGR dues,"A petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Saturday by an NGO to quash and set aside a January 23 order of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) not to take any coercive action against telecom companies for failure to comply with a court order to pay Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues.

The DoT has directed its Controllers of Communication Accounts (CCAs) of the Licence Service Areas (LSAs), the Controller-General Communication Accounts (CGCA) and the Deputy Director-General Licence Finance Assessment (DDG LFA)/the Deputy Director-General Wireless Planning Finance (DDG/WPF) not to take any coercive action against the companies, said the petition filed by Save Consumer Rights Foundation, represented by advocate Sriram P.

The petition said the directive amounted to a gross violation of the court’s October 24, 2019 judgment. It transgressed the fundamental rights of citizens by not collecting dues from the companies, thus causing a loss to the exchequer. The petition sought urgent steps to ensure immediate recovery of the dues. It also asked the court to initiate “appropriate proceedings” against the government for defying its judgment.

Next week, the court is likely to hear the petitions filed by Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel for modification of the verdict that asked the companies to pay up ₹1.47 lakh crore in dues within three months.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/eze8s1/article30653886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-THGRP-COURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ngo-moves-supreme-court-against-order-on-agr-dues/article30653887.ece
61,2020/01/25,"We’re in the stone age, say Kashmir students on Internet shut down","From ferrying data in hard drives by air to driving over 300 km away for downloading syllabi of professional courses, students in the cut off Kashmir Valley are finding new ways to bypass the obstacles posed by the 147-day Internet shutdown.

Though the government has restored 2G services in dribs and drabs, connectivity remains a major issue.

Peerzada Fawaz Qureshi, 22, pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science from S.S.M. Engineering College in Srinagar, is a fourth semester student and dreams to make it big as a security researcher. Mr. Qureshi has already earned a name as an ethical hacker after identifying bugs on known platforms including Facebook, Oath, Tesla, Uber, Mastercard and Adobein the past few years. His work which also help him earn money.

“It's a very, very tough competition online. I am out of the race since August 5 (when Internet services to the Valley were cut off). Internet to a security researcher is what water is to fish,” Mr. Qureshi says. The SSM college’s closed assignment and reference sharing group on WhatsApp has also shut down.

Once hooked to the Internet for eight to 10 hours a day, the shut down has left Mr. Qureshi restless and sleepless.

“It has already impacted my job prospects. I cannot compete with those breathing hi-speed Internet in rest of the country. It's like a student from the Stone Age competing with the Information Technology age. It will dent local engineers employability in the corporate sector,” he points out.

For Khursheed Saiqa, a Class 11 student from Srinagar's Zaina Kadal area, it's literally back to the chalk-and-board era.

“I was used to reading on the Kindle for many years now. [But] no new books could be downloaded in the past five months. We paid a friend to ferry course material and references on a hard disk from Delhi and then distributed it here,” Mr. Saiqa says.

Scores of students in the Valley have shipped their tablets, Kindles and iPads for necessary updates and downloading of popular YouTube lectures from online course and coaching platforms like Unacademy. Kashmir is home to 14 lakh students, a significant section of the total population of 70 lakh.

The Internet blackout has impacted students pursuing national-level professional examinations the most. Naveed Azeem and his friends booked a cab to travel all the way from Srinagar to Jammu, a distance of 300 km, to access a fixed-line high speed connection.

“We downloaded the NEET syllabus for 2020, course material and online references. I am pretty sure that the results of the NEET later this year will reflect how students of Kashmir suffered due to lack of Internet. How many can afford to travel to Jammu in this weather when the Srinagar-Jammu highway gets closed for days together?” said Mr. Azeem.

Top coaching centres in Srinagar, such as Aakash that train students for all-India competitive examinations, have seen a movement of students and parents opting for s centres outside J&K for year 2020; many fear a “scaling up of tensions in the region” sources said.

Rukhsana Qureshi, vice-principal of the S.S. Islamia High School, says, the lack of Internet has also erased a crucial interface between the school administration, teachers, parents and students.

“The modern means of education is not just class work but online search, study and experience. Kashmir was part of the flat world due to unhindered access to the Internet before August 5. A local Kashmiri student is as aspirational as someone in Delhi, Islamabad, Istanbul or London. This generation of students for sure will lag behind in absence of Internet. It's an assault on the education in the name of security,” Ms. Qureshi says.

While authorities have restored 2G mobile Internet services, the speeds are insufficient for data-heavy sites. Further, access is limited to only 153 so-called ‘whitelist’ websites which excludes all social media platforms including YouTube and WhatsApp. Srinagar is yet to see any Internet restored. All fixed-line broadband services continue to be barred in Kashmir, with the shut down completing six months in February.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2na5f2/article30653508.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THRDSRINAGAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/were-in-the-stone-age-say-kashmir-students-on-internet-shut-down/article30653509.ece

63,2020/01/25,China coronavirus: PMO reviews India’s preparedness to combat outbreak,"The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on January 25 reviewed India’s preparedness to deal with the outbreak of the new coronavirus (nCoV), amid mounting global concern over increasing number of cases in China, the epicentre of the outbreak, and several other countries.

At a meeting chaired by P.K. Mishra, Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, Health Ministry officials presented an update about response measures, official sources said.

So far, 20,000 people from 115 flights at seven international airports in the country have been screened. The sources said the National Institute of Virology labs are fully equipped to test the virus and that all State and district health authorities have been alerted.

Earlier, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan reviewed preparations with officials for prevention and management of the nCoV.

“No nCoV case has been detected in the country so far. However, 11 persons have been put under observation; out of samples taken from them, the samples of four passengers have been confirmed to be negative for nCoV by the ICMR-NIV Pune lab. One of the Mumbai patients tested positive for rhinovirus and one for routine common cold virus,” he said.

“The situation is being closely monitored at the highest level,” said Dr. Vardhan.

24X7 helpline set up for coronavirus

As the number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) rise across the world, the government on Saturday set up a round-the-clock National Centre for Disease Control Call Centre ( +91-11-23978046) to attend to public queries.

“The call centre will monitor the list of contacts furnished by the Ministry of External Affairs; provide details of district and State surveillance officers to callers and in case of any clinical query, direct the concerned to the relevant Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer,” officials in the Health Ministry said.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan urged passengers who have a travel history to China since January 1, 2020 to come forward for self-reporting if they experience any symptoms such as fever, cough, respiratory distress, etc. and also inform their treating doctor.

“We are in touch with the World Health Organisation (WHO) for technical support and guidance,” the Minister said after a review of preparedness.

Dr. Harsh Vardhan said he spoke with the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand and assured all support for screening at the border with Nepal, where a confirmed nCoV case had been reported. “We are also writing to the Chief Ministers requesting for personal intervention to review the preparedness,” he added.

The Ministry directed for multi-disciplinary Central teams to be formed and sent to the seven States where thermal screening is being done at the airports (New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi).

“The Central team will consist of a public health expert, a clinician and a microbiologist. The teams shall reach the respective States on Sunday. They shall review the end-to-end preparedness for management and control of nCoV including that at the airports, for thermal screening and transferring of patients to hospitals for isolation, and shall also visit the tertiary hospitals attached to the airports for reviewing the isolation wards and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and masks, etc. They shall also review whether the infection control, surveillance and other guidelines are being followed. The teams shall coordinate with the State Health Secretaries to explore all avenues for further supporting and strengthening the States’ preparedness,’’ said a health official.

An advisory has also been issued to all States/UTs for Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) surveillance to pick up any travel-related case reported in the community and follow up contacts of suspect/confirmed cases.

“The National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune is fully geared up to test samples of nCoV. Ten other laboratories under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s Viral Research and Diagnostics Laboratories (VRDL) network are also equipped to test such samples, if a need arises,” said a release issued by the Ministry.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/p5r5zn/article30653325.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJPATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/china-coronavirus-pmo-reviews-indias-preparedness-to-combat-outbreak/article30653326.ece
64,2020/01/25,India ‘requests’ China to permit Indian students stuck in Wuhan to leave,"As the coronavirus turned virulent, India is understood to have requested China to permit over 250 Indian students stuck in Wuhan, the epicentre of the new SARS-like virus, to leave the city, sources here said on Saturday.

About 700 Indian students, mostly medical students, are believed to be studying in different universities in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Authorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others.

While majority of the Indian students left for home on Chinese New Year holidays, over 250 to 300 students are said to be still in the city and its surrounding areas. Besides the students, the fast spreading virus has become a major worry for their parents back home.

Some students managed to leave the city just before it was sealed off on January 23. India has stepped up monitoring of passengers arriving from China, especially from Wuhan.

The sources here said that in view of the prevailing situation, India has requested both the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the local officials in Wuhan to consider making arrangements for the Indian students to leave.

Asked whether China would consider any request of countries to move their citizens out of Wuhan, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told media here on Thursday “We always help foreign consular officials in China in their official jobs, we offer them all the assistance and convenience necessary and we work to guarantee foreign citizens legitimate rights and interest in China.”

While specific detailed would be provided by local officials, he said China in principle always handles issues according to domestic laws, international laws and bilateral consular agreements.

65,2020/01/25,SC to hear plea to raise Bhopal gas compensation from Jan. 28,"A five-judge Constitution Bench will begin hearing from January 28, a curative petition filed by the government a decade ago for enhancement of compensation to the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy, over and above the $470 million already paid by Union Carbide.

The Constitution Bench would be led by Justice Arun Mishra and comprise Justices Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M.R. Shah and S. Ravindra Bhat.

In January last year, a Bench led by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had agreed to examine the petition.

The government had contended that the compensation,determined in 1989, was arrived at ‘on assumptions of truth unrelated to realities’.

A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court had in 2011 issued notice to the Union Carbide Corporation, now a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Chemicals Co., U.S., Dow Chemicals, McLeod Russel India, Kolkata, and Eveready Industries, Kolkata.

The Centre had sought a review of the May 4, 1989, and subsequent October 3, 1991, orders of the Supreme Court, contending that the 1989 settlement was seriously impaired.

The government has sought additional funds of more than ₹7,400 crore from the pesticides maker.

The tragedy unfolded in Bhopal (the capital of Madhya Pradesh State) on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984, when the highly dangerous and toxic gas, Methyl Isocyanate (MIC), escaped from the Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) facility. The industrial accident resulted in the death of 5,295 human beings, caused injuries to almost 5.7 lakh persons, besides loss of livestock and loss of property.

The court had earlier dismissed a curative petition filed by the CBI in 2010 for ‘enhancement of punishment’.

The investigation agency had filed the curative petition to ‘correct’ the “colossal failure of justice” in 1996 when the apex court chose to dismiss the tragedy as a result of an ‘act of negligence’, and not culpable homicide by former Union Carbide Chairman Warren Anderson and his Indian employees. Mr. Anderson died in 2014.

Dismissing the curative plea in 2011, the Supreme Court had held that “no satisfactory explanation has been given to file such curative petitions after about 14 years from the 1996 judgment”.

The CBI had wanted the Supreme Court to “restore” the criminal charge of Section 304 Part II IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the accused persons. It had approached the Supreme Court after the government had faced a public outcry over a Bhopal court order that sentenced Union Carbide executives to two years’ imprisonment. Those convicted included former Union Carbide India chairman Keshub Mahindra.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kry9qk/article30652971.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-BhopalGasTragedy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-to-hear-plea-to-raise-bhopal-gas-compensation-from-jan-28/article30652950.ece

68,2020/01/25,JNU VC continues to hold official accommodation at IIT-Delhi,"Four years after he took charge as Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Vice Chancellor, M. Jagadesh Kumar still holds an official accommodation at IIT-Delhi, besides a residence at the university campus.

Mr. Kumar, who used to teach at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and still takes classes there, is expected to return to the prestigious educational establishment when his tenure ends next year.

His retention of the IIT accommodation, however, is based on a now-revoked IIT rule.

According to officials, prior to 2017 the institute allowed professors to hold on to their accommodation for five years if they were appointed Vice Chancellors of central universities or Directors of other IITs.

In 2017, the institute amended the policy to reduce the duration of free house retention to one year. However, there has been no retrospective implementation of the new policy.

“Technically, it’s not a violation of the norms but he himself should have surrendered the accommodation considering there are faculty members who have been on waiting list,” an IIT official said on condition of anonymity.

The issue of the JNU Vice Chancellor holding two official accommodations has also been raised by the JNU Teachers Association (JNUTA) in its complaint to the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry about alleged irregularities by Mr. Kumar.

69,2020/01/25,Some voters don’t realise importance of right to exercise franchise: President Kovind,"President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday lamented that there are some voters who do not understand the importance of their right to exercise franchise and reminded them that in several countries people had to struggle to get it.

Addressing an event here on National Voters’ Day marking the establishment of the Election Commission in 1950, the President said from the very first general election to the 17th Lok Sabha polls held last year, voters have increased the credibility of Indian democracy all over the world.

“For this, I congratulate all the voters of the country. But even today some of our voters do not understand the importance of their franchise. They should know that in most of the democratic countries of the world, the common people had to agitate to get the franchise and many sacrifices had to be made,” Mr. Kovind said.

He pointed out that even in old democracies such as England, women were able to get equal voting rights in the 20th century, after nearly three decades of struggle.

The framers of the Indian Constitution gave this invaluable right to all adult Indians without any discrimination, the President said.

Mr. Kovind reminded the audience that soon after Independence, India granted adult suffrage to all citizens which came under a lot of criticism as at that time, democracy was limited to a few developed and prosperous nations.

There were reservations that with only 16% literacy, and poverty, universal adult franchise would not be successful. He said the decision was dubbed as “biggest gamble in history”.

“But our voters proved it to be the biggest successful experiment in democracy in the world history.

73,2020/01/25,Nirbhaya convict moves plea in SC,"Nirbhaya gangrape convict Mukesh Singh on Saturday moved a plea in the Supreme Court challenging the President’s rejection of his mercy petition on January 17.

The petition, filed under Article 32 of the Constitution, has sought a stay of the execution of the death warrant. The sessions court had ordered the death sentence to be carried out on February 1.

Singh has asked the court to call for his medical records, dating back to the time of his arrest and incarceration, which were placed before the President for a decision on his mercy plea. He has also sought for the jail records of his solitary confinement.

This development comes shortly after the Supreme Court had rejected a juvenility plea by another Nirbhaya convict, Pawan Kumar Gupta.

Akshay Singh, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma had brutally gang-raped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

Court disposes petition

Meanwhile, a Delhi court on Saturday said no further directions were required on a plea by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the gang rape and murder case alleging the prison authorities were not handing over certain documents required to file mercy and curative petitions, and disposed of the petition.

Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts’ lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, notebook and paintings or sketches from the Tihar jail authorities.

The court noted that the jail authorities had already complied with the request made by the convicts by supplying the documents whatever was lying with them.

76,2020/01/25,JD(U)-BJP spat: Prashant Kishor posts video of Sushil Modi criticising Nitish Kumar,"A war of words appears to be raging between ruling NDA alliance partners JD(U) and BJP leaders Prashant Kishor and Sushil Kumar Modi, as on Saturday Mr. Kishor attacked Mr. Modi while releasing an old video in which he was slamming Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for having “betrayal in his DNA”.

While releasing the video on social media, Mr. Kishor, JD(U) leader and poll strategist, said, “No one can beat Sushil Modi in giving character certificate to people…his chronology is very clear”.

In the video posted on Mr. Kishor’s twitter handle, senior State BJP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi is being heard slamming the Chief Minister for his betrayal to so many leaders and the BJP.

Earlier, Mr. Modi too had posted on his twitter handle saying, “it is ironic that those whom Nitish Kumar lifts from the ground to power, later became a problem for him…he (Mr. Kumar) gave some his chair, made some a member of the Rajya Sabha, picked someone from non-political backgrounds and held them at high position in the party but some of these have been thankless…in politics all is not always fair”.

It was said Mr. Modi’s tweet was in oblique reference to Mr. Kishor who, to everyone’s surprise, was earlier appointed JD(U)’s national vice-president by Mr. Kumar.

Mr. Kumar had even called him “future” in politics which had caused much consternation among some senior party leaders. But, Mr. Kishor remained close to Mr. Kumar.

CAA, NRC issue

Recently, though, he put Mr. Kumar in a major embarrassment while urging him to clarify his stand on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Later, JD(U) leaders attacked Mr. Kishor for his utterances while questioning his political credibility.

Mr. Modi, who is also known for his closeness to Mr. Kumar, too tweeted slamming Mr. Kishor obliquely. In response, Mr. Kishor attacked him on Saturday by posting the old video.

Recently, another senior JD(U) leader Pawan Varma had attacked Mr. Kumar by writing a two-page letter to him, making references to some “private talks” he had with Mr. Kumar earlier regarding the BJP and the RSS.

Apparently infuriated the Chief Minister asked Mr. Varma to “go wherever he wants as he has my wishes”.

The Union Tourism Minister said this on Friday at the concluding ceremony of the two-day National Tourism Conference, organised by Odisha government in association with FICCI at Konark.

“Tourism Ministry will fund the travel expenses of tourists who visit 15 destinations in the country in a year and submit the photos to our website,” Mr. Patel said.

However, the condition is that the person should travel out of his/her own State, he said.

In the ‘Paryatan Parv’ initiative of the Union Government, it has been decided that a person should travel to at least 15 tourist places of India by 2022. The Ministry of Tourism intends to reward those who complete the task within a year, he said.

“This should not be construed as a monetary benefit but as an incentive. We should honour these persons as brand ambassadors of Indian Tourism,” Mr. Patel said.

The Union Tourism minister said the Sun Temple at Konark would be included in the list of ‘iconic sites’.

A special event will be organised to announce the inclusion of the Sun Temple in the list of ‘iconic sites’ very soon, he said.

Tourist guides course

The Ministry of Tourism has been organising certificate programmes for candidates intending to work as tourist guides. But the participation of Odisha in this programme is very low and it needs to be enhanced, said Rupinder Brar, additional director general, of tourism.

“Odisha government should encourage students and candidates to take part in the certificate course,” she said.

Chairman of FICCI Eastern Tourism Committee, Soubhagya Mohapatra said more tourist trains should be introduced to connect to more tourists sites.

“The Centre can coordinate with States to introduce more tourist trains to connect various undiscovered areas of India, Mohapatra said.

On the concluding day of National Conference, a Memorandum of Intent (MoI) was signed between Odisha government and Gujarat for cross-promotion of tourist sites in both States as well as across India.

Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts’ lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, diary and paintings from the Tihar jail authorities.

The public prosecutor, appearing for the Delhi Police, told the court that the Tihar jail authorities have supplied all the relevant documents sought by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the case.

He claimed that the convicts are only adopting “delaying tactics“.

“The entire process is to defeat the law. We have already supplied all the documents. We procured all the documents from all the jails where they went,” the counsel said.

He then produced before the court the diary of one of the convicts, Vinay Kumar Sharma, which he had named ‘Darinda’, and several paintings and other documents.

“These are all we have. If the court directs, we can hand these over to the convicts right now,” the counsel said.

'Slow poisoned'

Advocate AP Singh, appearing for the convicts, alleged that Vinay was being slow poisoned and was hospitalised, but his medical reports are not being supplied to him.

He further said though he had received some documents on Friday night from the jail authorities, Vinay’s personal diary and medical documents have not been supplied.

“They (Tihar jail authorities) say there is no such record. Vinay was being slow poisoned. That’s why he was sent to hospital. Vinay made several paintings about that and we want to inform the President about it. Also, what he earned from those paintings needs to be informed,” Mr. Singh said.

He also alleged that another convict Pawan Gupta’s head was “split open” in Mandoli jail and he was shifted to a hospital but those documents were not supplied to the counsel too.

The documents related to the third convict Akshay Kumar Singh’s health were also not supplied and were required to file his curative and mercy petitions, the lawyer said.

Mr. Singh had moved an application alleging that the jail authorities were yet to give the documents which are required to file the mercy petition for Vinay (26) and curative petitions for Akshay (31) and Pawan (25).

The Supreme Court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts -- Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32). Mukesh’s mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month.

The hanging of all four is to take place on February 1 at 6 a.m., according to the court order.

On the sidelines of the two-day conference for Smart Cities CEOs here on Friday and Saturday, Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Durga Shanker Mishra and joint secretary and Smart Cities Mission director Kunal Kumar said they were working on the partnership between cities.

“Many cities are laggard. The best cities will be made sister cities, like we have with foreign cities, with the worst cities in a 20-20 formula,” Mr. Mishra said, adding that the aim was for the top performing cities to inspire and help those lagging behind to improve their work. He said a common platform would be created for cities to share their experiences with each other.

While the exact pairings would be announced in about 15 days, Mr. Kumar said the internal weekly rankings of the cities shared with the CEOs every Monday would be the basis of the 20-20 scheme. Cities would be paired up with those from a similar region, for example the best hilly city would be teamed with the worst one in a hilly area, or those facing similar problems, such as water scarcity, would be paired, he said. The cities were ranked on project implementation, money spent and citizen engagement, he said.

Among the top cities in the latest internal rankings, according to sources, are Nagpur, Tiruppur, Ranchi, Bhopal, Surat, Kanpur, Indore, Visakhapatnam, Vellore, Vadodara, Nashik, Agra, Varanasi, Davanagere, Kota, Pune and Udaipur.

Launched in 2015, the Smart Cities Mission selected 100 cities in four rounds after a competition. With the last round concluding in June 2018, the cities selected then were the ones lagging in comparison to the ones selected in the first round in 2016, a source said. However, it was not yet decided if the round four cities – Silvassa, Erode, Diu, Biharsharif, Bareilly, Itanagar, Moradabad, Saharanpur and Kavaratti – would be considered as the “bottom 20” for the purpose of partnering with the top cities, the source said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/ncuqsd/article30604106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19vzskp2ExecutGC070FK265jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/20-best-worst-performers-in-smart-cities-mission-to-be-paired-up/article30650363.ece

“Kashmir is a real paradise on earth and assured that every step shall be taken to retain and preserve it. The youth need to come up with new and progressive ideas pertaining to developmental concerns,” said Mr. Prasad.

The Union minister’s decision to visit Sopore assumes significance because the area is considered to be a bastion of the now banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) socio-religious organisation.

Terming Sopore “a hub of horticulture production”, Mr. Prasad said that ‘Fruit Mandi Sopore’ shall be developed as an e-mandi, “wherein it shall be integrated with the rest of mandis of the country”.

“Sopore is best endowed with Apple tourism and it can play a larger role in socio-economic development,” he said.

The Union minister, who met 10 delegations, also met a group from the Fruit Association Sopore, which demanded “uninterrupted movement of apple-ferrying vehicles on the National Highway, compensation to orchardists whose property got damaged in recent heavy snowfall and during floods in 2014, exemption of KCC loans, establishment of a testing lab for pesticides and establishment of a truck terminal in North Kashmir”.

Sopore’s influential civil society groups including the Traders Federation Sopore, the J&K Choppan Welfare Association, the NYC Association Baramulla also apprised the Union minister about the local issues.

“J&K will witness a new dawn of development, prosperity and various measures are underway to ensure holistic development of J&K,” Mr. Prasad told the delegations.

Addressing a press meet here on Saturday, Deputy SP (Chittoor) Eeshwar Reddy said that the accused, M. Hemanth Kumar (32), a resident of Puthalapattu mandal, got the trackman job in the railways on compassionate grounds following the death of his father.

Posted at Srikalahasti in 2010, he went absconding from duty since 2014. Acting on a complaint from a youth early this month that Hemanth Kumar had collected an amount of ₹5 lakh and a laptop from him on the pretext of getting him a government job, the Chittoor police swung into action and launched a search for the accused.

The police had also found that the accused was having criminal cases in Tirupati and some other police stations for job frauds.

Acting on a tip-off, a special party reached the Court Complex junction here on Friday late in the evening and nabbed the accused while he was moving suspiciously.

During interrogation, it was found that Hemanth Kumar had cheated as many as 12 people.

Raiding his hideout near Chittoor, the police also recovered the letterheads and rubber stamps which the accused had reportedly used to create fake appointment letters.

He was produced before the local court, and was remanded.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/9ix97v/article30654375.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26VJJOBFRAUD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/man-held-for-job-fraud-in-chittoor/article30654376.ece

100,2020/01/25,Disha Act: strong network to be in place in 3 months,"It may take three months for the special Disha courts proposed to be set up in every district across the State to start functioning, according to Kritika Shukla, one of the two special officers appointed for effective implementation of the new Act.

“If everything goes according to the plan, we will have these first-ever special courts dealing exclusively with heinous crimes like rape and the cases filed under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, in place in three months,” Ms. Shukla has told The Hindu.

“Work is in full swing to put in place a seamless network of the police, the courts and the forensic science laboratory, the three key players whose coordination is imperative.”

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and a Disha app have been developed for effective implementation of the new Act and Chief Minister Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will release them on February 7. Ms. Shukla has said the special courts in the 13 districts are likely to be place by February 15. For smooth and effective functioning, each of these courts will have a district judge and 20 staff members.

As a first step, the mahila police stations, which will now function as Disha courts, will immediately issue charge sheets in the 245 pending cases, all of them identified as heinous crimes of either rape or filed under the POCSO, investigate them and send them to the special courts.

According to the special officer, in addition to the existing mahila police stations, 18 more are proposed to be set up tentatively by January 31.

Challenges ahead

Putting in place a strong forensic science laboratories is a challenge. “We have lost the well-equipped main ‘lab’ to Telangana at the time of bifurcation and may of the experts chose to stay back in Hyderabad. We are having to start afresh here,” she says informing that 118 contract posts have been notified and the government expected to fill these posts in the next 45 days. The idea is to set up genetic DNA testing labs in Vijayawada, Visakhapatnam, and Tirupati but since staff is hard to come by, the government wants to incentivise by offering them higher salaries.

Meanwhile, experts from forensic labs in Delhi and Bengaluru are roped in to train a panel of local doctors in medical examination of the samples obtained in such cases. “The training will take place from January 30 to February 8,” she says.

A dip in such crimes will be seen after speedy convictions become a reality. “These are crimes of passion. They will decrease only after people get the cases moving on a fast track. The first few convictions will serve as a deterrent to others who will think twice before resorting to such heinous acts, she says predicting a spurt in reporting of such cases. “The victims will visit police stations confidently knowing that the guilty will be punished.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/disha-act-strong-network-to-be-in-place-in-3-months/article30653429.ece

103,2020/01/25,Andhra's man-animal conflict: Jumbos in jeopardy,"The Asian elephant made a dramatic reappearance in Kuppam on a wintry evening in the 1980s, after being off the map for many years.

The comeback of the jumbos led to both excitement and fear in hundreds of fringe villages of Kuppam and Palamaner forest ranges. While many looked forward to the establishment of a sanctuary for the pachyderms, some were worried about a threat to their way of life.

Kuppam, said to be a ‘tri-junction’ as it is flanked on either side by Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, soon saw a large influx of elephant herds from Hosur and Bannerghatta areas of the neighbouring States. Senior forest officials said that while one big herd moved into the Seshachalam biosphere, two smaller herds chose to stay put in Kuppam.

Casting away their migratory nature, the jumbos soon made the forests of Kuppam their natural habitat. This led to the setting up of the Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary in the 1990s with only three elephant herds. Kuppam however has continued to see rogue herds from Bannerghatta and Hosur visiting the area and destroying the standing crop season to season.

Apart from regular crop damage in Kuppam, Ramakuppam, Gudupalle, Baireddipalle, V. Kota, Palamaner and Bangarupalem mandals for nearly two decades, the region has also seen an increase in man-animal conflict. According to estimates, around 42 people were killed by the wild elephants between 1990 and 2002, and around 12 elephants were electrocuted in fields in the same period.

With the gradual drying up of the Koundinya and Kaigal tributaries of the Palar river in the sanctuary zone, the wild herds started raiding crops in the abutting fields from 2000 onwards, a practice that continues till today. Many elephants were reportedly killed due to electrocution. Two elephant cubs rescued in the fields were rehabilitated at S.V. Zoo Park, but the efforts went in vain.

The year 2019 was a dark chapter in the history of wildlife conservation in Chittoor district, with five elephants getting electrocuted and one elephant dying of wounds after infighting. The man-animal conflict took a serious turn last year, when two giant male elephants were clandestinely buried in the fields by some tenant farmers after they were electrocuted. The episode came to light after a fortnight. All casualties took place within a radius of 15 km from the sanctuary.

On January 21 this year, a giant elephant was electrocuted in the fields near Chittoor. During the last three years (2016-2019), four human casualties were reported in the tri-State junction.

Last year, wild elephants from the Kuppam region began straying into fields as far away as 50 km in forest ranges of Madanapalle, Punganur, Chittoor and Piler, posing a major headache to farmers who suffered huge crop losses. Officials of the Forest Department spent sleepless nights attempting to drive the jumbos back into the forests. The department reportedly paid close to ₹35 lakh as compensation to farmers last year. The man-animal conflict has led to a fall in tjhe sowing of kharif crop by 40% in villages abutting the sanctuary.

Population growth

Forest Range Officer (Palamaner) K. Madan Mohan Reddy attributed the sudden increase in the number of herds arriving at Koundinya sanctuary and straying into fields of the neighboring ranges to stress factors in Hosur and Bannerghatta zones, including population growth of jumbos.

""When Koundinya was established in 1990, it had hardly half a dozen elephants. Now, we have about 50 wild elephants in our area, in addition to migratory pachyderms. They are straying far away into other ranges, which hitherto remained free from their presence. Though the sanctuary is spread over 40,000 hectares, the crop-raiding herds are active in over 1 lakh hectares, including forest fringes and fields,"" Mr. Reddy said.

Also Read Elephant herd pushed to the brink

The FRO observed that keeping in view this uncontrolled frenzy of marauding herds, the Forest Department struck upon the idea of establishing a ‘Royal Elephant Reserve’, which is expected to include Punganur, Madanapalle and Chittoor ranges. ""The department’s efforts like arranging trenches and solar fencing and rock pillars in Kuppam region bore fruit to a large extent. Now, the entire jumbo population is concentrated in Palamaner and adjoining Chittoor range. The efforts to drive them back are getting harder by the day. If we try to initiate steps to prevent the jumbos from entering fields, they are advancing towards other ranges,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Palamaner MLA N. Venkate Gowda said that a proposal worth ₹9 crore to initiate a network for control of crop-raiding herds is under way.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/osezkt/article30656840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CaptureJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jumbos-in-jeopardy/article30653393.ece
104,2020/01/25,Poachers make merry in Dowleswaram,"Declared the State animal in 2018, the natural habitat of the blackbuck, Dowleswaram, does not have even a single tracker to address existential threats such as poaching.

In March 2017, an independent wildlife activist had for the first time documented the death of three Indian Antelopes (Blackbuck - Antilope cervicapra) in Pitchuka Lanka island near Dowleswaram Barrage in East Godavari district.

The field-level investigation also documented a blackbuck with injuries on her entire body and a baby in her womb, highlighting the conflict of the animal with its rivals - poachers and dogs - on the banks of the Godavari. The Hindu has in its possession copies of photographs of the three blackbucks found dead in Pitchuka Lanka.

On condition of anonymity, the wildlife activist told The Hindu: ""Farmers in the blackbuck habitat from Dowleswaram to Ravulapalem have confirmed poaching by outsiders. Farmers in the islands of Pitchuka Lanka and others were found to be keeping track of the poachers. However, their role is minimal in preventing poaching.""

Until 2018-end, the territorial wing had deployed a single ‘Animal Tracker’, whose task is to track blackbuck poachers and update higher officials to swing into action, if needed.

""The lone animal tracker quit the job a year ago. Now, the habitat does not have any tracker on the ground. Recently, the presence of blackbucks was recorded in new islands near Dowleswaram,"" Forest Range Officer (Kakinada-Territorial Wing) L. Dhanraj told The Hindu.

The entire blackbuck habitat falls in the ‘Unprotected’ area under the jurisdiction of the territorial forest wing that needs to join hands with the wildlife wing to chalk out a conservation plan.

Community Reserve

According to highly-placed sources, there is a proposal to declare a portion of the blackbuck habitat, particularly Pitchuka Lanka, into the ‘Community Reserve’.

The presence of nearly 150 blackbucks was estimated by the Forest Department in 2017. However, no census had been carried out to ascertain the number of blackbucks in this habitat.

Andhra Pradesh Co-ordinator, Indian Bird Conservation Network, K. Mrutyunjaya Rao, told The Hindu: ""The row of islands near the Dowleswaram Barrage has been a safe natural habitat of blackbucks over the past three decades. The habitat needs to have a dedicated conservation plan"".

In summer, blackbucks tend to venture out from their habitat for water, which leaves them vulnerable to attacks from poachers and dogs. The blackbuck falls in the Schedule - 1 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

The blackbuck was declared the State animal by the State Environment and Forest Department in early 2018.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/s2yxdm/article30656842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BLACKBUCKDjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/poachers-make-merry-in-dowleswaram/article30653380.ece
105,2020/01/25,Elephant herd pushed to the brink,"A herd of elephants along the Andhra Pradesh- Odisha Border (AOB) region is frantically searching for food and water, as drastic deforestation is stripping the region of its natural resources.

Occupation of forest lands and water bodies is forcing the elephants to enter human habitations in Vizianagaram district. This is leading to grave consequences, with one elephant getting electrocuted and another elephant meeting a watery grave in the Nagavali when it tried to cross the river in search of food.

The other elephants are reportedly starving due to non-availability of food and water in the AOB region.

Heavy diet

The elephants need a large amount of food every day. While they eat all kinds of fruit, grass, tree bark and roots, their preferred diet is sugarcane. An elephant eats 150-170 kg of vegetation and drinks around 26 gallons of water every day.

According to animal lovers, the government spends crores of rupees to pay compensation for crop damage but has never taken any steps to remove illegal occupations and ensure food and water for the elephants.

Green Mercy founder N.V. Ramana Murthy said that animals have the right to live in the forest but they are forced into conflict with humans due to rampant deforestation.

Three persons were killed by elephants last year. N. Pakeeru of Kemiseela village, K. Kasim Dora of Kuduma village and G. Chinnammi of Jiyyammavalasa were killed by the jumbos in separate incidents in 2019 in Vizianagaram district limits. The government sanctioned ₹5 lakh for the families of the deceased and ₹75,000 each for seven persons injured in elephant attacks. It has paid around ₹1.49 crore as compensation to 2,248 farmers for the damage of 2,378.12 acres in Jiyyammavalasa, Kurupam, Gummalakshmipuram and other areas.

A decade ago, the government had planned to build trenches but could not complete the project due to lack of funds. The trenches would have restricted the elephants to a specified area. The plan was aimed at improving required greenery and ensuring water for them. With the delay in construction of the trenches, illegal occupations have increased further in Veeraghattam, Palakonda and other places.

Coordination meet

To arrive at a solution for the man-animal conflict, the Forest Departments of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha conducted a coordination meeting on December 12, 2019 in Vizianagaram.

AP Chief Conservator of Forests (Visakhpatnam Range) Rahul Pandey, Regional Chief Conservator of Forests (Berhampur Circle) Suresh Pant and other officials decided to use drone cameras for the effective tracking of wild elephants. The officials decided to track the movement on a daily basis and share information immediately for better coordination between officials of A.P. and Odisha.

108,2020/01/25,Low rates leave social forestry planters in despair,"Peasants in Prakasam district are in for a serious trouble as the prices of subabul, eucalyptus and casuarina logs continue to rule low despite increase in demand for paper.

Taking stock of the situation, farmer leaders at a meeting chaired by Prakasam District Development Forum president Ch. Ranga Rao here on Saturday decided to agitate demanding that the State government intervene to rein in the paper mills which drove down the prices for the logs, throwing to winds the agreements reached from time to time.

At the behest of the State Government, a tripartite agreement was reached in 2014 for the purchase of eucalyptus and casuarina at ₹4,400 per tonne and subabul at ₹4,200 per tonne. The prices were revised upwards in 2017 to ₹4,800 per tonne for eucalyptus and casuarina and ₹4,600 per tonne before they were brought back to old rates in 2019.

These rates had little relevance for the farmers as the prices realised for the logs were between ₹2,000 and ₹2,500 per tonne during the previous Telugu Desam Party regime as the paper mills bypassed the Agricultural Market Committees(AMCs) and procured logs directly from farms through their network of agents. The situation had not improved for the better even after YSR Congress Party assumed office, Mr. Ranga Rao said while briefing the media about the deliberations after the meeting.

It was unfortunate that the Agricultural Mission, which paid attention to market intervention for conventional crops, had left in the lurch farmers in the social forestry sector, complained Lok Satta Party leader Ch. Ratnakumari.

The farmers got only ₹2,300 per tonne for eucalyptus and casuarina and ₹2700 per tonne for subabul, incurring a loss of more than ₹1,000 per tonne.

‘No option’

“We will have no option but to uproot the trees if they are not offered at least ₹4,000 per tonne,” said a social forestry planter J. Venkateswara Rao from Jagarlamudivaripalem village. Farmers incur a production cost of ₹3,300 per tonne and take an average yield of 20 tonnes per acre.

Farmers in the drought-prone district who have been growing tobacco in a big way switched to social forestry plantations, thanks to encouragement from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.

Eucalyptus alone is grown in 1.10 lakh acres, subabul in 67,000 acres and casuarina in 9,000 acres in the district.

The district accounts for 43% of the cropped area under the social forestry plantations in the State.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8eoiax/article30653114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26ONGSUBABUL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/low-rates-leave-social-forestryplanters-in-despair/article30653115.ece

The district administration reportedly appointed them in October, 2019 and the delay had cascading affect on the completion of syllabus. Although many private colleges have started revision of the syllabus, it is yet to be completed in many KGBVs where Intermediate course was started from 2019-20 academic year. The aim of the government is to ensure higher education for girls on the same premises as many girls are stopping their study after completion of Class X.

According to a release from the Indian Railways on Friday, Commissioner, Railway Safety inspected the electrified portion and certified it as fit to run passenger train services with immediate effect. About 20 curves have been straightened to enhance the strength of the track. This will enable all types of passenger services with electric traction on this line, which acts as a bypass line for south-bound trains and vice-versa.

Trains from Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad travel towards Bengaluru along this section, which was earlier a single line with trains running on diesel traction. Work on electrifing the route was sanctioned in 2015-16 at a cost of ₹357 crore. The project was completed in different phases beginning with doubling of the section between Khadarpet-Gullapalyamu, electrification of the entire single line, doubling between Guntakal-Gullapalyamu, doubling between Khadarpet-Kalluru and finally electrification of the second line.

With this, one more significant step has been taken towards fulfilling the dreams of Rayalaseema people to have better rail connectivity and more number of trains, the release said.

Iron ore and other bulk commodities such as cement and steel are transported along this route.

The TDP leaders performed a ‘palabhishekam’ to the portrait of Legislative Council Chairman M.A. Sharif, on Friday, for sending the ‘AP decentralisation and inclusive development off all regions’ Bill to the select committee. TDP district president Somisetty Venkateswarlu alleged that the YSRCP leaders were trying to intimidate the Opposition parties.

Calling the YSRCP Ministers as “thugs”, Mr. Venkateswarlu said that the statements made by Civil Supplies Minister Kodali Sri Venkateswara Rao (Nani) were deplorable. “Mr. Rao must remember that he had matured in politics due to TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu,” he added.

Capital shift

Later, talking about the three capitals issue, he said that the government was trying to appease Rayalaseema people with just a High Court. “While we welcome the High Court, if the capital is being shifted it must be to Kurnool. Otherwise, the government would have to witness protests demanding Greater Rayalaseema,” he said.

Former Health Minister N. Md. Farooq said, “I have been in politics for a while now, and have worked in various ministries. However, the events that unfolded in the past few days are a first.”

He criticised the behaviour of YSRCP Ministers and claimed that Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister Botcha Satyanarayana would have attacked the Council Chairman if it were not for the marshals present on the premises.

117,2020/01/25,Andhra CM Jagan Mohan Reddy to visit villages from February 1,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will visit villages from February 1 onwards. The Chief Minister will select the village randomly and inspect the selection of beneficiaries and implementation of welfare schemes. Mr. Jagan has plans to take feedback from the public during the interaction with them. Officials will be held responsible if there are any mistakes.

The Chief Minister announced the decision during a review meeting on house sites on Friday.

It may be recalled that Mr. Jagan, at a review meeting in November, announced that he would conduct ‘Rachabanda’, a mass contact programme, from either January or February. Under the programme, he would meet people, receive their grievances, and resolve them at the earliest.

House sites

Referring to house site pattas, the Chief Minister said the list of beneficiaries should be displayed in the village secretariat. The criterion for selection of the beneficiaries and exemptions, if any, should be displayed. Fresh applications should also be accepted, he said.

The Praja Sadhikara Survey (PSS) should not be the benchmark for the identification of the beneficiaries. Instead, ground realities should be taken into consideration. The sites identified for the purpose should be congenial for living and ensure that the beneficiaries are happy about the plots allotted to them, he said.

House site allotment should be made only after the beneficiary was satisfied. An alternative site should be allotted to those who were living on encroached lands. It is the biggest programme after Amma Vodi. The programme was being taken up in a massive way and would be never before in the country, he said, adding, “Action will be taken against erring officials.”

The government has planned the distribution of 25 lakh house pattas to the poor on Ugadi day.

118,2020/01/25,Don’t treat helmet as a burden: SP,"An event was organised by the traffic police and the Transport Department at SVU Srinivasa Auditorium here on Friday, marking the 31st Road Safety Week. Deputy Transport Commissioner M. Basi Reddy flagged off the rally, where local legislator Bhumana Karunakar Reddy and Superintendent of Police (Tirupati Urban) Gajarao Bhupal rode two-wheelers wearing helmets, aiming to send a positive message among the public.

Though the Tirupati Urban police have already begun checking motorcyclists and slapping fine on violators, the public mood is grossly against enforcing it on the narrow and dingy lanes of the city. With the visiting pilgrim crowd occupying every inch of the already-crammed civic space, motorcyclists can hardly crawl in the old city areas comprising railway station, RTC bus station, Govindaraja Swamy temple, Chinna Bazaar, Bhavani Nagar and Korlagunta areas, where over-speeding is ruled out. The recent special drives conducted by the traffic cops in the heart of the city, where bulk of the two-wheeler riders were booked and fined drew criticism from road users. On the other hand, the Transport Department, which checks vehicles on highways where the use of helmet is most necessary, is able to send chill down the spine of erring motorcyclists.

Mr. Karunakar Reddy advised the youth to think of their beloved parents waiting at home before raising the accelerator, subtly reminding them that speed would hardly matter after a certain stage. Dr. Bhupal said the department’s insistence was only in the interest of the road users. “You should treat helmet not as a burden, but as an instrument of protection,” he said, maintaining that every road user should have concentration, physical fitness and proper safety gear while driving. Students, drivers of buses, cabs and autorickshaws took part in large numbers at the meet.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/4la1b1/article30647548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-VJ-HELMETRALLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dont-treat-helmet-as-a-burden-sp/article30647549.ece

Speaking at a programme on ‘Celebrate every moment’ organised by Brahma Kumaris, Vijayawada centre, here on Friday, she said it was important for parents to develop a bonding with their children, without which the latter might not reveal anything going in their minds.

“Parents are telling children from a very young age that tension is normal while studying for exams. However, they should advise children not to get tense during important exams like SSC,” the spiritual speaker said. Ms. Shivani said that parents should accept the child, even while rejecting their bad behaviour. Children would be able to withstand peer pressure if they get emotional support from their parents, she said.

Ms. Shivani said with the advent of social media, gossip had become global, People were taking good things for granted and only highlighting the faults in others. “We should keep away from mobile phones and TV early in the morning and just before going to bed,” she said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/develop-bonding-with-children-parents-told/article30647535.ece
120,2020/01/25,Scrapping Council not possible in present political climate: Naidu,"The scrapping of the Legislative Council as proposed by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy is not possible in the present political climate, said Leader of the Opposition and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

Addressing the media at the party office in Mangalagiri here on Friday, Mr. Naidu recalled that when the Legislative Council of Andhra Pradesh was scrapped in the past, the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi rejected a resolution sent by the Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao for the first time. The Andhra Pradesh Council was scrapped only when Rajiv Gandhi was Prime Minister, when a resolution was sent by NTR for the second time. Mr. Naidu said that without the Centre’s, support the Council could not be scrapped.

He said that the term of Mr. Jagan would in all probability come to an end before the process to scrap the Legislative Council was completed.

Mr. Naidu said the people of the State need not in anyway worry because the Telugu Desam Party would revive the Council as soon as it was elected to power.

Expenses

While claiming that Andhra Pradesh was poor and could not afford the Legislative Council, the State Government had hired the most expensive advocate for a fee of ₹5 crore and paid ₹1 crore as advance to fight writ petitions filed by Amaravati farmers in court. Other top lawyers have been intimidated not to represent poor farmers, Mr. Naidu alleged and asked where the State was heading.

Referring to Mr Jagan’s claim that the word “capital” did not exist in the Indian Constitution, Mr. Naidu asked why the Chief Minister had introduced a Bill for the establishment of three Capitals in the State.

Mr. Naidu said that the Chief Minister had cited his running the government at Visakhapatnam in the aftermath of Hudhud cyclone. But there was no comparison between the two. While officials concerned came to Visakhapatnam to assist him, Mr. Jagan was trying to shift the entire Secretariat. “I worked in a bus in which I slept for 10 days,” Mr. Naidu said.

The case was the same when Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ran the government from Ooty. There was no attempt to shift the Secretariat, Mr. Naidu pointed out.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sxnpsq/article30647527.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TPNAIDUU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/scrapping-council-not-possible-in-present-political-climate-naidu/article30647528.ece
121,2020/01/25,Naidu meets Governor on Council issue,"A Telugu Desam Party (TDP) delegation led by its national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu met Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to apprise him of the developments in the Legislative Council. The delegation submitted a memorandum urging him to take suitable action and call for a report on the functioning of the Council.

Mr. Naidu, in the memorandum, said, “The government in a hurry would undermine the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council by bringing in Ordinance only to further its selfish agenda. Your Excellency’s intervention would not only establish faith in democratic process, but also would go a long way in protecting the sanctity of the Legislative Assembly and Council.”

The former Chief Minister said that the ruling party by discussing Council proceedings and Council Chairperson’s conduct of business in the Assembly was trying to pitch one house against the other. The government discussed Council proceedings in the Assembly only to build up antipathy against the Council and finally abolish it permanently. Simultaneously, the government was involved in horse-trading subjecting Council members from Opposition sides to allurements and pressures. On the one hand the government was threatening Council members that the Council would be abolished and on the other the Council members were threatened with false cases and police action. Thus, it appeared that horse-trading was the basis for proposing to abolish the Council by the government, he said.

Minister Botcha Satyanarayana had abused the Chairperson in the name of his religion and community and other Ministers and ruling party members had even entered the chambers of the Chairperson and abused him using filthy and unparliamentary language, Mr. Naidu said. Concomitantly, the government made nefarious attempts to undermine the Upper house, Mr Naidu said in the representation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-meets-governor-on-council-issue/article30647519.ece
122,2020/01/25,Governor urges students to think innovatively,"Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan on Friday said education was like the apprenticeship of life, not merely imparting a training but preparing an individual into a fully blossomed human being.

Delivering the keynote address at the convocation of Adikavi Nannaya University in Rajamahendravaram, he urged the graduates to make the best of the knowledge gained in the university to gain success in their career as well as life. “You have reached this stage due to hard work and perseverance. You are now ready to leave the portals of this university and step into the outside world with confidence,” he said, adding that each of them should strive to contribute towards the well being of the society.

Pointing to the fact that India was one of the ancient civilisations of the world and “our ancestors realised long ago the importance of knowledge,” he said the students should make the right use of this knowledge and quoted Rabindranath Tagore to drive home his point that education should mean more than just giving information.

He said regardless of the field of work the students chose in future, they should all work for the benefit of humanity.

Referring to the Central government schemes like Make in India, Skill India, Startup India and Fit India, he said the country was in need of graduates who could think innovatively for the good of the society and environment. “The government of Andhra Pradesh too is aiming at accessible, equitable and quality education for all,” he pointed out.

‘Help needy’

He said recently people observed the Constitution Day. “Our Constitution provides us equality, right to freedom of speech and expression besides other privileges. Whenever there is any violation of these rights, we rush to the court. We seldom take note of the lesser privileged population who do not enjoy these privileges,” he said, urging the students to help such people in need.

They reportedly found unaccounted cash, pattadar passbooks and poor maintenance of registers.

The ACB teams carried out simultaneous raids and interacted with the visitors and the petitioners. They found that some thousands of petitions received through Mee-Seva centres and online were piled up in the offices.

ACB Director-General P.S.R.

Pending petitions

The investigation officials noticed that many petitions submitted for mutation and title deed, pattadar passbooks, adangal correction, e-passbooks and house sites were found pending on the tables.

During verification, the ACB teams reportedly confiscated huge amount of unaccounted cash from the staff. Cash had been seized from almost all the MRO offices, in which the surprise raids were conducted, said an ACB official, who participated in the raids.

Poor maintenance

In many tehsildar offices, the government land registers, mutation, adangal, field measurement books, Mee-Seva applications registers and other ledgers were not updated and maintained properly.

The DG said that amount had been seized from the Village Revenue Officers (VROs), Additional Revenue Inspectors and other office staff.

“We seized the copies of the documents and the ledgers from all the tehsildar offices. The ACB officials were surprised that many old pattadar passbooks and passbooks to be distributed to the petitions were kept in the offices,” Mr. Anjaneyulu said.

However, special court judge B.R. Madhusudhan Rao dismissed the petition. CBI counsel contended that appearance of the co-accused could not be allowed as charges were related to grave financial crimes.

The arduous road trip would be a test of the bikers’ resilience. However, both women are no strangers to adversity.

While Vaishali narrowly survived a serious motorcycle accident three years ago, Supriya is a cancer survivor. Vaishali is returning to the road for her first long-distance trip after the accident, while for Supriya it is her first brush with long-distance biking after battling stage-II cancer.

The women will head south on their motorcycles, cruising along the Coromandel coast all the way till Kanyakumari, from where they will ride along the Malabar and Konkan coast to reach Goa in 15 days.

The theme of the duo’s expedition is ‘Rise, Ride and Recover’, which intends to send a message that age is not a factor. Challenges might crop up, such as a bad accident or a life-threatening disease, but they should not be allowed to dampen one’s spirits, the duo said.

The road trip is being undertaken under the aegis of the Women’s International Motorcycle Association (WIMA- Vizag). On reaching Goa, Vaishali and Supriya will participate in the first national rally of WIMA, to be held from February 14 to 16.

“Supriya and I never realised that we would go biking again, but here we are today,” said Vaishali, who is excited to be hitting the road again after a long gap.

Riding for a cause

All along the route, the bikers will make frequent stops to spread awareness on education for girls, genital hygiene and cervical cancer.

“We will also talk about women empowerment, as the theme for this year’s Women’s Day is ‘Each for Equal’,” Vaishali said.

130,2020/01/25,Air India agrees to reduce cargo rates from Vizag airport,"Air India has agreed to reduce cargo rates on its flights from Visakhapatnam, a move that will be welcomed by cargo exporters at the city airport.

There was a long-pending demand from exporters to reduce cargo rates at the Visakhapatnam airport to bring them on par with rates prevailing at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad.

The A.P. Air Travellers Association (APATA) took up the issue of differential cargo rates fixed by Air India with Daggubati Purandeswari, Independent Director of Air India, and apprised her that the differential tariffs would hit cargo exports from Visakhapatnam.

Ms. Purandeswari met the Chairman and Managing Director of Air India on January 23 and impressed upon him the need to reduce cargo rates. The CMD agreed to it and said that he would issue instructions in this regard at the earliest.

Ms. Purandeswari intimated the same to cargo officials in Visakhapatnam and to APATA.

APATA representatives O. Naresh Kumar and D.S. Varma thanked Ms. Purandeswari and Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana for taking up with various airlines the issue of introduction of cargo flights from the city.

SpiceJet is learnt to have expressed its readiness to start an exclusive cargo flight on the Chennai–Vizag– Kolkata sector, which could carry 20 tons of cargo on a daily basis, from mid-February.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/air-india-agrees-to-reduce-cargo-rates-from-vizag-airport/article30647261.ece
131,2020/01/25,Naidu meets Governor on Council issue,"A Telugu Desam Party (TDP) delegation led by its national president and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu met Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to apprise him of the developments in the Legislative Council. The delegation submitted a memorandum urging him to take suitable action and call for a report on the functioning of the Council.

Mr. Naidu, in the memorandum, said, “The government in a hurry would undermine the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council by bringing in Ordinance only to further its selfish agenda. Your Excellency’s intervention would not only establish faith in democratic process, but also would go a long way in protecting the sanctity of the Legislative Assembly and Council.”

The former Chief Minister said that the ruling party by discussing Council proceedings and Council Chairperson’s conduct of business in the Assembly was trying to pitch one house against the other. The government discussed Council proceedings in the Assembly only to build up antipathy against the Council and finally abolish it permanently. Simultaneously, the government was involved in horse-trading subjecting Council members from Opposition sides to allurements and pressures. On the one hand the government was threatening Council members that the Council would be abolished and on the other the Council members were threatened with false cases and police action. Thus, it appeared that horse-trading was the basis for proposing to abolish the Council by the government, he said.

Minister Botcha Satyanarayana had abused the Chairperson in the name of his religion and community and other Ministers and ruling party members had even entered the chambers of the Chairperson and abused him using filthy and unparliamentary language, Mr. Naidu said. Concomitantly, the government made nefarious attempts to undermine the Upper house, Mr Naidu said in the representation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/khw8fo/article30647259.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25VJPG4-NAIDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-meets-governor-on-council-issue/article30647260.ece
132,2020/01/25,Ways to increase traffic at Vizag airport discussed,"A need for more slots for civilian aircraft during peak hours at the Visakhapatnam International Airport and improvement of international air connectivity from Vijayawada Airport were the two major issues that came up at a review meeting on ‘Airports in A.P.’ chaired by Special Chief Secretary Karikal Velaven in Vijayawada on Thursday.

Airport directors Giri Madhusudana Rao (Vijayawada), M. Raja Kishore (Vizag), Siva Prasad (Kadapa), S. Suresh (Tirupati) and Manoj Kumar Nayak (Rajamahendravaram) attended the meeting.

V.N. Bharat Reddy, Adviser (Aviation) to the State Government, and officiating CEO of APADCP Neena Sharma were present.

Only 10 flights can land and take off in an hour from the Visakhapatnam airport, which limits the maximum number of slots in a day to 240. Of these, 160 slots are allotted to passenger flights while the remaining 80 slots are reserved for military aircraft. Of the 160 slots that have been allotted for passenger flights, only 80 slots are convenient for operation of passenger flights while the other slots fall under ‘odd timings’, according to officials of the Visakhapatnam International Airport.

It was felt that two more flights could be accommodated in the summer schedule at Vizag airport. Officials also opined that negotiations were needed with the Navy to get more slots during peak hours for operating passenger flights.

Early commissioning of the newly-constructed N5 taxiway at the Vizag airport would reduce runway occupancy time, officials said.

Mr. Madhusudhana Rao, director of the Vijayawada Airport, elaborated on the potential for international air connectivity to Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Malaysia from Vijayawada. The meeting also plans to host an all-airline meet in Vijayawada in the future to discuss growth opportunities.

Improvement of air connectivity between all airports in the State was also discussed at the meeting.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ways-to-increase-traffic-at-vizag-airport-discussed/article30647249.ece
133,2020/01/25,Axe may fall on two Ministers if Legislative Council is abolished,"The State government is seriously considering abolishing the Legislative Council, miffed at the way the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions and the APCRDA Repeal Bills were referred to the select committee in the Upper House of the legislature.

If that were to materialise, axe may immediately fall on two Ministers in the Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy Cabinet – Deputy Chief Minister (Revenue) Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose and Marketing Minister Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, both of whom are MLCs.

While Mr. Bose’s tenure would come to an end in 2021, Mr. Venkata Ramana, who had been elected under the MLA quota for the period 2019-23, was inducted into the Cabinet on June 8 despite losing the election from the Repalle constituency.

On the other hand, there are several MLCs who are aspiring for a berth in the Cabinet, which is likely to be shuffled during 2021-22 if Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s statements at the time of his swearing-in as Chief Minister were to be considered.

‘Rude shock’

In this backdrop, the Chief Minister’s statement in the Assembly came as a “rude shock” for them.

“We have no option but to say yes to the Chief Minister,” said a senior leader on condition of anonymity.

The TDP’s role in the Council disturbed the government at a time when it was planning for all-round development of the State. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision to abolish the Council. It was not a planned one, he explained.

The MLCs, are however, sceptical about the plan materialising immediately going by the changing political equations in the State.

“The Centre may or may not consider the relevant Bill in Parliament as soon as it receives it. We have to wait and see,” said another senior leader.

“As of now, there is no scope for bargaining, or requesting for other posts,” he said.

Word of caution

A few YSRCP leaders feel that the “decision taken in haste” will not help the party in the long run. They have a reason.

The tenure of two nominated MLCs – K. Satyanarayana Raju of the TDP and T. Rathna Bai of the Congress – will conclude this year. So, the YSRCP will have two more seats in its kitty.

The next elections to the Council will be held in 2021, when the tenure of five MLCs from the TDP, two from the YSRCP, and one from the BJP will come to an end.

Besides retaining the two, the YSRCP can win the other eight seats and increase its strength in the Council to 20.

On the other hand, the TDP’s strength will come down to 20 by then, the YSRCP leaders say.

At present, the YSRCP has 9 MLCs and the TDP 28, including Dokka Manikya Varaprasad (who resigned) and Pothula Suneeta, who joined the YSRCP. The BJP has two MLCs and the PDF five. Three seats are vacant.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/axe-may-fall-on-two-ministers-if-legislative-council-is-abolished/article30647214.ece

136,2020/01/25,National Voters’ Day 2020 held,"The National Voters’ Day 2020 was held in the city on Saturday to create awareness on the need to maximise the enrolment of new voters.

The main programme was held at the Town Hall and Principal District and Sessions Judge K. Vontigodi urged the youth to compulsorily enrol to secure their voter ID card and exercise their franchise during the elections.

He said the future of the country was in the hands of the voters and it was imperative for the youth to realise the importance of voting and exercise their rights as they had a role to play in national reconstruction.

Mr. Vontigodi said voting was a right and the youth of the country should realise the importance of elections and take part in it by exercising their franchise and elect suitable candidates as their representatives.

The NVD is being celebrated ever year since 2011 and it also marks the foundation day of the Election Commission of India.

Dedicated to the voters of the country, the NVD entails spreading public awareness and promoting informed participation in the electoral process.

Mr. Vontigodi pointed out that voting percentage in urban areas tends to be lower than in rural areas. This is because the educated voters in urban areas tend to go out on a vacation as the day of election is a holiday. They stay away from the electioneering process while people in rural areas exercise their right to vote.

The judge said the voting percentage in rural areas should be increased to reach cent per cent.

MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde said creating greater awareness among the students and first-time voters was essential and they should be encouraged to take part in the election process without being influenced by caste and money.

Voters’ ID cards were distributed to a few students who had attained 18 years of age on the occasion.

139,2020/01/25,State govt. subsidy to set up millet packaging units: Savadi,"The State government will provide a subsidy of ₹10 lakh to farmers who set up packaging units for millets, Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Agriculture Laxman Savadi said here on Saturday.

He was speaking after inaugurating a millet mela at the S.G. Balekundri Engineering College.

“This is part of our efforts to promote the cultivation and the consumption of millets. We will also give incentives to cultivators and those who store millets,” the Minister said.

“The pizza-burger culture has not only destroyed our eating habits, but also our health,” Mr. Savadi said.

“The increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides is leading to over 24 crore Indians suffering from high blood pressure, over 17% people suffering cardiac problems, and around 1 crore people suffering from cancer every year,” he said.

“Farmers should work to preserve the health of society. However rich you are, you cannot be healthy if you do not eat healthy food. Feeding poison to crops in the form of pesticides is a sin. Farmers should behave responsibly and seek god’s blessings by reducing the use of fertilizers,” he said.

Deputy Director of Agriculture H.D. Kolekar said the mela was organised to help farmers find markets.

The mela will end on Sunday evening. Farmers are showcasing and selling millets, fruits, flowers, and animals at the mela.

140,2020/01/25,Farmers to get new varieties of bengal gram suitable for machine harvesting,"Bengal gram, which is cultivated in about 70% of the land in North Karnataka for the rabi season, gives good returns with limited expenditure.

But owing to the unavailability of labourers, the farmers here are facing a problem in harvesting this crop. It is also not suitable for machine harvesting.

But now in a year, the farmers will cultivate new varieties of the crop which will be suitable for machine harvesting and will also give a solution to increasing labour problem.

Researchers of agriculture universities of the State have not only developed special varieties of the bengal gram but have also successfully conducted its trials.

The varieties are called DBGV-204, GBM-2 and NBeG-47.

S.B. Patil, Agronomist of Regional Agriculture Research Station here, told The Hindu on how the new varieties are fit for machine harvesting.

“The traditional varieties, such as JG-11, are unfit for machine harvesting because the pods develop in the plant from less than 30 cm from the ground. This is a major drawback because the present harvesting machines needs pods to be at least 30 cm above the ground. If the pods develop below this height, then the machine will also pick up sand and stones while harvesting. If the height of the machine is raised, then only half of the pods get harvested, which is a loss to the farmer,” he said.

To overcome this problem, the researchers, instead of designing new machines, decided to develop the new varieties that develop pods from over 30 cm.

“Experts have not only developed the varieties but have also successfully conducted field trials. We have found multiple benefits of the new varieties,” Mr. Patil said.

He claimed that these new varieties also help in saving more space which enables the farmers to cultivate more crops.

“Unlike the traditional crop, where the plant develops more horizontally, the new ones develops more vertically, leaving additional space between two plants. While an acre requires some 20 kgs of the traditional seeds, for the varieties, the farmer could sow about 25 kg of seeds in an acre. This means more yield. At the same time, the farmer will save time and money as it is suitable for machine harvesting,” he said.

Mr. Patil said that from next Rabi reason, the farmers will be given these seeds on a pilot basis to sow and check its benefits.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1kccel/article30653210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26BGGRAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/farmers-to-get-new-varieties-of-bengal-gram-suitable-for-machine-harvesting/article30652636.ece
141,2020/01/25,"Candlelight protest held against CAA, NRC, NPR","Demanding the repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and withdrawal of the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), hundreds of people staged a candlelight protest here on Friday evening.

Mobilised under the banner of the Welfare Party of India (WPI), the protesters formed a human chain at Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Circle at 7.30 p.m. and staged a demonstration for an hour with candles.

Speaking at the protest, Mujahid Pasha Qureshi, State secretary of WPI, said that the CAA violated the Constitution and intended to disturb the communal harmony in the country.

“Article 14 of the Constitution says that all are equal before the law and the State shall not discriminate against anybody on the basis of religion, caste or socioeconomic status. The CAA, however, completely violates the Constitution by offering citizenship on the basis of religion. The very purpose of CAA, NPR and NRC appears to divide the people along the lines of their religion and damage the communal harmony that the Indian society had been maintaining for centuries,” he said.

Mr. Qureshi made it clear that his organisation had been opposed not to offering citizenship to the immigrants, but to offering it on the basis of religion.

“As the Union Home Minister [Amit Shah] said, CAA would first come into force and then NRC would follow. Those who cannot prove their citizenship in the NRC process would be treated as immigrants. The non-Muslim immigrants would get citizenship if they prove that they are the immigrants of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, though they don’t become natural citizens. But, the Muslims who cannot prove their citizenship in NRC would be treated as illegal immigrants and won’t get citizenship,” he said.

Ravi Gaikwad, the regional president of Dalit Panthers, said that the NRC and NPR were against not just the Muslims, but all downtrodden and marginalised sections.

“There are millions of masses living on a hand-to-mouth existence at the bottom stratum of the society who cannot simply produce the required documents to prove their citizenship in the NRC. If the NRC is implemented the majority of the indigenous people would become Stateless overnight. They will be foreigners on their own land,” he said.

He was speaking after inaugurating a Millets Walk organised in the city by the zilla panchayat and the district administration.

He walked along with students, farmers, members of NGOs and officers, from the Rani Channamma Circle to the S.G. Balekundri Engineering College, the venue of the mela. The two-day Millet Mela will start on Saturday. Students held placards and posters speaking about the health benefits of millets and the ease of cultivating them.

He said that the State government was organising millet melas in several places to create awareness about the health benefits of consuming millets. Once there is an increase in consumption, there will be a larger market for such foodgrains. That will automatically ensure that farmers get remunerative prices, he said. He expressed concern that the increased use of fertilizers and pesticides was affecting soil health. This leads to reduced output and increases the cost of cultivation also. Ultimately, it may make the soil unproductive. That is why we have to watch out against the misuse of chemical fertilizers, he said. Belagavi Zilla Panchayat Chief Executive Officer K.V. Rajendra, Joint Director of Agriculture Jilani Mokashi, Deputy Director H.D. Kolekar and Assistant Director Ravindra Hakati and others were present.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/9tltzp/article30649956.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGBELAGAVIMILLETS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-to-promote-cultivation-of-millets/article30649958.ece

152,2020/01/25,Police security for seer,"Belagavi Police will provide security for Sri Nijagunananda Swami and his Kittur Nishkal Mantapa Mutt following a letter containing a threat to his life that was received on Friday.

The letter, containing the names of 15 liberal thinkers and activists, was circulated widely on social media and shown on some Kannada TV channels. The letter is addressed to the seer, and it condemns his lectures where he speaks in favour of liberal values.

“The decision to eliminate you will be taken on January 21. You will be eliminated, along with 15 of your followers and people who think like you,” the letter said. Among those threatened are Nidumamidi Channammalla Swami, Jnyana Prakash Swami, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, actors Prakash Raj and Chetan Kumar, writer Chandrashekar Patil, Brinda Karat of the CPI(M) and writer K.S. Bhagavan.

It is not the first time that the seer is getting such threats. Two years ago, Belagavi Police had provided security to the seer following threats to his life. Last year, he got a phone call from a person from Shivamogga district. But the seer did not bother to complain.

This time, the district police will seek a written complaint from the seer. “We will assess the threat perception and the security levels. Adequate security will be provided,” the police said.

The seer is now camping in Jewargi in Kalaburagi district. “We have intimated the Kalaburagi Superintendent of Police of the need for immediate security arrangements. We will take steps to provide adequate security to him once he arrives in Belagavi district,” Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi told The Hindu.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/police-security-for-seer/article30647773.ece
153,2020/01/25,Bickering among sub-sects of Lingayat comes to the fore,"The recent “threat” by Sri Vachanananda Swami of Veerashaiva Lingayat Panchamasali Peetha at Harihar to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on the need for inclusion of more Panchamasali MLAs in the State Cabinet has brought to light the bickering among the sub-sects of Veerashaiva Lingayat community.

Although there are still several people who don’t consider Mr. Yediyurappa as a Lingayat leader as he did not support the Lingayat movement, they are sympathetic towards him, only for the reason that he is part of the same community.

That was evident from the fact that Sri Basava Jaya Mrutyunjaya Swami of Panchamasali Peetha at Koodalasangama (the other Panchamasali Peetha owing allegiance to Basava philosophy) was quick to voice his support for the Chief Minister.

Sri Vachanananda Swami had said that the Panchamasali community would have to rethink about its support to the BJP if former Minister and industrialist Murugesh Nirani and other leaders from the community were not made Ministers.

While the swami’s conduct at Hara Jatre, where he issued the “threat”, was condemned by a few other seers and community leaders, it has also has brought to the fore the divisions within the Veerashaiva Lingayat community that exist based on sub-sects.

No doubt, these sub-sects were one of the criteria for ticket selection during elections. But with over 40 Lingayats from the BJP entering the Legislative Assembly and several being strong contenders for Ministerial berths, Mr. Yediyurappa is finding it tough to do the balancing act.

In fact, Mr. Yediyurappa expressed his inability to “please all” from among the community soon after the comment of the seer and even issued a counter threat as it were that he would resign and go home.

At present, eight Lingayats, including Mr. Yediyurappa, are among the total 18 Ministers who have been sworn in.

While there are almost nil sub-sects among the Veerashaiva Lingayat community in the Old Mysuru region, the sub-sects are dominant among the Lingayats residing in the North Karnataka. Interestingly it was in these districts that the 12th Century social reformer Basaveshwara, also considered as founder of Lingayatism by a section of the community, spread his message of treating everyone equally.

While after the era of Basaveshwara and the subsequent lull in the Vachana movement which lasted over two centuries, several changes took place and professions became castes, the differences among the sub-sects only widened with the passage of time.

Although marriages among the sub-sects in Veerashaiva Lingayats are taking place now, the differences still exist, which explains the reason for the particular seer’s conduct. While the seer has apologised after a backlash, the undercurrent is likely to trouble the Chief Minister and he will have a hard task to handle when he expands his Cabinet.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bickering-among-sub-sects-of-lingayat-comes-to-the-fore/article30647762.ece

159,2020/01/25,Budgetary support sought to map unprotected monuments in State,"The exercise to map and document unprotected monuments in the State will require at least ₹6 crore for which the Department of Archaeology Museums and Heritage has sought budgetary support from the government.

The pilot project of the exercise undertaken in Mysuru taluk was completed recently and the taluk alone has yielded around 650 sculptures, hero stones, temples, kalyanis, etc. The taluk-level pilot project helped ascertain the complexities and the enormity of the exercise in mapping all unprotected monuments across the State.

The objective of the State-wide exercise is to prepare a baseline data for the number of unprotected monuments, document their present status, trace their history and antiquity and conserve them for posterity.

Historically important structures could include kalyanis, temples, ruins of forts, tombs, towers etc of considerable architectural merit. The physical verification will also help assess if the precincts have been encroached upon or not. If any new discovery fulfils the criteria stipulated by the Archaeological Survey of India and the National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities and reflects architectural and historical significance, they could be incorporated in the protected list.

At present, Karnataka has 844 protected monuments that are of significant artistic and historical importance but the figures have not been updated for nearly two decades. It is reckoned that there are thousands of monuments across the State but they risk being obliterated owing to developmental pressure or for land grabbing if not documented and mapped.

Based on the pilot project for Mysuru taluk, the department has prepared a project report and has submitted it to the government seeking budgetary allocation in the coming financial year so that the mapping project across the State could be launched. Commissioner for Archaeology, Museums and Heritage Venkatesh told The Hindu that a rough estimate indicates that mapping the monuments would cost around ₹6 crore. The pilot project in Mysuru was undertaken by the department staff. However, for the rest of Karnataka, human resource has to be outsourced by roping in PG students of history from different universities, NSS volunteers, etc., apart from NGOs, said Mr.Venkatesh.

“The pilot project has given us a broad idea of how the mapping can be undertaken across the State. Interaction with local village headmen and gram panchayat members helped us cover much ground as they are well-versed about the presence of ancient temples and monuments within the vicinity of their respective villages,” said Mr. Venkatesh.

Though Minister for Kannada and Culture C.T. Ravi impressed upon the department to prepare a conservation plan as well, the authorities have decided to go about it in a phase-wise manner. Officials said preparing the baseline data and ascertaining the importance of the monuments is the immediate objective and conservation will follow next.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/odzt7z/article30647678.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/24BGMYSURUMONUMENTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/budgetary-support-sought-to-map-unprotected-monuments-in-state/article30647679.ece
160,2020/01/25,Santhosh slams actors for stance on CAA,"BJP leader B.L. Santhosh has lashed out against actors Naseeruddin Shah, Deepika Padukone, and Swara Bhaskar for their stance on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and said that the Act does not apply to citizens of India.

Addressing a gathering of BJP leaders, party activists, and the public in the city on Friday, Mr. Santhosh cited remarks attributed to Mr. Shah and Ms. Bhaskar that they had no documents to prove their citizenship and rebuked them.

Mocking their statements that they did not have relevant documents, Mr. Santhosh wondered how it was possible for them to procure passports and visas to travel abroad or get a driving licence without documents, and reiterated that the CAA will not ask for any documents from Indian citizens as it is meant to bestow citizenship upon persecuted religious minorities.

Ms. Padukone also came under flak for her support to the JNU students’ strike, and Mr. Santhosh said that her concern would have been more meaningful had she visited the parents of Nirbhaya who was sexually assaulted and murdered in Delhi in 2012, and questioned such “selective outrage.”

161,2020/01/25,HC: Souharda co-op. entities also eligible for I-T benefit,"In a relief to entities registered under the Karnataka Souharda Sahakari Act, 1997, the Karnataka High Court has declared that they also “fit into the definition of cooperative society in the Income Tax (I-T) Act, 1961” and are “entitled to stake their claim for the benefit” of deduction of income from certain sources under Section 80P of the I-T Act.

Justice Krishna S. Dixit delivered the verdict while allowing petitions filed by M/s Swabhimani Souharda Credit Cooperative Ltd., and Karnataka State Souharda Federal Cooperative Ltd.

The I-T Department had contended that only entities registered under the Karnataka Co-operative Societies Act, 1959 can seek exemptions under Section 80P of the I-T Act, as the 1997 law does not fall under the definition of “co-operative society” under Section 2(19) of the I-T Act.

Disagreeing with the I-T Department’s contention, the Court said that the provisions of exemption in deduction from taxable income under Section 80P were enacted by the Parliament for promoting the cooperative movement in India and this provision needs to be liberally construed to effectuate the legislative object of encouraging and promoting the growth of the cooperative movement.

Analysing the preambles and various provisions of the 1959, and the 1997 laws, the Court said they lead to an irresistible conclusion that they are both cognate statutes that deal with cooperative societies, regardless of some difference in their nomenclature, and functionality.

All entities, which are registered under the enactments relating to cooperative societies regardless of their varying nomenclatures, need to be treated as cooperative societies, the Court added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-souharda-co-op-entities-also-eligible-for-i-t-benefit/article30647341.ece

163,2020/01/25,Gear up with a game plan,"Exams can be a tricky affair for some, but a cakewalk for others. With the exam season fast approaching, the time for revision is getting shorter. Reviewing conceptual subjects in particular, such as accountancy, chemistry and math is essential, but can be difficult without the right material and direction.

Due to the vast syllabus and peer pressure, students also tend to feel that their life revolves around exams and become stressed. A few years ago, a children’s mental health group received 6,332 calls to its helpline. Of these, 884 were by youngsters between 16 and 17, and 39% were about school problems revolving around exam stress. In order to address this situation, CBSE has recently issued some new guidelines and revised the exam pattern with an aim to:

Decrease the over-burden of syllabus and exam stress upon the students.

Discourage students from rote learning.

Develop analytical skills and reasoning abilities among students.

Produce better results and improve the academic quality of institutions.

The new exam pattern which will be implemented from this year’s board exam, and the new revised question paper will include a reduction in the number of subjective questions to lessen the burden of writing a lengthy exam. This will be coupled with several creative, innovative and critical thinking skills questions. For example, 20 marks dedicated to MCQ’s in an 80-mark question paper will encourage students to study every topic to cultivate an in-depth understanding.

Revised exam format prep

In line with the new changes, it is also important to equip oneself with the right tools and study material which can help preparation. Following a strict timetable and devoting equal attention to every subject can also be helpful. Other than that:

Practice well: Practice papers are a great way for you to simulate the real feeling of writing an exam paper. Besides, practice papers are essential to help you manage your time well and develop a sound exam-solving strategy.

Periodic review of progress: Reviewing one’s progress periodically and keeping revision up-to-date material is necessary when preparing for a subject. With the right material, you can boost your analytical thinking and anticipate important questions, thus allowing you to prepare outline answers for each, ahead of time.

Memory aids to retain information: It is psychologically proven that it is always better to write something down when wanting to retain information. Flashcards and mock question papers are popular memory aids for you to test your knowledge and understanding of difficult subjects, such as math and physics.

Assessments and mock tests: Sample question papers and mock tests not only put you in real-life exam scenarios, but also encourage you to explore various avenues when answering questions, finding solutions as well as vastly improving your critical and creative thinking.

Customised and personalised learning: It is also important to understand that every student is different, and one should customise one’s method of learning keeping in mind one’s potential and capabilities. For instance, a student who is good in accountancy might not be equally proficient in economics and vice-versa. Hence, a customised approach towards preparation is critical.

Teachers and educators to the rescue: The need to understand a subject does not just rest with students. Teachers are valued as the most essential resource in determining the learning capabilities of students. For this purpose, schools and educators must step up and host regular workshops, which keep teachers abreast with changing learning patterns.

Appropriate study material: Apart from the above preparation tips and techniques, using the right study material for revision is and always will be the secret to exam success.

Choosing the right study resources and learning material is extremely crucial so that students can go about preparing in a more efficient manner. Today, many books are available in the market which offer various benefits and advantages to students while preparing for their exams. They should be mindful of choosing a resource which is based on the latest 2019-20 CBSE curriculum and includes a multitude of previous year papers, practice questions, self-assessment corners, detailed marking scheme, performance cards, and so on.",education,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/education/gear-up-with-a-game-plan/article30650837.ece

Dear Jacob,

You are in a catch-22 situation. It is time for you to have a frank and assertive conversation with your parents on what you want to do and make of your life. Finish the course first and try to get placed at a decent job that gives you financial stability and then, you can explore your passion for music in good time. Keep developing it and attend classes over the weekend/s to improve your skill-set, as this is something that will only get better with practice, dedication and discipline. At the same time, be mindful that you cannot afford to be merely romantic about pursuing your music. Good luck.

However, I didn't get selected in the final allotment. Now, I am in a dilemma about my career, and I am 27 unemployed. What step should I take now? — Sankar Dhulipalla

Dear Sankar,

This is a huge problem and worrisome, no doubt. Give the bank exam a last try as you are still eligible for it and nearly made it through. Also, meanwhile, a good idea would be to look at employment opportunities across other fields and industries and see what comes up. What else would you like to do? Give it a thought. It can become unsettling and unhealthy if this carries on any further. All the very best to you.

The advantages of the system are quite obvious. The students can use the common grading system and marks obtained in class X or XII to get admission to reputed higher education institutes. This in turn can empower them to get meaningful jobs in a domain of their choice.

However, the marks obtained in the board exams should not define you. It may so happen that you are faced with a difficult/unavoidable situation during the time of your exam which may prevent you from performing to your potential and secure the grades you deserve. There is no need to lose heart. Bear in mind that with a positive attitude, you will always get a second chance in life.

Prep tips

If you are feeling tense about the board exam, here are the 10 most important preparation tips:

Start now: Every student is different with unique learning capabilities. So, there is no generalised rule for deciding when a particular student should start his or her preparation. However, the most effective approach is to start learning, practising and revising at the earliest. Do not procrastinate.

Understand the exam pattern and syllabus: Go through question papers from the previous years and talk to teachers to know about the class X and XII board exam pattern, as well as syllabus. You need to be clear about the type of questions, the number of questions, marking scheme, sections covered and duration of the exam well in advance.

Analyse the pattern of the question papers and get familiar with the format and nature of questions beforehand. The scheme of marking, as well as, criteria for writing answers can also tell you a lot about how to approach the board exams well in advance.

Prepare a timetable and stick to it: Prepare a proper study schedule allocating different time slots to each subject. Make it a habit to adhere to the timetable. Rank the subjects in order of importance — you can prioritise the courses in which you may be lagging behind or the courses you want to ace.

Realise the importance of self-study: You may still be going to school or coaching classes prior to your board exams, where your teachers will help you revise topics in different subject areas. However, self-study is important as well. Studying on your own can help you internalise the topics learnt and positively impact your grades.

Prepare notes, study smart: Do not study hard, rather study smart. Create study notes; break down the subject matter into different topics to create revision notes. You can mark important concepts in bold which would be helpful when you are revising the topics.

When you are revising a particular subject two days before the exams, it would not be possible to go through all the concepts, properties, definitions and theories. A better practice would be to have all the important formulae, diagrams, definitions and theories of different subjects on a paper with you. This would help in quick and easy revision .

Solve sample papers: Start solving sample papers a couple of months before the exams. That way, you would have covered most of your syllabus. In all likelihood, you would be well-versed with the content and topics in each subject.

Take regular breaks: Do not study for long hours at a stretch. You can take regular breaks every one hour to relax your mind and re-energise yourself. This way, you can get yourself ready for the next study session. This simple practice can help you stay focused.

Revise regularly: Go through the notes you have prepared chapter-wise for various subjects. Reading these subject notes regularly will help you internalise the myriad concepts and increase your comprehension with every revision.

Take care of your health: Eat healthy, drink lots of water every day, and exercise for at least half an hour to stay healthy during exam time. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body; you would need to have an alert mental faculty during exam time. Get sufficient sleep so that your body and mind are fully energised.

Seek guidance: Talk to parents/teachers in case you are feeling overwhelmed about the upcoming exams. The positivity and reassurance derived from them can encourage you to do better.

No good has come of fear. Stress, anxiety and fear can only come in the way of your exam preparation and adversely impact your performance in the final exams. Practise mindfulness or meditation, listen to soothing music, or take a walk in your neighbourhood. Do all that it takes to keep your mind relaxed before the boards and you would be pleasantly surprised at what you can achieve once you are stress-free.

166,2020/01/25,Have a plan in place,"Dear class XI students, if you haven’t realised it already, this is going to be one of the most fast-paced, high-pressure and high-impact years of your student life. The best way to stay cool is to know what to expect and plan things early.

I have collated this timeline for students applying to the top five college destinations for Indian students today: the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Singapore and India.

January to March: Most students are writing class XI final exams. Several universities in the U.S., Singapore and Canada consider class XI scores when assessing a student’s application so this has to be given priority.

This is a great time to start planning the summer — fixing testing schedules, applying for summer programmes and reaching out to organisations for internships.

Both the Common App and the Coalition App release their essay prompts by this time and it is a great idea for U.S. college aspirants to start working on these prompts to make time to really think, ideate, edit and re-edit the main essay — and truly get a headstart on the process.

April to July: Multiple SAT, ACT and SAT II dates. This is a good time to finish all your testing, including the IELTS, so that you are free to focus on applications after this. Several schools have summer breaks in May and June. This is the last summer you have to enhance your skills and credentials through short courses, internships or projects. You will soon be writing numerous essays about why you want to major in the subject you have chosen and what you have done to further your interest. Use the summer to create material that could impress admissions officers, as well as give you clarity on your goals.

Another good use of the summer is to create a CV, and a basic Statement of Purpose stating what you want to do in college, why you want to do it and your credentials in the area.

August and September: Class XII half yearly exams form the basis for predicted grades so this has to be given priority during these months. Most U.S. universities open their college applications in August and it is a great idea to start working on the supplementary college essays as well.

Those applying to the U.K. also need to check if their courses require any tests and register for these with the British Council or their representatives. The deadlines for this are usually September 30.

October: This is a big month. The CSS profile for financial aid in U.S. colleges opens on October 1. UCAS deadlines for applying to Oxbridge fall on October 15 and their tests are on October 30. It is good to use this time to prepare for any early deadlines you wish to approach in November and December.

November: Application fever begins in earnest. Almost all Early Decision and Early Action deadlines for U.S. colleges fall on November 1. University of Toronto has an early deadline in November as does Ashoka University. The University of California applications close on November 30.

December: Apart from class XII final exams, you may be dealing with early deadlines for Texas universities and Indian universities like Flame, Krea, Azim Premji among others. Many US and Canada regular decision deadlines are in early January so December is usually a super hectic month for college essays and video essays.

January 2021: The New Year starts with a bang for those applying to the U.S. with many application deadlines between January 1 and 5. UCAS and Canada deadlines are on January 15. Hopefully, you have spent the last quarter of the previous year well and have minimal work to reach these deadlines. Most decisions on early applications are announced at this time so many students have the comfort of having an offer from a target college as they enter their pre-boards.

February and March are for the board exams, of course. Most U.S. and Canada colleges declare their results at this time as well. Hopefully you have applied to a broad and diverse enough list to have good news coming in from several corners.

A word of comfort for those already hitting the stress buttons: you don’t control your class XII outcomes but you do control your actions. And action is the best antidote to stress. Just start early and stay cool to avoid the adrenaline rush of last-minute applications.

167,2020/01/25,Brush the mind,"“Lose yourself!”, “Escape to happiness!” are messages and promises on billboards and TV advertisements about wellness clinics, spas and resorts. Forgetfulness of the self and one’s context is seen as some sort of goal to work towards. To sink into nothingness. To put everything behind one, as if life were something to run away from and not to be lived. Many of us look at these visions of golden sand or green glades or gardens and think, “Wish I could be there.”

The arrival of a new year steps up the voltage of this feeling that what we have or have been so far is not good enough.

Reason

Whatever ‘high’ comes from such a delinking (always supposing you can afford it) can only be temporary because the truth is that the lightness of being you seek, can only come from within. Small anxious thoughts that slowly knot the mind on waking after the first joy of rising to a fresh day will remind you that these ‘escapes’ are not really escapes. But if we deal with the small knots by holding them outside the mind and saying “Well, they are not going to disappear, but I am not going to let them ruin my day either”, we might be able to collect ourselves better to meet them.

Every day, I recall the response of the founder of the Ba’hai faith Bahaullah after he visited a prison. When he was leaving he was invited to write something in the Visitors’ Book. “What a wonderful place,” he wrote against his signature. As they drove away, his friend asked, “How could you possibly say that about such a gloomy place of forced confinement, a jail?” Bahaullah said “Why? Everything is provided on time, it is clean, it is well run. The greatest prison is not stone walls but the prison of the self!” Then I read that in 1852 it was as he lay imprisoned and persecuted, that he had had a vision of man’s spiritual destiny. The day I read this anecdote I also read what an Indian sage had said about the dust of the mind being like the dust atop a table or the fine skin that forms on the surface of still waters. As the dust atop a table is wiped, so too should one from time to time, brush the mind.

Today a great deal of dust has settled on our collective awareness with shadow lines being drawn between people and communities; these are things we need to be aware of. Are we denying the freedom we value to someone else? Let’s be honest about our own prejudices. Darwin concluded his On the Origin of Species with the famous “entangled bank” paragraph. It describes an environment in which a wide variety of plants and animals “so different from each other and dependent upon each other in so complex a manner” all governed by the same laws, seemed to be thriving.

Words to hold on to in our troubled times.

168,2020/01/25,Orthopaedic meet begins,"The 39th annual conference of Kerala Orthopaedic Association, KOACON 2020, began at Perinthalmanna on Friday, discussing at length strategies in traumatic injuries, life-threatening complications, and management of fractures.

Road accidents

Inaugurating the conference, former High Court judge Babu Mathew P. Joseph said youth-oriented initiatives were needed to check the growing number of road accidents and trauma incidents in the country.

Organising secretary and senior orthopaedist Faizal Kareem said nearly 80% of multiple traumatic injuries in the country were the result of road accidents.

Impact on GDP

According to Dr. Faizal, India accounts for 12.5% of global road accidents, and 10% of worldwide road accident deaths. “Its impact on our GDP is about 3% a year,” he said.

Kochu S. Mani, president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Perinthalmanna chapter, was the guest of honour. Jacob P.J., president in charge of the Kerala Orthopaedic Association, presided.

169,2020/01/25,A power-packed take on misogyny in society,"No Rest in the Kingdom, a black comedy by Deepika Arwind, tells about how women deal with misogyny in their daily lives. The performance looks at the female performer’s body as a site of protest.

The play, a powerful one-woman physical theatre, performed at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK) on Saturday, draws from the lives of urban characters who speak similar languages of consumerism and technology.

Daily annoyances

It deals with daily annoyances of being a woman in the country.

Masculinity in South Asia, especially India, is asserted and celebrated widely, says Deepika. “Its conventional manifestations are varied and dangerous, infecting different aspects of everyday life. Whether through the perpetration of rape culture in cinema and politics, or the palpable anxiety of the female body on the street, masculinity occupies oppressively large spaces, literally and figuratively,” she says.

Subverting masculinity

No Rest in the Kingdom has been created out of the desire to embody and subvert expressions of this masculinity through the body of a female performer, she says.

The kingdom is the current society where we live, where women are subjected to daily discrimination and violence.

Blurring the boundaries of genders, the actor embodies a variety of characters — male, female and feline — representing a gender and inter-species fluidity. The cat is a powerful motif that runs through the play.

How might her body, alone and vulnerable, serve as a metaphor for gender insensitivity and antagonism? How can her body transform into multiple sites of protest and how can humour, irreverence, and playfulness become her primary weapons of dissent and opposition?

This show has travelled to find resonance in different countries because its characters are archetypes of ‘masculinity’ familiar across cultures.

The play causes discomfort, sometimes scepticism. It breeds introspection and provokes conversations, Deepika says.

She avoids clichés, does not preach. But the play holds a mirror to the audience.

The characters she portrays sent the audience to howls of laughter.

But for every woman in the audience, there were scenes that they can identify deeply with. The play is produced by Sandbox Collective.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vqpyyi/article30654349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AJT7828,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-power-packed-take-on-misogyny-in-society/article30654350.ece
170,2020/01/25,Spotlight again on illegal constructions in Munnar,"After a gap, the district administration has started action against illegal constructions in Munnar, this time with the attachment of property.

District Collector H. Dinesan has cancelled the title deeds of three resorts at Pallivasal, including one under construction, for violating the rules of title deeds.

The conditions in the title deeds, issued as per the 1964 rules specifying that the land should be used only for agriculture purposes and any constructions should be for residential purpose, have been found to be violated.

The construction of multistoreyed buildings for commercial purposes is against the rules.

The constructions include the Plum Judy resort that has been renamed as Amber Day, Madaparambil resort, and one under final stages of construction.

The resorts are on the land under ‘thandaper’ numbers 1,193, 1,334 and 1,410.

Report

Mr. Dinesan told The Hindu on Saturday that there is a report by the Director, Vigilance & Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB), to the government specifying the violations of the rules and action has been taken as per it. The tahsildar has been asked to take over the resorts. They would be attached to the government.

Environmentalists raised the issue of illegal and unauthorised constructions in Devikulam taluk after Bijo Mani had complained to the VACB prompting it to investigate the cases.

Plum Judy

Plum Judy was in the news when 57 tourists, including 22 foreigners, were trapped there after the road to the resort was inundated in landslips during the 2018 August floods.

Later, the resort was given on lease and renamed Amber Day.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/spotlight-again-on-illegal-constructions-in-munnar/article30654339.ece

172,2020/01/25,Padma Awards 2020: Seven unique achievers bring laurels for Kerala,"Seven Keralites whose achievements have remained relatively unsung have been conferred Padma awards on the occasion of Republic Day this year.

N. R. Madhava Menon, the father of modern Indian legal education, will be awarded Padma Bhushan posthumously. Spiritual guru Sri M is the other Keralites selected for Padma Bhushan this year.

Five other Keralites, including puppetry artist Moozhikkal Pankajakshi, social activist Satyanarayanan Mundayoor and botanist and taxonomist K.S. Manilal will be conferred with Padma Shri.

Born in Thiruvananthapuram, Madhava Menon was founder director of the National Law School of India University (NLSIU) and the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal. He had been honoured with Padma Shri in 2003. Madhava Menon passed away in May 2019.

Hailing from Thiruvananthapuram, Sri M (M. Mumtaz Ali) heads the Satsang Foundation. Growing up listening to Sufi tales, Mumtaz Ali had embarked upon a spiritual quest. He later became the disciple of Maheshwarnath Babaji.

The other Keralites selected for the Padma Shri are M. K. Kunjol (social work), N. Chandrasekharan Nair (literature and education), Sathyanarayanan Mundayoor and Moozhikkal Pankajakshi.

Sathyanarayanan

Sathyanarayanan Mundayoor, aka Uncle Moosa, from Thrissur, has been recognised for developing libraries as part of a social movement in Arunachal Pradesh. Mr. Mundayoor, who reached Arunachal Pradesh in 1979 at the age of 25 as a ‘life worker’ for the Vivekananda Kendra, opened schools to educate tribal children. He went from ‘life worker’ to a teacher and then an education officer. He took the name Uncle Moosa while writing a column for children in a local newspaper.

In 1998, he decided to place the school libraries of the Vivekananda Kendra in the midst of tribal communities. Tribal girls and boys discovered the joy of reading and also learnt to express themselves though storytelling, skits, and recitation.

Moozhikkal Pankajakshi

Moozhikkal Pankajakshi is the sole practitioner of a fading form of puppetry called Nokkuvidya Paava Kali. She has been balancing the entire Ramayana and Mahabharatha on the tip of her lips for almost her entire life.

She had performed the art form, in which a stick puppet is balanced on the upper lip, for a living. Even after withdrawing from the scene, the 81-year-old has kept the passion for the art alive.

Pankajakshi learnt it from her parents, who used to perform in houses and temples. She started training at the age of 12. Soon, she became the art form’s sole exponent.

Assisted by her family, Pankajakshi has visited many places in the country and abroad, showcasing her unique art form. Having lost her front teeth, which rendered her unable to balance the puppet, she stopped performing some six years ago. The artist is recuperating from a massive stroke she suffered a few years ago.

Another Keralaite, Thalappil Pradep, nanotechnologist who works at IIT, Madras, in Tamil Nadu also gets Padma Shri.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/v5pj4q/article30654324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-padma-awardREVcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/seven-unique-achievers-bring-laurels-for-state/article30654325.ece
173,2020/01/25,"Being starved in convent, says Sr. Lucy Kalappura","Sister Lucy Kalappura, who had raised her voice against Bishop Franco Mulakkal in a case regarding the bishop’s sexual assault of a nun, has alleged that she is being starved by the Church as part of expelling her from her convent.

Speaking to The Hindu on Saturday, Sister Lucy said she had been made to starve by the convent authorities at Karakkamala, near Vellamunda, in the district for the past many months. The nun of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation (FCC) under the Syro- Malabar Church was expelled from the order on August 7 for ‘failing to give a satisfactory explanation’ for her lifestyle ‘in violation of rules.’

“The hostile attitude of the convent authorities started after a four-member team of nuns, including a superior, took charge of the convent a few months ago,” Sr. Lucy said.

“They always behaved rudely with me and tried to expel me from the convent. One of the nuns told me recently that I had no right to live in the convent as the Church had expelled me,” she said.

There are five residents in the convent, including Sr. Lucy. She said many a time her food was locked up. Earlier there was a servant to prepare food for the residents. When the new team had arrived they expelled the servant first, she said. “They will not allow me to touch even the sewing machine that I had used to stitch my clothes,” she said.

Appeals rejected

“I appealed thrice to the higher Church authorities in the Vatican, but two of them were rejected. Though I had submitted the last appeal to the Supreme Tribunal of the Signatura Apostolica three months ago, they are yet to consider it,” Sr. Lucy said. She had lodged complaints against the convent authorities and a priest, but the police were yet to act, she said.

“All my rights are being deprived here,” she said adding that she had drafted letters to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Chairman of the State Human Rights Commission to restore her privileges in the convent.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/being-starved-in-convent-says-sr-lucy-kalappura/article30654319.ece
174,2020/01/25,"Technical upgrade, a distant dream","When Abraham Antony decided to leave his job in Singapore and return to his native Edakkom, he was hopeful of making a career out of farming. After all, the State government had been actively promoting a high-tech technology to grow vegetables. Six years into polyhouse farming, he deeply regrets the decision. The heavy losses forced him to stop farming. Now, he works in Qatar.

Like Mr. Antony, several others in Kannur have wound up polyhouse cultivation, after pumping in huge amounts. Since its inception in 2011-12, 38 people have constructed polyhouses in Kannur. The last person to join the scheme was in 2017-18. Now, fewer than 10 farmers are on the job. Others are on the verge of closure.

“It was a great start, with tomatoes, cucumbers, and long yard beans giving a rich yield,” says Mr. Antony. But, when the crop reached the market, it was much costlier than those brought from other States. He grew tomatoes when the market price was ₹60 a kilogram. When it was time to sell, the price had dipped to ₹6. “The price did not even meet the production cost,” he says.

He tried other vegetables, but the returns never picked up. He invested ₹50 lakh on a polyhouse, got a return of just ₹10 lakh in four years.

The soil factor

M.V. Rajan, a farmer from Karippal, who had a polyhouse in 25 cents of land, could only watch helplessly as the yield reduced over a period of time. With the regular use of fertilizers, the quality of soil plummeted.

Mr. Rajan says the cultivation is high-risk as any disease will spread within few hours and destroy the produce. Moreover, the lack of expertise in the Agriculture Department is a point of concern. “The field officers had no solution to offer when the red spinach I grew was affected by a disease. A large portion of the yield was destroyed,” he says.

An outdated technology from Israel, which was in use 25 years ago, is still being implemented here, claims T.V. John, a farmer who discarded polyhouse farming after incurring debts. He says polyhouses are not suitable for the climatic conditions here. High humidity content affects vegetables. “There is a need to upgrade technology and come up with designs suited for local conditions,” he says.

A few bright spots

However, there were a few exceptions like N.K. Roy at Neeliyara in Taliparamba block, who, despite several failures found a way out by cultivating bush pepper in the polyhouse. He started a polyhouse in 50 cents of land. All efforts at cultivating vegetables failed, mainly due to the climate. Then he switched to pepper cultivation. Today his polyhouse has 10,000 bush pepper plants.

“I could bear the losses, as I am running a coir company too. Not everyone will be able to absorb such losses, primarily caused by the lack of technical know-how in the implementing authority,” he says. “The government officials do try to popularise the concept, but once launched, there is little technical support for the farmers.”

Agriculture Department officials say they are not encouraging farmers to directly take up polyhouse cultivation. Kannur Principal Agriculture Officer Lal T. George admits to the many drawbacks in the system. “Before taking up the project the farmer must understand the pros and cons,” he adds.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/vhu511/article30654303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvThepolyhouseabandonedatKanNur,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/technical-upgrade-a-distant-dream/article30654304.ece
175,2020/01/25,Farmers see a ‘slaughterhouse of plants’,"It was in 2013 that Johny Pattani, a progressive farmer at Kalpetta in Wayanad, took up polyhouse cultivation, an emerging commercial activity.

The farmer borrowed ₹12 lakh from a bank to set up the biggest polyhouse in the district. However, he gave up precision farming this year, after suffering huge losses for seven years. Mr. Pattani had started the venture upon being told by officials about the advantages of hi-tech polyhouse farming — high productivity, minimum water requirement, longer shelf life for produce, and low pest attacks. He also felt encouraged by the positive experiences of a few farmers who had taken up the innovative farming technique. Today, he feels let down.

“I had organically cultivated capsicum in the polyhouse made of polyethylene. But the first harvest itself flopped, mainly owing to the dearth of marketing facility for organic vegetables in the district,” he said.

“I could not compete with the low-priced vegetables brought from Karnataka and was forced to sell the produce at a throwaway price,” Johny said. He cultivated bitter gourd, cow pea and French beans the next year, but the result was no different.

Pest attack

Gradually the yield from the polyhouse declined and attacks of fungus, mealybug and other insects increased. Finally, he realised that farming is not possible inside a polyhouse without applying highly toxic chemicals to keep pathogens at bay. Always a stickler for organic farming, he was averse to applying toxic pesticides on plants. He stopped farming this year. He is yet to close the loan.

Where are the experts?

The plight of more than 150 other farmers who had put up polyhouses under various such schemes in the district is almost similar. K. Saseendran, a farmer at Thekkumthara in the district, had borrowed ₹5.50 lakh from a bank and received ₹2.70 lakh as subsidy from the Agriculture Department when he set out in 2013 on the uncharted territory of precision farming.

He is yet to get any profit from the venture, and blames for it the dearth of a marketing system and absence of experts to provide feedback and tips on new technologies.

Many a time, excessive heat can make the polyhouse a slaughterhouse for plants, farmers say. They resort to misting to bring the heat down. But excessive misting can lead to excess moisture and finally it makes a polyhouse the breeding ground of fungi. Mr. Saseendran is now trying to convert his polyhouse into a naturally ventilated one.

An alternative

K. Ajithkumar, Associate Director of Research, Regional Agricultural Research station, Ambalavayal, says polyhouses are not suitable for subtropical or tropical regions. Rain shelter farming with insect proof-net is suitable for such regions. The high temperature with high humidity inside a polyhouse helps pathogens, including fungus and insects, multiply. Naturally, input cost would go up. The research station is planning a study on the reasons for the failure of polyhouses in the district and ways to renovate them, in the wake of Wayanad being declared a ‘special agriculture zone’ for floriculture.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gbyrgk/article30654289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvwypolyhouse,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/farmers-see-a-slaughterhouse-of-plants/article30654290.ece
176,2020/01/25,Hopes begin to wilt,"When Shameer S. decided three years ago to try his hand at polyhouse cultivation, the hi-tech farming sector was scarcely exuding confidence. Across the State, disillusioned entrepreneur farmers were busy calling it a day, courtesy lack of governmental support, viable markets, technical know-how and a plethora of attendant issues.

Nonetheless, Shameer started off by renting a 400-sq m polyhouse at Mannanthala where he grew salad cucumber, yard-long beans, and leafy veggies. A year ago, he decided to go all out. He established a 1,000 sq m polyhouse at his home in Nedumangad, an agriculture-rich region in rural Thiruvananthapuram.

Hard truths

Shameer has not lost his passion for polyhouse farming, but he has also learnt — the hard way — important lessons that every surviving hi-tech farmer in the State would agree are necessary simply to make ends meet.

“This is one sector where you need to pump in money to make money. Getting a subsidy is easy. But there’s more to it than that. The farmer himself needs to have a crystal-clear idea of what is needed in a polyhouse. It is safer not to depend on others,” says Shameer.

Indications are that many of the problems that plagued hi-tech farming in Kerala three or even five years ago still persist. Hi-tech farmers blame a marked lack of support from the government machinery. High operational and maintenance expenses, absence of technical inputs from field-level agricultural offices and mounting bank debts continue to haunt polyhouse farmers. After the devastating floods of 2018 and 2019, many farmers were unable to make a comeback due to the huge expenses involved.

Govt. support is crucial

“We could do with more support from the Department. At present, farmers lack assistance even for hiring power-wash machines to clean the facility once a year. We hire it privately. Cleaning costs alone come to around ₹12,000 annually,” says Aneesh N. Raj of Anchal, Kollam, who won the State award for hi-tech farming for 2017-18. Aneesh had dropped a lucrative corporate job to take up polyhouse cultivation. Today, he has one polyhouse on ten cents of land and two smaller ones on two cents each, where he grows yard-long beans, salad cucumber and tomato. Recently, he added aquaponics to the list. Aneesh says he finds good markets for his produce. “The beans go for ₹100 a kg, the tomatoes (Arka Rakshak variety) for ₹80 per kg and salad cucumber for ₹70. We can do more, with a little more support,” he says.

Though grassroot-level government set-up has been found wanting, social media platforms are proving a big help to these entrepreneur farmers. They are part of WhatsApp and Facebook groups and are in constant touch with each other, sharing tips, and technical advice.

The flagship scheme implemented by the State Horticulture Mission (SHM) offers financial assistance up to 75% of the unit cost to entrepreneurs, said Sakeena I., Joint Director, SHM. Of this 50% comes as Central assistance and 25%, State government share. The 75% subsidy is on offer to polyhouses ranging from 400 to 4,000 sq m, SHM officials said. On their part, farmers urge the government to ensure that the subsidies are issued to only eligible candidates. At present, there is little or no follow-up once the subsidy is issued, they say.

Not all is lost

Polyhouse cultivation cannot be written off as a failure in the State, stresses Dr. Narayanankutty, Professor, Agricultural Research Station, Kerala Agricultural University. “Earlier, many people were attracted to it by the huge subsidy that was on offer. Today, only farmers who are genuinely interested in it remain. Polyhouse farming has potential in the high ranges. Several farmers in places like Wayanad are doing it well,” Dr. Narayanankutty said.

V. Gopakumar, a retired Army Subedar who was one of the earliest to take the plunge into this sector, says a more farmer-friendly attitude on the part of government officials can go a long way. “Polyhouse farming has certain advantages over conventional farming. But you also need to have strong policies and measures to protect farmers. You cannot have policies that keep changing with the governments,” says Mr. Gopakumar who has a polyhouse at Kottoor here.

These days, the retired soldier is also attempting to enhance his income through value addition. “Food processing has scope. Such know-how is not easily available to farmers, though,” he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/5pugbd/article30654282.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tvPoly-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hopes-begin-to-wilt/article30654276.ece
177,2020/01/25,Shelter work progressing,"The construction of a multipurpose cyclone shelter for providing refuge to over 1,000 people during natural calamities is progressing in Thazhava grama panchayat.

The 3.4-crore shelter being built under the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) can be used for other purposes in normal circumstances.

The Centre’s NCRMP is an attempt to mitigate the effects of cyclonic storms in coastal States through structural and non-structural measures.

The shelters being built will come up in coastal areas that are prone to hydro-meteorological hazards. The World Bank and the State will share the cost of the construction in a 75:25 ratio.

The project implemented by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority aims to provide shelter to communities living in the coastal areas of the State who are vulnerable to various calamities, including cyclones and coastal erosion.

Families that are often evacuated from their homes during disasters will be shifted to the shelters, which will also function as a centre for coordinating relief activities.

The three-story building will have a large kitchen and dining hall along with rooms and separate toilets facilities for men and women.

The construction will follow a disaster-proof method that can withstand cyclones and other calamities to a great extent.

“The design of the building makes it quite flexible so that we can conduct public functions, weddings, training sessions and other community events in normal conditions. There is also provision to set up classrooms since it’s basically a multipurpose structure,” said an official.

First shelter

Kerala will have a number of such shelters across the coastal districts, and the first one was set up at Mararikkulam in Alappuzha.

The locations have been selected considering various aspects, including access and possibilities of hazard-free transportation during an event of disaster.

The shelter will be managed by a committee including panchayat officials, representatives of various departments, the police, Fire and Rescue Services officials and differently abled persons.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/shelter-work-progressing/article30654256.ece

The drive, coordinated by the District Suchitwa Mission, was initiated in association with various departments and local bodies. Members of the Haritha Karma Sena, National Service Scheme and other voluntary organisations also take part in it.

The biodegradable waste collected during the drive was disposed at select locations while the plastic waste would be handed over for recycling after segregation by the local bodies concerned.

The nondegradable waste collected from Kottayam municipality was shifted to the plastic shredding unit at Kodimatha. Meanwhile, the Collector has directed the local bodies to initiate stern action against those dumping waste on the road and in waterbodies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/massive-clean-up-drive-in-kottayam/article30654254.ece
179,2020/01/25,Malayalam film on Rohingya refugees cleared with cuts,"A A Malayalam film on Rohingya refugees has been cleared by the revising committee of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), but only after making cuts to references to the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) and cows. Kaattu, Kadal, Athirukal (Wind, Ocean, Borders), directed by Samad Mankada, was earlier rejected by the regional office of the CBFC, which sent it to the revising committee.

“We had submitted the film to the regional committee in October last. The committee said the film that touches on international issues can affect the country’s relationship with friendly nations in the neighbourhood. When it went to the screening committee, they asked us to mute and blur a few scenes. One of the lines we were asked to mute was on the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB). When we made the film, the Bill was yet to be passed. All the lines referring to the ‘cow’ in a scene where ‘gau rakshaks’ confront cattle traders have also been muted,” Mr. Mankada told The Hindu.

The film chronicles the life of a Rohingyan refugee who accidentally ends up in Kerala. While fleeing the genocide back home, he gets separated from his wife and children. With the help of a journalist and his Tibetan friend, the refugee goes in search of his family, from one camp to another.

Message of love

“Our film stands for a message of love and kindness, beyond all borders of religion, caste, nationality, and language. We have shown reality as it is. If that reality offends someone, we cannot help it. India has always kept its doors open to persecuted refugees from everywhere, irrespective of their religion. In fact, We began shooting the film in 2019, on the 60th anniversary of India providing asylum to the Dalai Lama. Now, even the International Court of Justice in The Hague has acknowledged that persecution of Rohingyas has happened and ordered Myanmar to protect them. Even our movie only talks about this reality,” said Mr. Mankada.

He said they had the option to approach a tribunal to appeal against the cuts, but the process being time consuming, they could not wait that long to get the film released. It is slated for release next week.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bdxvj5/article30654589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200125-WA0022,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/malayalam-film-on-rohingya-refugees-cleared-with-cuts/article30654248.ece

181,2020/01/25,Governor differs with draft policy address,"Governor Arif Mohammad Khan is reportedly in variance with the government's views on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) as articulated in the draft policy speech send to him by the council of ministers for formal approval.

Mr. Khan is scheduled to deliver the speech on behalf of the government when the Assembly convenes for the budget session on January 31.

Informed sources said Mr. Khan strongly felt after perusing the draft that the government's policy statement should stress on development issues and not dwell on matters that could potentially deteriorate relations between the State and the Centre.

They said Mr. Khan had also flagged the point that the Supreme Court was considering the constitutional validity of the law. Hence, the Governor felt that any public discussion on the CAA, particularly in the Assembly, might not be in order. Sources said Mr. Khan had conveyed his views to the government in writing and awaited a reply.

Mr. Khan, later, appeared to confirm the report that he was at odds with the elements about the CAA in the policy address prepared for him by the government. When asked by reporters whether he had instructed the government to remove the points from the draft policy statement, Mr. Khan said: “I have advised the government. Now I will wait for a response. I am not going to discuss these issues with the media. But, if a stage comes when these things are not forthcoming, I will certainly let you know.”

The wrangling over the policy address is the latest chapter in the simmering differences of opinion between the Raj Bhavan and the government on the CAA. Mr .Khan had said the government had committed an unlawful act when it appealed the CAA in the Supreme Court.

Earlier, Mr. Khan had said the Assembly had overstepped its constitutional bounds and jurisdiction by passing a resolution calling for the repeal of the CAA. The statements had opened Mr. Khan to criticism that he was using the Governor’s office to play politics at the behest of the BJP-led Centre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/governor-differs-with-draft-policy-address/article30653402.ece
182,2020/01/25,Pressing need to rein in houseboats flouting rules,"Amidst the recurring accidents involving houseboats and concerns over non-compliance with rules, there is a renewed call for the constitution of an authority for regulating the sector.

On Thursday, 16 people, including 13 tourists and three crew members, had a miraculous escape after the houseboat they were cruising caught fire near Pathiramanal island. A probe by Ports Department, the licensing authority, revealed that the houseboat had been operating in total disregard for the rules — without a registration and mandatory licence, clearances and safety equipment.

According to officials, of the total 1,500 houseboats plying in Alappuzha backwaters, nearly half of them operate without registration and mandatory licence.

Sources said a lack of regulation and oversight, mostly in the absence of coordination among government departments and agencies, was pushing the backwater tourism sector into disarray.

“The sector is ruled by several departments. The role of the tourism department is confined to facilitating guests. But, other departments are playing a more dominant role. While, the Ports Department is responsible for registration and issuing licence, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board is the authority for issuing pollution-related clearance. The police have a responsibility to ensure houseboats crew are not working under the influence of alcohol, among other things. However, in the absence of coordination among the departments, there is hardly any regulation taking place in the sector. This is leading to a total disregard for rules on the part of houseboat operators,” said an official with the Tourism Department.

The official said the formation of a district-level regulatory authority with members drawn from the district administration, Ports, Tourism, KSPCB, police, Fire and Rescue Services among others would help to regulate, coordinate actions and bring decorum in the sector. “Alappuzha backwaters is home to the highest number of houseboats in the State. A proposal for such as authority has been made a few years ago, but it remains on paper,” the official added.

When contacted, an official with the Ports Department said lack of power and staff crunch were preventing them from acting tough against the erring houseboats. “Couple of years ago, we have submitted a proposal to the government for the constitution of an enforcement wing under a Deputy Superintendent of Police to carry out patrolling in inland waters for ensuring the safety of the passengers on board including at night halt centres. But,nothing has come to fruition,” the official added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/pressing-need-to-rein-in-houseboats-flouting-rules/article30653166.ece
183,2020/01/25,Bishop Franco files discharge petition,"In a new turn of events, Bishop Franco Mulakkal who is facing charges of raping a nun on Saturday, moved a petition at the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Kottayam, seeking to discharge him as an accused in the case.

In the petition, the Bishop requested the court to discharge him from the case without even stepping into the hearing as the nun fabricated a story out of her personal grudge to him. He stated the prosecution witnesses were not trustworthy and there was no cogent evidence in the entire episode.

The petition was moved even as the court was scheduled to commence preliminary hearing on charges against him. Based on the petition, judge G. Gopakumar posted the case to February 4 for further hearing.

Meanwhile, the victim’s aides alleged that the petition was part of delaying tactics by the accused to influence the witnesses.

The court had to postpone the hearing on the charges earlier this month after the accused had submitted an excuse petition for not appearing before it. While the Bishop’s counsel sought one month’s time to commence the hearing, the court rejected the plea and posted the hearing for Saturday.

Bishop Franco had appeared before the court on November 30 and had secured extension for his bail.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/franco-moves-discharge-petition/article30653045.ece
184,2020/01/25,KC(M) factions’ tussle for Kuttanad rages on,"The tussle between two factions in the Kerala Congress (M) for the Kuttanad Assembly seat reached a flash point on Saturday with the Jose K. Mani faction lodging a complaint to the United Democratic Front (UDF) convener against the party working chairman P.J. Joseph for proposing to field his aide Jacob Abraham as the front's candidate.

‘‘Mr. Joseph made the proposal without holding any consultations and it clearly violates the coalition protocol. The seat belongs to the Jose faction and there is no question of giving it up,’’ said Stephen George, office secretary of the KC(M) Jose faction who filed the complaint.

The Jose faction has constituted a subcommittee to identify a suitable candidate. Though a couple of names are under its active consideration, Shaiju Kandakkudy is regarded as the front runner.

Turning down the Jose faction's claim to the seat, Mr. Joseph had stated the other day that Mr. Abraham, who lost the previous election to the late Thomas Chandy of the Left Democratic Front, is at the forefront of the Opposition UDF's probable candidates.

""Jacob Abraham lost the fight by a slender margin of 4,891 votes. This time, the UDF will certainly win the election,"" said Mr. Joseph, while accusing Mr. Mani of attempting to ruin its prospects as he had done in Pala, where the party lost the recent byelection after party patriarch K.M. Mani held it for 54 years.

The UDF is yet to respond to the claims of the factions. Political observers say it is likely that the Congress would take over the seat if the fight continues.

186,2020/01/25,LDF campaign seems to attain its target,"As the Left Democratic Front (LDF) campaign against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) enters a crucial phase with the formation of a human chain across the State at 4 p.m. on Sunday, the front has to a great extent succeeded in enhancing the clout it wields among the minorities and make a dent in the United Democratic Front (UDF) camp.

In addition to a number of socio-political and cultural bodies, a host Muslim organisations are understood to have volunteered to join the human chain. Even some denominations of the Christian community such as the Syro Malabar and Latin churches, that had initially reserved their responses to the Act, have adopted a public stance in spite of their political differences, to join the chain as a symbol of united resistance.

Despite the front leaders reiterating that the united movement need not be construed as a prelude to the formation of an electoral front, it triggered serious dissensions within the Congress and among the UDF allies on conducting joint protests.

The organisational machinery of the LDF had reached out to the minorities who had expressed their allegiance to the UDF in the Lok Sabha elections by projecting it as the champion of their cause in fighting the Centre, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Sangh Parivar organisations.

The failure of the UDF in working out a strong and focussed course of action had drawn the displeasure of even the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) which went ahead in saying that joint protests cannot be ruled out. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy too had echoed similar opinion in due course.

The abortive attempts of the BJP to win over the minorities and launch a pro-CAA campaign under the leadership of Union Ministers worked to the advantage of the LDF that had been sustaining the tempo of the movement till it culminated in the human chain.

Whether such efforts of the LDF in mobilising mass support in the name of CAA will transform into electoral gains in the local body elections or the Assembly poll scheduled to be held early next year remain to be seen.

But the string of agitations, the resolution passed by the Assembly, and similar initiatives have put the LDF on a safe ground for the time being.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ldf-campaign-seems-to-attain-its-target/article30652823.ece
187,2020/01/25,UDF plans resolution to recall Governor,"The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) has sought the permission of Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan to introduce a resolution in the Assembly urging the President to recall Governor Arif Mohammad Khan for ‘violating’ all democratic principles and ‘publicly questioning’ the pride of the Assembly which passed a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said on Saturday that the Governor had crossed a line by terming the resolution ‘illegal and against the Constitution.’ The Assembly has every right to air an opinion on any Central legislation as it is emblematic of the collective will of the people.

Mr. Khan should have communicated his dissent in writing to the Assembly rather than ‘standing in front of a mike and belittling the House,’ he said.

The Opposition challenged the government to support the resolution at the potential risk of precipitating a Constitutional crisis. The UDF’s move could present a legal and political minefield for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government and raise questions about its resolve in countering the alleged trespass against the secular spirit of the Constitution.

Mr. Chennithala sought permission to introduce a substantive motion under Rule 284 (5) of the legislative business. The proposal is widely viewed as part of a procedure for impeachment of persons who hold high office.

Governor’s response

However, the Governor appears unfazed. He told reporters that he welcomed the move. “Everyone is entitled to their opinion. I am the constitutional head of the State. It is my duty to advice, counsel, encourage and warn the government. It is part of my duty as per the Constitution and as interpreted by the Supreme Court,” he told media on the sidelines of a programme here.

On reports that the Governor had expressed discontent over the reported mention of the anti-CAA resolution passed by the Assembly in the policy address to be read out by him on the first day of the budget session, Mr. Khan said he had just informed the government on how to ‘improve the content of the documents’ submitted to him.

The Speaker said he viewed the Opposition’s proposal with utmost gravity.

In his plea filed before the Additional District and Sessions Court I, Mulakkal claimed that prima facie there was no case to frame charges against him.

The trial court adjourned the matter to February 4 for the prosecution to file its objection to the plea filed by the Bishop, accused of raping and sexually assaulting a nun of the same diocese.

The Bishop filed the discharge plea as the Court was supposed to commence the preliminary hearing on charges on Saturday.

However, he was not present in the Court.

The case is based on a complaint filed against the bishop by the nun. In her complaint to the police in June 2018, the nun had alleged that she was subjected to sexual abuse by the Bishop during the period of 2014 and 2016.

189,2020/01/25,Kerala Opposition to move Assembly resolution to recall Governor Arif Mohammad Khan,"The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) Opposition in Kerala has sought the permission of the Assembly Speaker to introduce a resolution in the House to urge the President of India to recall Governor Arif Mohammad Khan.

Opposition Leader Ramesh Chennithala said Mr. Khan had unfairly criticised the Assembly for passing a unanimous resolution urging the Centre to repeal the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which he said was deeply prejudicial to Muslims and undermined the secular spirit of the Constitution.

Mr. Chennithala said the Governor had crossed the line by stating that the Assembly had no business passing an opinion on a Central law.

Mr. Khan had publicly declared the unanimous resolution of the House as ""illegal and against the Constitution"".

""The Assembly has every right to pass an opinion on any Central legislation. The House is emblematic of the collective will of the people. Mr. Khan should have communicated his dissent in writing to the Assembly. It was 'unbecoming' of the Governor to 'stand in front of a mike and belittle the House',"" Mr. Chennithala said.

He taunted the government with the allegation that Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan was ""increasingly afraid"" of the Governor and the Centre.

The UDF's move could present a legal minefield for the ruling LDF Government. Mr. Chennithala has pointedly moved for permission to introduce a substantive motion under rule 284 (5).

The motion, if allowed, empowered the House to discuss the conduct of persons in high authority. The proposal is widely viewed as part of a procedure for impeachment of persons who hold high office.

The move also adds a new dimension to the ongoing political tug-of-war between Mr. Khan and the government over the State's decision to appeal the CAA in the Supreme Court ""without the Governor's knowledge"".

190,2020/01/25,Kerala HC asks schools to desist from imparting religious study without govt. permission,"In a significant verdict, the Kerala High Court on Friday directed the State government to issue an order directing all recognised private schools in the State to desist from imparting religious instruction or religious study without the permission of the government.

In his order, Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque said the government can initiate action for closure and de-recognition of the schools if they are found violating the order.

The court issued the order while declining a plea challenging the State’s action of closing down a school on the premise that it promotes exclusive religious instruction and amidst only students from a particular community, thereby posing threat to the secular fabric of society.

The court observed that the Constitution accords special protection to the minorities under Article 25, Article 29 and Article 30.

Cultural rights, as protected under Article 29, would include nature of education as well, it said.

The right to establish and administer educational institutions under Article 30 would also include the right to choice of education, subject to any restriction imposed under law, the court said.

“However, these rights do not extend to dilute the secular nature of education. These rights cannot override the basic values of the Constitution. It can be exercised only in consistent with the fundamental values of the Constitution,” it said.

Noting that the status of minority institutions in relation to imparting elementary education is relatable to State function, the high court said, “minority institutions, therefore, cannot shrug off their role as State functionaries and protect sectarian education under the garb of Articles 29 and 30.”

The court said Article 21A and the Right to Education Act of compulsory elementary education do not conceive the idea of education beyond the realm of secular activity of the State.

“If minority institutions are given free hand to promote religion, it would result in denial of admission to such schools based on religion,” the court said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/education/vu8o4a/article25143717.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02EPBSMENTORING2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-hc-asks-schools-to-desist-from-imparting-religious-study-without-govt-permission/article30650649.ece

The Manjeshwar police arrested Ayesha (43), and a distant relative, Mohammed Haneefa (34), on the charge of murdering her husband, Ismail (52), at Kidambadi in Vorkady grama panchayat.

According to Manjeshwar station house officer Dinesh A.V., besides the two arrested, there were two more accused in the case. Both were absconding, he said.

On January 20, Ismail was found dead in the house at Kidambadi, a village bordering Karnataka. Ayesha reportedly told neighbours that Ismail had died of heart attack.

However, some neighbours found injury marks on the neck when the family was getting the body ready for the funeral, the police said.

The neighbours called the police after they suspected foul play. Following an autopsy at the Pariyaram Medical College Hospital, it was confirmed that he had been strangled.

In the following investigation, it was found that Ayesh had planned the murder for which she allegedly hired two persons. She allegedly plotted with Haneefa to kill him. For this, they hired two woodcutters for the job, said the officer.

“On the day of murder, Ayesha opened the door for the two men and they strangled Ismail in his sleep,” Mr. Dinesh said.

194,2020/01/25,Allegation of denying water to families refuted,"The allegations of denying drinking water to a few families of Cherukunnu Dalit Colony at Payinkannu in Kuttippuram panchayat for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) have been found to be false.

The police said here on Friday that the allegations were made by vested interests with the intention of creating communal embitterment in society. Zainuddin, who was accused of discontinuing the drinking water he provided to his Hindu neighbours, said that he had never denied them water.

Mr. Zainuddin, who did not have a well of his own, said that he had told his neighbours to minimise the use because of water shortage and other technical difficulties in pumping water from another man’s borewell.

Mr. Zainuddin had been depending on his neighbour Moideen Kutty alias Moidutty’s borewell for water ever since he started living at Payinkannur. About four months ago, officials of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) raised objections over the use of the borewell for non-agricultural purposes.

The Jalanidhi drinking water scheme under the block panchayat had become dysfunctional over eight months ago, depriving the 22 Dalit families of the Cherukunnu colony of their drinking water. Since then, all of them were dependent on Mr. Moidutty and Mr. Zainuddin.

When Mr. Moidutty pointed out the KSEB objections, some of the Dalit families stopped taking water from his house. All of the 22 families began depending on the tank maintained by Mr. Zainuddin.

Mr. Zainuddin said that he had told his neighbours to limit the use of water over a week ago. Three of the families from the colony took part in a pro-CAA meeting convened by the BJP at Valanchery on January 17.

However, a campaign soon shaped up alleging denial of drinking water to the Hindu families for supporting the CAA.

Mr. Zainuddin said that his neighbours used to take water from his tank until two days ago even when the campaign against him was taking shape. He said he would never say no to drinking water to anyone.

Meanwhile, some colony residents, seeking anonymity, said that Mr. Zainuddin’s wife had confided in them that there had been pressure on their family to discontinue water to their neighbours.

BJP district president Ravi Thelath, while admitting what Mr. Zainuddin did was an act of kindness, said that there had been pressure on his family to discontinue water to his neighbours. But Mr. Zainuddin denied it.

Meanwhile, the district administration, the police and the revenue department said they would ensure water for the colony within a week.

“It’s not a question of denying water. The issue is that there is no water in the colony,” said a senior revenue officer.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/allegation-of-denying-water-to-families-refuted/article30647938.ece
195,2020/01/25,HC flays exclusive religious instruction in schools,"A school that requires recognition from the State government under the Right to Education (RTE) Act does not have the right to impart religious instruction of one religion in preference to other religions as it is discharging a public function, the Kerala High Court said on Friday.

Justice A. Mohammed Mustaque gave the ruling on a petition filed by the Hidaya Educational and Charitable Trust, Thiruvananthapuram, challenging the government’s decision to close down the school allegedly for promoting exclusive religious instruction.

Exclusivism or preference of one religion over others by the State or public functionaries or private bodies, while discharging public functions, strikes at the very root of the fundamental values of the Constitution, especially secularism. It negates neutrality, promotes discrimination, and denies equal treatment. Private schools that are required to have recognition from the State must not promote one religion over others. The exclusive promotion of a particular religion by private educational institutions defies the secular character of the Constitution and denies constitutional value and morality, the court said.

Differentiating between the right of a person or a group and that of a group discharging public function, the court said an individual or a group or a denomination has the freedom to express and to promote and practise their religion.

Pluralist society

That freedom is not available to a private body while discharging a public function. In a pluralist society like India, which accepts secularism as the basic norm in governing secular activities, including education, there cannot be any difficulty in imparting religious instruction or study based on religious pluralism. What is prohibited is exclusivism. Educational institutions can impart religious instruction based on religious pluralism instead of exclusivism, it observed.

The rights of minorities under the Constitution do not allow them to dilute the secular nature of education, or override the basic values of the Constitution, it said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hc-flays-exclusive-religious-instruction-in-schools/article30647629.ece
196,2020/01/25,"Bombay’s untold story, written in red","Bombay Sketches, the winner of the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi’s pravasi amateur drama competition, is a theatrical illustration that connects the modern Mumbai to its past.

The play, performed by the New Bombay Keraleeya Samaj at the International Theatre Festival of Kerala (ITFoK), reveals the socio-cultural and political transformation of the city. It tells the untold pains and sighs of the downtrodden thrown out of their land and exploited and about the women who are reduced to mere commodities.

Major themes

It deals with the stories of countless workers who came in search of better life and ended up in gullies of the city begging for a living, about thousands of mill workers left jobless in the onslaught of corporatisation, underworld gangs, and the bar dancers pushed to poverty and abuse once bars were closed.

However, nothing can stop the life in Bombay, which even forgets the violent bomb blasts. It is the mafia, slums, and corruption that make the city. That is why Bombay is a synonym of red. Bombay Sketches is a few illustrations drawn by that blood. It represents the red of the bloodstains of the exploited, the red of the people who are displaced.

Direct format

Directed by K.S. Prasanth Narayanan, the play develops in a very simple, direct format.

“Just as important as to how a play communicates, it is also important as to what is being communicated. The language of presentation should be simple, yet leave enough scope for interpretation,” says the director.

“The scenes in Bombay Sketches explore the possibilities of art, meandering from Raja Ravi Varma to Picasso and Richard Prince, as art walks ahead of us. Seen here is a confluence of simplicity of expression and naturality. Both silence and cacophony equally define Bombay. When the dramatist talks of the angst of wasted, devastated lives, his language becomes that of the spirit,” Mr. Narayanan points out.

Established in 1984, the New Bombay Keraleeya Samaj is a socio-cultural organisation in Navi Mumbai. The script of the play is by Keli Ramachachandran, an active presence in the field of performing arts, both visual and aural. He is a founder-member and principal mentor of Keli, a 27-year-old Mumbai-based cultural organisation.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/x07b30/article30647327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvtrfolk,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bombays-untold-story-written-in-red/article30647328.ece
197,2020/01/25,‘Industrialised’ PSLV by 2022,"The first Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) fully built by the industry will be rolled out in 2022, K. Sivan, Chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), said on Friday.

Mr. Sivan was speaking after accepting the Sree Chithira Thirunal National Award - 2019 from Governor Arif Mohammad Khan. “Very soon, the PSLV will be manufactured by the industry as a whole product,” he said. The ISRO has announced plans to outsource the PSLV to the industry so that it can focus on other research areas and important missions.

Developmental flight

The first developmental flight of the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is expected in April this year, he said. This mission will be carried out from Sriharikota. The process of acquiring 2,300 acres at Kulasekharapattanam in southern Tamil Nadu for establishing a launch facility for the SSLV is in progress, he added.

“The SSLV is conceived as a potential low-cost access to space. It will cater to the large number of small satellite launch requirements. Launching from Sriharikota would, however, hamper regular launches,” he explained the reason for establishing the new launch pad.

Astronauts for the Gaganyaan mission were picked after rigorous medical and psychological screening, Mr. Sivan said. “A series of tests are planned in 2020 to validate the design and engineering aspects of the launch vehicle systems.”

200,2020/01/25,Murali Sharma: It’s taken me 30 years to reach this stage,"It’s been two weeks since the release of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (ALVP), and actor Murali Sharma finds himself answering more phone calls and meeting appreciative strangers during his morning walk than ever before. “I walk for an hour each day, now my walk extends to an hour and 45 minutes, because people stop me on the way. They don’t just tell me that they liked the film or my performance, they discuss specific scenes,” says the actor, terming this overwhelming response “exhilarating”. He lends an ear to anyone who wants to talk or click a photograph and says that’s the least he can do to thank people.

ALVP, says Murali Sharma, has left him with “an inner joy” of having pulled off a tough character. He played the bad dad Valmiki, walking with a limp and wearing a scowl. “Some people told me that by interval, they wanted to finish me off,” laughs the actor.

All through the conversation, Murali Sharma appreciates director Trivikram Srinivas and says he surrendered to his vision and followed instructions. He remembers their first meeting at a five star hotel when the story was narrated to him: “He said let’s make a happy film. I loved the story and was blown by the magnitude of my character and felt thankful that I was chosen to play it.”

Murali Sharma entered Telugu cinema with Athidi (2007) and won the Nandi Award for Best Villain. More films followed. Director Maruthi presented him in a new light as the father character Panduranga Rao in the comedy Bhale Bhale Magadivoy (2015). “Since then, fortunately I’ve been getting a variety of well written parts. I too put in some effort to see that I don’t get typecast in typical father roles. But I’ve been lucky. There are many films I hold dear to me, like Ninnu Kori (2016) for example,” he says, adding, “I’ve done more than 175 films. It’s taken me 30 years in cinema to reach this stage.”

Looking back at how the Valmiki character took shape, Murali Sharma recalls discussing the nuances with Trivikram: “Valmiki has a crooked bent of mind and I felt that has to reflect in his physicality as well. We first see him in the hospital where something happens and he ends up limping. That limp stays with him and is a reminder of that incident. Even later in the house scenes when he is with Buntu (Allu Arjun), Valmiki rests his leg on a stool and massages it.”

To ensure that he got the gait correct, Murali Sharma recalls walking from the vanity van to the shooting spot with a limp. There were times he went overboard with the limp or the peculiar jaw angle and Trivikram would tweak it. “He (Trivikram) ensured that I didn’t make a caricature of Valmiki. He kept a sharp eye on each one of us, and was still extremely patient and answered all our questions. It all fell in place beautifully.”

Murali Sharma makes a special mention of Allu Arjun and calls him “a dangerously hardworking actor” and says “he didn’t behave like a star on the sets; he was like Bantu (his character).”

The veteran actor is no longer active on social media and prefers it that way. Work and family are priority and he cherishes the process of enacting different characters: “More than winning, I enjoy the process of preparing to win.” Before he winds up, he talks about his father who passed away a year ago: “He would be so happy when people called and talked about my work to him. I miss him so much today.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/f29lbu/article30651327.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Murali-Sharma-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/murali-sharma-discusses-the-making-of-his-character-valmiki-in-ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-and-heaps-praises-on-trivikram-srinivas-and-allu-arjun/article30651329.ece
201,2020/01/25,‘Judy’ movie review: Renée Zellweger shines in this stunning biopic of an enigmatic star,"When Judy Garland (Renée Zellweger) is asked if she takes anything for depression, a dry, bored voice replies, “Four husbands. Didn’t work.” The biting albeit self-deprecating wit, offers a shred of a glimpse into the tragic life of one of the greatest entertainers that ever lived. Zellweger portrays Garland as never fully intent on revealing a vulnerability to the world, that’s unfortunately on display for everyone to see.

In Judy, director Rupert Goold brings the West End and Broadway play End of the Rainbow to the big screen on Zellweger’s slender but very able shoulders. The film recounts the last year of the starlet’s life, when at the age of 47 — broke, financially and physically — Garland had to make her way to London to earn enough money to get her children back from an ex-husband. Through flashbacks, Goold crafts a narrative of Garland’s troubled childhood. We see the strain substance abuse takes on a young mind and body; the exploitation and manipulation rampant in show business that’s only slightly abated today, and the destruction it can wreak on a fragile spirit.

Judy Director: Rupert Goold

Cast: Renée Zellweger, Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, Rufus Sewell, Michael Gambon

Storyline: Judy Garland is broke and loses her kids to her ex-husband. The only option is a move to London

At present in 1968, Garland is unemployable, unreliable, inebriated or intoxicated most of the time, temperamental, depressed and anxious. But all of this is conveyed through a performance of a lifetime by Zellweger with every eyebrow raise, facial twitch, nervous tick and an ever-so-slight hunch — as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, Louis B. Mayer caller her ‘My little hunchback’.

Though her vocal prowess can’t quite match Garland’s range, Zellweger acts her heart out, becoming the Wizard of Oz star. The actor embodies Garland’s vulnerability, sadness and wistfulness through and through. The depth of this performance peaks at a long-shot number at London’s Talk of the Town club. After the adrenaline-fuelled show, Garland’s despondent in her changing room, lamenting, “What if I can’t do it again?” As the protagonist in the film admits, she’s Judy Garland for only one hour a night. The rest of the time, it’s evident she’s just as lost and hungry for love like the rest of us.

Judy is Zellweger’s exclusive playground, overshadowing every other character, even the impressive assistant Rosalyn Wilder who Jessie Buckley plays with brilliant clipped restraint. There’s a myopic focus on the last few months of Garland’s life with insufficient context to architect a well-rounded biopic. Flashback snippets alone cannot do justice to an illustrious through fraught life like Garland’s. But Zellweger overcomes any and all faults, eliciting admiration, empathy and love for a star who is still as enigmatic five decades after her death.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/hcz07l/article30651035.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25bm-pg2-Judy-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/judy-movie-review-rene-zellweger-shines-in-this-stunning-biopic-of-an-enigmatic-star/article30651036.ece
202,2020/01/25,‘Taana’ movie review: This Vaibhav-starrer is a dull and messy affair,"Set in Vellore, Taana opens with an animated stretch or a history lesson on the backstory of Taanakaran, who was a guardian angel to the country folks centuries before the Police Department came into existence. It’s an annual ritual to organise festivities in the village to celebrate the glory of Taanakaran, provided there’s at least one serving police officer in Taanakaran’s family. It’s been more than 20 years since the village had festivals, since the last standing police officer had died and his son, Pandiaraj, has been rejected in police recruitment, on the grounds of physical fitness (lack of height).

To reaffirm his kinship and to throw light on the village, Pandiaraj hopes to realise his dream of becoming a cop through his son, Sakthivel (Vaibhav). But his dreams are vanquished when he comes to know of his son’s disorder, when the latter is asked to speak at a school function. We are told that Sakthi has a rather peculiar but completely believable disorder called: puberphonia. I think I blinked a couple of times... not at the mention of the word, but the way it was said. Whenever Sakthi comes remotely close to exertion or anxiety attack, his vocal chords begin to sound like a female. Now imagine a police officer looking all tough and astute, but sounds like a TV serial mom when he opens his mouth. It’s an interesting line to ponder over.

Taana Cast: Vaibhav, Nandita Sweta, Yogi Babu and Pandiaraj

Director: Yuvraj Subramani

Storyline: Sakthivel has to join the police force, to safeguard his family’s lineage. The catch? He has puberphonia

Long before Yuvaraj could even sense a potential in this premise, Ayushmann Kuranna created a genre named after him in Bollywood. But what limits Taana from becoming a moderately engaging movie is the lack of charm and humour — which was evident in the Kuranna brand of evoking laughter from a social taboo, in movies such as Dream Girl, Bala and his upcoming Shubh Mangal Zayada Saavdhan.

It must have been tempting for Yuvaraj to invent absurd scenarios with the protagonist’s perceived disorder, to draw humour from the characters. Even if it’s a little convenient way of handling things, that would have been a far better approach. But Yuvaraj seems to be completely dissociated with his own material that he envisioned in the first place. It begins with the story of a son fulfilling the wishes of his father to become a police officer — something along the lines of Kireedam. But it suddenly shifts gear to establish a physical disorder. When you think Sakthivel’s disorder is going to take centre-stage, you are given a sleeping pill in the form of romance. Then it ventures into a senior police officer’s ego, exposing the corrupt nature of loan sharks. A supporting character is designed to trigger a dramatic point for the hero’s journey. However, there are no signs for this, and her character appears to be written with a shallow understanding of how Tamil cinema’s entertainers work.

If someone were to write a book on the merits of the current Government, it would look as directionless as Taana’s screenplay. Of course, I understand that these events are tied together while being mounted on the backdrop of Taanakaran. The resultant mixture, however, is a mess.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/j35vcn/article30650982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/taana,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/taana-movie-review-this-vaibhav-starrer-is-a-dull-and-messy-affair/article30650983.ece

205,2020/01/25,Madras University will not recognise post-doctoral research work from foreign institutions while recruiting faculty,"The University of Madras has decided not to recognise post-doctoral research experience from foreign institutions and research laboratories while recruiting faculty, citing University Grants Commission Regulations. However, a former professor has questioned the decision.​

​Retired professor G. Shanmugam has written to the Chancellor-Governor stating that the university has called for applications for 32 faculty positions, including assistant and associate professors by January 27. While the university has, in its guidelines, asked candidates to furnish all details regarding teaching/research and post-doctoral research experience obtained from universities/research institutions in different countries, it has also stated that research work done abroad would not be counted for deciding the minimum teaching/research experience required for the post.​

​Prof. Shanmugam contended that this rule prevented “many bright candidates involved in post-doctoral research work” from applying. He termed it “untenable” and urged the university re-examine its decision so that candidates doing research abroad could also apply.​

​A senior university official said the information on work experience as a post-doctoral fellow is sought to judge how the candidates had spent their time after their Ph.D. “People take up post-doctoral work either in India or abroad but the UGC does not say that it can be counted as teaching experience. A post-doctoral fellow would have worked in the best institutions abroad out of their own interest,” he said.​

​Vice Chancellor P. Duraisamy said: “The UGC Regulation 2018 Section 10.0, which is uploaded in the University website, provides detailed regulations relating to counting of past services relating to research experience for new recruitment. We have clarified and also uploaded this regulation as part of our application procedure. We follow the above regulation relating to counting of past services for essential qualification requirement. There is nothing wrong in getting information on research experience at doctoral or post-doctoral level. There is no contraction or confusion in the call for application,” he said.​

Speaking to The Hindu on the sidelines of the event, he said that they were planning to collaborate on sharing of findings.

Kerala Culture Minister A.K. Balan described Tamil as the mother and Malayalam as her favourite son. He explained how Tamil Nadu had helped many Keralites grow and outlined the cultural similarities between the two States.

“We planned to hold this programme earlier, but due to various reasons we could not,” he said. The Ministers honoured 10 personalities who excelled in art, literature and socio-cultural felds.

210,2020/01/25,"1,000-year-old Chola monument remains obscure","National Tourism Day is observed every year on January 25. This year, there has been no sign of any programmes being organised at the memorial of King Rajendra Chola I (CE 1014-1044), located at Brahmadesam village in Tiruvannamalai district.

Brahmadesam is accessible from Vembakkam as well as Kancheepuram. A road from Ocheri on Chennai-Bengaluru National Highway leads to the monument. Chandramouleeswarar Temple inside the historic memorial for King Rajendra Chola I, which is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India, tells the story of the great Chola ruler. The stone inscriptions at the temple, with a Sivalinga and a diminishing oil lamp, are a rich source of information on the Chola king, who succeeded Rajaraja Chola I who built the Big Temple at Thanjavur.

Barring a few people rearing cattle, the monument does not attract any visitor. There is a lone security guard who lives in a nearby village. The monument has inscriptions that explain the reign of Chola kings and their followers, according to historians who lament lack of maintenance at the site.

According to epigraphs and records, Rajendra Chola I died at Brahmadesam and this information is recorded in an inscription by his son Rajadhiraja Chola I. The inscription states that Rajendra Chola's queen Viramadevi committed “sati” upon her husband’s death and her remains were interred in the same tomb as the king at Brahmadesam.

Viramadevi’s brother Madhuranthakan Parakesari Velan, who was the general of Rajendra Chola's army, built a watershed in memory of his sister.

“Such information can make the youth curious about knowing history and culture of our country,” said S. Balamurugan, secretary of Tiruvannamalai District Historical Research Centre.

He said there were several historic places in Tiruvannamalai district such as Mamandur and Koozhamandal on Kancheepuram-Perunagar-Vandavasi Road that needed to be developed as a tourists attraction.

Lack of awareness

Monthly heritage walks by students and cultural programmes at the sites with CSR funds could fetch revenue for Tourism Department.

Signboards indicating the location of these monuments should be put up on different roads leading to Brahmadesam or any other historic places of importance to draw visitors and spread the message of such historic importance places, Mr. Balamurugan suggested.

S. Paarivallal from from Ocheri said a handful of vehicles pass through his house to the Rajendra Chola’s memorial on weekends. As a result, real estate business has thrived in the area but there has been no improvement made to the memorial, he lamented.

There were a number of other people from Tiruvannamalai district who wanted the district administration to joint hands with Tourism Department to organise heritage tours to these historically important places.

211,2020/01/25,"CPI(M) slams board exams for classes 5, 8","CPI (M) state secretary K. Balakrishnan slammed the Tamil Nadu government for announcing board exams for students of Classes 5 and 8, and called upon students, youngsters and everyone in the State to raise a voice of condemnation.

In a statement, Mr. Balakrishnan said even before the Centre decided the National Education Policy, the Tamil Nadu government has jumped the gun to announce public exams for students of classes 5 and 8.

“This announcement has shocked the students and parents and will cause mental agony and confusion to students.” he added.

Although there are many ways to enhance the ability of students, the Tamil Nadu government has resorted to this regressive step,” he said. The move will not bring any advantages to enhancing the educational capabilities of students, he added.

Mr. Balakrishnan said if a student failed the exams, it will lead them to drop out of school. ""Especially students from rural areas, poor students, girls will be affected through this. It is due to this that the board exams are conducted only on tenth standard,"" he said and demanded the government to withdraw the announcement..",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cpim-slams-board-exams-for-classes-5-8/article30647704.ece
212,2020/01/25,Opinion divided on actor’s remarks on Periyar,"Opinion is divided on whether veteran actor Rajinikanth’s observations on the Superstition Eradication Conference organised by the Dravidar Kazhagam in Salem in 1971 , which have sparked a political storm, were made to kickstart his political career.

At the 50th anniversary of Tamil journal Thuglak about 10 days ago, the actor had claimed that at the rally, attended by social reformer “Periyar” E.V. Ramasamy, the images of Lord Rama and his consort were paraded in the nude with a garland of footwear. He stood by his remarks later.

K. Balakrishnan, secretary of the State unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said that although there were many aspects to be highlighted in favour of the journal and its founder, Cho S. Ramaswamy, Mr. Rajiniknath’s views appeared to give the impression that he had a “specific political agenda” which would suit that of the RSS-BJP, given their “appeal” to Hindus. “What is the necessity to talk about Periyar when he was not a subject matter? This is surprising at a time when there are issues such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and violence at the JNU campus that are rocking the country,” the CPI(M) leader asked.

However, ‘Tamilaruvi’ Manian, founder of the Gandhi Makkal Iyakkam and a friend of the actor, asserted that Mr. Rajinikanth did not make the statements with any political motive.

“There is no need for him to talk communally,” he said.

The actor will make known his stand on a variety of issues, once he starts his party, probably in April, he said.

Pointing out that minorities and Dalits constitute a “majority” of Mr. Rajnikanth’s fans, Mr Manian said the actor respects religious sentiments of all and he is for all.

Expressing opinion in his personal capacity, B.S. Gnanadesikan, senior vice-president of the Tamil Maanila Congress, said the actor did not comment adversely on EVR or his programme of social reforms. “It is not acceptable to issue statements or hold demonstrations against him,” Mr. Gnanadesikan added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/bnozdk/article30647683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THRAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/opinion-divided-on-actors-remarks-on-periyar/article30647684.ece
213,2020/01/25,HC frowns upon those who spread canards on social media,"Expressing displeasure over the growing trend of baseless defamatory comments made in the social media against constitutional functionaries and those holding high posts in the Centre as well as State government, the Madras High Court on Friday directed the police department to explain whether any mechanism was in place to deal with such issues.

Justice M. Dhandapani issued the direction while hearing a bail petition filed by A. Maruthachalam, 59, of Kattamapatti in Coimbatore district who had been arrested by Cyber Crime Cell of Central Crime Branch police in Chennai for uploading a video on YouTube accusing a High Court judge and an advocate of having taken ₹100 cr. as bribe.

The petitioner was arrested on November 20 and lodged in the Central prison at Puzhal near here on the basis of a complaint lodged by a lawyer practising in the High Court. The complainant had reportedly come across the video on YouTube and was shocked to find the accused having levelled unsubstantiated allegations against the judge and the advocate based in Coimbatore.

Disapproving of such conduct by the petitioner as well as many others, Justice Dhandapani pointed out that those who spread lies on the social media do not spare even the family members of constitutional functionaries and high dignitaries. He was of the view that the police should put in place some mechanism to take action against such people.

After adjourning further hearing on the bail petition to January 29, the judge directed the petitioner too to file an affidavit by then with an undertaking that he shall not indulge in such activities in the future.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-frowns-upon-those-who-spread-canards-on-social-media/article30647673.ece
214,2020/01/25,Petitions to register FIRs against Rajini withdrawn,"The Madras High Court on Friday permitted two office-bearers of the Dravidar Viduthalai Kazhagam (DVK), from Chennai and Coimbatore, to withdraw the petitions they had filed seeking registration of First Information Reports (FIRs) against actor Rajinikanth over a speech he had made regarding a 1971 incident involving Dravidar Kazhagam founder E.V. Ramasamy alias Periyar.

Justice P. Rajamanickam allowed the petitioners’ counsel to take back their cases and granted them liberty to approach the court after exhausting other legal remedies.

The decision was taken after the judge concurred with State Public Prosecutor (SPP) A. Natarajan that the complainants had rushed to the court without following elaborate procedures established under law.

The SPP pointed out that a Division Bench of Justices M.M. Sundresh and N. Sathish Kumar had on September 20, 2018 categorically held that every other complainant could not approach the High Court and seek a direction to invoke its inherent powers under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for ordering registration of an FIR.

The Bench had pointed out that a complainant, aggrieved over the refusal on the part of an officer in charge of a police station to register a FIR, should first approach the jurisdictional Superintendent or Commissioner of Police. If the complainant does not get remedy, the jurisdictional judicial magistrate should be approached under Section 156(3) of the Cr.P.C.

Exceptional cases

The Division Bench had made it clear that complainants could bypass the procedure contemplated under Section 156(3) and directly approach the High Court under Section 482 only in exceptional and rarest of rare cases.

Even in such rare cases, the complainants could approach the High Court only after waiting for 15 days from the date when they had lodged the complaint with the Inspector of Police concerned.

Despite such authoritative pronouncement by the Division Bench, the present petitioners, R. Umapathy and M. Nehrudoss, of the DVK, had rushed to the High Court within 15 days and the Registry too had entertained their petitions erroneously, the SPP said.

In so far as the merits of the case were concerned, Mr. Natarajan said there could be no speck of doubt that Periyar was not just a tall leader but also an icon of reforms. “However, Mr. Rajinikanth appeared to have made his speech not on his own but based on an article published in a magazine,” he added.

Taking exception to such a submission, the counsel for the petitioners stated that the actor should not be allowed to go scot-free despite having incited violence due to his objectionable remarks against Periyar.

Intervening at this point, the judge said: “Everyone has great respect for the leader. There can be no second opinion about it but now the issue is that you have to follow the procedures laid down by law. In case, the police refuse to register FIR, you have an alternative remedy under Section 156(3). We cannot bypass that procedure.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/petitions-to-register-firs-against-rajini-withdrawn/article30647658.ece
215,2020/01/25,CJI to examine listing of DMK plea,"Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde on Friday agreed to consider listing a petition filed by the DMK on the disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs for voting against Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami in a confidence motion moved in 2017.

Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, during an oral mentioning, referred to a January 21 judgment by a Supreme Court Bench, led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman, requiring Speakers of the Lok Sabha and the State Assemblies to decide disqualification petitions against legislators, especially those who defect, within a “reasonable period” of a maximum of three months.

The judgment had also urged Parliament to amend the Constitution to strip Speakers, who may be biased on account of their political ideology, of their power to decide disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. The court wanted the power to be entrusted to an independent tribunal to arrive at a fair and impartial decision.

This judgment is contrary to what the Supreme Court had orally observed in July last year while hearing the DMK’s petition seeking disqualification of 11 AIADMK MLAs. Justice Bobde [as he was then] had expressed reservations about appropriating powers conferred exclusively on the T.N. Assembly Speaker under the anti-defection law to conduct disqualification proceedings against the State’s Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam and 10 other AIADMK MLAs for voting against the CM in February 2017.

“When the Tenth Schedule (anti-defection law) of the Constitution confers the power of disqualification on the Speaker, why should the court assume this power? Why should the court assume the power of the Speaker for something which happens inside the House,” Justice Bobde had asked Mr. Sibal then.

Mr. Sibal appears for DMK leader R. Sakkarapani, who has appealed an April 2018 order of the Madras High Court. In its 57-page order, the High Court had held that it cannot, merely on the basis of a writ petition under Article 226, encroach on the Speaker’s powers under the Tenth Schedule.

The HC had reasoned in its order that it was “difficult to conceive how this court can disqualify the concerned MLAs...Passing of such orders would not only amount to judicial overreach, it would also amount to gross breach of judicial discipline, if not contempt”. The court had further refrained from passing any orders on the prayer made by Mr. Sakkarapani for the issuance of a mandamus to the Speaker to disqualify the 11 AIADMK legislators under the anti-defection law.

The HC had said that the legal question of whether a court can direct a Speaker to disqualify members was pending before the apex court.

Arguing before the Bench, Mr. Sibal had submitted in July 2019 that if the Speaker had abandoned his duty under the Tenth Schedule, the court should then take over. “If the Speaker, who has the power, does not decide on the disqualification, the court will have to,” Mr. Sibal had argued.

Mr. Sakkarapani's petition said 11 MLAs from the Panneerselvam faction had voted against the CM during the trust vote on February 18, 2017. The plea for their disqualification was made before the Speaker under Paragraph 2 (1)(b) of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution. However, the Speaker did not issue any notice on the disqualification petition.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/iykmu4/article30647848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bobde-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/cji-to-examine-listing-of-dmk-plea/article30647634.ece
216,2020/01/25,NGO alleges scam in PDS procurement,"The non-governmental organisation Arappor Iyakkam has alleged a scam in the procurement of goods for the Public Distribution System (PDS) in Tamil Nadu which, according to it, has resulted in the loss of around ₹1,500 crore to the exchequer.

In a detailed statement issued on Friday, the organisation said that the tender conditions for supplying sugar, palmolein and dal were altered to favour a particular group of companies and the items were procured at an inflated price than the market price. The organisation has also petitioned the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in this regard.

Citing information it has gathered, the organisation said that the three products were bought at a price as high as ₹28.5 per kg.

According to Arappor Iyakkam, sugar was bought at ₹9.65 per kg higher than the market price, palmolein by ₹17.6 per kg, and dal by ₹28.5 per kg.

It alleged that the favoured company was Christy Group and other companies run by its owners. Though some tenders were awarded to public enterprises like MMTC Limited, State Trading Corporation of India Limited (STC), and Kendriya Bhandar, these companies also ended up supplying the goods through Christy Group and related companies, it claimed.

For all the tenders awarded to the group, the goods were continued to be supplied by the companies that were supplying TNCSC before the ‘scam.’

“The delivery up to the godowns were done by these other companies. Christy Group pocketed money by just doing the billing,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, Convenor, Arappar Iyakkam, in a statement.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ngo-alleges-scam-in-pds-procurement/article30647632.ece

Karuppannan has kicked up a row by saying that the State government will allot less funds to panchayat unions that have come under the DMK’s control following the local body elections.

Addressing a public meeting organised as part of former Chief Minister MGR’s birth anniversary celebrations at Shenbagapudur village in Sathyamangalam on Thursday, the Minister said DMK chairpersons cannot implement any schemes to improve basic amenities as the AIADMK was the ruling party.

“Only if we allot money, they can work,” he said, and asked whom the police will listen to if the issue was raised with them at the station. The Minister also said that only if people voted for the ‘two leaves’ symbol will they stand to benefit, and the government will allot less funds to Sathyamangalam panchayat union as it was won by the DMK.

When contacted, Sathyamangalam panchayat union chairman K.C.P. Ilango of the DMK said he will not differentiate between parties like the Minister had done, and added that he will allot funds to all the wards, irrespective of the party that won the seat.

“We will obtain more funds from Nilgiris MP A. Raja and function effectively,” he said.

219,2020/01/25,Police recover knife used in SSI’s murder,"A day after recovering a .32 calibre semi-automatic pistol that was allegedly used by two radicalised youth to shoot special sub-inspector Wilson in Ernakulam, the special police team probing the case retrieved a knife from a gutter at the Thampanoor bus stand near Thiruvananthapuram on Friday.

Police sources said the team, led by DSP Ganesan, visited the spot with the aid of the Kerala police following the confessions of the accused, and seized the weapon in their presence.

The National Investigation Agency has now taken over the case.

Abdul Sameem of Thiruvithancode in Thuckalay and Thoufiq of Ilangkadai in Nagercoil were identified as the prime accused in the murder case. The video footage captured from a few cameras near the Thampanoor bus stand showed the movements of the duo, a senior officer said, adding that they were seen hailing an auto-rickshaw after visiting a shop on January 8.

“The confessions from Thoufiq revealed that they had purchased the knife from a shop near Neyyatinkara mosque, boarded the auto and reached the police check-post at Kaliyakavilai [where the incident occurred]...After committing the heinous crime, they abandoned the weapons in the gutter...” the officer said.

The official said that as the news that the police were on the lookout for Sameem and Thoufiq spread, and their photographs were released by the media, the duo fled by train from Kochi to Mumbai. Apprehending arrest, they left Mumbai by train and reached Bengaluru. They were later nabbed in Udupi and brought to Tamil Nadu.

Speaking to The Hindu, a senior police officer from Chennai said that the confessions of Thoufiq and a search conducted on a bag in his possession revealed that he had some ‘papers’ bearing phone numbers and literature suggesting that the offenders would work hard and not rest until their goal was achieved.

On the morning of Monday (January 27), a mass will be held at St. Louis Church in Adyar, followed by a burial at the Quibble Island cemetery, according to family sources.

His father T. A. Varghese, an officer of the Indian Civil Service (ICS), retired as Chief Secretary of the State government in November 1965. His brother Thomas Varghese was General Manager of the Southern Railway.

Joining the Indian Administrative Service in May 1956, Mr. Antony, who held degrees in chemistry and law, served the State government in various capacities, like the Collector of Madurai, Tirunelveli and Thanjavur districts, before becoming the Special Officer of the Chennai Corporation in 1973. He was Secretary to the Rural Development and Local Administration Department for a year, and then went to the Centre, where he worked for four years as Joint Secretary in the Health Ministry. Returning to the State in 1982, Mr. Antony worked as Secretary, Planning and Development Department, for a year, after which he was made the Second Secretary in 1983. He had two stints as Chief Secretary – April 1985-July 1986 and January 1991-June 1991. When he retired in October 1991, he was holding the post of Chairman of the State Planning Commission.

She has now partitioned the small single-room house into two, so that her son, Selvaraj, and his family can live in one half. As she boils water on a wood stove, the 75-year-old recalls how difficult she found life in India for the first two years after her return. “We were first put up in a camp in Mandapam in Rameswaram, set up to house repatriates brought back from Sri Lanka. Then we were brought here to Gudalur [a municipality in the Nilgiris district]. For the first 10 months we stayed in small huts with thatched roofs in the middle of dense forests. We cleared the forests ourselves so that tea could be planted,” she says. When she arrived in 1978-79, Valliyammal and her husband were among the 37 families who were given jobs at the Tamil Nadu Tea Plantation Corporation (TANTEA) estate in Pandiar in Gudalur. “I was about 30 years old then. My daily wage was only a few rupees,” she says. Valliyammal recalls the nearest shop being over 10 km from her home in Pandiar estate.

Today, Valliyammal does not work. Selvaraj is an estate labourer who earns ₹300 for a day’s work. Valliyammal’s daughter-in-law works at a private estate but her work is seasonal and she is paid less than her husband. Apart from the worry of livelihood, the family now has a new fear: proving citizenship.

Valliyammal was among the six lakh Tamils of Indian origin who were repatriated to India as part of the Sirimavo-Shastri pact, signed in 1964 between Prime Ministers Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Lal Bahadur Shastri. Also known as the Agreement on Persons of Indian Origin in Ceylon, this pact allowed for the repatriation of nearly 5.25 lakh persons of Indian origin who were taken to Sri Lanka over a century ago by the British to work in the tea, coffee and coconut plantations there. In turn, Sri Lanka agreed to grant citizenship to a section of Indians who had gone to Sri Lanka to work in its tea plantations. Later, a follow-up agreement called the Sirimavo-Gandhi Pact was signed between Prime Ministers Bandaranaike and Indira Gandhi for the repatriation of 75,000 more persons of Indian origin. Following this, Sri Lanka again agreed to grant citizenship to another 75,000 persons of Indian origin. This meant that for every four people of Indian origin being granted citizenship, seven were to be repatriated to India.

These two agreements were signed by the two governments without taking into consideration the views of the affected people. When invitations for applications for Sri Lankan and Indian citizenship were thrown open, the overwhelming majority applied for Sri Lankan citizenship. Though Sri Lanka had earmarked only 4 lakh for Sri Lankan citizenship, the number of applicants was as high as 6.25 lakh. There was a shortfall in applications for Indian citizenship: only 4 lakh people applied in the prescribed period, though 6 lakh people were to be given Indian citizenship. Subsequently, another 87,000 people whose applications for Sri Lankan citizenship were rejected also applied for Indian citizenship, pulling up the total number of people who applied for Indian citizenship to 4.87 lakh.

“These numbers clearly reveal the gap between the wishes of the people concerned and the arbitrary decisions of the two governments. Fortunately, the Government of India resolved not to extend the two agreements beyond October 31, 1981,” says M. Chandrasekaran, former South Indian Secretary of the National Conference of Repatriates and General Secretary of Hill Country People’s Repatriates Rehabilitation Association.

The Sirimavo-Shastri pact of 1964 and was to last 15 years. However, the repatriation process formally started only in 1968. As the pact was set to expire in 1979, the Sri Lankan government wanted the deadline for expiration of the pact to be extended to continue the repatriation process. The repatriation process continued till 1984.

Poor standard of living

Those repatriated to India were resettled in parts of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, in government-run tea and coffee estates, rubber plantations, and spinning mills, Chandrasekaran says. “However, after just a few years of functioning, the spinning mills shut down. This forced the repatriates to become migrant labourers,” he says.

M. Selvaraj, a repatriate, says most of those who returned have either died or moved with their children to other districts to look for jobs. “The number of repatriates in these government-run estates is slowly decreasing as many feel that their standard of living hasn’t improved in the last few decades,” he says. As more repatriates are sending their children to schools and colleges, they are moving away from the estates and into bigger cities that hold the promise of good job opportunities. Though data on the number of repatriates who have moved out of the estates over the last few years are unavailable with the government, local activists and organisations working in the region estimate that at least a quarter of the repatriates have moved to other districts or found other jobs.

Punniya Moorthy, a tea estate worker in the Cherangode division of TANTEA, says a worker can expect to be paid a little over ₹300 for a day’s work. “Many feel that the wages are inadequate. So, they work at construction sites in the surrounding districts of Tiruppur and Coimbatore, and even Kerala, to supplement their incomes. Many have also found work in private estates, where they are paid a little more,” he says. Echoing Selvaraj, Moorthy says the living conditions of the repatriates have remained largely the same since they first came to the Gudalur and Pandalur taluks.

M.S. Selvaraj, State Convenor of the Vivasayigal Thozhilalargal Munnetra Sangam, which has been working on land rights for repatriate communities in the Nilgiris and across Tamil Nadu, estimates that 2.8 lakh repatriates were resettled in Gudalur, Pandalur, Kotagiri and Coonoor taluks. “A number of government schemes were implemented to provide jobs, housing, healthcare and other benefits — business loans up to ₹7,500, loans for self-employment in dairy farming, to purchase cycle rickshaws, to incentivise them into buying land for agriculture, to grant them employment opportunities at government-run co-operative spinning mills, TANTEA estates, cinchona plantations and also in private firms through the Repatriates’ Co-operative Finance and Development Bank’s industrial schemes. However, none of these were implemented in proper spirit. As a result, these communities remain some of the most marginalised and impoverished groups in the Nilgiris,” he says. “Very few of them own land. And the few that do are often harassed by the forest department, which claims that they have encroached on forest land. They have been living in poverty for many decades, even as the government has earned a lot of revenue from the estates because of the work of these labourers. There should be conversations taking place about transferring management of the estates to these communities,” he says.

Suspicion and stigma

The repatriate communities have also faced challenges in integrating with the local communities. As a majority of the repatriates who were first sent to Sri Lanka were Dalits from some of the most impoverished regions of Tamil Nadu, their return to India and rehabilitation in the Nilgiris was met with stern disapproval from the local communities.

P. Ramalingam, a resident of Ketti town outside Udhagamandalam, says he and his brothers arrived in Tamil Nadu in 1974 and worked as tea estate workers in Gudalur. Then they worked as construction workers in Kerala. And finally they moved to Ketti. “There was definitely some stigma attached to us — first because we were Dalits, and second because the Tamil Eelam movement in Sri Lanka was gaining traction in the public consciousness, leading to suspicions that repatriates sympathised with the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam],” he says. As a result, repatriates were denied basic rights, he says. “For many large landholders, repatriates were only labourers to whom land would not be sold to, even if they had the money to pay for it.”

R. Hariharan, a college student from the same village, says these divisions manifested in the way the settlements of repatriate communities developed. “For instance, a ‘repatriate colony’ even today exists as a separate unit. These colonies sprung up and developed over time outside pre-existing villages and settlements. Those villages and settlements were usually home to landowners who first gave jobs to repatriates as daily wage workers,” he says. For many years, landowners and village heads would refuse to sell land to members of repatriate communities if the land was too close to their village. “These challenges forced the children of repatriates to seek better opportunities to earn a livelihood outside the Nilgiris,” he says. “For decades our lives have been synonymous with tea estates and farm labour. We have had very little opportunity to aspire for something better. This is why youngsters are leaving their homes and starting afresh elsewhere.”

Chandrasekaran says there is no doubt that very few repatriates owned land. Many of the youth have managed to get a college education today, he says. Their standards of living have undoubtedly risen over the last couple of decades. However, while those who were resettled in tea and coffee estates managed to send their children to school and climb out of extreme poverty, others who were sent to work in spinning mills, which were subsequently closed down, were forced to become daily wage workers and migrant labourers. “The government must take steps to find out what happened to these people and rehabilitate them too,” Chandrasekaran says.

Documents lost

The repatriates today have new worries. While they face an uncertain future due to the fall in tea prices, a bigger concern is the government’s proposal to roll out the National Population Register and the National Register of Citizens, which may require them to furnish documents to prove their citizenship. Many repatriates misplaced or lost their documents in transit several decades ago. Some others recently lost their documents in the rains that triggered landslips and floods in the hills.

An activist working with the repatriate communities in the Nilgiris says many repatriates became victims of fraud when they first arrived in India. “When we first got here, many brokers approached us with promises of getting us resettled. They took away our travel documents and made a lot of money by applying for loans and settlement packages on behalf of the repatriates. Anywhere between 25% to 30% of the repatriates lost their documents under different circumstances. It’s unclear whether this will lead to problems for the community [in proving their citizenship],” he says.

The repatriated communities in the Nilgiris, who comprise about a third of the total population, are now a major political force, he says. “So if they have to prove their citizenship, that could have wider ramifications for the district as a whole. If they are unable to prove their citizenship, they could be deprived of their right to vote or their right to government benefits,” he explains. What the repatriates do have are documents that attest that they were registered Indian citizens when they received their passports to travel from Sri Lanka back to India.

P. Manikandan, a resident of O’ Valley in Gudalur, says many lost their documents in the spell of heavy rains that led to flooding in the Nilgiris in 2019. “Even my parents’ documents, including their passports issued by the Indian government, were washed away when water entered our homes. We weren’t worried then, as the documents were nothing more than just reminders of our past, but now my parents are worried whether their citizenship will be questioned,” he says.

The identity and loyalty of the repatriates have been questioned before too, local activists claim. Repatriates were harassed after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated. “The problem is that the police and even the government have little or no understanding of the difference between Sri Lankan Tamils, who are refugees in India, and repatriates,” says the activist. There needs to be clarity from the government on what awaits the members of the community who have lost their travel documents, he says. “One way to get around this problem would be to cross-check the details of the repatriates with the High Commission in Sri Lanka,” he suggests.

Prominent writer S.V. Rajadurai, a resident of the Nilgiris, says the repatriate communities who have been resettled in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka will not be affected by the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. However, Sri Lankan refugees who have lived here for decades are the most vulnerable to being deported forcibly. “The government’s claim is that Sri Lankan refugees are not victims of religious persecution, but victims of displacement caused by a civil war. But the underlying cause for their displacement was the religious and cultural persecution of the Tamil people, be it native Sri Lankans or repatriates,” Rajadurai says.

Decades ago, the majority of Tamils applied for Sri Lankan citizenship after the two agreements were signed. Many were repatriated to India.

224,2020/01/25,BJP slams KCR for raking up CAA after municipal elections,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Telangana unit president K. Laxman has observed that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is gripped by a fear of the BJP and that’s the reason why Chief Minister and TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao has targeted the BJP while speaking on municipal election results.

Speaking to reporters here on Saturday, he claimed that the results were clearly indicating that people were looking at BJP as an alternative to the TRS in Telangana. Mr. Laxman said Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao owes an explanation to people as to why he was opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act now after supporting the Bill in Parliament. He also sought to know why Mr. Rao did not speak on the issue before the municipal elections and remarked that speaking on it after the elections was a clear indication of opportunistic politics.

The BJP leader said Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao was trying to mislead people on CAA. “Had he spoken about CAA before the polling, people in all municipalities and corporations would have slammed TRS like what they have done in Bhainsa by not electing even single ward member,” Mr. Laxman said.

Further, Mr. Laxman demanded that the TRS leader explain as to which Muslims he wanted to include in the citizenship law and whether citizenship be given to Muslims who trespassed, illegally entered, into India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/tl8pze/article30654470.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26LAXMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-slams-kcr-for-raking-up-caa-after-municipal-elections/article30654471.ece
225,2020/01/25,It’s possible to ‘edit’ genes now,"Technologies developed with the ‘human genome’ made it possible to read and decipher the entire human DNA sequence and predict potential genetic risks. This knowledge can be used to take precautionary measures as nothing can be done about genes inherited from our parents. However, with ‘CRISPR-CAS’ technology, now, it will be possible to ‘edit’ DNA and ‘correct mistakes’.

Prof. Virginijus Syksnys of Vilnius University, Lithuania,co-inventor of the CRISPR-CAS technology said it is very much possible to reprogramme DNA and cut it as you wish under certain conditions. One of it being requirement of a small DNA sequence called ‘PAM’ for this technology to work and this limits its use, he said.

The professor was delivering the eighth Shirdkar Endowment lecture instituted by Rajkumari Indira Devi Dhanrajgir for the Telangana Academy of Science (TAS) at the CSIR-Indian Institute of Chemical Technology on Friday. Mr. Syksnys described how this technology was developed, main features and the challenges associated with it during the course of his talk.

This technique has opened the possibility of treating diseases like cancer and also correct many inherited diseases. It can also lead to new and better varieties of food crops and vegetables, he said.

226,2020/01/25,TRS wins six ULBs in erstwhile Nizamabad dist.,"The TRS has shown its supremacy in municipal elections by winning six out of seven Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in the erstwhile undivided district, and finishing third in the prestigious Nizamabad Municipal Corporation (NMC).

In the NMC, the voter gave a mixed verdict electing 28 BJP, 16 AIMIM, 13 TRS, 2 Cong candidates and one independent in the 60 divisions’ corporation.

In the tug-of-war election in this city, BJP, though it emerged as the single largest party, it has no choice to take up reins of the NMC as it fell three seats short of the magic figure of 31. If the ruling party MLCs and MLAs enrolled their votes in the corporation, the magic limit might go up. So, it is clear that the TRS with the support of its friendly political party, MIM, and also ex-officio members, may come to power here.

The scene will be different if the MIM insists for the Mayoral post as the party in the previous corporation, though secured majority seats of 16, it extended its support to the TRS to win mayoral post and compromised with deputy mayor post. Then, the TRS won only 10 seats in the NMC.

The MIM retained the same number of seats like in the last elections.

The worst-hit is Congress as its strength was reduced to a single digit from 16 in the previous corporation to just two.

However, except two, all its members later joined the TRS.

The BJP, which won just 6 divisions in 2014 elections, considerably improved its strength by winning 22 more this time. In the multi-cornered contests in the NMC and triangular fight in the remaining six municipalities, the TRS got a clear mandate in Bheemgal, Bodhan, Armoor, Yellareddy, Banswada and Kamareddy.

Though the Congress gave a good fight in Kamareddy, it lost to the TRS.

Congress party’s expectations in Yellareddy have gone awry in the results.

In Bheemgal, which comes under Balkonda constituency represented by Roads and Buildings Minister V. Prashanth Reddy, the result was one-sided. All the 12 wards went in favour of TRS there.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/xt289l/article30654679.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26NZB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-wins-six-ulbs-in-erstwhile-nizamabad-dist/article30654100.ece
227,2020/01/25,Telangana Assembly will pass resolution against Citizenship Amendment Act: Chandrasekhar Rao,"Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has made it categorical that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) will be opposed tooth and nail, and the Telangana Assembly will pass a resolution against it.

Expressing his opinion on the CAA for the first time at a press conference in Hyderabad, the Chief Minister appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reconsider the CAA and said that, in a democratic set up, it was better to review laws that were opposed by people.

He said India was a federal country and argued that States had their own rights to protect and the Assembly had a right to express its opinion on any law in a federal setup like India.

The Chief Minister said the CAA had damaged India’s reputation abroad as a peace-loving country and this was not at all good for the country where people had coexisted for centuries. He felt that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Narendra Modi government was bent upon dividing people through this ‘controversial’ law. The TRS was a secular party and would not discriminate against anyone based on religion or caste.

To call for CMs’ meet

Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao also plans to call for a meeting of the Chief Ministers and like-minded political parties. “I want to host the meeting in Hyderabad to send a strong message to the country and chalk out a strategy to oppose the legislation,” he said. “I am not scared of any party or anyone.”

KCR also found fault with the contradictory statements of the Union Ministers on the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). In Parliament, the government’s intentions were made clear when it said the NPR was the first step to NRC but some ministers refused it.

He said Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, who hails from Hyderabad, had been saying there was no force on people to divulge the details. “What do you want the Telangana government to tell people?

The TRS, which continued its winning streak since Assembly elections, continued its victory in all the rural local bodies’ elections and also in ULBs.

For the first time, the TRS had attained power in the Jagtial municipality, which was otherwise the Congress strong bastion under the leadership of MLC T Jeevan Reddy.

Against a total of 48 wards, the TRS won from 30 wards, Congress 7, BJP 3, MIM 1 and independents - 7.

Former Minister and sitting Manthani legislator D Sridhar Babu also failed to capture the Manthani municipality. Against the total of 13 wards in Manthani municipality, the TRS snatched the chairperson post by winning 11 wards and the Congress confining only to two wards.

Surprisingly, Minister for IT and Municipal Administration K Taraka Rama Rao tasted setback in his Sircilla municipality following 12 party rebels getting elected as independents.

However, the TRS had won the municipal elections by winning from 22 wards in Sircilla. Minister for Health Etala Rajender saw to it that the party wins from Jammikunta and Huzurabad municipalities, which fall in his Assembly segment. TRS won from 22 wards out of a total of 30 wards in Jammikunta, and 21 wards in Huzurabad municipality against a total of 30 wards.

In both the municipalities, the party rebel candidates won as independents in 5 wards in Jammikunta and 3 wards in Huzurabad.

Minister for Social Welfare Koppula Eshwar ensured the victory of the party from Dharmapuri and Raikal municipalities with less margin.

In Dharmapuri municipality, the TRS won from 8 wards and Congress from 7 wards out of a total of 15 wards. In Raikal, the TRS won from 9 wards, Congress 1, BJP one and independent one.

The opposition party and the TRS won five wards each of the total of dozen ULBs while the Bharatiya Janata Party and an independent candidate winning the remaining two wards.

According to sources, the winning Congress candidates and the BJP and independent have gone underground soon after the declaration of results. It is learnt that the Congress will have party MLC T. Jeevan Reddy vote in Khanapur Municipality to swing the tide in its favour.

The TRS also fell short of a clear majority in the newly formed Naspur ULB in Mancherial district but the performance of the opposition parties was not in their own favour either. Of the 25 wards, its candidates won in 10 while the Congress won in si, the BJP and independents in three, CPI winning two, and one going in favour of the All India Forward Block.

In Adilabad Municipality, where local MLA Jogu Ramanna of the ruling party is trying to get his son Premender elected as chairman, the TRS has won 24 of the 49 wards. The chairman candidate, however, will get elected what with the MLA himself voting for him in his capacity as ex officio member of the ULB.

The BJP has won 11 wards, failing to encash on the polarisation caused by the anti Citizenship Amend Act protests, while the Congress and Majlis Ittehadu Muslimeen won five wards each and the remaining four going the way of independents.

The MIM won a clear majority in the 26-member Bhainsa Municipal council in Nirmal district by winning 15 of the wards. In Nirmal, Forest Minister A. Indrakaran led the TRS in winning 30 of the 42 wards, only seven falling in the kitty of the Congress party.

In Kodad and Huzurnagar, the home of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, the party was decimated to three and seven wards, whereas the winning TRS figures stood at 25 and 20, respectively.

The good news for TRS started with Alair municipality in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district, where it won eight of the total 12 wards early in the day. Its results were straightforward, comfortably passing the corresponding ‘magic figures’ also in Mothkur and Pochampally.

TRS, in Suryapet, the home constituency of Energy Minister G. Jagadish Reddy emerged the single largest party winning 24 of the total 48 wards, and Congress and BJP secured 15 and five wards respectively.

Congress, on the other hand, got majority wards in Chandur municipality only, and in Nereducherla, where it is in a pre-poll alliance with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), it together garnered (7+1) eight of the total 15 wards.

Hung situations are many, including in the Nalgonda municipality, which witnessed a neck and neck contest and ended in 20-each figure between Congress and TRS at the end.

232,2020/01/25,Rape of tribal woman triggers protests,"A 36-year-old tribal woman was allegedly gangraped by seven persons at a tribal hamlet in Raghunadhapalem mandal around Friday midnight.

The incident sparked an outcry from women’s organisations and triggered a massive protest here.

Sources said two bike-borne miscreants whisked away the married woman, who was alone at her house in a tribal hamlet situated along the Khammam-Pangidi road, late in the night.

They took her to fields near Harya Thanda, where two of their accomplices joined them.

The four miscreants took turns to rape the hapless woman, sources added.

They reportedly called their three other accomplices to the spot.

On hearing the screams of the victim, some passersby alerted the police about the suspicious movement of bike-borne youths near the farm over phone.

A mobile police party rushed to the spot. But, the miscreants managed to flee, sources said.

The Raghunadhapalem police shifted the rape victim to the district headquarters hospital in Khammam for medical examination.

The police registered a case and reportedly detained a few suspects belonging to two nearby villages for questioning, sources said.

Police suspect the involvement of an engineering student in the heinous crime.

Additional DCP Injarapu Pooja and other police officials inspected the scene of crime and launched a thorough probe into the incident.

Infuriated by the gruesome incident, activists of the AIDWA and various youth organisations staged a rasta roko in front of the District Headquarters Hospital here late in the afternoon.

233,2020/01/25,KCR blames Centre for precarious situation of State’s finances,"Expressing concern over the precarious economic situation in the country, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has said that Telangana, one of the most progressive states, was badly affected.

He said Telangana consistently registered 21% growth year-on-year in the last five years but it dropped down to 2% at one point and now stabilised at 9.2%. The growth rate is definitely not healthy, he said and blamed the Central government for its almost “zero effort” to revive the economic crisis.

KCR said the Centre owes ₹2,812 crore to Telangana under the IGST apart from ₹1131 crore, and he would write a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking release of the State’s share of funds immediately.

He alleged that Centre was fudging the economic figures and it cannot continue it for long. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report would bring out the truth and the figures have to be submitted to Parliament where it will be exposed.

Welfare schemes

KCR, however, said that despite the poor finances the government was committed to fulfil its welfare promises including reducing the eligible age limit for Aasara pensions to 57 years, increasing the retirement age limit for government employees and implementing unemployment dole.

Though assuring some hike for the government employees through the Pay Revision Commission (PRC) report, he said the hike may not be huge in the present circumstances.

Tax increase likely

KCR hinted at increasing the taxes to shore up revenues for improving infrastructure in the urban and rural areas. Tax hike is pending for long but the hike would not be a huge burden on the people. Those who can afford should pay the taxes and underprevileged sections will not be touched.

Social media menace

The Chief Minister warned of severe action on the people hitting at the government abusively on the social media platforms crossing all limits. Politicians are being targeted individually and this was damaging the reputation of politics and political parties, he felt.

234,2020/01/25,AIMIM makes significant gains in ULB polls,"The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen put up an impressive show in the urban local bodies elections as it made significant gains in Jalpally Municipality and Bhainsa Municipality.

In Bhainsa, which witnessed communal flare-up earlier this month, the party bagged 15 wards out of 26. The Bharatiya Janata Party came second with nine. Interestingly, the Owaisi brothers-led party bagged 15 out of the 28 wards in the Jalpally Municipality were it is expected to enter into alliance with the TRS which bagged 10 wards.

In Nizamabad, the AIMIM’s candidates managed to win 16 out of the 60 wards. The AIMIM had contested in as many as 276 seats in the ULBs and managed to bag 86.

Meanwhile, AIMIM candidate Mir Basith Ali won the Dabeerpura byelection with a margin of 9,240 votes against his nearest rival Mirza Akheel Affandi who managed to poll only 1,225 votes. The Congress’s Mirza Askar Ali Baig polled 950 votes and the TRS’ Raza Ali Mirza secured 620.

235,2020/01/25,"Blackmailing, misuse of power help TRS landslide win, says Congress","The Congress party has termed the landslide victory of Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the elections to urban local bodies (ULBs) as a result of “blackmailing tactics” adopted by the ruling party and also misuse of the official machinery.

“It’s not the reflection of welfare and development schemes being implemented by the State government or the functioning and popularity of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Minister for Municipal Administration, IT and Industries K.T. Rama Rao. But, the TRS rank and file have snatched votes from the electorate by using all sorts of power, pressure and influence,” working president of Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee A. Revanth Reddy said here on Saturday.

In his reaction to the results, Mr. Reddy said the Congress party had seen many elections during the last 72 years and experienced many ups and downs in the electoral battles. “The party would never take the victory to its head or feel completely let down with the loss. It takes everything in its stride and marches forward in its mission to serve the people,” Mr. Reddy said adding that they contested the election everywhere possible “to save democracy”.

Pressure to perform

Mr. Reddy, who is also the Malkajgiri MP, said Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao’s major weapon in the ULBs’ election was “blackmailing of ministers” with a threat to dislodge their berths in the Cabinet if they failed to deliver in the municipal elections. “KCR did not believe in the people but relied mostly on the power of money, liquor, police and election officials as the investment to win the municipal elections,” the TPCC leader remarked.

He accused the election officials of violating the rules brazenly stating that they did not act against several ministers in spite of their violation of election code and lodging of complaints by the Congress with proof. The election officials owe an answer to people on such “inaction and bias” in favour of the ruling party, Mr. Reddy stated.

Mr. Revanth Reddy also took a dig at the media alleging that it was singing TRS tunes even before the commencement of counting of votes on Saturday. Stating that the result of Boduppal Municipal Council was an example, he said the electronic media was seen running scrolling on TRS win even before the results were declared.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/j0qsai/article30653426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26REVANTH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/blackmailing-misuse-of-power-help-trs-landslide-win-says-congress/article30653423.ece

237,2020/01/25,MIM sidesteps polarisation to win Bhainsa,"Strongman of the All India Majlis Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) in Bhainsa town, Jabir Ahmed, was a happy man on Saturday as results of the election to wards in this communally sensitive urban local body (ULB) in Nirmal district were announced. His party won 15 of the 26 wards exactly as claimed by him despite the town witnessing communal violence in the run up to the polling.

The AIMIM victory was aided no less by the fact that the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had made it a friendly contest in Bhainsa. Three of its candidates had withdrawn in favour of the AIMIM giving them the wards on a platter, the other contestants being ‘weak’, evident from their tally of votes.

But it was the failure of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in putting in place a proper strategy to defeat the AIMIM that saw it limited to winning from nine wards, a tally which was lesser than many in town expected in the wake of the communal violence of January 12 and 13. Polarisation of votes was anticipated but evidently did not take place.

It is a well known fact that the BJP leadership had come in for criticism for its poor election strategy by way of nominations just as the nomination process had ended. The party apparently failed to take advantage of the ‘mood’ of the voters by putting up ‘deserving’ candidates at least from some wards.

The AIMIM on the other hand had a clear cut vision of its campaign notwithstanding the aberration of the communal violence. It put up candidates even from Scheduled Tribe and Scheduled Caste reserved constituencies.

Though its ST candidate from ward number 12 conceded a win to the BJP, the SC candidate from ward number 13 scored a mighty win. The BJP, it was clear, failed to make inroads in that ward.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/enjc8z/article30653581.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY26BHAINSA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mim-sidesteps-polarisation-to-win-bhainsa/article30653312.ece

Expressing thanks to people for voting for BJP in the corporation elections, he described the party’s success as a gift to Modi. Referring to the comments of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in his press meet immediately after the results were out in Hyderabad, he said that Mr. Rao need not tell him about the political courtesy and language.

Mr. Arvind alleged that in the Division No.21 recounting of votes was taken up, even when it was not necessary, to ensure the victory to TRS candidate. Similarly, in the Division No.1 the election authority mocked the democracy by accepting the votes from one ballot box which had no seal, he said. Thus, repoll must be held in these two divisions, he said.

239,2020/01/25,Mesram women introduced to Nagoba after 25 years,"The ceremony of ‘bheting’ or introducing new brides to the clan god, Nagoba or the serpent god, was as aesthetic as curious. Nearly 200 women from the families of clan patels or heads found it conducive to participate in this year’s Nagoba Jatara in Keslapur village of Indervelli mandal in the early hours of Saturday.

New brides actually get introduced to the clan god during the first jatara after their marriage into the clan, it being an annual cultural and religious event of the Mesram clan Raj Gond and Pardhan Adivasis in erstwhile undivided Adilabad district.

There are instances when death in the family or some other inauspicious event prohibits the new brides from participating in the bheting. In the case of the patel family women, 25 years had elapsed due to some or the other inauspicious occurence. However, since the last jatara until now, nothing unfortunate had happened and they were able to participate in the solemn ceremony this year.

Bheting is a very important event in the ethos of ethnic tribes in these parts as it gets them recognition as a member of the clan. “Until the bride concerned gets formally introduced to Nagoba through this ceremony, she is not considered as a member of the clan,” says Mesram Dada Rao, a Pardhan elder.

The women draped themselves in new white sarees and, walking in pairs, emerged from the Govad next door which is a temporary abode for the bheti koriad or the daughters-in-law who need to be introduced. Pardhan musicians led the ‘veiled’ bheti koriad to the Nagoba temple.

The veil made of the white saree was removed only in front of the brass image of the serpent god in the sanctum sanctorum. This darshan of the god made them eligible for enlistment as a clan member so that they can participate in all religious functions thereafter.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/l81y20/article30653086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25-NAGOBA-WOMEN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/mesram-women-introduced-to-nagoba-after-25-years/article30653073.ece
240,2020/01/25,It’s political camps time now in some municipalities,"With the completion of counting process for urban local bodies on Saturday, the political parties and the aspirants for the top posts such as mayor and municipal chairpersons have launched the “political camps” with the elected ward members, councillors and corporators respectively.

As it is indirect elections to the elect the top posts of the urban local bodies, the political parties organise camps to avoid horse-trading and poaching by the rivals. This time, the camps are being organised only by the ruling TRS with their candidates and roping in the support of independents, who are also party rebels.

Even as the party wave continued throughout the State, the people of Ramagundam Municipal Corporation have given a different verdict and it was hung as no party secured an absolute majority in the elections. Out of a total of 50 municipal divisions, the TRS secured 18, Congress 11, BJP 6 and independents 14. As the majority of independents elected were TRS rebels, the party leadership is roping in their support to win the Mayor post of the corporation.

The party has organised a camp in Hyderabad under the leadership of Ramagundam legislator Korukanti Chander. The mayor post of Ramagundam Corporation was reserved for SC general.

The TRS leaders also organising camp with the elected TRS members of Dharmapuri Municipality to avoid their jumping into the Congress party. In Dharmapuri, the TRS had won 8 wards and the Congress 7 wards.

In the meantime, the parties which had organised camps with the candidates from Vemulawada, Sircilla, Korutla, Metpally, Raikal and other municipalities have started returning to their native places following the one-side victory of the TRS party and not giving the chance for the opposition parties to involve any kind of horse-trading.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/its-political-camps-time-now-in-some-municipalities/article30652751.ece

242,2020/01/25,TRS headed for landslide victory in urban local body elections,"The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) is heading for a landslide victory in the elections to urban local bodies (ULBs) — 129 municipal councils and corporations — with trends in the counting of votes taken up on Saturday morning confirming it.

In spite of the brave face being put up by the Opposition parties, particularly the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), they have failed to make much impact. Both the parties are faring badly with a distant second and third positions in winning the total number of wards – 2,727 in municipal councils and 325 in municipal corporations.

Till the forenoon, the TRS has bagged nearly 900 wards out of 1,600 results followed by the Congress (250) and the BJP (115) in municipal councils. Similar trend is prevails in the elections to the municipal corporations.

Except the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM), other parties such as the Communist Party of India, the Communist Party of India-Marxist, and the Telugu Desam Party have struggled to make their presence felt. The AIMIM, however, has retained its hold in some pockets where it has a mass base.

After the landslide victories in Assembly and rural local bodies (RLBs) elections, the TRS’s victory in the ULBs elections makes its leadership stronger. The ULB election results are being attributed to the “hard work” of party working president K.T. Rama Rao, who incidentally said during the electioneering that it would be a referendum on his functioning, both as the working president and the Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development.

The Congress’ claim that its vote-bank was intact, as proved in the elections to Lok Sabha held in April last year, has fallen flat as its tally in municipal wards remained only around 10% of TRS numbers. Intense campaigning by party bigwigs such as Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy, working presidents A. Revanth Reddy and Ponnam Prabhakar, Legislature Party Leader M. Bhatti Vikramarka, senior leaders T. Jeevan Reddy, Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and others has proved inept in mobilising the support of the electorate.

Meanwhile, Mr. Rama Rao reached the party headquarters Telangana Bhavan before the counting of votes began to follow the trends.

In spite of the allegations of the Opposition parties, mostly by the Congress and the BJP, that the ruling party has resorted to largescale poll-irregularities to influence the voters, it is the TRS leaderships’ reported cautioning of its Ministers that they may risk their Cabinet berths with a poor show in ULB elections that appears to have made the elected representatives put in extra efforts to ensure victory of its candidates.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ae5zc2/article30650860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25TELANGANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-headed-for-landslide-victory-in-urban-local-body-elections/article30650834.ece
243,2020/01/25,Telangana urban local body polls: Counting of votes begins,"Counting of votes for the municipal elections in Telangana began on Saturday morning with the ruling TRS, which swept the rural local body polls last year, hopeful of continuing its dominance. The counting commenced at 8 a.m. and the results are expected to be fully available by evening.

The Telangana State Election Commission has made elaborate arrangements for the exercise.

Polling for 120 municipalities and nine corporations in the state was held amid tight security on January 22 and 24.

According to official sources, 40% of voters exercised their franchise in the municipalities while that of municipal corporations was 58.83.

Aiming at continuing its impressive performance, the TRS led a spirited campaign in the run-up to elections, under the direction of its working president and minister K.T. Rama Rao. The opposition Congress and BJP too sought to put their best foot forward.

The TRS bagged all the 32 Zilla Parishads in the rural local body elections held last year and was hopeful of continuing its impressive performance in the municipal polls, party sources said. TRS has been successful at the hustings after having returned to power with a massive majority in the assembly polls held in December, 2018.

It put up a decent performance in the Lok Sabha polls winning 11 out of the total 19 seats, though it suffered an unexpected setback in Nizamabad assembly seat, which it failed to retian.

As part of the third Brahmotsavam celebrations at the shrine, which would be held from January 25 to February 3, the authorities had planned to remove the statue. Objecting to this, activists of the Communist Party of India (CPI) rushed to the spot and obstructed the removal of the statue.

Following the arrival of CPI activists, the authorities stopped the removal work — they had by then removed the high-mast light on the island, garden and grills etc. As tension prevailed, the police rushed to the spot and brought the situation under control.

246,2020/01/25,Shared heritage of India and Bangladesh,"After 1947, printmakers from erstwhile East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, were no longer in touch with their roots, and printmaking virtually came to a standstill.

“Before Partition, Calcutta was the centre of printmaking for both West and East Bengal. However, from 1947 till 1971, when East Bengal went to Pakistan, we had no link with printmaking activities in West Bengal. Pakistan had no tradition of this creative expression,” says Prof. Nisar Hossain, Dean, Faculty of Fine Art, University of Dhaka.

He says that it was only after Bangladesh was born that artists from the country started coming to India, to study in Santiniketan much like he did himself.

Prof. Hossain is the co-curator of Confluence: Celebrating India-Bangladesh Printmaking, an exhibition where 24 artists, 12 each from India and Bangladesh, are showcasing 150 prints.

To give people a clear idea of the way the Bangladesh tradition developed, he has arranged artworks chronologically.

Work of Anisuzzaman, a Bangladeshi printmaker

“For the first generation of artists, Calcutta was the main centre. So, our pioneers were students of Art College. Saifuddin Ahmed, who did a lot of wood engravings, honed his skills in Calcutta. He was a pioneer,” he says. Some of his students travelled Westward, to Spain, Greece, Germany and specialised in abstract art. “These are second generation artists. The third generation are present-day artists who learnt this medium of expression in India,” he says.

Lubna Sen, co-curator of the exhibition

Co-curator Lubna Sen, whose parents hail from East Bengal, and made India their home after Partition, says: “We traced our shared history through works of printmaking masters — Somnath Hore in India and Safiuddin Ahmed in Bangladesh. Safiuddin taught printmaking to Somnath in the Government College of Art and Craft in Kolkata. Though they were children of undivided Bengal, after 1947 Saifuddin went to what is now Bangladesh,” says Lubna, who selected the 12 artists from India. She is the founder-CEO of The Art Route, which is organising the exhibition.

Despite their common heritage, Hossain says that generally speaking, Indian artists are mostly literal (flora, fauna) and Bangladeshi artists specialise in the abstract.

However, the new generation of artists from Bangladesh that has studied in India is creating art works that have direct and indirect influences from their friends in India. “After returning home upon completing their art studies in India, they have gravitated to figurative art,” says Hossain.

What ties them together is the fact that “for a printmaker the motivation is not just the final output; it is also the process.”

Hossain, who visits his alma mater on work, remembers the late K.G. Subramanyan: “He was also an unparalleled teacher,” he says.

Celebrating India-Bangladesh Printmaking was born out of the need to promote printmaking that has managed to survive despite cultural and technological changes over the years. However, the mission here, is not just to show how it continues to be relevant in the sub-continent, but also to promote artists and their art forms.

Prof. Hossain remembers the importance of printmaking in the freedom movement, where they were used in campaigns. Then, it was a medium for all. After independence he says art became an elitist pursuit.

“Unless you take art to the common people, the elite will continue to have a monopoly over it. There are two types of art lovers: one wants to see a painting for visual pleasure, while the other wants to learn what the artist has to say about society. The former is pure aesthetics, while the latter is socio-political.”

247,2020/01/25,The unremembered Indian soldiers of WWII: a photography project,"D.S. Kalha sits on a parapet, togged out in his khaki uniform, Sam Browne belt and black shoes. Beside him stands his wife of a few months, smiling at the camera. The photograph was shot on one of those halcyon days in Dehradun before World War II engulfed three continents, taking the Kalhas in its sweep.

The man who would rise to be a Lieutenant General in free India’s Army was not to know then that he would be captured at the Siege of Tobruk in 1941 and shipped off to Avezzano in Italy as a prisoner of war. He escaped and was sheltered by local farmers with whom he would go on to build extraordinary friendships that lasted many decades and encompassed many generations of family on both sides.

Lt. Gen. Kalha’s story, along with those of many others, is part of Annu Palakunnathu Matthew’s reclamation of an almost lost epic — India’s role in World War II. The subcontinent sent the largest volunteer army (over 2.5 million) to fight for the British even as its people fought to get rid of the yoke of empire back home. While the war has been examined beyond the tropes of victor and vanquished by several historians and writers, the life and times of this extraordinary generation have fallen through the cracks, especially in India, where military history has been largely brushed aside.

Lighter remembrances

As the distance widens between the men and women that fought in the war and a generation that struggles to remember it, it becomes vital to recount the stories of the strange bonds that war forges. Across Europe and the U.S., oral and visual history projects, battlefield tours, museums and displays such as remembrance poppies running riot at the Tower of London keep the lessons of battles alive. But glimpses of the lighter moments in the soldiers’ lives — before, during and after the war — have mostly been lost in the din. This is what Matthew, Professor of Art at the University of Rhode Island and Fulbright Scholar, hopes to train the spotlight on.

Matthew, 55, was born in Stourport-on-Severn, U.K., and relocated to India when she was 12. It was while pursuing a degree in mathematics at Chennai’s Women’s Christian College that Matthew discovered a love for photography. “I chose mathematics for all the wrong reasons,” she says with a laugh. “We had one optional subject a year and I chose a photography course offered by the physics department. We had one camera for the 15 of us and only two rolls of film, which meant we could shoot only two frames each. The picture I remember taking was that of a friend reflected in a pond. Seeing the image develop had me hooked.”

Matthew returned to Bengaluru, where her family lived, worked with computers for six years and pursued a career in advertising before moving to the U.S. in search of what was to be her calling — photography. Living in three countries gave her an extraordinary body of work that found space at the Royal Ontario Museum, Nuit Blanche Toronto and sepiaEYE, New York. She has also exhibited at RISD Museum, Newark Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Houston, the Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as the Smithsonian.

Over the years, Matthew has explored the gulf between the public face and private feelings, drawing from culture and oral history. Some of her pictures for ‘Memories of India’, an exhibition on her cultural homeland, were shot with a Holga camera and display vignetting and light leaks that lend surrealism to the work.

“The show titled ‘To Majority Minority’ lends agency to the voices of America’s immigrant minorities. It draws inspiration from Ronald Takaki’s ‘A Different Mirror’,” says Matthew. “For my first Fulbright Fellowship, I focused on the stories of the children of Partition. The photo-animations in ‘Open Wound’ start from the family’s old and new photographs and morph into three generations, telling their story on Partition. They narrate the experiences of Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi families.”

Private moments

Her second Fulbright covers her current photo project that involves the private moments of officers and men of the British Indian Army. She kickstarted a series of exhibitions with an installation and video at the 2018 Kochi Muziris Biennale titled ‘The Unremembered: Indian Soldiers from the Italian Campaign of World War II’, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Monte Cassino and the campaign that saw a number of Indians receive the Victoria Cross.

“I was less interested in rummaging through Army archives as they yield mostly mugshots. I was looking for scenes from their everyday lives so that the viewer can connect to them as individuals. One of my experimentations has been to create a 3D image etched in a crystal through which I plan to project archival film footage of the Indian soldiers,” says Matthew, adding that accessing such pictures was difficult “as families are oblivious of their histories or have moved cities and discarded photo albums.”

Despite this, Matthew has managed to put together a collection from travels across the country, and delivered a talk at a portraiture workshop at the Chennai Photo Biennale. Some of the gems she discovered include a studio picture of her grand-uncle who served; Major General N.K.D. Nanavati in mess regalia with his wife Sharda a little before his tragic death in a helicopter crash; Lt. Col. V.K. Sundaram in a Scouts uniform, an organisation he was passionate about; Lt. Col. Chakraborty posing easy in front of the Leaning Tower of Pisa; Col. P.C. Dasgupta on a gondola keeping out the Venetian sun with a pair of sunglasses; and Havildar Murga and Sepoy Samuel in a studio — the family says Murga was a strict parent and is keen to know where he fought.

These indistinct pictures lend depth to these men, tiny integers in a vast war, creating a human tapestry of those times. When she returns to the U.S. next month, Matthew will begin work on an upcoming exhibition of the project, after which she plans to focus on children separated from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. Until then, she hopes more people get in touch with her for the project that underlines that the past is never past.

248,2020/01/25,Initiatives and inaugurations: an interesting churn in the museum sphere,"For a grand cultural manifestation on Bengal and its pre-eminent position through the 19th century, the coverage of the opening of three new exhibition spaces has been oddly subdued. Drowned in the din of mass protests, Prime Minister Modi’s recent Kolkata initiative invites a revisit, if only because it signals a decisive announcement on museums. The demand for a museums policy is long-standing, and this is the first major pronouncement on it.

The public commitment to restoring five major museums and making the Indian Museum a ‘world museum’ has struck an unexpected note, even as debates around issues of demolishing, remaking and recasting art and architectural sites rage.

The Prime Minister set the note by inaugurating the restored old mint, or Currency Building, in Kolkata, with the exhibition ‘Ghare-Baire: The World, The Home and Beyond’, with over 800 art works from the colonial to the contemporary period. Recently restored by the ASI, the Mint, which was a condemned building, now has a new lease of life as MoBA or Museum of Bengal Art.

A redesigned portrait gallery in Victoria Memorial gives a place of prominence to Abanindranath Tagore’s 1905 poster titled ‘Bharat Mata’, and the desk on which Bankim Chandra is believed to have written ‘Vande Mataram’. The Prime Minister also visited Metcalfe Hall, a colonnaded building in the manner of Greek temples, which earlier housed a library owned by industrialist Dwarkanath Tagore and the grand Asiatic Society collection.

Flurry of events

He also inaugurated a show of works by Rabindranath Tagore, and archival photography by Lala Deen Dayal and Sunil Janah at Belvedere House, a historic 1828 building which was once the palace of the Viceroy of India.

This perceived initiative that has involved structural conservation as well as a refashioning of public interface, seems to belong to a larger churn in the museum sphere. In a flurry of events, the making of museums, the moving around of collections, and a rehistoricising of events are all under way. Already in Delhi, the refurbishing of the North and South Blocks as museums and the demolition of the National Museum building, all part of the Central Vista, have been announced.

As institutions pass through the process of relocation, a new vision of ‘heritage tourism’ is evidently coming into play, one that will dislodge fixed colonial or modern histories with newer intersections. Dislodging Jawaharlal Nehru’s occupancy of Teen Murti house to include an array of former Prime Ministers, introducing the ‘Kranti Mandir’ exhibitions at the Red Fort complex, which foreground the ideology of Veer Savarkar and Subhash Chandra Bose, among others, are among the first steps. In the same vein, Modi has also called for a Biplobi Bharat museum with Bengali freedom movement figures such as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Aurobindo Ghose, Rash Behari Bose, Chittaranjan Das and others. The museum is thus perceived as entrenched in a polyvocal national history. The Prime Minister has also spoken for the beautification of other historic museums across the country, such as the National Museum, Delhi; Madras Museum; Indian Museum, Kolkata; Hyderabad and Shri Pratap Singh Museum, Srinagar Museum.

In the flurry of activity, it may be necessary to take a larger view that would create a genuine museum culture. A trained cadre of museologists is urgently needed, and curators are alarmingly short. Experts are invited only sporadically. For several years now, major institutions have been run by IAS officers in uninspired tenures. The task of creating a world-class museum is indeed desirable, but the curatorial heft, the documentation and programming all have to work in tandem.

Weight of inertia

Much like the proposed Central Vista project, the ideas around museums are still not in the public domain. It may be worthwhile for the government to consider the number of museums it already runs, many of which are collapsing under the weight of public inertia. In the heart of the capital, the Supreme Court Museum, the Dolls Museum and Gandhi Smriti, to name a few, have received little or no worthwhile attention. The important question then is whether India is not proferring its own model of the museum, which is not the monolithic capital-intensive model of the West, but the smaller, home-grown initiative. In the new millennium, at least 50 such have come up, which record the idiosyncratic, the domestic and the traumatic, with modest budgets but passionate commitment.

To bring the public into museums will need a far more concerted effort. On Kolkata’s arterial Chowringhee, a virtual hawker’s market crowds the Indian Museum for a mile on either side, a noisy hub of shoppers and browsers. How many of them step into the 200-year-old institution, with its extraordinary Bharhut and Gandhara galleries?

249,2020/01/25,Assam police file case against former JNU student Sharjeel Imam,"The Assam police have registered a case against Sharjeel Imam, the alleged mastermind of the Shaheen Bagh protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and former Jawaharlal Nehru University student, for his “hate speech” against the State.

“An FIR has been filed at the Guwahati Crime Branch police station against him for his speech...under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, read with the relevant Sections of the IPC,” Additional DGP (Law and Order) G.P. Singh said on Saturday.

Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma earlier said the State decided to file a case against him on the basis of a video, in which he was heard “instigating people” to cut Assam off India.

The police in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, have registered an FIR against Mr. Imam for the speech at Aligarh Muslim University on January 16. In a video of the speech, he could be heard inciting Muslims to “cut off Assam from India” by occupying the “Muslim-dominated Chicken’s Neck”. The 22-km Siliguri Corridor, or Chicken’s Neck, in West Bengal connects the northeastern States to the rest of India.

The decision follows a complaint that personnel of the Assam Rifles assaulted and misbehaved with a woman IPS officer at the Khudengthabi check post, near the Manipur-Myanmar border, on January 19. Reports said Rifleman P.K. Pandey of 12 Assam Rifles led the team at the check post. The Assam Rifles, however, has denied the charges.

Government spokesperson T. Biswajit said there had been earlier allegations, including from Ministers, of misbehaviour by Assam Rifles personnel.

251,2020/01/25,FIR against 100 in Lucknow,"The Uttar Pradesh police on Saturday filed a first information report (FIR) against more than 100 persons for violating prohibitory orders and participating in a demonstration here on Friday.

The FIR, filed at the Thakurganj station, has named 10 persons, including Kalbe Sibtain, son of prominent Shia cleric and All India Muslim Personal Law Board vice-president Kalbe Sadiq. It invokes several Sections of the Indian Penal Code and Section 7 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act.

According to the FIR, around 6 p.m. on Friday, hundreds of persons suddenly assembled at Hussainabad Clock Tower, the site of the “illegal dharna” being staged by the women against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The men were wielding sticks and raised slogans against the CAA and a pan-India National Register of Citizens.

It said they held up traffic by parking their cars near the site and took out a march around the clock tower, raising “provocative” slogans. When the police ordered them to stop, they raised “provocative and inflammatory” slogans and pressed ahead.

On Saturday, policemen marched around the site and dispersed men standing there, as seen in videos circulated on social media. A senior police officer was heard ordering bystanders through a loudspeaker to leave the site or face action.

A woman protester told presspersons that they were protesting “peacefully” when the police came to the site and detained several of the male volunteers.

The police allegedly detained Samajwadi Party youth leader Pooja Shukla, who was named in an earlier FIR for the protest, when she intervened.

Mr. Kalbe Sadiq visited the site, despite his ill health, to express solidarity with the protesters. Talking to presspersons, he cautioned the protesters against the “people planted” to tarnish their protest.

Additional DCP (West) Vikas Chandra Tripathi said eight persons, including a woman, were arrested from the protest site on the charge of obstructing official work and leading an “illegal” march on Friday. Some of the arrested persons were booked on Friday for leading a march at the site of the protest, he said.

252,2020/01/25,Assam: NDFB chief released ahead of talks for more concessions to Bodos,"Ranjan Daimary, founder-chairman of the extremist group National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB), was released on an interim bail ahead of a “comprehensive agreement” in New Delhi expected to yield a slew of concessions for the Bodo tribal people.

The negotiations toward a peace deal are likely to be held in New Delhi on Monday.

The Gauhati High Court had on Friday granted a four-week interim bail to the head of the NDFB (Ranjan) faction after splits in the organisation since 2009. He was serving life imprisonment in a case related to the 2008 serial blasts that killed 84 and wounded 540 people.

“Our chairman hopes to ensure that the Bodo people, marginalised and victimised in Assam for decades, get a good deal toward greater development,” a member of the group said after meeting Mr. Daimary before he left for New Delhi for the talks next week.

Leaders of the Saoraigwra faction of the NDFB, many of whose members including its chairman B. Saoraigwra faction came overground more than a week ago and the NDFB (Progressive), are also scheduled to be part of the peace deal with the Centre. Representatives of civil society groups such as the All Bodo Students’ Union and the Bodo Sahitya Sabha are expected to attend too.

It’s speculated the deal could see the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) being given more powers and its area expanded. The Bodo groups have also been demanding the increase in the number of Parliament and Assembly seats in BTC and areas beyond with sizeable population of the community.

A large part of the BTC area comes under the Kokrajhar Lok Sabha seat. The rest is divided among adjoining seats where non-Bodos are in a majority. The BTC areas have 12 Assembly constituencies, some of them extending beyond the council’s boundary.

Bodo groups have indicated that any agreement would not be final until the Bodos get a separate state. The largest plains tribe in the northeast, the Bodos have been fighting for statehood since 1967 with the call to “divide Assam 50-50”.

“We support the demand for a Bodoland state,” said Taren Boro, president of the Bodo Sahitya Sabha.

The possibility of more power and concessions to the Bodoland council has made the non-Bodos uneasy. “Any agreement that eventually results in the curtailment of rights of the non-Bodos will not be acceptable to us,” the Sanmilita Janagosthiya Aikya Mancha, umbrella organisation of 19 non-Bodo groups, said in a statement.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/8dkitz/article30652589.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RANJANDAIMARY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-ndfb-chief-released-ahead-of-talks-for-more-concessions-to-bodos/article30652590.ece
253,2020/01/25,All leaders know that their phones are tapped: Pawar,"NCP president Sharad Pawar on Saturday said that all political leaders know that their phones are tapped, which is why they do not think about it seriously.

His comments come a day after Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh accused the previous BJP-led state government of tapping phones of senior NCP and Congress leaders during the 2019 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls.

“It is not new, we all know our phones are tapped. Hence, we never thought about it seriously,” Mr. Pawar told reporters here.

Former Maharashtra Chief Minister and BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis had rejected on Friday Mr. Deshmukh’s allegation saying that phone tapping was not the culture of the state and his government had not given any such orders.

254,2020/01/25,"Dharmashala stands, but not many travellers as the community shrinks","“Manackjee Rustomjee Dharmashala for Parsi travellers” — the inscription in an old-fashioned font on the doorway transports one to the days when accommodation wasn’t pre-booked online and travel itself was fraught with uncertainties.

The building itself, with slatted windows, belongs to that era, and so does the neighbourhood where it stands — Kolkata’s famous Bow Barracks, located off the busy Central Avenue. The dharmashala is one of those leftovers of time that still remains in business — a living testament to the Parsi community in the city — though there aren’t too many Parsis in the country today, leave alone travellers, to avail themselves of the facility.

“Once upon a time tourists came to Kolkata, spent a couple of days here and went on to Darjeeling and the northeast. But now many cities are directly connected to Bagdogra (gateway to the northeast), so people hardly come to Kolkata,” says Dara Hansotia, who hails from Ahmedabad and has been the manager of the dharmashala since 2014.

“Also, now when people come to the city on work, they are put up in hotels by their companies,” he says. Even then, according to Mr. Hansotia, the facility, with 13 operational rooms, hosts about 30 people every month. A double room costs ₹1,150 and single ₹950, inclusive of breakfast.

Though the rooms are available only to the Parsis, the dining hall is open to all: just about anyone can walk in to get a flavour of Parsi cuisine, provided they have placed their order well in advance with Mr. Hansotia, who loves cooking and briefly looked after catering at the dharmashala before being appointed its manager.

Does he remember this place being ever packed to capacity? “On two occasions,” Mr. Hansotia’s wife Meher replies. “Once in 2014, when three Parsi weddings were held simultaneously in the city, and again in 2017, when a tournament of five Parsi cricket teams was held in Kolkata. One was the local team, and of the remaining four, one stayed at the fire temple and three with us.”

The dharmashala was originally built in 1909 in the memory of Manackjee Rustomjee by his friends living in Bombay, Calcutta and China. The rent was eight annas a day. In 1936, that building was demolished and the present structure constructed by architect and civil engineer Ardeshir Dinshaw Vehvalvala, and the rent hiked to 12 annas. Today it is run by a trust called the Calcutta Zoroastrian Community’s Religious and Charity Fund.

According to Mr. Hansotia, there were about 3,000 Parsis in Kolkata until a few decades ago, and now the number stands at around 400, almost half of it consisting of the elderly. As one of the nodal persons of the community, he is also expected to conduct funerals. At the Tower of Silence, he says, solar panels are used these days to disintegrate a body because vultures have almost disappeared.

Mrs. Hansotia believes that focus on career is partially responsible for the dwindling population. “Youngsters these days don’t want to marry early because they want to build a career, and by the time they are ready to marry there is no suitable candidate within the community. We are quite horrified about the future,” she says.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/t3ipxq/article30651632.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG2912,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dharmashala-stands-but-not-many-travellers-as-the-community-shrinks/article30651633.ece
255,2020/01/25,Rajasthan Assembly passes resolution against CAA,"The Rajasthan Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution urging the Union government to repeal the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), making the State the third one, after Kerala and Punjab, to confront the Centre on the issue. The resolution was passed by voice vote after a five-hour debate during which the BJP accused the ruling Congress of indulging in appeasement politics.

The House also asked the Centre to withdraw the new fields of information which have been sought for updating the National Population Register (NPR) 2020. The CAA violated the provisions of the Constitution and discriminated against people on religious grounds in the grant of citizenship, asserted Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal, while moving the resolution.

“The CAA is an onslaught on the secular structure of the Constitution,” Mr. Dhariwal said. “The Centre has not framed rules under the Act because it knows that they too will be challenged in the court... The CAA should not be implemented until the Supreme Court delivers its verdict on the petitions against the impugned amendment,” he added.

BJP members moved to the well of the House and raised slogans against the resolution. Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria said the State Assembly was not empowered to challenge a statute enacted by the Parliament and that citizenship was a matter under the Centre. He said the Congress should stop appeasing a particular community and doing “vote bank politics”.

Rajasthan’s resolution is the first legislative document incorporating objections to the NPR and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). Asking the Centre to start the Census work only after withdrawal of the new NPR questionnaire, the House in its resolution stated that a substantial section of the population believed that the NPR and the NRC had the same base as the CAA.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the CAA was the first law enacted in the history of the country that had discriminated on the ground of religion in violation of the constitutional provisions. “The CAA should be repealed because it violates Article 14 laying down equality before law and equal protection of laws,” he tweeted shortly after the resolution was passed.

“A large number of States have been opposing CAA-NRC, keeping in mind the public opinion at large. It is the duty of the Centre to keep the federal structure intact and strong. I urge the NDA government to withdraw the Act... The government should not make it a prestige issue,” Mr. Gehlot said.

While Mr. Gehlot asserted that the CAA was aimed at changing the basic principle of secularism, the House in its resolution said the people would face inconvenience with the proposed additional information sought under the NPR. “Assam is a live example of this. Large-scale protests are taking place all over the country. No provision has been made regarding migrants from neighbouring countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal and Bhutan, which raises many questions,” the Assembly said.

Earlier in the day, the Assembly ratified the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill passed by the Parliament last month for extending reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies for another 10 years.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/l8qgvr/article30651562.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJASTHANASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rajasthan-assembly-passes-resolution-against-caa/article30651563.ece
256,2020/01/25,Centre likely to sign accord with Bodo group NDFB on Monday,"The Centre is all set to sign an accord with the banned Assam-based insurgent group National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) on Monday giving political and economic provisions to the tribals. However, the outfit’s key demand of a separate Bodoland State or Union Territory will noe be entertained, said an official.

The tripartite agreement will be signed in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal by top leadership of the four factions of the NDFB, Joint Secretary in the Home Ministry Satyendra Garg and Assam Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna.

“The accord will provide for some political rights to the Bodo tribals living in Assam and some economic package for the community,” a senior official privy to the development said.

However, the official made it clear that the territorial integrity of Assam will be maintained and the key demand of the NDFB, which is either a separate State or a UT, is not going to be entertained.

“The accord will be within the framework of the Constitution without splitting the state,” another official said.

'No-UT status for Bodo-dominated areas'

Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma clarified that the Centre would not upgrade the state’s ‘Bodoland Territorial Area Districts’ (BTAD) to a Union Territory, as part of a new peace accord likely to be inked between various stakeholders and the Centre.

Addressing a press meet here, Mr. Sarma, who is also the North-East Democratic Alliance convener, said no new village or area would be added to the BTAD under the new accord.

“The Centre has informed the State government that no Union Territory will be created or new areas be added to the BTAD, but the accord will ensure that the territorial integrity of Assam is maintained,” he told reporters.

People of Assam should be rest assured that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah would not agree to the division of Assam, he stated.

The four factions of the NDFB, which will sign the pact, are led by Ranjan Daimari, Govinda Basumatary, Dhiren Boro and B. Saoraigra.

Some NDFB militants were part of the 644 militants who surrendered in Guwahati on Thursday before Chief Minister Sonowal.

However, it is immediately not clear whether the status of the existing Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) will be enhanced under the accord.

It will be the third Bodo accord to be signed in last 27 years when the violent movement for a separate Bodoland State claimed hundreds of lives, destruction of public and private properties.

257,2020/01/25,"Mistaken for CAA, NRC surveyors, people held hostage in Bihar","As the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR) protests are spreading in different parts of Bihar, people engaged in conducting surveys for private research and marketing companies are being mistakenly held hostages by people amid apprehensions of being attacked.

A survey team of 12 people, including four women, doing research work for Lucknow-based Morsel Research and Development Pvt. Ltd. on behalf of a Ph.D researcher of Yale University in U.S., were held hostages for hours on Friday in Jhagarua village under Jamalpur police station of Darbhanga district.

The Ph.D scholar, Shikhar Singh, is said to be doing research at Yale University on the topic of “Role of social identity in political preferences”.

The villagers had held them hostage on the assumption that they were affiliated to a particular political party and conducting survey in support of the CAA and the NRC.

“Getting information, we quickly reached the place and took them out of the village…had we been late, they would have been attacked by the villagers,” said Jamalpur police station officer Anwar Ansari.

Second incident

Local people in Darbhanga told The Hindu that this was the second incident in the district in the last 10 days.

“On January 17 also, a man conducting some survey for a Gurgaon-based television company was attacked by people in Karamaganj locality of Darbhanga town area as the attackers mistook him for collecting data for the CAA and the NRC,” a local journalist said. He was identified as Prince Singh and handed over to the police.

Similar incidents of “mistaken hostages” of people engaged in some private research or marketing surveys have come from others districts such as Champaran, Begusarai and Bhagalpur.

“Even if we’re not being attacked or held hostages at some places, people get angry and ask us to get lost the moment we begin our questionnaire…yes, at some places they get violent too,” Binit Kumar, a young man engaged in such surveys, told The Hindu.

“In the present volatile atmosphere in view of the anti-CAA, NRC protests in different corners of the State, there is danger lurking for those people hired and engaged by private companies for field research work to be held hostages and attacked,” a senior police official said, while adding, “I would suggest that they stay away from such work for some time”.

“In view of the CAA-NRC-NPR there is lot of anger and protests going in the different parts of the State…people seem to be seething with rage against this law,” retired Patna University professor and social activist N.K. Singh said.

260,2020/01/25,Smart Villages scheme: Maharashtra government to increase prize money,"The State Rural Development Department has decided to increase the cash prizes handed over to top villages at the taluka and district levels under a government scheme and name it after R.R.

261,2020/01/25,"'Poha a poor man's meal, indispensable to Indore'","As a group of labourers ate Indori poha — for which vendors are seeking a GI tag — heaped over a plate in their centre, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya claimed they were Bangladeshi migrants, and had to be extradited. Yet, the city’s residents claim the flattened rice dish is very much their own, affords them a headstart each morning and remains indispensable to the local cuisine.

“I got suspicious which country are they from that they eat poha filling plates like this,” said Mr. Vijayvargiya at a meeting to spread awareness on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. “You don’t know where all infiltrators could be.”

Pushpesh Pant, food critic and historian, said poha is the city’s signature dish, a nutritious cereal breakfast. Yet, it’s origins lie in the realm of conjecture - though still in India.

“The Holkars and Scindias came to Madhya Pradesh from Maharashtra where the dish is popular. In Madhya Pradesh, wherever Maratha rulers went you can find common dishes like shrikhand and poha. So, it is logical to assume marathas warriors brought it to the north india and the Malwa region,” he said.

A possible reference to poha is also made in the epic Mahabharata, when Sudama offered it to his childhood friend Krishna.

While the dish is blended with potatoes or curd in Maharashtra, in Madhya Pradesh, especially in the Nimar-Malwa region, either bhujiya is sprinkled on the top, or jalebi or kachori is crushed with it, resulting in a tangy blend. “The Ratlam district, close to Indore, is famous for sev, hence the bhujiya touch. It lends a texture, a crunchy taste to poha which is otherwise soft. And chillies or peanuts help variate it seasonally,”

The easy availability of Poha of streets, and labourers' dependence on it, claims Mr. Pant, is an incorporation of urbanised living. “The poor mostly have roti, daal and chawal before going to fields in villages. But, when they come to a city, they must change their diet. So, poha comes up as a low cost, filling meal,” he said.

“Labourers eat it because it’s cheaper. And they can have it the way they want,” he said, of the staple breakfast sold for Rs. 10 a plate on the streets in Indore.

262,2020/01/25,Ex-IAF officer files police complaint for Facebook ‘defamation’,"A former Indian Air Force (IAF) sergeant has lodged an FIR against three persons for “showing disrespect” to the IAF uniform and “trying to defame” him by uploading and sharing a morphed photograph on Facebook. Himangshu Gogoi, who quit the IAF to participate in the movement against the CAA filed the complaint at the Panbazar police station in Guwahati.

He also named Rahul Das and Shruti Choudhury in his complaint for sharing the morphed photo to various groups and individuals. Their act, he said, was “objectionable” and in “violation of the principles of the Air Force of the country”.

Such type of disregard to the uniform may cause serious damage to the morale of the entire Air Force community as well as the other defence organisations of the country, Gogoi said.

“Also, it may cause a serious threat to dignity, security and sovereignty of the country,”he said, seeking the immediate arrest of the trio to “safeguard the dignity of the Indian Air Force” and steps to prevent the morphed photograph from being circulated.

Gogoi told The Hindu that he would be going on a bicycle tour from Assam to New Delhi for drumming up support against the CAA. “I have taken voluntary retirement from the IAF to protest this law and had begun cycling for the cause. I have paused briefly and would resume the tour when the situation is right,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ex-iaf-officer-files-police-complaint-for-facebook-defamation/article30647845.ece
263,2020/01/25,268 Bangladeshis held while trying to cross border: BSF,"The South Bengal unit of the BSF has apprehended 268 Bangladeshi nationals along the border in the first 24 days of this year.

Speaking to journalists on Friday, Inspector General of the South Bengal Frontier of the BSF Y.B. Khurania said there had been an increase in the outflow of Bangladeshi migrants in last month. He indicated that most of them were arrested while crossing over to Bangladesh.

Earlier, Border Guards Bangladesh, indicated that it had caught about 1,000 Bangladeshis who went out of the country illegally.

While the BSF officials did not comment on whether the increased apprehensions of Bangladeshi nationals was linked to the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the figures indicate a spike in the arrests in recent months as compared to the previous year. According to the BSF, in 2019, it had arrested 2,194 Bangladeshi nationals along the border.

BSF officials said Bangladeshi nationals were not only arrested for crossing in and out of the country but for also smuggling goods and cattle. Hundreds of Indians were also arrested for the same, the BSF added. In January 2020, the number of Indians arrested in border smuggling or for crossing over to the other side is 29.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/268-bangladeshis-held-while-trying-to-cross-border-bsf/article30646636.ece
264,2020/01/25,"Manipur, Assam groups take divergent approach to NSCN (IM)","Groups in Manipur and Assam have taken divergent approach to dealing with the “territorial threat” perceived to be etched on the final settlement with the Isak-Muivah faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, or NSCN (IM), expected soon.

The Naga peace process began with the NSCN (IM) declaring a truce in July 1997. A solution has been elusive despite several rounds of talks since.

A team from the Coordinating Committee on Manipur Integrity (COCOMI), a ‘nationalist’ group based in Manipur capital Imphal, on January 21, visited the NSCN (IM) headquarters at Hebron near Nagaland’s Dimapur town and met the Naga outfit’s general secretary, Thuingaleng Muivah, and other senior leaders.

“We agreed unanimously to work together for peaceful co-existence among different communities of Manipur and to shape a future for the Northeast without letting a third party, the Government of India, interfere,” COCOMI convenor Sunil Karam said.

This is believed to be a significant development in a State with a history of cold conflict between the Meitei community dominating the Imphal Valley and the Nagas inhabiting the hills around. A majority of the members of the NSCN (IM) are from the hills of Manipur.

On the other hand, the extremist Dimasa National Liberation Army (DNLA) operating out of central Assam’s Dima Hasao district, vowed to oppose any territorial threat the Naga peace deal might bring. In a statement on Thursday evening, its publicity secretary Ringsmai Dimasa announced a 24-hour shutdown in Dima Hasao and adjoining Karbi Anglong districts to mark the “martyrdom” of two people in an anti-Naga Accord protest on January 25, 2018.

January 25 is commemorated as Dimasa Martyrs Day in honour of Probanta Hakmaosa and Mithun Dibragede who were killed in police firing during a protest triggered by a report that the Naga peace deal would lead to taking away large swathes of land where the Dimasa tribal people live in Assam.

The DNSA also opposed the setting up of a detention camp in Dima Hasao district for people excluded from the National Register of Citizens.

R-Day shutdown

The chiefs of six extremist groups, in a joint statement issued on Thursday night, announced the boycott of “India Republic Day” celebration and a 12-hour shutdown across Western South East Asia (WESEA) on January 26.

The United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent, led by the elusive Paresh Baruah had given a separate boycott call.

The joint statement was signed by Sainkupar Nongtraw, general secretary of the Hynniutrep National Liberation Council (Meghalaya); N. Oken, chairman of the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup and K. Laba Meitei, president of the Kangleipak Communist Party (both Manipur); H. Uastwng Borok, president of the National Liberation Front of Twipra (Tripura); Jiban Singh Koch, chairman of the Kamatapur Liberation Organisation (Assam and West Bengal) and J.K. Lijang, chairman of the People’s Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (Assam).

The Manipur-based Socialist Democratic Front of Kukiland, a group of Kuki extremist outfits not on talks mode, has also called for a boycott of Republic Day in “all Kuki-dominated territories in India”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/y1rv8w/article30646607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-NSCN-IMCadres,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-assam-groups-take-divergent-approach-to-nscn-im/article30646598.ece
265,2020/01/25,Delhi police say no change in security at Pawar residence after NCP raises issue,"The Delhi Police on Friday denied news reports that said security provided at the official residence of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar in New Delhi had been withdrawn.

I. D. Shukla, Joint Commissioner of Police (Security), Delhi, asserted in the evening that there had been no such development as reported by the media with regard to the security at Mr. Pawar’s residence.

Earlier on Friday, the NCP slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - led central government over the news reports about withdrawal of security at Mr. Pawar’s New Delhi residence and said the move reflected the BJP’s ‘vindictive’ nature.

“The change of government in Maharashtra has not gone down too well with the BJP and it is behaving in a vindictive manner,” NCP State unit chief and Irrigation minister Jayant Patil said in a statement. “This is not the manner in which we ever behaved against our opposition. This news of withdrawing security is extremely worrisome,” he added.

NCP leader and Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad told reporters that even if the news of withdrawal of security at the NCP chief’s house was true, every party worker would stand as a shield to protect Mr. Pawar. “Each and every one of us is capable of protecting our leader, irrespective of whether police security is provided or not,” he asserted.

The minister said that the Congress-NCP government had never behaved in a vindictive manner with any of the opposition leaders. “Former CM Devendra Fadnavis has still been given the security that he had while working as the Chief Minister,” he asserted.

Reacting to the reports, Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut said it could have been because Mr. Pawar was instrumental in forming the Shiv Sena-led government in the State.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rh3zl/article30646511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25TH-PAWAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ncp-claims-security-to-pawar-in-delhi-withdrawn-officials-deny/article30646512.ece

To show the world his undying love, he has erected her statue, along with his own, at the village’s cremation ground. His wife, Sumati Dalai died in 2010.

“I did not want even the statue of my wife to stand alone at the cremation ground. So I decided to have one of my own by its side so that she never feels lonely,” said Dalai. He says Sumati had made him promise that he will never leave her company even after her death.

Dalai tends to the statue of his wife as if she were alive. Despite his advanced age, he reaches the cremation ground every morning with a bucket of water in one hand and a lathi in the other to support his body. He washes the statue and wipes it clean it with a fresh napkin. At times he hugs and pats it. At meal time, he serves food in two plates. He eats his meals at the funeral ground.

Their two sons and a daughter are married. He was first employed as a labour contractor sending workers to Burma. He later became a construction contractor.

According to locals, Dalai spends much of his time murmuring words of love to the statue.

268,2020/01/25,BJP boycotts Governor’s address in Rajasthan Assembly,"The Opposition BJP on Friday boycotted the customary address of Governor Kalraj Mishra in the Rajasthan Assembly on the first day of the new session, with the BJP members accusing the Congress government of flouting the rules for convening the session.

The session, which is set to be extended for presentation of the State Budget, was called mainly to pass a resolution against the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Assembly is also scheduled to ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill passed by the Parliament, for extending reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies by another 10 years.

As soon as Mr. Mishra started delivering his address, Leader of the Opposition Gulab Chand Kataria raised an objection over the session having been called without prior notice of 21 days. He said the session had been “hurriedly convened” to meet the deadline for ratification of the Amendment Bill by January 25.

Interrupting the Governor’s speech, Mr. Kataria said the State government wanted to save itself from embarrassment over the lack of prompt action after the Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on December 12, 2019. “The government woke up suddenly and decided to call the session without giving sufficient time to the members to make preparations,” he asserted.

The BJP MLAs raised slogans and staged a walkout, as Mr. Mishra, unfazed by the disorder, continued to deliver his speech. Mr. Mishra highlighted the steps being taken by the State government to redress people’s grievances, promote industrial development, control the crime rate and strengthen the agriculture sector by extending the benefits of various schemes to the farmers.

The resolution against the implementation of CAA will be introduced and debated in the House on Saturday. The State Cabinet was giving final shape to the resolution, according to sources in the Chief Minister’s Office.

BJP MLA from Nokha, Bihari Lal, carried a basket filled with locusts into the Assembly building to highlight his demand for expediting the distribution of compensation to the farmers whose crops were damaged on a large scale in the recent locust attacks in 11 districts.

The FIR lodged at the Gomti Nagar police station names five persons while 100-125 have been listed as unidentified.

The FIR evokes Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy), 145 (joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing it has been commanded to disperse) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.

This is the fourth such FIR registered by the police against protesters in Lucknow.

The police have named around two dozen persons in the FIRs, while more than 135 are unidentified protesters. Most of those named in the FIRs are women and include Sumaiya Rana and Fauzia Rana, daughters of well-known Urdu poet Munawwar Rana, a Sahitya Akademi Award winner.

273,2020/01/25,England powers closer to series victory,"Mark Wood starred as England took a huge stride towards securing a series win when it dominated the second day of the fourth and final Test against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium on Saturday. England posted a first innings total of 400 before reducing South Africa to 88 for six by the close.

Two century partnerships and a boisterous last-wicket stand of 82 took England to a total which almost certainly put the match beyond South Africa.

Then it was the turn of the bowlers, led by Wood, as England pushed for a third successive win in a series which it leads 2-1.

The host finished the day still 312 runs behind, with Quinton de Kock its only consistent batsman during the series, seeking to give the innings some respectability on Sunday.

Wood made the first breakthrough when he had Pieter Malan caught behind for 15. He followed up with the wicket of the recalled Temba Bavuma, then finished the day on a high when nightwatchman Anrich Nortje was caught at gully in the last over of the day. He had figures of three for 21.

274,2020/01/25,Pakistan Cricket Board refutes reports of boycott,"Wasim Khan, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive officer, has rubbished reports claiming that Pakistan won’t send its team to India for the 2021 T20 World Cup if the BCCI doesn’t allow its team to tour Pakistan in the Asia Cup later this year.

“This has been completely taken out of context. Even though we would still want to host the Asia Cup in Pakistan, the Asian Cricket Council needs to decide on what it will do about the matches involving India,” Khan told The Hindu from Lahore on Saturday.

Earlier reports

Earlier, reports claimed that PCB would skip the World Cup T20 — to be held in India next year — if Indian team didn’t travel to Pakistan for the Asia Cup. “It’s absolutely incorrect. What I would like to say is that, we are concerned about security issues and also there could be issues in attaining visas. But we are confident that things will ease out over the period of time,” Khan said, making it clear that there’s no question of pulling out from the T20 World Cup, which is an ICC event.

Neutral venue

India had hosted the Asia Cup at a neutral venue — in the UAE — in 2018, and this time too, there is uncertainty on whether India would get clearance from the government to travel to Pakistan owing to security issues. That’s where there is a possibility of the matches being held at neutral venues. “These are the issues, which the ACC will have to look into and decide accordingly,” Khan added.

India has not toured Pakistan since 2008, while it has also not played a full Test bilateral series with the neighbouring country since 2007 due to strained political and diplomatic relations. Pakistan did visit India in 2012 to play a short limited-overs series. However, the two sides have met in Asia Cup and ICC events over the last few years.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gaubd9/article30651313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WASIMKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pcb-refutes-reports-of-boycott/article30653183.ece
275,2020/01/25,Goud back to where it began,"For 15 years, Yere Goud made the Karnail Singh Stadium here his home. On Saturday he was back, this time leading Karnataka and trying to plot Railways’ — the host and his erstwhile employer — defeat.

Karnataka had a good beginning to the season, winning the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (T20), and Vijay Hazare (one-dayers) and the opening Ranji Trophy fixture before drawing the next two at home. A win and then another draw highlight the team’s struggles in finding consistency. Goud, who took charge last season, is hoping to hit the right notes as the competition enters the business end.

“It feels good. Sort of a homecoming for me. More than 100 games for Railways, 15 years on this ground, it is special. Harvinder Singh on the opposite bench makes it more special. We were together when Railways won those two titles and are still part of the Railways veterans group. So it is good to match up on-field,” Goud said while overseeing Karnataka’s first practice session here.

Just the same

Of the 105 Ranji matches Goud played for Railways, 49 were at this ground, with 2654 runs at an average of 42.12. No wonder, he knows every nook and corner of the field. How much have things changed? “Well, the pitch has been relaid and so is expected to be different. But other than that, nothing has changed here since then. It’s more or less just the same as I left it,” he smiled.

And that, for him, would be an advantage in terms of passing insider information to the youngsters in his side. “Some of the senior players have already faced Railways here. For youngsters like Devdutt (Padikkal) or Sharath Srinivas, I can give some inputs on what can be the scoring areas and the kind of ground and pitch that can be expected at Karnail Singh,” he added.

Helping hand

Goud, though, understands that things have changed since he last played and so is thankful for the added experience that someone like Sreenath Aravind brings to the side. The medium-pacer called it a day two years ago and immediately joined the side as bowling coach. Goud admitted that the immediacy helps players.

“The nature of the game has changed and so, when you have that recent experience, it helps the players understand better and get immediate results. Aravind has played with Abhimanyu Mithun and Ronit More and so can explain things better. I am glad that, as a medium-pace unit, we are showing the progress we wanted at start of the season,” he said.

Gowtham boost

The visitor would be boosted by the return of off-spinner K. Gowtham, joining the side on Saturday night after being declared fit by the NCA after a fitness test on Friday. Gowtham, who picked up 14 wickets in the season opening win against Tamil Nadu, had been out since then with a right toe injury.

“Gowtham will be here at practice tomorrow. We have missed him in the last four games and were desperately wanting him back. He is our main spinner and will definitely be in the playing XI,” Goud confirmed.

Bolstered

Meanwhile, Railways was bolstered by the return of Mahesh Rawat. The experienced batsman-wicketkeeper, who joined the team for Saturday’s practice for the first time this season, had along with others including Ashish Yadav and Anureet Singh fallen out of favour with the RSPB after complaining against selection and administrative issues. Anureet subsequently sought an NOC and is playing for Baroda this season.

The team is also likely to continue with List A captain Arindam Ghosh in charge with original captain Karn Sharma continuing to be ruled out of action with a groin strain.

276,2020/01/25,"We will not travel to India for T20 World Cup if they won’t come to Pak for Asia Cup, says PCB","PCB Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Wasim Khan on Saturday said they will not send their team to India for the 2021 T20 World Cup if the BCCI won’t send its team to Pakistan for the Asia Cup T20 in September this year.

“If India doesn’t come to Pakistan for the Asia Cup, we would also refuse participation in the 2021 T20 World Cup there,” Khan told reporters in Lahore.

The senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official dismissed reports that PCB had given up Asia Cup hosting rights to BCB in exchange for Bangladesh sending its team to Pakistan.

“The hosting rights have been given to us by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) and we can’t just hand them over to anyone. We don’t have that authority,” he said.

Khan, however, conceded that due to issues with India currently two venues are being considered for hosting the Asia Cup.

India has not toured Pakistan since 2008 while it has also not played a full Test bilateral series with Pakistan since 2007 due to strained political and diplomatic relations. Pakistan did visit India in 2012 to play a short limited-overs series.

Cricket experts say the main hurdle to Pakistan hosting the Asia Cup will be whether India agrees to play in the country due to security issues.

Khan also confirmed that a security delegation from Cricket South Africa would be visiting Pakistan in February to take stock of the security situation as Pakistan has invited the Proteas for a three-match T20 series in Pakistan in March-April after the Pakistan Super League.

Referring to the visit of ICC Chief Executive to Islamabad and Lahore earlier this week, Khan said PCB would try to get hosting rights of at least three ICC events between 2023 and 2031.

He also said that Marylebone Cricket Club would be sending its team to Lahore to play four matches and the team would include prominent players such as Moeen Ali, Kumar Sangakara and Ravi Bopara.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gaubd9/article30651313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/WASIMKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/we-will-not-travel-to-india-for-t20-world-cup-if-they-wont-come-to-pak-for-asia-cup-says-pcb/article30651314.ece
277,2020/01/25,2nd T20 | India look to extend advantage over New Zealand at high-scoring Eden Park,"India are unlikely to change a winning combination but a few changes in the bowling department won’t come as a surprise when the visitors take on New Zealand in the second T20 at the high-scoring Eden Park here on Sunday.

Jasprit Bumrah was the only bowler on either side to concede less than eight runs per over at the peculiar shaped ground with short boundaries in the series opener on Friday.

Both Mohammad Shami (0/53 in 4 overs) and Shardul Thakur (1/44 in 3 overs) were taken to the cleaners with the New Zealand batsmen using their pace to collect boundaries at will.

Since Shami is expected to retain his place in the playing eleven, Thakur might make way for Navdeep Saini. However, Saini, with his extra pace, too could go for big runs at the small ground.

It remains to be seen whether India stick to three specialist pacers and two spinners combination or bring in an extra tweaker in Kuldeep Yadav to partner Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravindra Jadeja. Washington Sundar is the the other spin option India have.

If India do play an extra tweaker, all-rounder Shivam Dube will be third seam bowling option.

Considering the conditions, Jadeja and Chahal had done a decent job on Friday, conceding 50 runs off 36 balls and taking a wicket each.

Additionally, Chahal and Kuldeep are yet to play together since the ODI World Cup ended. With the batting bearing a settled look, the team management might be keen to take a punt on their reunion.

On the batting front, Virat Kohli was a pleased skipper as the much scrutinised middle-order delivered for the team under pressure. Shreyas Iyer solidified his position at number four with an unbeaten 58 off 29 balls.

It was a near perfect start of the tour for the away team which chased down 204 with relative ease to go 1-0 up in the five-match series.

Settled batting line-up

Ahead of the Indian team’s departure, there was concern about constant shuffling, much like the ODI experimentation ahead of the 2019 World Cup.

Iyer’s form has put paid to all that chatter. The batsman has figured in all of India’s 12 T20Is since September last year, averaging 34.14 in 11 innings with two half-centuries and strike-rate of 154.19. With his match-winning temperament at Eden Park, Iyer has stitched down a spot in the batting line-up for good.

As Manish Pandey and Dube alternate in finishing duties, aided by KL Rahul’s wicket-keeping skills, India’s T20 batting line-up finally seems set in the short term barring unforeseen changes.

New Zealand were left pondering about a shortage of 10-15 runs to their total as well as missed chances in the field that allowed the visiting batsmen to get away with a high scoring rate.

Partly, it also had to do with India’s surprisingly quick adaptation to the awkward conditions on offer at Eden Park.

In turn, the Black Caps themselves now have to come to terms with India’s adaptation if they are to prevent an early 2-0 lead within three days. India had also won here in February 2019, albeit it was a three-match T20I series they had eventually lost 1-2.

Irrespective of the result, the tide seemed to turn for the hosts in terms of their batting form. Senior batsmen Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor defied recent criticism to score attacking half-centuries. It complimented their top-order’s runs, albeit they only finished with a par score.

India won key battles during their innings in that new batsmen at the crease were able to maintain the momentum previously generated. It is something New Zealand cannot simply fix with a change in personnel. As such they will be hoping the likes of Colin de Grandhomme and Tim Seifert come good.

There is a school of thought in the hosts’ camp that Williamson should open the batting in T20 cricket, thus taking advantage of the powerplay overs. Given the lightning start provided by openers Martin Guptill and Colin Munro, this seems infeasible for the next game, atleast.

New Zealand expect to field the same eleven, avoiding any temptation to take a look at all-rounders Scott Kuggeleijn and Daryl Mitchell.

Both teams enjoyed a day off on Saturday in lieu of the tight schedule and sterner battles ahead.

Eden Park was only an estimated 60 per cent full on Friday despite New Zealand Cricket anticipating more gate collections owing to the Indian team’s popularity.

It remains to be seen if the scheduled late-starts (7.50-8 pm local time) continues to have an impact on match attendances during this T20I series.

Teams:

India: Virat Kohli (captain), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar. PTI CN

New Zealand: Kane Williamson (captain), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Kuggeleijn, Colin Munro, Colin de Grandhomme, Tom Bruce, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Tim Seifert (wk), Hamish Bennett, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Blair Tickner.

278,2020/01/25,Ben Stokes apologises for foul-mouthed altercation with spectator in Johannesburg,"England all-rounder Ben Stokes apologised for a foul-mouthed row with a spectator after his dismissal in Friday’s Test against South Africa at The Wanderers as he faces possible sanctions while England asked for extra security for players and staff.

Stokes was shown on television exchanging insults with a middle aged man as he walked off the field after being caught cheaply for two runs in England’s first innings on the opening day of the fourth Test at the Johannesburg venue, known as the bullring for its often hostile atmosphere.

In a statement, Stokes said he was sorry, while Ashley Giles, Managing Director for England Men’s Cricket, added other England personnel had been abused and issued a strong condemnation.

Giles has made a request for the stadium to beef up security around the England team.

“I wish to apologise for my language that was heard on the live broadcast today after my dismissal. I should not have reacted in that way,” said Stokes.

“As I was leaving the playing area, I was subjected to repeated abuse from the crowd. I admit that my reaction was unprofessional, and I sincerely apologise for the language I used, especially to the many young fans watching the live telecast around the world.”

Throughout the Tests so far, the support from both sets of fans (England and South Africa) has been brilliant. One incident will not ruin such a competitive series, which we are determined to win,”he added.

Personal abuse

Giles stressed that Stokes was not the only one to suffer abuse.

“In addition to this incident, members of our support staff were subjected to personal abuse during and after the days play,” he said.

“We have requested to the venue to ensure that security and stewarding are enhanced for the remainder of the match so that players and staff members can go about their duties without provocation,” Giles added.

The 28-year-old Stokes faces being charged by the International Cricket Council with a level one offence of use of an audible obscenity and a possible fine and demerit point if the match referee decides to charge him.

There was no immediate confirmation of any charge after England reached 192 for four when bad light stopped play.

Stokes is the latest in a long list of players to have spats with spectators at The Wanderers, where there is a long walk from the dressing rooms to the pitch, alongside a grassy bank often filled with boozy spectators.

Television pictures did not show Stokes being insulted but did show him swearing in response to obvious provocation.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tja17s/article30650498.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STOKEA-K,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ben-stokes-apologises-for-foul-mouthed-altercation-with-spectator-in-johannesburg/article30650499.ece

India will meet Australia in the Super League quarterfinal at Potchfestroom on January 28.

In the rain-hit final Group A match, reduced to 23-overs-per-side, India scored 115 for no loss in 23 overs with openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (57 not out off 72 balls) and Divyansh Saxena (52 no off 62 balls) in good nick.

New Zealand needed 193 as per the DLS method calculations, but managed only 147 in 21 overs as India emerged group topper with six points.

Ankolekar, who played through pain with a fractured finger on his right hand, had figures of three for 28 in five overs. Bishnoi bowled googlies, sliders and top-spinners to end with four for 30 from five overs.

Put in to bat, both Yashasvi and Divyansh were watchful but didn’t let the loose deliveries go unpunished. Yashasvi again held anchor, hitting four boundaries and two sixes in his knock.

Divyansh was more aggressive as he slammed six boundaries in his half-century. Just when they had completed a century stand, the heavens opened up.

The scores: India 115/0 in 23 overs (Yashasvi Jaiswal (57 n.o., Divyansh Saxena 52 n.o.) bt New Zealand 147 in 27 overs (Atharva Ankolekar 3/28, Ravi Bishnoi 4/30).

281,2020/01/25,‘Brick kilns in Thadagam operating without permission’,"None of the brick kilns operating in five village panchayats at the Thadagam valley have obtained permission from the Coimbatore Local Planning Authority (LPA), according to a reply to a query made under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

The query was made by activist S. Ganesh from Thadagam and the reply was from E. Rajendran, supervisor of Coimbatore LPA.

According to the reply, permission from LPA is mandatory to set up a brick kiln and to obtain electricity connection. However, the kilns operating at Thadagam, Nanjundapuram, 24 Veerapandi, Pannimadai and Somayampalayam village panchayats have neither applied to the LPA nor were permitted to operate.

To a query on whether the LPA had initiated any legal action against the brick kilns, the RTI reply was ‘no information available’. The LPA would issue permit for brick kilns only after being cleared by the District Collector and the Hill Area Conservation Authority, according to the reply.

Speaking to The Hindu on Friday, Mr. Ganesh said that the reply has established the illegality of the brick kilns. “Without permission (from the LPA), how did the brick kilns managed to get electricity connections?,” he asked.

Mr. Ganesh, along with activist T.M.S. Rajendran, is currently involved in a legal battle seeking action against illegal brick kilns.

Sources in the district administration said that the officials are waiting for the court order to take punitive action against the brick kilns. A team from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board visited the area and will shortly submit a report, based on which further action will be initiated, sources said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/brick-kilns-in-thadagam-operating-without-permission/article30647045.ece

284,2020/01/25,"Access to basic amenities, healthcare remains a challenge for residents of Sundapur village","Life remains unchanged for the 500-odd people of Sundapur village in Bargur Hills for many years now, as they still have to travel 12 km to access a hospital or shops to buy basic things for their daily life.

The village is located about 6 km from the Thamaraikarai – Bargur Road and can be reached through a muddy road in the hilly terrain. The residents belong to the Lingayat community and cultivate ragi, maize, small millets, beans and other dry crops in their small holdings that range from 30 cents to 1.5 acre for each family. There are about 110 houses and access to health care, basic infrastructure, protected drinking water, education and shops remain an unfulfilled dream for the people, said M. Kenjan (55), a resident. “We have to travel through the damaged road, including the three km forest road, to access the main road and again travel six km to Bargur for hospital or shops”, he said. While the produce from the land are preserved and used as staple throughout the year, youngsters work in plains and visit the village twice a month. Many women in the village have not been to the plains as they continue to work in their fields and take care of the children who study at the Government Middle School in the village. Since the roads are poor, most of the people cannot commute and stay here, said J. Erannan (35) who in December last year carried his pregnant sister-in-law in a cloth cradle for six km to reach the main road. “To refill LPG cylinders, we need to go Bargur on two-wheelers”, he said. Gravel for laying road was dumped three months ago and the work is yet to commence.

During the Sri Veerabhadra Swamy temple festival, members of the Lingayat community from Karnataka visit the village. “We believe that only good roads can uplift our lives”, said Kempanna (42). After Class 8, students stay in hostels and pursue school and college studies in Anthiyur, Sathyamangalam and Erode and the village has so far produced three graduates.

V.P. Gunasekaran, State Committee Member, Tamil Nadu Tribal People Association, said that the income of the villagers was very meagre.

Additional Sessions Judge Umed Singh Grewal observed that the delay resulted in the “weak nature of evidence of the victim”.

The court acquitted the president, vice president, principal and a teacher of the school accused of raping the woman in 2010.

In her complaint, the woman said that she was employed as a sweeper at the school. On the day of the incident, she was asked to come to work despite being a Sunday on account of an examination being conducted by the National Open School (NOS). However, she was gang-raped by the four men inside the school.

The court observed that the prosecution failed to prove that the NOS conducted the examination in the school of the accused on any Sunday of 2010 due to which the woman’s claim of being raped had not been proved.

297,2020/01/25,I have tried to be elder son of every family in Delhi: Kejriwal,"AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal, while talking at a public rally in Rohini on Friday, said that he was happy to hear BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah talking about schools, unauthorised colonies and hospitals in Delhi.

“BJP asks for votes in the name of Jat and non-Jat in Haryana, in the name of Maratha and non-Maratha in Maharashtra, Patel and non-Patel and Hindu and Muslim in States such as Gujarat... Yesterday Amit Shah ji came to Delhi and delivered a speech and I felt really good after hearing that. He talked about schools; he talked about unauthorised colonies; he talked about hospitals. You people have changed politics,” the Chief Minister said.

He said that in Delhi, votes will not be cast in the name of religion or caste. “People will only vote for parties that will improve schools, hospitals, roads, provide free electricity and water,” he said.

Earlier in the day, hitting out at Mr. Shah, the AAP chief had said in a tweet, “I’m glad you saw ‘some’ CCTV cameras. A few days ago you said, don’t put a single camera, take some time, let us show you schools too? I am very happy that the people of Delhi have changed the politics. BJP has to ask for votes on CCTV, schools, and unauthorised colonies here.[sic]”

Mr. Kejriwal conducted public rallies at Rohini and Nangloi on Friday besides taking out a roadshow at Janakpuri.

“I have tried to be the elder son of every family in Delhi and carry out all responsibilities in the past five years,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

When asked about his focus areas, Rajesh Nama Bansiwala, AAP candidate from Rohini constituency, told The Hindu, “The current BJP MLAs and councillors have not even pruned the trees here. We will focus on installing CCTVs cameras and opening Mohalla Clinics in the constituency.” BJP leader Vijender Gupta is the current MLA from Rohini.

People The Hindu spoke to raised different issues that “needed to be fixed” in the area, such as traffic jams, air pollution and snatching menace and said that the battle would be fought between AAP and the BJP.

Janardhan Goswami, 43, who hails from U.P., said: “I have three children who study in government schools and the schools have become better after Mr. Kejriwal took over. Chairs, tables and fans have been fixed and even teachers are more dedicated now. Earlier, my daughter had told me that one of her teachers used to knit in the class, but it does not happen any more.”

Meanwhile homemaker Bindu Dogra (42), whose husband works with the Ministry of External Affairs, claimed that no work has been done by the AAP at least in Rohini. “They gave a lot of free things to the poor, but the middle class got nothing. I still pay electricity bills amounting to ₹2,500 a month. AAP has even stood by Shaheen Bagh [protesters]. I support the BJP,” Ms. Dogra, who lives in a nearby society, said. “But these people are happy with him,” she said, pointing to a market in the area.

When asked about a complaint by the BJP regarding AAP making videos of BJP Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari, Mr. Kejriwal told a TV news channel: “We did not make it. If you are a public figure, people will crack jokes. BJP has cracked a lot of jokes on me. I never felt bad.”

“It is wrong that you have said that I have grudge against [Narendra] Modi ji. I have no grudge against any person or party,” he also said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnrbmx/article30647922.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25AAP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/i-have-tried-to-be-elder-son-of-every-family-in-delhi-kejriwal/article30647923.ece
298,2020/01/25,Cong. accuses CM of not standing up against CAA,"The Delhi Congress on Friday alleged that the BJP and AAP were indulging in shadow boxing on the issue of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act to fool the people. It said the silence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue proves his complicity with the BJP in the matter.

‘Crocodile tears for votes’

“Mr. Kejriwal is now shedding crocodile tears for the Shaheen Bagh agitators for votes ahead of the Delhi Assembly elections,” Mr. Chopra alleged.

He said the Chief Ministers in the Congress-ruled States have made it clear that they will not abide by the CAA in their States and the Kerala Assembly, headed by a Communist government, has even passed a resolution against the implementation of the Act.

He further alleged that Mr. Kejriwal, who sits on dharnas for small matters, has not spoken up against the CAA.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/cong-accuses-cm-of-not-standing-up-against-caa/article30647899.ece

The accused have been identified as Rajan Saini (26), a resident of Rajouri Garden and his sister-in-law Preeti (20), a resident of Karol Bagh and a bank employee.

On Thursday, a woman lodged a complaint in which she said that on January 19, she was issued a credit card. On Monday, around 3.21 p.m., she received a call from one Ashish, who claimed himself to be a bank employee, who said that the purpose of his call was to verify and update the Know Your Customer (KYC), a senior police officer said.

The woman provided her credit card number, CVV and OTP received on her mobile number to the accused. A few minutes later, she received a message from the bank that an amount of ₹41,480 was spent on her card, police said.

During investigation, it was found that the money was used for purchasing a mobile phone.

“Police traced the account and zeroed down the location of the accused. They were later arrested from Rajouri Garden and Karol Bagh respectively,” said DCP (South East) Chinmoy Biswal.

Interrogation revealed that the accused Saini had worked in a call centre where he learned impersonation. He was influenced by videos and the web series “Jamtara” to dupe people, the DCP said.

Preeti works at a bank in Karol Bagh. She would upload the data of customers, who recently applied for new credit card on her personnel email id and the same was used by Saini to dupe people.

305,2020/01/25,"In video message, CM asks senior citizens to vote for AAP","The AAP on Friday released a video message on social media in which the party’s national convener Arvind Kejriwal is seen urging senior citizens to vote for the party. More such video messages will be launched targeting different groups, the party said.

“You have seen so many ups and downs in the last 50-60 years. We can only imagine the difficulty you had to face in raising your children and making them stand on their own feet. Your have spent your life taking care of your children and now you are looking after your grandchildren. You need a holiday,” Mr. Kejriwal said addressing senior citizens.

Referring to a free pilgrimage scheme for senior citizens introduced by the AAP-led Delhi government, he asked them to take a leave and go on pilgrimage. “We have made all arrangements. It is the responsibility of the government to take you on a pilgrimage. The government will make arrangements for food and a comfortable stay for you. You will travel in a AC train, stay in a good hotel and the government will bear all the expenses. You don’t have to worry about anything,” Mr. Kejriwal said. He added that nearly 40,000 senior citizens, who had gone on pilgrimage under the scheme, were happy.

“To take care of your health, we have opened mohalla clinics near your homes. Free tests and medicines are available in the clinics.

306,2020/01/25,300 private schools allowed to run without extra FAR charges,"The Delhi High Court on Friday allowed around 300 private unaided schools to run as senior secondary schools, as recognised by the CBSE, without having to pay any additional charges to the DDA for increasing their floor area ratio (FAR).

Justice C. Hari Shankar said the member schools of Action Committee Unaided Recognised Private Schools, a society, which have been recognised as senior secondary schools by the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government or the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), can function as such without paying any additional charges to the DDA.

While ruling so, the court expressed hope that in the future, statutory bodies like Delhi Development Authority (DDA), CBSE and DoE would avoid conflicting stands, with regard to functioning of educational institutions, so that right to education can “prosper and thrive”.

“One must bear in mind the fact that, at the end of the day, the voiceless students are the ones who are sacrificed, in the tussle between the bureaucracy and the educational institutions. In a welfare State, such as ours, this is unthinkable,” the court said.

The observation came as in this case the schools had been permitted by the CBSE and DoE to function at senior secondary level, but were being prohibited from doing so by the DDA due to its demand for additional FAR charges.

The court said the DDA stand was “completely unreasonable” and amounted to “an attempt to take away with the left hand that which is given with the right”. The order and observations came on the society’s plea opposing DDA’s demand.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/iwk46b/article30647792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL25-SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/300-private-schools-allowed-to-run-without-extra-far-charges/article30647793.ece

He advised the opposition not to spew venom on the victory and remember that such a consistent victory had not been possible for any other party in the country even during the Indira Gandhi or N.T.Rama Rao wave. “We are winning about 120 municipalities out of the 130 and we captured all the 32 Zilla Parishads earlier,” he reminded.

The party was able to win in only Narayankhed municipality. T. Jayaprakash Reddy, the lone Congress MLA from erstwhile Medak district, failed to make an impact in both Sangareddy and Sadashivapet municipalities, which were won by the TRS.

313,2020/01/25,Tribal women farmers get ICRISAT inputs,"Having gained valuable insights into best farm practices and entrepreneurship in farming at a three-day training programme in Hyderabad-based International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), a group of 50 women tribal farmers from Bhadrachalam Agency returned back with enriching experiences to share with their fellow farmers.

The tribal women hailing from remote villages in Dummugudem mandal, bordering Chhattisgarh, had undergone the training programme, sponsored by the Tribal Welfare Department, at ICRISAT.

The programme is aimed at empowering tribal farmers, mainly women, with requisite knowledge to adopt best farm practices, harness modern agricultural technology and augment their farm income, sources said.

Around 50 women tribal farmers from Manuguru mandal had already undergone a similar training programme recently.

Another batch of women farmers from Dammapeta mandal are expected to undergo training at ICRISAT next week, sources added.

The training programme forms part of the Tribal Welfare Department’s targeted intervention to expose tribal farmers to agricultural scientific knowledge and encourage them to embrace best farm practices suited to the agro-climatic conditions in the tribal region.

This follows a slew of training programmes organised by the Tribal Cooperative Finance Corporation Limited (TRICOR) in collaboration with ICRISAT for equipping tribal women with requisite skills to prepare a range of nutrition rich value-added products from moringa (drumstick) leaves and millets.

In addition to the initiative to train women tribal farmers of various Agency mandals at ICRISAT in a phased manner, a plan is on the anvil to send a group of tribal women from Palvancha mandal to ICRISAT for undergoing training in making Chikki (groundnut bars), sources in the Telangana State Girijan Cooperative Corporation (TSGCC) said.

The three-day residential training at ICRISAT helped us to interact with agricultural scientists and progressive farmers thereby enabling us gain knowledge of various best farming practices, including organic farming, soil conservation, prudent water management techniques, said Midiam Kamamma of Adavi Ramavaram of Dummugudem mandal.

""We have not only enriched our knowledge of modern agricultural technologies but also had a rare opportunity to watch the use of digital tools for optimising crop yield, she told The Hindu.

We are eager to implement some of the best practices learnt by us during the training in our farm fields with the help of the government agencies concerned, said Srilatha of Cherupalli village.

We will seek the support of the ITDA to grow vegetables in organic farming mode to make farming a sustainable enterprise, she asserted.

We owe our thanks to the Tribal Welfare Department Commissioner Dr Christina Z Chongthu for her initiative in organising free training programmes to promote entrepreneurship in farming among us, said another woman farmer from Dummugudem.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jzlfm9/article30647685.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY25KHAMMAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tribal-women-farmers-get-icrisat-inputs/article30647686.ece
314,2020/01/25,Two booked for lodging false gangrape case,"The Sangareddy district police were finally able to prove that a false complaint was lodged by a girl and her mother on Thursday that a gangrape took place.

On Thursday, commotion took place at Ameenpur with a mother lodging a complaint with the police that her daughter went missing. Police immediately swung into action, located the girl, and shifted her to the government hospital at Sangareddy for medical check-up.

According to S. Chandrasekhar Reddy, Superintendent of Police, a minor girl of a migrant family from Srikakulam, staying in Ameenpur, came into contact with one Sandeep during the election campaign. Both of them exchanged their phone numbers.

On Thursday, Sandeep called her and asked whether she would come for a movie.

After returning from the film, fearing her mother, the girl told her that she was raped by four persons. She had even torn her dress to convince her mother. Police investigation led to the cinema hall, where they viewed the film.

The girl confessed that she did so fearing her parents.

Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy told reporters that they have registered a case against Mr Sandeep for taking the minor, and against one Ravi, house owner of the women, who recorded a video to help the minor get ‘justice’, and shared it on social media.

315,2020/01/25,"IMS scam: create firms, jack up product prices, mint money","Creation of multiple companies by a single person is not unheard of in fraud cases. It is the unusually high profit, 200% at that on some products, pocketed by an accused in Insurance Medical Services (IMS) by creating four firms, is leaving people astonished.

Sleuths of Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) probing the IMS scam involving close to ₹1,000 crore public money found that one of the accused, Srihari Babu alias Babji, floated four firms. Omni-Medi, Omni Enterprises, Omni Healthcare and Legend Enterprises were created allegedly by him. A supplier of medicines and medical kits, the accused used to purchase products directly from the manufacturers and supply to others by taking some profit.

Suppliers make profits from 5% to 25% maximum. But the accused made more than 200% profit on products he had supplied to directorate of IMS! It is here floating of four firms helped him to jack up price of a product and earn profit double the product’s cost.

A classic example is a medical kit called HemoCue, used to assess white blood cells, he had supplied.

Investigators found that the Sweden-based company making the kit was selling it for nearly ₹11,000. But the same kits were purchased by the IMS officials for ₹36,000 for each!

“The supplier would purchase first with one of the four firms, add some profit margin, and sell to second firm. And then to third and fourth,” the investigators said.

By the time the last of the four firms supplies the kits to the IMS office, the price of each kit would reach ₹36,000. It is not yet known if the IMS authorities were aware that the accused floated all the four firms and was minting money. However, the authorities laid hands on documents which suggest that the indent relating to kit supplies involving all four firms were signed in a couple of days.

It is learnt that in one year, he pocketed ₹6 crore by supplying these kits. Similar was the story of supplying HBA1C kits. The suppliers reportedly pocketed Rs.9 crore in a single year. Meanwhile, the investigators are verifying allegations that some agents persuaded the IMS authorities to prepare indent for purchase of medicines even though there was no demand.

The indents were prepared, medicines were supplied at jacked up prices and the money exchanged hands. The investigators are ascertaining the charges that one of the accused created 25 shell companies at the behest of some top IMS officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ims-scam-create-firms-jack-up-product-prices-mint-money/article30647659.ece
316,2020/01/25,Oath to boycott NPR administered; ‘flash’ protest in old city,"Dozens of worshippers who had converged at the Mecca Masjid took an oath to boycott the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

Joint Action Committee Against CAA and NRC convener Mushtaq Mallik ‘administered’ the oath in the courtyard of the historic mosque to around 100 people. “Come what may, we will not fill any form of the NRC or NPR. We are Indians and will not give any documents,” Mr Mallik said after which those assembled repeated these lines. Speaking to the media, Mr Mallik said that Muslims across the country in large numbers have decided to boycott the NPR. He also claimed that despite having required documents, people are ‘not safe’.

“Look at the State of Assam. Young people are dying in detention centres. Nobody is safe,” he said, and urged protesters to maintain calm and ensure that demonstrations are peaceful. “Peaceful protests are key to winning,” he said. Late on Thursday night, the city witnessed a flash protest at Khaja ka Chilla in Moghalpura. While at around 8 p.m., around 25 women gathered at the venue, said to be a private property, messages on social media with details of the protest urged recipients to join in large numbers began to circulate. When the protesters started swelling, police arrived at the spot and began to convince them to disperse. Sources said that locals went door-to-door to inform people of the protest, after which a few women made their way to the venue. Former AP State Minorities Commission member Syed Taraq Quadri, who was at the protest, told police that women protesters were making making supplication, and that venue was a private property. Avinash Mohanty, in-charge Deputy Commissioner of Police, South Zone, too tried to reason with them.

Speaking to The Hindu, one of the organisers of the protest said, “After police arrived, they tried to tell them to vacate the place. They did not allow those people to enter and also kept a close eye on those who were trying to exit. There was sloganeering and people had come from various parts of the city to join us. We winded up at 3.30 a.m.”",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/oath-to-boycott-npr-administered-flash-protest-in-old-city/article30647664.ece
317,2020/01/25,Jaganmohan Reddy’s plea in ED cases rejected,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy’s petition seeking exemption from personal appearance in Enforcement Directorate (ED) cases was rejected by the special court for CBI and ED cases, here on Friday. Mr. Reddy, against whom ED officials filed five chargesheets, also filed a petition requesting the special court to allow appearance of the co-accused, Brahmananda Reddy and Ramgangi Reddy, on behalf of him in the ED cases.

However, special court judge B.R. Madhusudhan Rao dismissed the petition. The CBI counsel contended that appearance of the co-accused cannot be allowed as charges were related to grave financial crimes.

The judge conducted further hearing in the case in-camera, asking other than the accused and the lawyers to leave the court hall.

The in-camera proceedings were held till 2.30 p.m. YSRCP leader and Rajya Sabha member V. Vijayasai Reddy, IAS officers Y. Srilakshmi and Manmohan Singh appeared before the court in the case.

Senior lawyer S. Niranjan Reddy presented arguments on behalf of Mr. Reddy in a CBI case connected to Jagathi publications.

Mr. Reddy filed a discharge petition in this case. The cases relating to ED were posted to January 31 for next hearing. Meanwhile, the CBI special public prosecutor Surender presented to the court that the Central government had accorded permission to prosecute IAS officer Manmohan Singh under Prevention of Corruption Act in connection with the investments made by Vanpic company in firms floated by Mr. Reddy.

Mr. Singh’s counsel argued that the State government had already refused to permit the prosecution and hence the decision taken by the Centre cannot be sustained. The CBI counsel contended that it is the Centre which has power to take a call on prosecution of IAS officers.

The State government had no say in the matter, he argued. Eventually, the judge allowed the charge-sheet filed by the CBI against the IAS officer.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/jaganmohan-reddys-plea-in-ed-cases-rejected/article30647638.ece
318,2020/01/25,De-notified tribes face several socio-economic challenges,"De-notified tribes of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh face several challenges such as poor access to education, school drop-out rates and vulnerabilities to diseases.

The book, Forgotten Communities of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh – A story of De-notified Tribes, authored by Prof Vijay Korra, sheds light on this aspect.

Speaking to The Hindu, Prof Korra, who is with the Centre of Economic and Social Studies, said that a survey on the socio-economic condition of de-notified tribes such as Budagajangalu, Dommari, Relli, Budabukkalas, Kati Kapari and Boyas was conducted.

“The survey included 14 communities (tribes) and we used a 21 page questionnaire to understand the situation of these tribes. We collected extensive data on educational challenges and attainment of these de-notified tribes,” Prof Korra said as he pointed out that the dropping out of school is on account of language problems.

No land holdings

“When there is access to education, it is in Telugu and the language of these tribes is their own,” Mr. Korra said, and added that a majority of these tribes do not hold land which is an income generating resource.

Prof Kancha Ilaiah touched upon how in the Criminal Tribes Act adversely targeted tribes in 1871. He also spoke about inter-sectionality of categorisation of tribes and the deities they worship.

Touching upon the relationship between de-notified tribes and languages, he said that English is spoken and understood among Dalits, notified and de-notified tribes.

This, he argued, was evidence that English, as opposed to Sanskrit and Persian, which were languages of Hindu and Muslim elite, has ‘reached these tribes’.

Prof Virginius Xaxa touched upon categorisation of tribes.

He said that tribes have different social structures and that there is a need to look at the issue carefully.

He opined that categorisation comes with prejudices and ‘inferiorisation’.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/de-notified-tribes-face-several-socio-economic-challenges/article30647654.ece
319,2020/01/25,Hearing in Naidu’s assets case begins in ACB court,"Arguments have begun here on Friday in the Special Court for ACB cases in a petition filed 14 years ago by YSRCP leader Lakshmi Parvathi against former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu accusing him of amassing wealth disproportionate to his income.

Wife of former CM of undivided AP late N.T. Rama Rao, Ms. Parvathi filed the petition in 2005 alleging that there was massive difference in the assets acquired by Mr. Naidu from the time he became first time MLA in 1978 and to eventually becoming CM of AP.

The petitioner’s lawyer told the court that their charges were based on the facts of assets mentioned by Mr. Naidu himself in the documents furnished while filing nominations for MLA elections.

Earlier, Mr. Naidu had secured an order from the High Court staying hearing of the petition by the special court.

The stay order was pending for past 14 years. However, the stay order automatically got vacated following a direction of the Supreme Court that all stay orders in civil and criminal matters are deemed to be vacated after six months of their issuance.

This paved way for hearing of the petition filed by Ms. Parvathi.

However, the special court judge on Friday sought clarity on the matter stating that the website showed that stay order was still continuing in the matter.

322,2020/01/25,Kerala Literature Festival: historians warn against the selective reading of the past,"If history is a labyrinth of our follies and wisdom, then the historian is a modern-day Theseus, navigating the corridors of half-truths and lies with a ball of red string. At the Kerala Literature Festival (KLF) 2020 in Kozhikode, historians turned interlocutors as they tried to sift through India’s past to make sense of its turbulent present.

As of January 6, at least 31 people have died in the violence related to protests against the CAA. After JNU students were attacked on campus by a masked mob, fellow students from small towns and big cities renewed their battle cry against the government, many reading aloud from the Preamble. Women continue to occupy Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, while the people of Kashmir are struggling against a new reality as generals call for war and the Centre marches towards its goal of implementing the CAA, which threatens to further split the country along religious lines.

Historians are trying to make sense of such events by revisiting the past, re-examining it for answers. Since 2018, there have been at least five books on the Mughals, one on Gandhi, one on the rulers of the Deccan, and two on Savarkar. And these are just some of the more popular works.

Parvati Sharma, author of Jahangir: An Intimate Portrait of a Great Mughal (2018), is not surprised by this trend. “We have a situation where history has become the most volatile subject that you can study. People are becoming hugely agitated about what happened all those centuries ago, and a section of society believes that there is a need to reclaim and rectify ‘what was done to us’. It’s almost as if we are fighting our elections in the 16th century,” she said at the sidelines of KLF.

It’s a shame

The Delhi author believes that this interest in historical figures — at least in Jahangir — is the result of a backlash against the propaganda. “People do not like to be harangued, and want to know for themselves what was going on at the time. The other thing is, we do have a very rich history that is not being written about in this way, which is a shame. There are so many fantastic stories. You could pick any king, any dynasty and find a narrative.”

In the hands of a canny author who has the ability to sift through historical material and separate fact from agenda-driven hyperbole, the result can be a multifaceted account of a capricious leader who shifts from benevolence to cruelty in a heartbeat.

When he was still a prince, Jahangir had a man skinned alive before his eyes, causing his father Akbar to exclaim, “But until today we have not ordered so much as a sheep to be skinned in our presence”.

This is the same king who rode a bullock cart at night with empress Nurjahan by his side, who allowed his subjects to discuss and debate religious topics freely, so much so that an Italian traveller wrote: “In India, there is Liberty of Conscience, and... a Man may hold or change what Faith he pleases... Not only, in fact, might a person profess any faith, he might even rail against another’s without undue trepidation.”

This, said Sharma, is the same man who had a Sikh guru executed for political reasons; a Shia cleric beaten, possibly under pressure from sectarian factions in court; and enjoyed long, spiritually fulfilling conversations with a Brahmin ascetic.

Quite contrary

History is replete with such conflicting figures. Take Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, for instance, who is the flavour of the season. The BJP-led government reinstalled a plaque at Cellular Jail in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands where the freedom fighter was once incarcerated. It had been removed in 2004 by the then Congress petroleum minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, after it was first installed there by the Vajpayee-led government.

Savarkar’s role in the freedom struggle upends the narrative that it was solely a non-violent movement. From the First War of Independence in 1857 till the Royal Indian Navy mutiny in 1946, there has been a continuous chain of armed struggle in different parts of India. “Abhinav Bharat sitting in Maharashtra was coordinating with the Bengali organisation, Anushilan Samiti, formed by Sri Aurobindo and his brother Barindra Ghosh, who were tried in the Alipore bomb case,” said historian Vikram Sampath, who tackles the subject in his 2019 book, Savarkar: Echoes from a Forgotten Past, 1883-1924.

“The same bomb manual that Savarkar got smuggled from London is sent to Nashik to murder a British official there and also in Bengal. This caucus of revolutionaries was operating across India: I think these other narratives, of what exactly was happening in those very eventful days of India’s freedom struggle, need to be told,” said Sampath.

In Jallianwala Bagh: An Empire of Fear and the Making of the Amritsar Massacre, British historian Kim A. Wagner documents the violence after 1857. “In British colonial imagination, the ‘Mutiny’ never ended,” writes Wagner.

The problem arises when proponents or opponents cherry-pick some aspects to make their case. Savarkar, who popularised Hindutva, is a case in point. “He is a man of multiple contradictions: a revolutionary in his youth who is also a sensitive poet, an orator and dramatist. He suffered the most inhuman torture at Cellular Jail, and started India’s first secret society of armed revolutionaries, Mitra Mela, which later became Abhinav Bharat,” said Sampath, adding that history becomes the casualty when leaders are appropriated to suit a cause.

A space for everyone

In an unrelated session, Member of Parliament Kanimozhi — “balancing the tact of a politician with the honesty of a poet” — spoke of the pitfalls of cult politics. “I’m not defending Tamil Nadu, but Indians love to have a very strong leader; somebody we think is strong enough to make others listen to them. But, we also know that it claims a big price. We have seen it in the past, and we are seeing it now... In Tamil Nadu, people celebrated leaders. But whether it was MGR or my father, they were not absolute powers. They had to obey rules within the party structure. What we are seeing today goes much beyond all that. There are one or two absolute powers, and the entire nation, the entire Parliamentary system, the legal system, every institution, has to fall in line. And now we realise the price we are paying for this.”

Tipu Sultan is another polarising figure who our politicians are trying to pigeonhole as either a cruel ruler who forced conversions or a benevolent king who gave grants to temples. “It is not an ‘either-or’, but an ‘and’. He was both things,” said historian Manu S. Pillai at a session aptly titled ‘Indian History: A Mosaic of Ironies?’

Tipu was extremely brutal in territories he came to conquer. “But in Mysore and other settled territories you saw a different side of him. The same man acted in different ways in different contexts,” Pillai said.

Citing the example of protesters carrying images and quotes of both Gandhi and Periyar at anti-CAA rallies — men who were polar opposites — Pillai pointed out that each generation reinterprets history for its own needs.

In one of his essays in The Courtesan, The Mahatma & The Italian Brahmin: Tales from Indian History (2019), Pillai brings out the dichotomy between the two men. “Where Gandhi was the embodiment of saintly piety, Periyar exemplified rebellion. Where Gandhi romanticised rural contentment, Periyar envisioned an ambitious age of aircraft and heavy machinery. While Gandhi renounced sex in his 30s, Periyar married a 30-year-old in his 70s. Where the Mahatma’s nationalism was immersed in Hindu morality, Periyar was an atheist who wrote op-eds titled ‘Honeymoon in the Hindu Zoo.’”

India exemplifies such contrasts and carves out space for everyone to co-exist. “The Constitution looks at all the existing (cultural and other) differences in India and helps us surpass them. It creates a situation where our differences can survive without any one dominating the other,” said Pillai.

And it is this that the people are fighting for. While Kanimozhi urged Kerala and Tamil Nadu to continue the fight to save India and protect the Constitution, and historian Ramachandra Guha railed against the Left, the Right, Narendra Modi, Amit Shah and the Congress, Rajdeep Sardesai warned against predicting the future in an India that has always been in a state of flux.

On the final day of the festival, away from the shores of the beach, a group of people staged an anti-CAA protest near the airport. Perhaps, the dread for the future that many of us feel is also tinged with hope.

323,2020/01/25,The terracotta temples of Maluti,"Deep in Jharkhand’s hinterland lies the village of Maluti. Flanked by mud houses and a handful of concrete buildings, narrow lanes lead to several open spaces right in the middle of the village — spaces that bear testimony to more than 300 years of rich temple architecture.

Once home to 108 temples, the village is now but a poor shadow of its past, with only 72 shrines remaining — but the sheer number puts Maluti on the heritage map of India. With intricate terracotta carvings of mythical scenes on their façades and walls, which have survived harsh weather and the ravages of time since the early 17th century, Maluti’s terracotta temples are now being restored.

The temples, mostly of Shiva, are dotted in five different clusters — Sikir Taraf, Rajar Bari, Madhya Bari, Chhoi Taraf and the Mauliksha temple complex.

Situated in Dumka district, the village is close to the border with West Bengal, and Chala architecture, inspired by traditional Bengali huts with their sloping roofs with curved edges, is a distinct feature of Maluti’s temples. Also, the influence of the exquisite Keshta Raya terracotta temple at Bishnupur in Bengal’s Bankura district can be seen clearly in every temple. The 17th century masonry technique using moulded bricks has been applied extensively.

Conflicting narratives

Dumka-based historian Surendra Jha, who has written a voluminous book on Maluti, points out that the terracotta plaques were neither carved on the walls nor were they like stuccos; rather, they were stuck on using vajralepa. This is a paste prepared by mixing local sand, betelnut, horsehair, coconut fibre, brick powder, molasses, an astringent made of Aegle marmelos trees and oil gum resin beeswax, and allowing the mix to decompose.

But why is an otherwise nondescript village like Maluti home to so many temples? There are conflicting historical narratives. “In the early 16th century, Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah of Gauda awarded a zamindari to one Basanta Roy, a poor Brahmin of Katigram village, as a reward for catching the pet hawk, or baj, that belonged to the Sultan’s wife. Roy, who came to be known as Raja Baj Basanta, founded a dynasty that had its capital at Damra (some 8 km to the south). Later, it was shifted to Maluti,” says Shree Deo Singh of the Indian Trust for Rural Heritage and Development (ITRHD), which has taken up the temple restoration work. And instead of constructing palaces, this king’s successors competed for prestige by building more and more temples on auspicious occasions.

Jha, however, has a different take: “The clash of egos between the women of the zamindar family appears to be the reason behind the construction of so many temples in such a small village. Oral history says that they would take offence if they had to visit a temple built by another woman’s husband. Most of these temples are dedicated to women, indicating that temple building had become a status symbol.”

It is believed that the temples began to be built in the early 17th century. With the passage of time, they began to crumble due to lack of maintenance, and a number of them have been overrun by vegetation. Several terracotta panels have been stolen over the years. The Bihar government did repair the temples in 1985-86, but there has been no sustained maintenance since there is no trained local manpower to handle conservation on a regular basis.

Years ago, Gopaldas Mukherjee, a retired schoolteacher, wrote a detailed research paper on just how this precious heritage could be protected, but it wasn’t until Jharkhand’s tableau based on the temples bagged a prize in the Republic Day parade of 2015 that the national spotlight fell on Maluti. Subsequently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is said to have taken a personal interest in the restoration work.

Worrisome methods

There is, however, a glitch. Jha and others have raised sustained questions about the conservation methods being used. “The terracotta structures would have survived for another 100 years if this conservation work had not fallen in the wrong hands. Guidelines are being grossly flouted. Iron, cement and chemical colours are being used. I am very worried about Maluti’s terracotta. I worry that its beauty will vanish forever,” says the historian.

ITRHD’s Singh is dismissive of these allegations — “The Archaeological Survey of India, the country’s apex body on heritage conservation, is monitoring our work. The ASI itself has certified that the cultural and archaeological values are being maintained and the conservation manual followed,” he says.

ITRHD has completed the restoration of 20 temples in the Rajar Bari cluster. “Temple No. 38 is the tallest of all. It has been brought back to its earlier glory,” says Singh. “It wasn’t easy to find masons with expertise in terracotta and 17th century construction. We are being aided by masons who have worked for decades in ASI monuments. We are using burnt-clay bricks (lakhauri) and lime-crushed brick aggregate (surkhi) mortar, lime, chhoa (molasses) and bhel (Aegle marmelos) fruits — the same material used 300 years ago,” he adds.

Mihir Kanti Sarkar, former Deputy Superintending Archaeological Engineer, ASI, emphasises the importance of continuous supervision of the ongoing restoration work. “One should stay away from any alteration or modification to the original structures, as we don’t have previous architectural or photographic documentation. If we make such changes, their aesthetic value will be lost forever,” he warns.

At least ₹50 crore will be required to meet the social and financial needs of applicants suffering from rare diseases, according to an affidavit filed by Subi Sukumaran, project co-ordinator of We Care project of KSSM before the Kerala High Court.

It was on a writ petition filed by Lysosomal Storage Disorders Support Society, seeking support for the patients, that the affidavit was filed.

The Indian goalkeeper will be the chief mentor and promoter of the Campeones Sports City, which will be launched in Kakkanad on Saturday with facilities for football, basketball, roller-sports, and Yoga in the first phase. It will include 10 badminton courts in the next phase. “We also plan to have tie-up with schools and exchange programmes with foreign clubs. Talks are also on to bring a foreign coach in short spells,” said Sreejesh here on Thursday.

326,2020/01/25,Urgent steps sought to stop concrete waste seepage into lake,"The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management, constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), has directed the Maradu Municipality to initiate urgent steps to prevent the flow of concrete waste from the debris of Golden Kayolaram apartments into the nearby Vembanad lake.

The directive was issued at the sitting of the committee held in Thiruvananthapuram on Friday. The SLMC had found during its visit to the Golden Kayaloram site on Saturday that the concrete sludge that emerged after spraying water (to contain dust) was flowing into the lake.

The unchecked seepage of concrete sludge into the waterbody will affect fish population in the lake.

Even though it will not have an immediate impact, concrete waste flowing into the lake will eventually take a toll on fish diversity, the committee observed.

The committee has asked Snehil Kumar Singh, Revenue Divisional Officer, Fort Kochi, who was in charge of the demolition, and the Maradu Municipality to take steps to stop the flow of concrete sludge into the lake. If they are not able to contain it, steps should be taken to ensure double-filtering of waste before discharging it to the waterbody, it said.

Civic body’s obligation

The SLMC made it clear that the Maradu municipal council had an obligation to ensure scientific removal and processing of debris in accordance with the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016.

Any reluctance on the part of the council will have to be reported, and follow-up action should be taken, the committee said. Meanwhile, the panel directed the civic body to strengthen spraying of water over debris using revolving type jet sprinklers, besides taking measures to implement sound and dust control measures on a regular basis.

Barriers

It suggested providing additional barriers with metal sheets and specific dust control facilities like double-layered garden at the sites. Periodic wetting of roads and CCTV surveillance of the sites have to be ensured, it ordered.

The committee appreciated the efforts made by Mr. Snehil Kumar Singh and R. Venugopal, Deputy Chief Controller of Explosives, Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation, to complete the demolition process without causing much damage to life and property nearby the apartment buildings.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cuv0bx/article30648067.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-KI-MARADU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/urgent-steps-sought-to-stop-concrete-waste-seepage-into-lake/article30648068.ece
327,2020/01/25,Water tanker operators continue to skip KWA plants,"Operation Pure Water, aimed at providing potable water to all, seems to have hit rough weather, with water tankers continuing to collect water from wells.

Reviewing the status of water availability in the district, the Assembly Committee on Petitions headed by K.B. Ganesh Kumar had directed tanker operators to collect water only from pump houses operated by the Kerala Water Authority (KWA). It was to ensure that quality water was supplied in the district.

Accordingly, the KWA set up 10 hydrants each at its Aluva and Maradu treatment plants from which tankers could collect water, besides installing 32 hydrants at pump houses across the district.

Ironically, there are few takers for water supplied by the KWA. Except for three to four days when around 400 loads of water in varying capacity of tankers were collected from the Aluva plant two weeks ago, less than 50 loads are being collected from the plant now.

As regards Maradu, around 80 loads, with an average of 25,000 litres per load, are being collected, while from the Perumannoor pump house, nearly 50 loads of water averaging 10,000 litres a load, are drawn. However, according to Water Tanker Owners’ Welfare Association secretary R. Ramachandran, around 2,000 loads are being brought to the city everyday, with a majority of consumers being hotels, malls, apartments, and the High Court. He said besides the KWA pump houses, water was being supplied from wells too. It is learnt that the purity of water drawn from wells has to be ensured by the owner.

Accessible

The new hydrants located in easily accessible positions at the Aluva plant can fill a large tanker of 36,000 litre capacity in 15 minutes. Four old hydrants are also being used to fill smaller takers as they take more time.

However, only 14 tankers had reached the Aluva plant on Thursday till noon. The usual collection from hydrants at the plant before the launch of Operation Pure Water averaged around 30.

The Assembly Committee had been particular that the imperative of drawing water from KWA hydrants was not negotiable. Though the officer in charge of Operation Pure Water did not respond to queries on the purity of water drawn from wells, it is learnt that the district administration had allowed tanker operators to collect water from wells till January 30, saying that the KWA had not been able to vend water to meet the demand, besides backing the operators’ claim that drawing water from KWA hydrants was time-consuming.

No shortage

However, it was found that except for a day when a KSEB cable broke down, resulting in a plant shutdown for around three hours, there was no shortage of water at KWA plants, and that the new hydrants were efficient enough to fill a 36,000-litre tank in 15 minutes. The cost of KWA water is ₹600 for 10,000 litres.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/32krz/article30648032.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26-KI-WATERTANKER-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/water-tanker-operators-continue-to-skip-kwa-plants/article30648033.ece
328,2020/01/25,The misfortune of being in news for wrong reasons,"Misfortune just does not seem to leave Christy Evart alone.

Hardly a year after her image was wrongfully beamed by the YouTube channel of a Malayalam web portal as an accused in a sex scandal, Ms. Evart, a single mother of two children residing at Mundamveli, finds herself in the middle of a political and communal drama with which she has absolutely nothing to do. Once again, it is the wrongful use of her photo that has landed her in the soup.

This was after an allegedly fabricated Facebook profile complete with a communally incendiary post in the name of one Anjana Umesh but with the photo of Ms. Evart identifying her as the woman who allegedly intruded into the now controversial symposium on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) at the Pavakkulam Temple auditorium started circulating in social media, predominantly among Sangh Parivar circles, evoking lewd comments and even threats.

‘No politics’

“I am a Christian, whereas the woman named in that issue is a Hindu. Nor do I have any politics. This is for the second time my picture is being misused in less than a year. In the first case, I was too shocked to respond, and I did not want to draw more attention or alert more people who were not aware of the defamatory news. This time, it is more serious and has the potential to create communal discord,” said Ms. Evart who works with a private company.

She has lodged a complaint with the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Kochi City), seeking action against those attempting to “incite communal riots” and those engaged in the misinformation campaign by wrongfully using her picture.

Post disappears

She specifically names one Jalaja Sreenivas Acharya as one among those who shared it in Facebook, but the post had since then disappeared. Screenshots and links of posts were attached with the petition.

Account deleted

After the first incident of misuse of her image, Ms. Evart had to shift her house at Thoppumpady, sell her vehicle, and even had a haircut to avert being identified. She had also deleted her Facebook account from where her misused images were sourced.

“Remaining silent is no longer an option now since it will even affect my children. I don’t want them to go through the trauma of their mother,” said Ms. Evart who is planning to take legal recourse.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/svsy5a/article30648016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25tvkifb22,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/the-misfortune-of-being-in-news-for-wrong-reasons/article30648017.ece
329,2020/01/25,Two quarantined on suspicion of Corona infection,"Two persons in the district with flu symptoms have been isolated at Government Medical College, Ernakulam, and another hospital on suspicion of Corona virus infection.

According to the district health authorities, they had recently returned from a trip to China, though the places they visited are far away from Wufan, the city witnessing a fatal outbreak of the virus infection. The district surveillance unit on Thursday had put six people under quarantine.

In fact, quarantining those who have visited the region affected by the deadly flu in the past 28 days is expected to help in containing infection.

Travellers screened

Accordingly, People arriving here from the affected region through airports or seaports are being screened. As many as 24 passengers were screened at the airport, and no suspicious case was found.

The District Medical Officer has said even apparently healthy people who have travelled to the affected region should maintain little contact with others. Special precautions should be taken with regard to pregnant women and children.

In case of fever, cough, or wheezing, one should contact the PHC or the district surveillance unit. For queries, contact health Services at 0471-2552066 or 1056.

Those with flu symptoms should cover nose and mouth while coughing and sneezing.

Maintaining hand hygiene will go a long way in keeping infections away. One should wash hands with soap.

If soap is not available, any anti-microbial agent will help in keep hands hygienic. Spitting in public should also be avoided.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/two-quarantined-on-suspicion-of-corona-infection/article30648014.ece
330,2020/01/25,Cases against 29 for shoving off woman from CAA meet,"The North police have registered cases against 29 persons, mostly Sangh Parivar workers, on a petition filed by the woman who was shoved off while being rained with communal remarks from the venue of a symposium for women on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) organised by a Sangh Parivar outfit at the Pavakkulam Temple auditorium on Tuesday.

The woman, identified as Athira from Thiruvananthapuram, had lodged the petition on Thursday after a video of the incident went viral.

The police registered cases invoking IPC Sections 143 (unlawful assembly), 147 (rioting) and 149 (every member who is part of an unlawful assembly is guilty of the offence committed in prosecution of the common object).

“The offence against the woman is pretty much proven by that video, which, after being scientifically examined, could be produced as evidence,” said police sources.

Initially, the police had summoned the woman and registered a case against her under IPC Sections 447 (criminal trespass) and 294 (b) (sings, recites, or utters any obscene song, ballad, or words, in or near any public place) after C.V. Sajini, secretary of the industrial cell of the BJP and a speaker at the symposium, lodged a petition against her and produced a few photographs as evidence. The woman, however, did not file a petition then. The police said neither were they aware of the treatment meted out to her at the venue till the video emerged. “As soon as the video emerged, we contacted her and asked why she didn’t tell us about the objectionable treatment, to which she said she didn’t want to create more problems. She asked for time to think about filing a petition and later decided to lodge one, following which her statement was recorded at her hostel,” police sources said.

According to the police, simply registering a First Information Report (FIR) against her does not make her guilty, but the offence has to be proved. The police may have to look into the ownership documents of the venue to verify whether the charge of criminal trespass will stand legal scrutiny since anyone can walk into a meeting held at a public space.

The charge under Section 294 (b) also remains to be proved since the video does not show her mouthing obscenities or abuse unlike the objectionable treatment meted out to her, which is very evident.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/cases-against-29-for-shoving-off-woman-from-caa-meet/article30648005.ece

Ashraf, who has been living in the city for a year, is attending a course at a reputed institution.

333,2020/01/25,Water metro can be launched by year-end: German envoy,"German Ambassador to India Walter J. Lindner has expressed confidence that the Kochi Water Metro project can be launched by the end of the year.

“We are very confident that the first jetty will be ready by the end of this year. And I promise that I will be back to inaugurate it,” Mr. Lindner told The Hindu in an interaction after inaugurating the Steag Centre for Smart City Technologies at the Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology here on Friday.

German Development Bank KfW had agreed to provide a loan of ₹597 crore for the ₹747-crore integrated water transport project in the Greater Kochi area. It will be financed by the Indo-German Bilateral Cooperation, under the ‘climate friendly urban mobility’ plan.

Stating that Kochi was very special in terms of its geographical location, Mr. Lindner said it had the challenge of connecting the islands to the mainland.

“The good idea is that you have this integrated project, which means one can start in the backwaters, board the boats, get your ticket, go in to the Metro Rail with the same ticket and from there you can go to the coastland. You can get in to another ferry and use e-rickshaws or buses as the last mile connectivity,” he said.

Displaying the Kochi 1 Card (the pre-paid card issued by Kochi Metro) with his name printed on it, the German Ambassador said one could travel the whole day using the single card. “It’s very less expensive. People can conveniently make use of it. It makes a lot of sense. Today, I tried it all [modes of transport] but missed the buses,” he said.

On whether the Water Metro project was running behind schedule, Mr. Lindner said it was a huge project. “There are land issues involved. It is not only the money part as different sectors are involved. Everyone working in the government knows how difficult it is to integrate the different stakeholders. Once this is done, and I think we are very close to it, things should move smoothly,” he said.

The Ambassador said there was no alternative to the integrated model of transport.

“Because otherwise you cannot deal with communication and transport in a smart city like Kochi. Too much congestion is not manageable,” he said.

Mr. Lindner said he would return to the State soon to take stock of the help rendered by German funding agencies in the reconstruction process after the devastating floods. “We have to work together and take precautions. I know the pattern of monsoon is changing in Kerala owing to climate change,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/rkfeqv/article30647861.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25-KI-AMBASSADORjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/water-metro-can-be-launched-by-year-end-german-envoy/article30647862.ece
334,2020/01/25,Haemophilia patients left in the lurch,"Haemophilia patients in the State are facing a life-threatening situation as blood factors crucial for their treatment are no longer available at Karunya pharmacies across Kerala.

On an average, a patient requires blood factors costing ₹25,000 to ₹50,000 a month. While the factors were available free of cost at Karunya pharmacies, only a few patients are now able to access it from the open market because of the huge costs.

‘No funds’

According to a statement from the State Co-ordination Committee of Haemophilia Chapters in Kerala, pharmaceutical companies have stopped providing the blood factors because the Finance Ministry has not provided funds for it.

About 1,600 patients have been registered with various hospitals in Kerala for blood factors as part of managing their haemophilic condition. Lack of the factors hampers the medical regimen of the patients and pushes them into various disabilities.

It is important that children up to 18 years have a preventive dosage to help them overcome disabilities that could affect their growth.

Co-ordination committee chairman E. Raghunathan and general secretary Jimmy Manuel said in the statement that the governments of neighbouring States like Tamil Nadu provided sufficient funds in the budget for bleeding disabilities.

335,2020/01/25,Relocation plan leaves fishers worried,"A section of fishers in the district has come up against the State Government’s proposed scheme to rehabilitate fishermen families who have homes within the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) limits.

The fishers, mostly hailing from Vadakara coastal area, allege that the proposed rehabilitation plan is aimed at evacuating traditional fishermen from their settlements in the name of CRZ rule enforcement.

Their leaders say the State Government’s plan to shift about 550 fishermen families in Kozhikode district under the scheme will only end up in marginalising the segment.

The State package offers only ₹10 lakh to a family to purchase about three cents of land and construct a house less than 600-sq.ft, which is hardly a lucrative offer, they claim.

Threat of sea erosion

The Fisheries Department plans to cover over 1,700 families in Kozhikode in two phases.

According to them, more than 500 families have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the scheme in the first phase. They also point out that field studies conducted earlier by the department stresses the need to rehabilitate about 2,000 families, now staying within just 50 metres of the coastline, which is prone to frequent sea erosion threats.

However, a majority of the targeted beneficiaries say the high cost of land, its distance from harbours and escalating construction costs will make their efforts meaningless.

A few short-listed beneficiaries in Azhiyur panchayat have alleged that the local body has begun search of land under the project without any consultations with them.

United Democratic Front leaders from Azhiyur, who declared political support to the fishermen’s protest, say the project was designed without any proper planning or understanding of the life of fisherfolk.

Meanwhile, Fisheries Department sources say the project is aimed at improving the safety of fishermen and saving them from frequent sea erosion threats. In Kerala, the department has already identified about 19,000 such families in need of immediate rehabilitation support for which the Government has sanctioned funds under the Chief Minister’s Distress Relief Fund, they add.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/relocation-plan-leaves-fishers-worried/article30654621.ece

Following a State-level directive to heighten coastline security, Coast Guard will deploy their special squads to carry out surprise inspections. An intelligent float observation system controlled by the Cyberdome will be in place off the Kozhikode beach.

Checks in trains

Public places such as railway stations and bus stands have been brought under the scanner of police patrol squads.

Railway Protection Force and the Government Railway Police have intensified checks in trains. Squads have been posted to closely monitor surveillance camera visuals in public places.

338,2020/01/25,"Settle partition of property in advance, panel tells elderly","The State Women’s Commission has advised elderly parents to decide on the partition of their properties well in advance, lest it should lead to battle among their children.

Speaking to the media after a mega adalat in Kozhikode on Friday, Commission member M.S. Thara said that a large number of property disputes were being brought before the commission these days, just because the parents did not take the initiative for partition when they were alive. After parents’ death, children fail to reach an agreement on how to divide the fruit of their parents’ labour among themselves, she said.

She sited the example of a case in Meppayur, in which a woman complained that her siblings had set fire to her home due to property dispute.

The complainant had taken care of their elderly parents during their last years and the father had reportedly given her a large chunk of the property. The siblings alleged that she had duped their father to snatch the property. Now, the children of these people too had joined the dispute, even as a larger chunk of the deceased father’s property lay undivided.

Another was a complaint by a student who secured a seat for engineering in a college in Bengaluru, paying a huge bribe. It turned out after three years that the college was unrecognised by the authorities concerned. The commission urged parents to pay more attention to details such as recognition before enrolling their children for courses in other States.

Several cases in which marriages were solemnised hiding the mental issues of either the bride or groom had come before the commission. Parents and guardians should be alert against such frauds, Ms.Thara said.

A total of 76 complaints were considered at the adalat on Friday, of which 26 were solved. Five were deferred pending reports from various agencies, including the police, while 45 were posted to the next adalat.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/settle-partition-of-property-in-advance-panel-tells-elderly/article30647950.ece

The police said that Pragadeesh, a doctor belonging to Oddanchatram, was returning from Madurai towards Dindigul in a car and he crashed into Krishnan of Mavoothanpatti who tried to cross the highway from east to west on a bicycle.

Speaking at the 10th National Voters’ Day awareness programme, organised at Kamaraj College, he said that in every election at least 30 % of eligible voters did not cast their votes. To ensure that all voters turn up at the polling stations and exercise their rights, the Election Commission of India had been organising such awareness programmes for the last one decade.

So, every voter particularly those who have turned 18 years should vote, he said and urged the public to join in the mega programme and be a part of the democratic process. As a part of the awareness programme, the district administration had conducted rallies and took pledge on the occasion. A large number of students, officials from various departments, college principal T Nagarajan and NSS coordinator A Devaraj, among others, participated.

347,2020/01/25,Loss of life in road accidents ruins fortunes of families: SP,"Despite a laborious effort by Madurai district police that brought down the number of deaths caused by road accidents by 15%, as many as 282 lives were snuffed out in as many as 1,694 accidents reported in 2019, said Madurai Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan.

Addressing a meeting organised by the rural district police for eye-screening of auto drivers from various rural areas here on Saturday, Mr. Manivannan said that every life lost in a road accident had the potential to ruin the fortunes of an entire family.

“Though the police enforced road rules by imposing fines, the accidents and the fatality would not reduce if road users were not going to scrupulously follow road rules,” he said.

A total of 282 lives were lost in road accidents in 2019 as against 330 in the previous years. Enforcement also led to reduction in the number of road accidents from 1,777 in 2018 to 1,694 in 2019, he said

He added that lives of at least 50% of the road accident victims were saved because they were wearing helmets.

“A negligent attitude that leads to not wearing helmet thinking that someone is going only for a short ride, has the potential to take out his/her life,” he warned.

He said besides following the traffic rules, if people avoid drunken drive, usage of cellphone while riding/driving, wearing helmets and seatbelts will go a long way in ensuring safety of road users, he said.

The SP advised auto drivers that they should know that rash driving could kill someone.

“There is nothing more precious than life,” he said.

Scores of auto drivers were screened for their eyesight and given free spectacles in the camp organised jointly by Rotary Club of Madurai North and Subbamma Charitable Trust.

Receiving information, a team of forest officials rushed to the spot and engaged in monitoring the animals.

As human habitations and farmlands are very close by, the sighting of the animals has created a flutter among people in the area. The District Forest Officer, Dindigul division, C. Vidya, along with forest officials camped near the site till Saturday evening to monitor the situation.

“The elephants are inside the reserve forest area in Palani hill north slope of Oddanchatram range but as the village is adjoining the foothills, we are watching the movement of the animals closely. Over 50 personnel are involved in the duty to make sure that the animals do not descend further,” said the DFO.

“We hope the elephants will move deeper into the forest towards Parappalar dam at night. Otherwise, depending on the direction of movement, we may drive them by using crackers,” she added.

As it’s the season of Thaipoosam and thousands of pilgrims walk through Oddanchatram, conservationists have raised concern over the wild elephant movement close to the main road.

A cooperative retail sales point for selling petrol and diesel was also inaugurated in the presence of Registrar of Cooperative Societies K. Govindharaj.

Apart from retailing agricultural and other produce, the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Marketing Federation (TANFED) has initiated retail sale of fuel through Indian Oil Corporation in Kodambakkam and Koyambedu in Chennai, Cuddalore, Tiruchi and Tirunelveli, said the Minister.

“On those lines, the government has also planned to open three such fuel outlets in southern districts, including Eriyodu in Dindigul, Virudhunagar and Tirunelveli. Last year, an outlet was opened in Palani and has been functioning smoothly. In Dindigul district, 31 mini supermarkets have been planned on behalf of the cooperatives department,” he said.

354,2020/01/25,Demand for paddy harvesters goes up,"As samba harvest gathers momentum in Madurai district, the demand for paddy harvesters has spiked. But, currently, there are very few harvesters available at the market, say farmers. This might affect the paddy yield, despite bountiful produce due to the availability of sufficient water for irrigation, farmers rue.

Usually, harvesters are hired from places like Salem, Aathoor, Namakkal and Poondi, says P. Murugan, an agent who rents out harvesters.

“There are also a few local farmers who rent out harvesters. But, this year, there are fewer machines available compared to the previous years. For instance, if there is a demand for 10 machines at a particular region, there are only two available at the market,” he says.

Following copious rainfall in the northeast monsoon of 2019 and the subsequent availability of adequate water, cultivation of paddy was undertaken simultaneously across the district by farmers, says a senior official from the Agriculture Department.

“This has led to an increase in demand for harvesters. Also, in the last few years, the dependence of labourers for harvesting has reduced,” says the official.

Similarly, the bountiful produce at Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga and Thanjavur had increased the demand for harvesters, says R. Arul Prakasam, Chairman of Water Distribution Committee, Periyar Water Users’ Association.

“Following a bountiful produce, the harvesting is now in full swing in Thanjavur. A large number of harvesters from the district were transported there before Pongal. It will also be profitable for the harvester owners,” he says.

Following this huge demand for the machines, there has been a marginal increase in rental prices of the harvesters, says Mr. Murugan. “There has been an increase of around ₹200 per hour for harvesting machines with tyres. For the belt type harvesters, the rental charges have increased by around ₹400 per hour,” he adds.

G. Balachandran, a farmer from Avaniapuram, says that for the last 10 days, farmers from the area are waiting for machines to harvest around 40 acres of paddy fields.

“We have been placing multiple calls for the last few days to harvest the crops on time. Delayed harvesting would result in a loss for farmers as the grains will wither off from the crop,” he says.

Mr. Arul Prakasam says that due to delayed harvest by around two weeks, the yield from his farm has reduced. “Usually, around 40 bags are harvested per acre. But this year, only 37 bags were harvested,” he claims.

The government-owned harvesters, which are available at subsidised rates, are also not easily available, says Mr. Balachandran. “There is no information or clarity on their availability,’ he adds.

An official from the Agricultural Engineering department says that there are only four harvesters available for Madurai, Theni and Dindigul districts. “All the machines are currently deployed at different regions,” the official adds.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ihccew/article30653131.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA26CITY-PADDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/demand-for-paddy-harvesters-goes-up/article30653132.ece

Speaking at a well-attended public meeting organised by the MDMK Madurai urban unit, marking the Martyrs’ Day (Mozhipor Tyagi Veeravanakkam), he said that every move of the Centre revealed the BJP’s ultimate plan to make the country as “Hindi, Hindu and Hindrashtra.”

The BJP’s actions were not only alarming, but dangerous to the secular fabric and the Constitution on the whole.

Time had come for the people to rise up and join hands to defeat such forces, Mr. Adheepan said and listed out the steps taken by the MDMK MP and general secretary Vaiko inside and outside the Parliament against the Centre.

“Only after Mr. Vaiko moved the Supreme Court filing a habeas corpus, did the Centre reveal the whereabouts of leaders, including Farooq Abdullah, who were detained in the Kashmir valley in their homes by the Centre.

Some of the leaders in the BJP claimed that there was no threat to the minorities or Muslims in the nation and that they were only attempting to correct the mistakes committed by the Congress. This was wrong and misleading, Mr. Adheepan said and added that the BJP indulged in diversion tactics.

At a time, when the nation faced severe recession, rising inflation and joblessness among the youth, the Centre and the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu remained mute spectators. Corruption had touched a new high in the State and the DMK-led front would emerge victorious in the ensuing general elections to the Legislative Assembly.

He urged the people to think twice before casting their precious votes and cited how the DMK-led front had won despite distribution of money and misuse of power by the AIADMK in the just concluded rural local body polls.

Association President N. Palanisamy said that the Brazilian leader had specifically singled out Indian farmers, especially sugarcane farmers, regarding subsidies available to them for their produces each year.

Secretary K. Rajendran said that the Brazilian delegation had approached the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to state that Indian government was flouting norms to provide subsidies for the farmers.

“At this stage, it is crucial that we receive subsidies. By inviting the Brazilian President to India, the country is being complicit in the ruin of farmers. If the WTO goes with the delegation side, we will lose the chance to be empowered,” Mr. Palanisamy said and added that the protest was a move to show solidarity with Indian farmers across the country.

The protesting farmers sought the receipt of arrears due to them amounting to over ₹20 crore from the Alanganallur National Cooperative Sugar Mills. They said the State government was not pressurising private sugar mills to pay the pending due. Even the State Advisory Price (SAP) on sugarcane, which has remained fluctuating, is yet to be settled, he said.

After a discussion with the members of the mills, dues worth ₹1.5 crore according to the fair and remunerative price (FRP) for sugarcane for 2019-2020 would be released in two days, the president announced.

Bhaskar Prasad, president of the State unit of the Dalit Sanghatanegala Okkoota, said on Saturday that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR), and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) were discriminatory and were aimed at the Muslim community.

He was speaking at the ‘Kagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’ campaign organised by the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) here.

Mr. Prasad said that there was Muslim rule in the country for 800 years but India did not become a Muslim country. Then there was Christian [British] rule for 200 years, but India did not become a Christian country.

“In such a scenario, it was a fallacy of the present ruling class to think that their six-year rule would make India a Hindu country,” he said.

He said that the people of all communities in undivided Dakshina Kannada lived in peace and harmony 30 years ago. The Billava community should not get swayed by right-wing forces, he said.

Mr. Prasad said that RSS and BJP leaders were misleading the youth belonging to the lower castes in this region. These misled youth finally ended up in jails due to their involvement in communal clashes, he claimed.

He said that though the general belief was that the CAA, NPR and NRC would affect only Muslims, it would ultimately affect the poor and the depressed classes.

The BJP which was making such discriminatory laws should not forget that it had not won a majority vote-share in the parliamentary elections.

“Should the Dalit and Muslim communities come together, the BJP would lose in the elections,” Mr. Prasad said.

Abdul Majeed, national general secretary of SDPI, Alphonso Franco, national secretary, Amrit Shenoy, President of Sahabalve, Sundar Master, district convener of Dalit Sangharsha Samiti, G. Rajashekhar, writer, Yasin Malpe, President of Muslim Okkoota, and others were present.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/caa-nrc-were-discriminatory-dalit-leader/article30654010.ece

362,2020/01/25,Every voter plays a vital role in India’s progress: Judge,"C.M. Joshi, District and Sessions Judge, said on Saturday that every voter played an important role in the progress of the country.

He was speaking after inaugurating the National Voters’ Day, organised by the district administration, the District Legal Services Authority, and the SVEEP Committee at Town Hall, here.

Mr. Joshi said that all citizens who had attained the age of 18 years must vote. Every voter must exercise his franchise. The youth should get their names registered in the voters’ list and become aware voters, he said.

By exercising their franchise, everyone should participate in the progress of the country. Citizens should also know about their duties as enshrined in the Constitution, he said.

When people did not vote, they did not have the right to complain or criticise various problems. “If you feel that no candidate is good, you can press the None Of The Above (NOTA) button on the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM),” she said.

She said that it was incumbent on government officials to be transparent in their work. “Voting is our right. Vote correctly and only then you can see the change in the country. Don’t lose faith in the system,” Ms. Kaveri said.

363,2020/01/25,Bommai promises to revive ailingBrahmavar sugar factory,"Home Minister and Udupi District in-charge Minister Basavaraj Bommai has said that he would put in his efforts for the revival of the ailing Brahmavar Cooperative Sugar Factory, which closed down in 2004 due to mounting losses.

According to a press release issued by the factory here on Friday, Mr. Bommai was speaking to a delegation of factory board and farmers representatives led by K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, during his recent visit to the factory premises at Brahmavar in Udupi district.

Mr. Bommai said that the factory was unlikely to become profitable merely by crushing sugarcane. It would have to produce ethanol also along with crushing sugarcane. But setting up an ethanol unit required a lot of money.

It was unlikely that the government would provide such a huge amount. Since the factory was located on National Highway 66, it would be possible to lease it out to a private party and thus revived, Mr. Bommai said.

Earlier, Mr. Bhat urged Mr. Bommai to put pressure on the State government and get financial help to revive the ailing factory. He said that the revival of the factory would help a large number of farmers of both Udupi and Dakshina Kannada districts. It would also generate employment for workers in the factory, he said.

Chairman of the factory Jayasheela Shetty, who submitted a memorandum to Mr. Bommai, said that with the implementation of the first phase of the Varahi Irrigation Project in Udupi district, water was now flowing into the fields of farmers.

The farmers were ready to cultivate sugarcane as it was more profitable. But if the factory was not revived, the economic condition of farmers was likely to deteriorate as, then, they would have to depend on traditional crops such as paddy, he said.

Besides, the water flowing in their fields from the irrigation channels of Varahi project too would be rendered useless. The revival of the factory was in the interests of farmers of Udupi district, Mr. Shetty said.

Karkala MLA V. Sunil Kumar, the former president of the Udupi Zilla Panchayat Bhujanga Shetty, secretary of the district unit of Bharatiya Kisan Sangha Satyanarayana Udupa Japti and others were present.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/lenth8/article30647881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25MNSUGARFACTORY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/bommai-promises-to-revive-ailingbrahmavar-sugar-factory/article30647882.ece

As many as 54 house surgeons, who have studied MBBS in Kasturba Medical College (KMC) under the government quota, are serving at the two hospitals. The KMC pays fees every year to the hospitals for use of clinical services. These surgeons are those who got MBBS seats in the college through CET conducted by the KEA.

373,2020/01/25,"ICICI Bank posts over two-fold rise in Q3 profit at ₹4,670 crore","ICICI Bank on Saturday reported an over two-fold rise in its consolidated net profit at ₹4,670 crore for the December quarter, helped largely by the Essar Steel recovery and a jump in its core income.

The Mumbai-headquartered bank, the country’s second biggest private sector lender, had posted a consolidated net profit of ₹1,874.33 crore in the corresponding three months of the previous fiscal.

On standalone basis, its net profit jumped to ₹4,146 crore during the December 2019 quarter from ₹1,605 crore in the year-ago period.

Its core net interest income grew 24 % to ₹8,545 crore on a 16% domestic advances growth and a 0.37% expansion in net interest margin to 3.77%.

Other income growth was 18.77% to ₹4,043 crore, with the core fee income increasing 17%, the bank said.

Gross slippages came at ₹4,363 crore for the reporting quarter, highest during the fiscal year, but the recoveries from assets like Essar Steel and a ₹2,000 crore write-off ensured that the same was down on a net basis.

Its president Sandeep Batra said “two well-rated accounts — a troubled broking company and a south-based industrial group — led to the spike in slippages during the quarter, along with Kisan Credit Card loans which is a fallout of the farm loan waivers.”

Without offering any numbers or an outlook on asset quality, he said the exposure to the broking company has been fully provided for, while the same for the industrial company has been done “prudently”.

Its standalone provisions came at ₹2,083 crore, down 51% from the year-ago period.

Gross non-performing assets ratio was at 5.95% as against 7.75% in the year-ago period.

Its overall recoveries, upgrades and deletions from the NPA book was at ₹4,088 crore and the bank did not divulge the benefit on the Essar Steel recovery.

Just like its smaller peer Axis Bank, the bank has also classified an exposure to a telco as below investment grade, which led to the increase in the overall BB and below book to ₹17,403 crore after two consecutive quarters of a reduction.

Its overall exposure to the sector has been stable at 1.8% and includes two top companies, he said, adding no extra provision has been taken on account of this.

Mr. Batra said the bank’s core operating profit excluding the impact of the benefit was up 23% at ₹7,017 crore, seeking to drive the point of a healthy overall growth for the bank.

From an asset growth perspective, loans to small and medium enterprises grew 36 %, corporate advances were up 12% while retail with 19 % expansion contributed to the major share.

The bank is happy with the performance of the unsecured book and continues to grow the same, Mr. Batra said, adding that it now contributes 9% of the assets. The gross NPAs from retail grew to 2.14%, as compared to 2% level in the quarter-ago period.

The corporate loan growth is coming from across sectors, and includes term loans as well, he said, adding that the bank is following a strategy of sticking to well rated borrowers as part of its risk calibrated growth approach.

The bank has added 400 branches during the fiscal year to take its total network to 5,275, and added 13,000 people mainly focused on frontline sales.

Share of the low-cost current and savings account balances slipped to 45 % level during the quarter, but Batra explained that the bank is focusing more on retail term deposits which have grown handsomely.

374,2020/01/25,ICICI Bank net zooms as provisions fall,"Private sector lender ICICI Bank’s net profit surged 158% to ₹4,146 crore for the October-December quarter as provisions for bad loans halved.

Provisions, excluding taxes, declined by 51% year-on-year to ₹2,083 crore during the period under review, from ₹4,244 crore in the year ago period.

The bank benefited from the resolution of Essar Steel during the quarter, which boosted profitability.

Net interest income (NII) increased by 24.3% year-on-year to ₹8,545 crore, which helped the core operating profit (profit before provisions and tax, excluding treasury income) to swell 23.8% to ₹7,017 crore.

The net interest margin (NIM) was 3.77% in Q3 of FY20, compared with 3.64% in the quarter ended September 30, 2019 (Q2-FY20) and 3.4% in Q3-FY19

The gross slippages to NPA remained elevated though recoveries, and write-offs helped to contain the net slippages number.

During the quarter, the gross additions to NPAs were ₹4,363 crore. Recoveries, upgrades and other deletions, excluding write-offs, from non-performing loans were ₹4,088 crore in Q3-2020.

Asset quality improved, with gross NPA ratio declining to 5.95% as on December 31, 2019, as compared to 7.75% a year ago, and 6.37% in the previous quarter end.

Provision coverage

The provision coverage on non-performing loans, excluding cumulative technical write-offs, increased from 68.4% at December 31, 2018 to 76.2% at December 31, 2019.

“During the quarter, there was [a] certain development with respect to a broking company. Our exposure to the company has been classified as non-performing. The corporate NPA addition in this quarter also included a south India-based industrial company, where servicing was regular, but refinancing undertaken in 2018 has now been assessed to be restructuring, leading to classification of NPA by lenders. The company is backed by reputed promoters and investors,” Sandeep Batra, president, ICICI Bank, said in the post earnings interaction with the media. As at December 31, 2019, the fund-based and non-fund based outstanding to borrowers rated ‘BB’ and below was ₹17,403 crore, compared with ₹17,525 crore at March 31, 2019 and ₹16,074 crore at September 30, 2019.

The domestic loan growth was at 16% year-on-year on December 31, 2019, driven by retail loans, which grew by 19% year-on-year. Domestic corporate portfolio grew by 12% year-on-year.

Total deposits increased by 18% and the term deposits grew by 24% year-on-year, while the current and savings account (CASA) deposits grew by 15%. The share of CASA in total deposits was 42.8% in quarter ended December.

375,2020/01/25,Are regulations a boon or bane for tech?,"Amid renewed debates over regulation of newer technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Indian tech industry is of the view that while some regulations may be needed to keep a check on tech , putting up too many barriers may stifle innovation. This comes in the aftermath of Google CEO Sundar Pichai pitching for regulation of artificial intelligence, in a recent article in a financial daily,

In a discussion with The Hindu on ‘Tech in 2020s’, Nasscom senior vice-president and chief strategy officer Sangeeta Gupta said, “From Nasscom’s perspective, you have to give some time for these technologies to mature before you start regulating, because if you start coming up with AI ethics policies, even before AI becomes a little more mainstream, you’re going to potentially create an environment where many of these things don’t even take off. The regulatory sandbox approach that is being suggested is one good way to think about newer technologies.”

Jagdish Mitra, chief strategy officer and head of growth at Tech Mahindra, pointed out that one can only regulate something when one has an assessment of ‘good’ or ‘bad’. “Who’s deciding whether this is good for the society or bad for the society? Will people, who have not experienced it, sitting in courtrooms, decide, or will the common citizen?”

Stating that he sees regulations becoming sort of a citizen charter in the future, Mr. Mitra said that governments would have to create a mechanism to listen to stakeholders.

“Starting from a place where you’re always worried that this will only do bad, is the wrong way to start. You’ll have to start from a point that says that this can do good. Therefore when it starts to act itself out, you will have a set of people raising their voice.”

Dharmender Kapoor, CEO, Birlasoft, said regulations were needed because they act like brakes in a car. “Brakes allow us to run the car at a high speed as we have the confidence that we can stop the car using them. So regulations should be seen in that light...I don’t think we should see this as anything negative. Otherwise, the same technology could be used for electricity generation, or bombing a country.”

Ms. Gupta, however, added that “too many barriers” should not be put up. “Regulation is important, but this should be done as part of a consultative process. You need to allow technology to mature, keep having those discussions, understand their impact and then think of regulation.”",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/are-regulations-a-boon-or-bane-for-tech/article30653955.ece
376,2020/01/25,‘Client must get time for margin before broker squares off position’,"In an important order, the Arbitration Appeal Bench of the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has ruled that a broker cannot square off a client’s position without proper notice even if the client’s margins fall below the required level due to a sudden fall in stock prices.

The order assumes significance as many clients approach the exchanges with similar complaints against brokers who, they say, sell their shares without giving sufficient time to bring additional margin if required.

The bench ordered the entire amount of loss to be refunded to the client along with interest from the date of sale.

As per the order, CD Equisearch has been directed to pay ₹1.23 lakh along with 9% interest to Suwarna Choudhary after the investor filed an appeal alleging that the broker sold her securities to meet the margin shortfall without giving time to bring in additional margin.

The matter dates back to September 2018, when the client had ₹1.23 lakh as margin, based on which she bought one lot each of Maruti Suzuki India and Canara Bank in the derivatives segment.

However, as per the order, the broker sold the lot on the same day due to a sudden fall in prices and post the ‘forced’ sale, the market recovered and closed at a much higher level than the price at which the position was squared off.

The complainant has alleged that the broker was required to ‘demand’ additional margin before squaring off her position.

Further, she alleged that the regulations allowed a broker to sell the securities only if the client was not able to deposit the required margin ‘within the next trading day’.

“Broker has to inform their client of the shortfall in margin calculated at the end of the day. And even after intimation/notice, if a client fails to pay additional margin as levied by the broker next day, then the broker can sell off the client’s open position, otherwise not,” Bhalchandra Ganu, the lawyer for the complainant, said.

There have also been rulings by the Bombay High Court that a broker cannot square off the client position without giving sufficient time to bring additional margin. “The trading member was at liberty to close out the transactions by effecting sales/purchases of derivative contracts but that was subject to the constituent being given a chance to meet his/her obligations in respect of the open position on the next trading day,” stated a Bombay high court in August 2019.

“The requirement of intimation and approval has been held to be sacrosanct before an open position is closed out by broker,” said Sumit Agrawal, Partner, Regstreet Law Advisors.

“In recent years, while SEBI has come up with a lot of circulars to deal with unauthorised trades that puts clients at risk, it should now consider looking at recasting Stock Exchange Byelaws and Rules, which are ambiguous in various provisions,” said Mr. Agrawal, who had earlier worked in the legal department of SEBI.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/tfhx22/article30653839.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THBUSEBI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/client-must-get-time-for-margin-before-broker-squares-off-position/article30653840.ece
377,2020/01/25,"Triumph, Bajaj to develop bikes for global market","British company Triumph Motorcycles and Bajaj Auto Ltd. on Friday entered into a long-term, non-equity partnership to develop, manufacture a new range of mid capacity Triumph motorcycles in India and for selling globally.

The first product from this partnership to be manufactured at Bajaj’s Chakan plant near Pune will hit the market in 2022. Details of the financial arrangements between the two companies have not been revealed.

Motorcycles in the range of 200 cc and 750 cc will be developed by this alliance and the first product will be priced below ₹2 lakh.

The agreement was signed in Pune, the headquarters of Bajaj Auto.

“This is a unique moment, where two world-class companies that are passionate, as well as product focussed, are coming together to build a brand-new range of mid-capacity motorcycles,” Bajaj Auto said. “The partnership will see the two companies with their respective strengths in large and small capacity motorcycles collaborate to design, engineer, and manufacture a range of mid-capacity motorcycles.”

Bajaj to take over Triumph’s Indian distribution activities

Triumph, which sells 60,000 units annually, will see its volume growing substantially as this partnership will offer mid-sized products in high volume emerging markets, including India.

As per the agreement, Bajaj will become one of Triumph’s key distribution partners in new markets for the Triumph brand around the globe.

Going forward, Bajaj will take over Triumph’s Indian distribution activities at a date yet to be confirmed, leveraging the expertise that Bajaj has in this region.

In other key overseas markets where Triumph is not currently present, Bajaj will represent Triumph and offer the new mid capacity bikes as part of the full Triumph line-up.

In all other markets where Triumph is present today, the motorcycles developed together from this partnership will join the current Triumph product portfolio and be distributed by the Triumph led dealer network worldwide.

Lauding Indian frugal engineering and manufacturing capability, Triumph Motorcycles CEO Nick Bloor, said: “This is an important partnership for Triumph. Besides taking our brand to crucial new territories, the products that will come out of the partnership will help attract younger customers. This is another step in our ambitions to expand globally, particularly in the fast-growing markets of South East Asia.”

The move will also drive growth in more mature territories like Europe, he added.

Learning process for Bajaj

Rajiv Bajaj, managing director, Bajaj Auto Ltd., said: “Today is truly a special day for us. Triumph brand is an iconic one the world over and we are confident that there will be a huge appetite in India and other emerging markets for these new products.”

“We look forward to working alongside such a famous motorcycle company and to leveraging each others strengths and expertise to make the relationship a success for everyone,” he added.

He said the company decided to go for this partnership because Bajaj was not known for producing high powered bikes and it would be a learning process for Bajaj in making bikes for the iconic brand.

Triumph Motorcycles had earlier tried to develop a mid-range of bikes on its own, but had failed to achieve competitive pricing argets.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cpbh40/article30650173.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Imagejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/triumph-bajaj-to-develop-mid-range-bikes-for-global-market/article30650134.ece
378,2020/01/25,The long and the short of Uttar Pradesh,"Yogi Adityanath’s term as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.) has perhaps brought the unprintable truth out again: That India’s greatest political problem is not Kashmir, not the Maoists of central India, not the “insurgents” of the North-east, not Pakistan, not China, but the existence of the everyday humanitarian disaster called Uttar Pradesh. U.P. has 80 seats in the Lok Sabha and 404 in its Assembly; and yet they bleed Indian “democracy”. In its violence, Yogi Adityanath’s term mirrors the political DNA of U.P. — a State that forces its governments to institutionalise communalism, casteism, injustice and maladministration. How do we make sense of U.P. as an idea within the Indian Union?

Ground realities

There has been a view that over this millennium, U.P. has witnessed some form of progress and lessening of inequality. But in the UN Human Development Index Report for 2017 (published in 2018), U.P. and Bihar scored the worst among all the States of India. A State Bank of India Research report of March 2019 showed that U.P. had not bettered its human development index over the last 27 years. Two surveys — one by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation called “Household Social Consumption” in its chapter on “Education” released in December 2019 and the other by NITI Aayog called “School Education Quality Index” that came out in October 2019 — measured the best performing States regarding participation of girl children. Kerala topped while U.P. came last in both. In both the reports, Uttarakhand, once a part of U.P., ranked high.

Evolution of communalism

The clichés about U.P. are true: Lawlessness, dacoity, communalism, caste killings, gender-based brutality, feudal-agrarian exploitation, unemployment and underemployment. A good part of its poor leads a sub-human life as migrant labour in urban India and outside. Onslaughts against its workers from nativist Maharashtrians, the exploitation of its labourers in West Asia; their illiteracy and poverty are everyday realities. There isn’t a social evil or fault-line in India, that is not roosting or thriving in it. Why? Because it is too big. Countries in Africa, Europe, and South America have fewer people than U.P. If U.P. is home to roughly 200 million people, how can it not sustain them?

As is customary, where the State is corrupt, callous and cruel, organised religion regulates life. U.P. is the mothership for the conservative and hard-line versions of both Hinduism and Islam in India. Since modernity and governments crater here, older forms of social anchoring have a solid social hold. In such circumstances, when ordinary humans view the state as the foe, godmen and goondas provide a path out of woe. Very often, political power is seized by stoking caste and religious embers. Communalism and casteism are rife for they constitute concrete capital. There is a large amount of scholarship on the evolution of communalism in U.P. and its malleable forms. A recent addition to the area is “Everyday Communalism: Riots in Contemporary Uttar Pradesh” by the scholars Sudha Pai and Sajjan Kumar, which explains how localised, regular, “small” communal conflagrations are manufactured. Ergo it is a State on the boil all the time. So much for Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb.

Crime data

Each citizen in U.P. grows up in an environment that legitimises criminality. The “Crime in India Report” for the year 2017 was released by the National Crime Records Bureau last year. U.P. topped the list with 10% of India’s total crime and three lakh registered First Information Reports (FIRs). It outdid every State on crimes against women, with 56,011 out of 3,59,849 cases all over India. U.P. leads in arms possession and gun licences. Home Ministry data released in 2016 showed the State authorised gun licences for 12.77 lakh people, followed by Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) where 3.69 lakh people possessed arms licences. And we are only speaking of legally owned arms. One study published in 2015, said that of nearly three lakh cases registered in the country for illegal possession of arms, U.P. accounted for 1.5 lakh. There is rich work in the social sciences that examines the spurt in ethnic conflict in “traditional” societies. When any change such as “modernity” or “democracy”, is attempted, it usually activates nativist identity politics. Simply put, an outcome of independence from Britain resulted in Partition, in Ceylon/Sri Lanka it vented the simmering rage of Sinhala nationalism against minority Tamils, the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 provided new fuel to the Sunni-Shia fires. Clearly, “democratisation” and “modernisation” are suspect.

Similarly, Hindu-Muslim and caste conflict are U.P.’s reflex responses to the vagaries and pressures of so-called modernisation — the unevenness modernisation exacerbates in an already uneven society, pushes U.P.’s citizenry into collective religious and caste cul-de-sacs. Pankaj Mishra has argued in his recent books, how modernisation, almost everywhere, is ridden with bloodshed. The purveyors of the Enlightenment, and capitalists and communists alike, avoided confronting this central feature, for it would stymie their vision of human progress.

One of the strongest arguments for the breaking up of U.P. is its internal neglect. Over the last 30 years or more, Purvanchal (east U.P.), Bundelkhand, Awadh (central U.P.) and Paschim Pradesh (west U.P.), have been fighting for resources and separation from U.P.’s power centres. These areas struggle even for water. Uttarakhand split from U.P. and there is no doubt that it has progressed since. In the ‘Report of the States Reorganisation Commission’, first published in 1955, the historian K.M. Panikkar, who was one of its panel members, added a 10-page note on the disproportionate size of U.P. Commenting on the matter he wrote: “It would be easy to see that this preponderant influence which would accrue to a very large unit could be abused, and would in any case be resented by all the other constituent units.” He was signalling a clear challenge for India’s federalism.

In the 2020s, for the sake of U.P.’s citizens and Indian democracy, it is imperative to begin democratically discussing the division of U.P. Its long-damaged psyche yearns to be healed.

379,2020/01/25,Amorphous politics: On rumblings in the JD(U),"The rumblings in the Janata Dal (United) over its alliance with the BJP puts the spotlight on the curious history and character of the regional party and its leader Nitish Kumar. Opportunism is easily forgiven, and often celebrated as pragmatism in politics, and the JD(U) has mastered it to perfection. The party has always been little more than a personal fiefdom of the Bihar Chief Minister but his upbringing as a socialist, social justice politician had occasionally given a redeeming allure to it. However, what has come to stick is his chequered association with the BJP and breathtaking political somersaults in the past that reflect the degrading absence of a moral compass. Nitish Kumar had remained a Minister in the Union Cabinet through the 2002 Gujarat riots, and became the CM in 2005 with the BJP’s support. In 2015, dusting up his social justice hat to stitch an alliance with Lalu Prasad Yadav’s RJD, Mr. Kumar defeated the BJP. Within two years, he broke the alliance with the RJD to snuggle back with the BJP, under Narendra Modi whose leadership he had cited as the reason for his split with it earlier. As the BJP is galvanising all forces to effect the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and start the process of a National Register of Indian Citizens, Mr. Kumar is trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. He impelled his party to support the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament and later called for a national debate on the issue.

This equivocation might soothe his bruised conscience but would not impress any dispassionate observer. The JD(U)’s formless politics is also reflected in the statements made by senior party leaders Pavan Varma and Prashant Kishor. It is possible that they are trying to chart a fresh course for themselves by publicly disagreeing with their leader. But a higher standard of public morality would require them to disassociate with the JD(U) forthwith if they are serious about their views on the CAA. Mr. Kishor’s political career itself is a sign of the changed times. Having shot to prominence as a Modi strategist in 2014, he was later reborn as a campaigner against him on the side of Mr. Kumar just a year later. His dramatic rise in the party was by trampling over the careers of many socialist veterans. Since then, while retaining his post in the party, he has acted as a paid strategist for other parties such as the Congress, YSRCP and Shiv Sena. More than opportunism, this is a commodification of politics. That he retains the JD(U) as a parking lot for himself reflects badly on him, the party and politics in general. Public figures need to outline a framework for their action and be transparent when they change that. Neither the politics of the JD(U) nor its improvisational critics meets this standard.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/amorphous-politics-on-rumblings-in-the-jdu/article30646482.ece
380,2020/01/25,Justice for Rohingya: On International Court of Justice ruling,"The unanimous ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), on Thursday, on the prevention of alleged acts of genocide against Rohingya Muslims has finally pinned legal responsibility on Myanmar’s government for the military’s large-scale excesses of 2017. Crucial is the Hague court’s stipulation that the civilian government of Ms. Suu Kyi submit an update, within four months, of the steps it has taken to preserve evidence of the systemic brutalities. Yangon has also been asked to furnish six-monthly reports thereafter, until the conclusion of the case, which relates to genocide accusations. The court has further emphasised that an estimated 600,000 Rohingya resident in Myanmar still remained highly vulnerable to attacks from the security forces. The ruling vindicates findings by the UN and human rights groups on the prevalence of hate speech, mass atrocities of rape and extra-judicial killings, and torching of villages in Myanmar’s Rakhine province, leading to the forced migration of thousands to Bangladesh. The ruling pertains to the Gambia’s suit on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), alleging that the brutalities by the defence services amounted to crimes of genocide under the 1948 Genocide Convention. Arguing the defence in person during the three-day public hearings last month, Ms. Suu Kyi, who was elected in 2016, insisted that the 2017 violence was proportionate to the threat of insurgency. She even questioned the Gambia’s standing to bring the suit, saying that there was no bilateral dispute.

Rejecting the ICJ’s ruling, Myanmar’s Foreign Ministry has accused rights groups of presenting the Court with a distorted picture of the prevailing situation. In a statement, it defended the army’s action as a legitimate response to violations of the law by the insurgent Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army. However, the above claim is at odds with the findings this week of an Independent Commission of Enquiry established by the government. The Commission acknowledged that war crimes had indeed been committed during the military campaign, when about 900 people were killed. But there was nothing to back the assertions of gang-rape, or evidence to presume any intent of genocide, it held. Although it could take years before the court pronounces the final verdict in the genocide case, Thursday’s injunction is an important victory for the refugees languishing in Bangladeshi camps. It empowers the UN Security Council to prevail upon Myanmar to take appropriate measures for the rehabilitation and repatriation of displaced communities. As the biggest regional player, China could play a constructive role to ensure a speedy return to normalcy in its neighbourhood. India has its own interests in an amicable resolution of Myanmar’s internal dispute. Above all, finding closure to the current dispute would mark the completion of Myanmar’s return to civilian rule.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justice-for-rohingya-on-international-court-of-justice-ruling/article30646488.ece

In her complaint, the 27-year-old woman claimed to have come to India on a tourist visa in March 2018 to learn Bharatanatyam and Kathak. The accused, Vikram Mada, was the teacher. The two fell in love and got married in July 2018.

The woman said that her family came from Chile to attend the wedding, and gifted gold and cash to Vikram.

In July 2019, the couple visited her family in Chile. She told the police that on seeing her family’s financial status, Vikram started demanding money to repay a loan, which he had taken before they got married.

382,2020/01/25,Hundreds of protesters take to the streets on eve of Republic Day,"On the eve of Republic Day, hundreds of citizens headed to different parts of the city to take part in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

One of the largest gatherings was organised at Town Hall by a group that takes its name from the Preamble to the Constitution, ‘We the people of India’. People young and old, many carrying the national flag, gathered from 4-7 p.m. to voice their opposition.

Besides speeches, there were music and mime performances and street plays. Cries for ‘Azadi’ rang out at regular intervals. Although the organisers wanted each protester to release one balloon in the air, the police reportedly did not provide permission.

Awareness at the gram panchayat level

To ensure that people from rural areas are also made aware of the Act, the organisers have decided to conduct programmes at the gram panchayat level. Naseem Ahmed, a core committee member, said that would sustain the movement and ensure that people in villages are made aware of the facts.

Many were first-time protesters, who felt compelled to come out and protest. The protest ended with people singing the national anthem.

At M.M. Road in Pulakeshinagar, hundreds of women, who launched a 48-hour-protest, dispersed in the afternoon. The protest which began on Thursday ended on Saturday. The women wanted to replicate the protests at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi in a show of solidarity. “We wanted to continue the protests, but we were advised by the police not to do so as Republic Day is on Sunday,” said a protester.

Another group that had planned to read from the Preamble and the Constitution of India at Town Hall after 7 p.m. was asked to leave mid-way by the police.

“They had not completed the necessary paperwork for permission. Hence, we asked them to leave,” said a police officer.

383,2020/01/25,Labourer dies while cleaning pit in Shivajinagar,"A 19-year-old labourer died on Saturday while his colleague is battling for life after they inhaled toxic fumes while cleaning a pit inside the premises of a Jain trust on Infantry Road.

The police have booked the manager, trustee and other members of the SSBS Jain Sangh Trust charging them under the SC/ST( Prevention of Atrocities Act), the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, Section 341 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code.

A member of the trust denied allegations that they were cleaning a septic tank and said the labourers had been contracted to clean a rainwater harvesting pit. However, social activist Narasimhamurthy, who registered a complaint with the Commercial Street police on behalf of the victims, alleged that the pit was clogged with sewage.

The deceased, Siddappa, hailed from Siruguppa in Ballari district. He had moved to Lingarajapuram in Bengaluru and worked as a labourer.

The alleged incident took place around 12.30 p.m. The management of the trust had engaged Muniyanna, 50, to clean the tank. Muniyanna brought Siddappa and another labourer for the job.

“After Siddappa entered the tank, he stopped communicating with the others. Worried, Muniyanna went inside and fell unconscious. The third labourer, with the help of members of the trust, rushed to their aid, and alerted the fire and emergency services,” said the police.

The duo were taken to the nearby Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital where Siddappa was declared dead. Muniyanna is in the ICU. The hospital’s Casualty Medical Officer Keshavamurthy said, “He has suffered pulmonary oedema due to aspiration (when some liquid or food gets into the lungs). He has been put on ventilator.”

Regarding Siddappa, the doctor said the cause of death could be ascertained only after the post-mortem.

The equipment used by the labourers, including a small motor, ladder and plastic ropes, lay near the pit.

Narasimhamurthy, in his complaint, said the trust had engaged untrained labourers to clean the tank without any safety gear.

The police are waiting for the post-mortem report and are questioning the trust members who had labourers. No arrests have been made.

A member, who did not want to be named, said, “The pit is cleaned every six months. Muniyanna approaches the trust directly. We routinely get the pit cleaned. Such a thing has never happened before.”

Reiterating that it was not a septic tank or a manhole, he claimed that the rainwater harvesting pit is covered with a metal grille for better air circulation and to allow water to flow in.

384,2020/01/25,Protests saved our national honour: Rajmohan Gandhi,"Historian and grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, Rajmohan Gandhi, hailed the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) – National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests, which he said saved “our national honour"".

On the eve of Republic Day, he spoke of how during the Independence struggle nationalism and secularism were synonymous unlike the narrow definition and notion of nationalism of today which is exclusive.

Addressing the audience at a lecture titled ‘Indian Nationalism and its Current Challenges' at the Indian Institute of Science on Saturday, he said, ""The inspirer of today in India are the women protesting in Shaheen Bagh and not political figures, historians or scholars."" He called upon citizens across the country to hold and encourage more Shaheen Baghs,

He added that anti-CAA-NRC sentiment was high even among BJP supporters. ""Truth has a few friends even in the BJP and the RSS, but they are silent. We must proceed with conviction. This idea of religious test of citizenship is so aberrant that we want everybody to come out against it. How can we accept this?”

He expressed happiness over Chandra Bose, BJP leader and grandnephew of Subhash Chandra Bose, for coming out and saying that dividing the country along religious lines is against the ideas and ideals of Netaji.

He hailed the role of south India in the protests. “Federalism is an important aspect of nationalism. If nationalism crushes federalism, then it is not federalism. India is too large and too diverse a country to be ruled from one place and person,"" he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/protests-saved-our-national-honour-rajmohan-gandhi/article30653573.ece
385,2020/01/25,Wife seeking maintenance claims husband pleaded bankruptcy to cheat her,"A 54-year-old woman has filed a cheating complaint against her husband, whom she had separated from, for allegedly attempting to cheat her. She claimed that he had submitted in court that he was unable to pay maintenance as he was unemployed and bankrupt, but ran a successful finance firm in the United States.

Based on the complaint filed by the woman, the Vidhana Soudha police registered an FIR against Amitabh Sinha on Friday. He has been charged with cheating and criminal breach of trust.

In her complaint, the woman said that they got married in 2001 and moved to the US, along with their child, in 2007 where Sinha worked with a multinational firm.

The woman alleged that Amitabh would harass her physically following which she filed a complaint, which led to his arrest in the US.

After he came out on bail, Amitabh allegedly continued to harass her. She returned to Bengaluru in 2012.

“On her return, she filed a suit in court seeking maintenance from Amitabh. The court ruled in her favour, and also directed the Home Department to produce Amitabh in court.

The Home Department got a Look Out Circular (LOC) issued against Amitabh. “He appeared in court and made a submission that he was jobless and bankrupt, and hence could not pay maintenance,” said the police.

The complainant, however, learned that he had been running his own firm since 2015. She alleged that the company was successful and making a profit. “In her statement, she said her husband has been paying taxes to the US government regularly,” said the police.

Based on the findings, the woman approached the police seeking action against Amitabh for cheating her and the court by producing fake documents.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wife-seeking-maintenance-claims-husband-pleaded-bankruptcy-to-cheat-her/article30653540.ece
386,2020/01/25,Bangladeshi woman arrested in Bengaluru,"The Marathahalli police on Wednesday arrested a 45-year-old woman, allegedly from Bangladesh, who had taken shelter in a labour shed in Kadubeesanahalli.

Incidentally, last Sunday, the BBMP, with police protection, had conducted a sudden eviction drive and razed around 150 makeshift houses at Kariyammana Agrahara, just a few kilometres away from the labour shed. The official, who organised the drive, claimed that illegal migrants were living in the area.

The woman, Nargis Begum, reportedly confessed that she hails from Bagerhat district in Bangladesh, and crossed the border illegally with her family. They came to Bengaluru a few months ago and began working as construction labourers.

“Nargis did not have any documents to prove her nationality, but based on her confession, we have booked her under the Foreigners Act. She has been remanded in judicial custody,” said a police officer, adding that they are on the lookout for her relatives who are absconding.

388,2020/01/25,BBMP standing committee elections today,"Though the long-pending elections to the 12 standing committees of the BBMP are scheduled to be held on Saturday, there appears to be no consensus in the ruling BJP on candidates for these panels.

According to sources, while one section wants the followers of the newly-elected MLAs, who have come into the BJP’s fold recently, to be given the post of chairperson of a few committees, another group wants only those elected from the party to head the panels. A few senior councillors were showing disinterest, given that the term of the committees will be limited.

The source also pointed out that the BJP has assumed power in the corporation during the last year of the five-year term of the current council.

“The party wants to utilise the opportunity to its benefit. This is why seniors want to ensure that only those who have won from the party are given the post of chairpersons of important committees,” they said.

The BJP leadership, including MPs, MLAs and senior councillors, went into a huddle on Friday night to finalise the candidates for the different committees.

390,2020/01/25,For a bird’s eye view,"The dates set for the Asian Waterbird Census 2020 (AWC) stretch from January 4 to 19, but as is the case always, it is not set in stone. The two-weeks-and-three-weekends format is just a recommendation. Conservationist and naturalist groups that are engaged in AWC can undertake the census through the month of January; as this mointh signifies the mid-point of winter, it is also loosely referred to as “mid-winter waterbird census”.

The Madras Naturalists’ Society is the group that is responsible for carrying out the count in Chennai and surrounding areas.

K.V. Sudhakar, president of MNS, explains that the waterbird data that is being obtained from January 1 onwards; and that the exercise will go on till January 31. Sudhakar and Kumaran Sathasivam are the coordinators for the AWC 2020 count pertaining to Chennai and its surrounding areas.

The AWC is bound to provide a bird-eye view of waterbird populations, and their migratory patterns, and it can provide answers to many conservation questions.

“Birds are stickers for “instinct-based systems”, and they pick up incredible cues on when to take that migratory journey and when to undertake the return trip. Everything is timed to perfection, and a small interference along the way can throw everything out of joint. The recent disturbance in the migratory patterns of red knots illustrates this: This bird makes a really long journey from the arctic region to the tip of South America. On the way back, they halt at Delaware Bay, United States, for eggs of horseshoe crabs: It is necessary that they fuel up in this manner, and at this rime of the return journey, to make the rest of the journey. Human interference in this area has led to a dwindling of horseshoe crabs, and this has now affected the pattern followed by these birds for centuries. And we know a lot about this and other the migratory patterns of the red knots, because of tracking systems,” explains Sudhakar, adding that advanced tracking systems and related technologies and wider bird censuses also now help us understand migratory patterns of birds in our region, and also any disturbances in these patterns.

“The AWC has to be viewed in this light,” he adds. “It is a major piece in the migratory puzzle in this region.”

The Asian Waterbird Census can help countries that fall in the Central Asian Flyway (CAF) route to effect interventions, if necessary, to make conditions favourable for birds. The CAF migratory route originates in the northern hemisphere, particularly Siberia, and ends in the southern hemisphere, of which the Indian sub-continent is a significant constituent.

Says Sudhakar, “AWC is a citizens-driven initiative, as it is sustained by the spirit of volunteering. It encourages naturalist and conservationist groups in every part of this region to contribute bird data. Increasing collaboration is also making it easier to collate data about birds — for example, eBird and AWC have an agreement. Now, while making entries about bird sightings, one can transfer the data to AWC as well. This system makes it convenient for tech-savvy youngsters to participate in AWC.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/for-a-birds-eye-view/article30652724.ece
391,2020/01/25,‘Ply mini buses from the station’,"Bus and train commuters from Nanganallur, have made a request to the Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) to opearate mini-bus services from Pazhavanthangal railway station to Nanganallur and Keezhkattalai bus terminuses through interior lanes and Madipakkam Koot Road.

Lack of connectivity in the interior areas - Civil Aviation Colony, Lakshmi Nagar, and Voltas Colony, Nanganallur, forces residents-commuters to depend on autos and private modes of transport to reach Pazhavanthangal Railway Station and Nanganallur Road Metro Station.

In the absence of share-autos facility, the commuters -residents have no other option, either to walk or travel by autos and private modes of transport to reach Pazhavanthangal and Nanganallur metro station.

“ Plying of mini-buses to Nanganallur Hindu Colony bus terminus from Velachery MRTS through Southern Sector Inner Ring Road, Nanganallur Road Metro Station and Pazhavanthangal railway station through Thillai Ganga Nagar, Nanganallur Fourth Main Road and Sixth Main Road, will be a boon to the commuters,” R. Vidya, a commuter, said.

The Pazhavanthangal railway station is a vital link to Nanganallur Anjaneya Temple, Thillai Ganga Nagar Ullagaram and Puzhuthivakkam (Medavakkam Main Road), but there is no dependable connectivity. Plying of small buses to Nanganallur terminus or Madipakkam Koot Road through Raghavendra temple, Roja Medicals, and Independence Day Park, will be helpful. The auto-drivers charge Rs.50 to and from the station, commuters complained.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ply-mini-buses-from-the-station/article30652281.ece
392,2020/01/25,"The answer, my friend, is flapping in the wind","“It was the best of times; it was the worst of times” — Charles Dickens

Dickensian ambivalence best describes the current mood of birders in Chennai. The wetlands are sufficiently-filled, if not filled to the brim. The migratory-bird arrivals have however not matched the expectations raised by the productive monsoon.

It is as though the operatic stage is set, and the expectant spectators have eased into their seats, but the prima donna is hesitant to take centre-stage, thereby delaying the performance indefinitely.

Vikas Madhav, a member of Madras Naturalists Society (MNS) who is the currently engaged in the Asian Waterbird Census 2020 (AWC), which concludes on January 31, expresses the birder-conservationist community’s disappointment succintly.

“When one month arrives, I wait for the next, hoping that the expected numbers would be found then. This has been going on from October. Now, we are in the end of January, and I am looking forward to February,” Vikas hits a plaintive note.

Coordinating the efforts for the waterbird count at Siruthavur, Thaiyur, Manampathy, Amoor and Kelambakkam, as part of AWC 2020, Vikas points out that “84 bird species (water and terrestrial birds) were spotted during the count at and around Siruthavur lake this month. This contrasts significantly with last year’s number of 111 species (water and terrestrial birds) there.”

D. Srinivas, an MNS member who coordinates AWC-2020 counting efforts at Adyar Estuary, Pallikaranai Marsh and Perumbakkam Wetland, has this to say: “Before my group could carry out the counting, I did an initial, individual study, visiting these places, and in the first two weeks of January, the bird count was strikingly low. So, it was decided that we would do the count on January 18 and 19, and we noticed that the migratory birds became more noticeable, which includes clusters of migratory ducks in the Perumbakkam wetland, However, in the three places – Perumbakkam wetland, Pallikaranai Marsh and Adyar Estuary – the numbers are nowhere near what we found in the corresponding period last year,” says Srinivas.

Abhishek Mimani, the MNS memer who coordinates the count at Tenneri, Chembarambakkam, Somangalam and Manimangalam, brings a similar report.

“At Amarambedu, we noticed that the numbers of migratory ducks had dipped considerably this year. Flocks of graganey constituted a decent number. But, there was only a handful of northern shovelers. When we made out visit, we could not see a sing northern pintail,” explains Abhishek.

By this “truant behaviour”, the birds are only instinctively responding to the situations presented to them by impersonal forces. The primary question is: Are the situations benign or are they malignant? There is a trail of other questions following this one.

Have the migratory waterbird population got scattered due to favourable conditions elsewhere that have resulted from a good monsoon? Now, there are more choices at their disposal.

If so, is this pattern noticeable in the those other sections of the Central Asian Flyway where these birds winter?

There is also some clear foreboding in the air, prompting a disturbing question: Is what we are seeing symptomatic of a larger problem, a climatic disturbance?

It is these questions that make AWC 2020 very significant. When collated, the findings of the study from various parts of Asia can be expected to help us understand the prevailing situation better.

Vikas is keeping his fingers crossed, and hoping that the “greater-choice hypothesis” is behind the reduced numbers in known wintering habitats.

“When birds find equally favourable conditions ahead of their regular winter haunts, they have a reason to avoid some extra flying,” says Vikas.

“Due to a copious monsoon, there are more wetlands that these migratory birds can use, and so they would have got distributed,” says Abhishek.

Vikas also hints at the possibility that in some cases, the temporary topographical changes brought in by the heavy rains could be creating something of an optical illusion.

Vikas cites an example: “With considerable water, the Siruthavur lake is really huge now. During the count, we found around 350 garganey, but they were all found at the centre of the lake. Given the size of the lake now, these birds’ presence is close to inconspicuous.”

Given how there would be proliferation of waterbirds during the winter in the Kelambakkam backwaters, what is seen there, at this point of time, can be only described as bleak, says Vikas.

However, encouraging sights heave into view now and then.

“In the Kelambakkam backwaters, we spotted over-a-hundred Pacific golden plovers,” says Vikas on a chirpy note.

Similarly, Srinivas has some positive stories to share from the count that his group carried out — “We observed 130 Eurasian wigeons on January 18 at the IT SEZ Sholinganallur which is cheek-by-jowl with the Pallikaranai Marsh; 200 black-tailed godwits at Adyar Estuary; and 80 grey-headed lapwings at Pallikaranai Marsh.

While being thankful for these small mercies, let us also wait for the complete data and findings from AWC 2020, and hope to see the puzzle solved.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/j3e4h8/article30652100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWCcensus2a,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/the-answer-my-friend-is-flapping-in-the-wind/article30652107.ece
393,2020/01/25,"A year on, plastic ban to be enforced in the city outskirts","It has been a year since Tamil Nadu banned the use of non-biodegradable and single-use plastic products in the state and accordding to enforcement agencies, it is being enforced strictly.

The Greater Chennai Corporation has set up five special teams, involving officials from the health and solid waste management departments, to monitor actions being taken to enforce the ban on single-use plastics covering all 200 wards in the 15 zones. Officials from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) and the police are also being roped in to assist the civic body in this work.

Corporation officials say they will be intensifying their drive in the extended areas which include Ambattur, Valasaravakkam, Sholinganallur, Manali and Alandur.

“There is lack of awareness on the city outskirts, so we have to focus more on such areas,” says a Corporation official, adding that tons of banned plastic bags were seized from Ambattur.

Sometime ago, civic officials conducted raids in wards 79 to 93 in Ambattur zone and wards 94 to 108 in Anna Nagar zone, covering more than 62,000 commercial establishments, hotels, petty shops, and seized 55 tons of banned plastic items.

Likewise, in Tiruvottiyur and Manali, drives were conducted at more than 20,000 shops a fortnight ago, and around 12.5 tons of banned plastic items were seized. During the year-long raid in 2019, the civic body had reportedly seized 312 metric tons of banned plastics and more than 60% of it was from added areas and a total fine amount of ₹ 1.5 crore had been levied, say Corporation officials. Easy availability of cheap plastics that are smuggled from districts into bordering zones is one of challenges faced in this drive. “Police check-posts in bordering areas within the city limits were also included in efforts to check the transport of plastic items into the city,” says a Corporation official.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jnmyk8/article30652063.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26DCMYPRPLASTIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a-year-on-plastic-ban-to-be-enforced-in-the-city-outskirts/article30652066.ece

395,2020/01/25,MTC commuters irked by lack of bus shelters,"In the absence of a shelter at Metropolitan Transport Corporation bus-stop in Saidapet, commuters have to brave the blazing sun. It is a busy stop as buses (including deluxe services) from Tambaram, Kundrathur, Poonamalle, Koyambedu and Thiruvanmiyur halt there.

“The bay dedicated for buses bound for Broadway and Central does not have a shelter. In contrast, there are shelters for services proceeding to T. Nagar and Ayanavaram,” says R. M. Sundaram, a resident of T. Nagar. Commuters also point out that a tablet listing the services that will halt at the respective bays should be displayed. They have also suggested that Metropolitan Transport Corporation ply services to Broadway from Saidapet terminus as most of the buses are overcrowded, coming as they do from faraway places like Kundrathur and Poonamalle.

On a section of CIT Nagar First Main Road, which stretches from Anna Salai junction to the intersection of CIT Nagar Fourth Main Road, motorists can be seen driving on the wrong side of the road. They do so to avoid waiting at the signal at Anna Salai junction.

“Although traffic police personnel have been deployed at the intersection, they are just mute spectators to the chaos. Many minor accidents have occured at this junction,” says M.

397,2020/01/25,Eco-warriors take up a BYOC battle,"In 2018, when cafe chain Chai Point launched the ‘Bring Your Own Cup’ (BYOC) initiative, it was a small but bold step towards preventing usage of disposable paper / plastic cups and preventing trash from reaching the landfills.

Convincing Chai Point management to commit to the BYOC is a big victory for a small army of eco-warriors called Bengaluru Eco Team (BET).

Now, Chai Point is not a small chain of outlets. As per the latest count, it has 170 outlets spread across all major cities.

“We sell over 5 lakh cups of tea every day across our 170 outlets. Even if 5 to 10 % start bringing their own cup, it will make a big difference to the amount of waste generated every day,” says Amuleek Singh Bijral, co-founder and CEO of Chai Point.

He acknowledges that they launched the BYOC drive from their Bengaluru outlets after a few environment-conscious customers started nudging them to do so.

“A couple of them started by writing mails, following us on social media, sending reminders, all very politely,” says Bijral.

It helped the brand win the hearts of environment-conscious consumers.

BYOC campaign are no more a novelty in Bengaluru.

BET, which is an informal group of members spread across various neighbourhoods in the city, have been pushing restaurants, juice shops, take-away outlets and societies to start their own BYO drives.

N.S. Ramakanth, a member of Solid Waste Management Round Table, says there are more than 200 members in BET. “All of us not just practise what we preach but we also try to influence others,” he says.

“Bengaluru was among the first cities that had banned single-use plastic, so the momentum was launched much earlier. Although arecanut leaf plates were considered environment-friendly, it takes around 10 months to decompose, so reducing the amount of waste we product became a big focus of our campaigns,” says Ramakanth.

He says BYOC has become a movement.

Last year, during Gandhi Jayanthi, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) launched the BYOC campaign inspired by the trend in the city. Until then, the Transport Corporation was providing passengers with plastic water bottles in all its buses.

“In fact, the Corporation went a step ahead where it launched ‘Selfie with your own bottle’ contest where lucky winners got a free travel,” says Seema Sharma, who was among those who co-ordinated with the Chai Point management.

Similarly, Rishita Sharma, who runs Rent-a-Cutlery, was among those who started the #BYOC Selfie challenge on social media. She proudly shows that her daughter’s school sent out a mail asking parents to bring their own boxes for annual day and her apartment society also initiated the ‘bring your own cutlery at get-togethers.

Ekayana, a north Indian and continental outlet, say they were inspired by the BYOC campaign and started to offer 10% discount for customers who bring their own containers.

Similarlly, Mani’s Dum Biryani asked customers to bring their own containers and carry bags and get a discount of 5% for takeaways.

398,2020/01/25,Hospital walls nurture art,"It seems to be an unwritten edict in the medical world: The corridors where patients wait for the doctor’s consultation have to be hemmed in by walls that are stark — sober and neat, but lacking in colour.

Isn’t that the case, usually?

Kauvery Hospital in Alwarpet is trying to overturn this general percepetion of the waiting hall and corridor, with what it calls ‘Project Magizhchi’.

The initiative seeks to help amateur artists from across Chennai by allowing them to display their artworks on the hospital walls. Of course, it helps the hospital, as the walls come alive with colours, shapes and stories.

The walls on three floors — second, fifth and sixth — and at the basement area of the hospital have been turned into an display section for art.

Uma Maheswari, head of innovation and talent management, Kauvery Hospital, says the hospital did have some art works adorn the walls when they started the facility but it soon became monotonous. Staring at a blank wall or waiting for the doctor can be frustrating, that’s when the management decided to do something more. With the project, they hope both in-patients and those frequenting the hospital will have a positive feeling taking a tour of the exhibits.

“This will be like a rotating exhibition, where new artworks would be placed every three months,” says Uma.

The founders of the hospital are patrons of art.

“We are particular that works of upcoming artists will only be showcased and it is being done on a no-cost basis,” says Uma.

Currently, 42 artworks of students of Sishya, OMR are on display.

The children — classes V to IX — had worked on them as part of their school exhibition.

On the basement, 18 ‘puzzle’ works of an autistic child are on display.

The hospital has more plans in the offing, with one of them being working slowly towards having artworks adorn all the floors. The artworks would be changed periodically.

“In the future, the artworks would also be up for sale. We might have special fund raiser events with the paintings,” says Uma.

Vijayalakshmi Shivaram, an artist, is helping curate the artworks.

“We have two criteria for selecting the artworks to be displayed — they must be secular in theme and pleasing to the eye,” she says.

Some of the doctors are also good artists, and we might make the walls “accessible” to their works too, she says.

The management will be promoting the works of the artists on their Facebook page.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i90bd4/article30651601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26dcmyprKauveryjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hospital-walls-nurture-art/article30651604.ece
399,2020/01/25,Taking a cycling route to our roots,"‘A bicycle ride around the world begins with a single pedal stroke” — so goes a famous saying, attributed to author and cyclist Scott Stoll.

As Cycling Yogis, a Chennai-based group of cycling enthusiasts, are celebrating the eight edition of what they call the Republic Day Heritage Ride, the saying rings true.

A pedal stoke started in 2013 has covered much ground in the world of heritage, putting the spotlight on many less-known heritage locations in and around Chennai. Over the years, it has tried to broadbase the definition of heritage by going beyond architecture-based heritage sites to encompass those imbued with natural history.

Here are some of the snapshots of the Republic Day Heritage Ride as it played out, over the years:

In 2013, around 40 cyclists took part in the first edition of the Republic Day Heritage Ride. Flagged off at Madhya Kailash, it culminated at Mamallapuram.

In 2014, the cyclists rode to the backwaters of Pulicat. Starting from MCC High School, Harrington Road, the route winded through Perambur, Madhavaram, Moolakaddai, Puzhal, Redhills, Thatchoor, Ponneri and reached its final destination at Pulicat.

In 2018, 50 cyclists rode to Gingee Fort, covering a distance of 150km.

The ride that began in the wee hours at Santhome Inn, Chennai ended at Gingee Fort by noon.

In 2019, 50 cyclists participated in the heritage ride to Kancheepuram, which flagged off from OMR.

This year, the 8th edition of Republic Day Heritage Ride is pedalling outside Chennai to another city, the temple town of Kumbakonam. On 24th January, 20 cyclists from Chennai set out on their cycling journey along with other riders from across Tamil Nadu to discover the roads that lead to the nine Navagraha temples around Kumbakonam. Today being the last day of the three-day heritage ride, the cyclists will be finishing their 250+ kms ride on the saddle.

With the cycle tour being headed by Girija Palani, a passionate cyclist, the team comprises of four women who are creating history on this first ever cycling tour of Navagraha temples. The three-day cycling tour aims at promoting one of the busiest pilgrimage routes in Tamil Nadu as an eco-friendly travel circuit through cycling. On finishing, the cyclists will be awarded with a specially designed wooden medal featuring the details of the tour.

Discovering heritage

“Seeing the world from a bicycle is completely different from viewing it through the tinted windows of a traditional tour bus.

By cycling to heritage sites, you get a deeper understanding of these places, how civilisation grew around them, about the natural resources and waterbodies that existed or still exist in these areas,” says Ramanujar.

The group organises heritage-based cycling rides across the year in Chennai, including on World Heritage Day in April, Madras Day in August, and Republic Day in January.

These trips attract people from different walks of life who share a common passion for cycling and heritage.

While the World Heritage Ride has thus far been about museums in Dakshinchitra and the likes, the Madras Day Heritage Rides in August have covered intracity expeditions to Triplicane, Mylapore, Royapuram, Perambur, Cooum River (Kesavaram), Sadras Fort, Adyar River (Manimangalam), Thirukazhikundram.

More than just being a sight-seeing trip, the cyclists get engaged at their pit stops to stop and look at the historical annotations of the place fuelling their quest to know more about their roots.

Every year in November, Cycling Yogis also organises a heritage site clean-up of the St. Fort George, open to public participation.

400,2020/01/25,First trial for Chennai Metro Rail’s phase I extension project to start by February end,"As the first step in preparation to running full-fledged operations, Chennai Metro Rail will carry out an initial trial in the phase I extension project from Washermanpet to Wimco Nagar that covers nearly 9 km of north Chennai, in the last week of February.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), they are likely to do run a shunting loco in the underground stretch from Washermanpet to Korukkupet initially, and do an inspection of how it works. “Now, the tracks are being laid in this 9 km stretch; in the underground section, the track has already been laid but the work is still on for the elevated section. We are hoping to finish it in an another month. If it gets completed, then we may do a trial run for the whole stretch and if not, we will certainly run the shunting loco for the underground section alone. During this trial, we will know if there are any problems and what areas need correction,” an official said.

In this 9 km stretch, a small section from Washermanpet till Korukkupet alone is underground and after that, the stretch rises above the ground till Wimco Nagar. Currently, the construction of stations and installation of some systems for running of the Metro are on.

Subsequently, after the trials with the shunting loco, CMRL will run a trial with trains. This is likely to happen by April, officials said.

As Chennai Metro has been planning to open this stretch by June, the beginning of such trials is crucial and only after they are proved safe and all the hitches are corrected, can the section become operational for the public.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/rqhuf0/article30651387.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25JANTH-METRO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/first-trial-for-chennai-metro-rails-phase-i-extension-project-to-start-by-february-end/article30651388.ece

The judgment has reinstated justice,” he said.

404,2020/01/25,Court orders fresh Nadigar Sangam polls within 3 months,"The Madras High Court on Friday declared as null and void the elections held on June 23 for the South Indian Artistes’ Association (SIAA), popularly known as the Nadigar Sangam, and ordered fresh elections within three months after a complete overhaul of the voters’ list.

Justice K. Kalyanasundaram delivered the verdict on a batch of cases filed both in favour and against the elections held last year. He appointed former High Court judge B. Gokuldas as an election officer, entrusted with the responsibility of supervising the election of new office-bearers.

“Fresh voters’ list shall be prepared after verification, and the same shall be notified. Fresh election notification shall also be issued as per bylaws. Members of the petitioner association and the Government of Tamil Nadu shall provide all assistance, including police protection, and extend fullest cooperation to the election officer for the conduct of free and fair election,” the judge said. “The decision of the election officer is final with regard to the issues relating to the election process. If there is any dispute/grievance/clarification, it is open to all parties to approach this court for getting appropriate orders,” the judge added. He also accepted the submission of Additional Advocate General P.H. Arvindh Pandian that a special officer, appointed by the government, should be allowed to continue to discharge her duties, until the results of the fresh elections are declared, and the new office-bearers assume office.

It was further ordered that SIAA should pay an initial remuneration of ₹2.5 lakh to Mr. Gokuldas for conducting the elections.

Justice Kalyanasundaram also held that the three-year tenure of former SIAA president M. Nasser, general secretary Vishal, treasurer Karthi and other office-bearers, who got elected in 2015, had come to an end on October 18, 2018, and all actions taken by them, pursuant to that date, should be considered invalid in law.

He pointed out that Section 15(4) of the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act of 1975 categorically states that the term of office of the members of the committee should not exceed three years. Further clause 37 of the bylaws of the association also provide for conduct of election of office bearers once in three years.

“Such being the legal position, the term of the Executive Committee (of SIAA) could not have been extended by way of a resolution passed at the general body meeting that too on the ground that the construction of a convention hall and office premises was in progress,” the judge said.

Consequently, a meeting convened by the Executive Committee on April 28 for the purpose of conducting elections and the elections conducted by it on June 23 were invalid in law and not binding on the members of the association, he ruled.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/9t7e7m/article30647586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THNADIGAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/court-orders-fresh-nadigar-sangam-polls-within-3-months/article30647587.ece
405,2020/01/25,Tamil version of Hum Dekhenge released,"The Tamil version of Hum Dekhenge, written by Faiz Ahmed Faiz, which has become a popular protest song during the recent demonstrations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, was released on Friday.

The translation was done by Ponni and Mangai and the rendition was by musicians Anjana and Bindu Malini.

In an interaction during the launch of the song, Kannan Gopinathan, former IAS officer and activist, spoke of the suppression of anti-CAA protests and how the freedom of expression, guaranteed by the Constitution, was not available in practice to citizens.

“We thought we had the freedom of expression. We never tried to use it. Only when we tried to use it, did we realise that we did not have it,” he said.

Sustaining protests

Mr. Gopinathan stressed on the need to continue the protests, while at the same time, engage in conversations with those in support of the Act.

Retired Madras High Court judge, D. Hariparanthaman, highlighted how Section 41 of the Madras City Police Act was used to suppress civil liberties, throughout the year, in Chennai.

R. Vaigai, advocate, Madras High Court, said Article 19 of the Constitution, guaranteeing freedom of speech, had been watered down over the last 70 years.

406,2020/01/25,When Chennai came close to getting its own Shaheen Bagh,"For a while on Friday evening, a narrow street in Washermanpet looked set to become Chennai’s own Shaheen Bagh. Hundreds of people, including women and children, turned up for a protest, fully intent on carrying it on for as long as they could. But all of them had to go home at night after the police denied them permission for a long-drawn protest, along the lines of the one in Delhi.

Around 4.30 p.m., people in the hundreds gathered in the narrow street in Washermanpet. A tent was in place and a huge poster declared it Chennaiyin Shaheen Bhag. A bunch of tiny tots held out roses to police personnel, and with an endearing smile requested them to grant permission to protest.

Over the next few hours, holding candles and flashing phones, hundreds of men, women and children gathered and registered their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

Clad in a bright blue dress, nine-month-old Alisha Sara was perched on her father’s shoulder. With them was her four-year-old brother Wasif Ahmed. “I decided to bring my children because they are the future; this Act [CAA] will be detrimental to their lives. What will happen to my children,” asked Mohammed Ershad. Thirty-year-old Yasmin Umar Khan, who brought both her children, said that they would protest till the government revoked CAA. “My children should know and be aware of what is happening to their lives. People take cognizance of an issue and view it more seriously when they see even children actively participating in a protest. Our demand is that the discriminatory Act should be withdrawn at once,” she said.

Former IAS officer Kannan Gopinathan visited the spot and expressed solidarity with the protesters. Speaking to The Hindu, he said, “When I heard women are leading the protest against something which is against the Constitution, it is inspiring indeed. It is our duty to show solidarity and tell them we are here by their side.”

Thameem Ansari of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi said, “Legislations are for the people and when the government can see people are extremely unhappy over CAA and NRC, it is only right that the Centre should immediately withdraw the law.”

Meanwhile, several men in white T-shirts that proclaimed ‘No CAA, NRC and NPR’ formed a human chain on one side, providing a sort of shield to those protesting, while ensuring smooth flow of traffic.

The protesters had come with plans to spend the night and continue their protests. But the police asked them to disperse after 9 p.m. “We had to discontinue the protest around 9.30 p.m as police spoke to us saying there will be traffic problems. We have asked for a venue for continuous protests,” said Ansari.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/78ogk0/article30647560.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/when-chennai-came-close-to-getting-its-own-shaheen-bagh/article30647564.ece

411,2020/01/25,"President Bolsonaro, PM Modi share views on the idea of a nation: Brazil Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo","India and Brazil are expected to sign a number of agreements including a Strategic Partnership action plan and a Bilateral Investment Treaty when Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro meets with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. In a written interview, Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araújo, who is part of the delegation, says the two countries share more than a common worldview; their leaders share values on nationalism and sovereignty as well.

What are your hopes and expectations from the visit of President Bolsonaro to India as the Chief Guest for Republic Day?

Brazil considers India one of the main partners in our new international strategy and in our new foreign policy as a whole. Our countries share common values. Brazil and India are two of the biggest democracies in the world. There is also a convergence between our worldview and that of Prime Minister Modi, that you should build a nation true to its values and traditions, proud of itself.

We think that this is the basis for a thriving economy. Many people around the world think that there is an incompatibility between having an efficient, liberal and productive economy, and being a nation true to its values, an organic nation. We believe the opposite; we believe that these things are compatible.

India and Brazil have shared some common foreign policy postures: on strategic autonomy, on the reform of the UNSC, a balance with the U.S., distance from China's BRI etc. Is it time for a common platform projecting a more ‘South-South centric’ worldview?

I would not exactly call it a “South-South centric” worldview. We believe that through a more profound relationship, our countries may leverage their positions in all international fora, in the United Nations and the Security Council as well as in many other instances. An excellent relationship with the U.S. — a situation India has attained as well — is crucial for the international projection we aspire for Brazil.

Previous doctrines in our foreign policy envisaged an international projection for Brazil in opposition to the United States or disregarding the role the U.S. could play in our partnership. We have changed that approach.

We are also deepening our relations with China, a very important partner for the Brazilian economy, above all as a market for our agricultural exports. Regarding the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), we believe that the great extent of valuable Chinese investments in Brazil do not need to bind us to a comprehensive framework such as the BRI in order to maintain a fruitful relation with China.

Both Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Modi have come under some international criticism for religious politics and their ‘nationalistic’ views….

President Bolsonaro and Prime Minister Modi share a close standpoint with regard to sovereignty and their idea of nation. Both leaders have appraised the concept of nationality. I believe those common values create an even more fertile soil for what we can do along with India, in a way we have never accomplished before. This official visit is the first step towards that aim: we have the opportunity to sign an unprecedented number of agreements — not only in quantity but also in quality — in many different fields. We can also feel the enthusiasm on both sides about our cooperation and particularly regarding the Action Plan to strengthen the Strategic Partnership.

One point of divergence has been the situation in Venezuela, where New Delhi and Brasilia recognise different governments. During the visit, would your government hope to convince the Indian government to withdraw support for President Maduro?

The Brazilian government expects to exchange views with the Indian authorities on each country’s regional scenario. It is not our intention to persuade India to address this issue in one way or another. We just expect India to look at the situation with new eyes. Because the population faces a despotic regime of the worst kind that has deliberately wrecked the country’s economy and institutions.

Brazil believes there is hope to restore democracy in Venezuela and stop the current genocide of its population, through the legitimate government of (Opposition candidate) President Juan Guaidó.

You have been publicly skeptical of climate science, particularly in the context of last year’s Amazon fires. What kind of discussions do you hope to have on climate change negotiations with India?

President Bolsonaro himself, other Brazilian authorities and I have tried to demonstrate that the image initially portrayed by certain leaders was not accurate. One has to bear in mind that the environmental portfolio, particularly the alleged deforestation of the Amazon, unfortunately conceals hidden agendas of certain governments and several NGOs which are detrimental to the Brazilian agribusiness, whose competitiveness and commitment to sustainability stand beyond doubt for all to see.

In a democracy, we have to discuss and scrutinize all scientific approaches to each issue, and there are several experts that present reasonable doubts about man-made global warming. They should be heard, not demonised. That course of action does not mean disregarding international commitments. President Bolsonaro has vowed to keep Brazilian multilateral participation in this pivotal area.

412,2020/01/25,"It’s not yet Howdy, Modi!","U.S. President Donald Trump completed three years in office amid the chaos this week of an impeachment trial, initiated by the Democrats. If he goes on to win a second term in November as it now appears, Mr. Trump will have had six overlapping years with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in power by 2024. Persistent in their efforts to remake their countries and their engagement with the world, Mr. Modi and Mr. Trump are shaking up the bilateral ties between the two countries, and the resultant flux could outlive their tenures. Mr. Trump is scheduled to make this first visit to India next month.

As leading a ‘reawakening’

Both leaders continuously reiterate that their predecessors were incapable of protecting national interest. Such a premise commits them both to reframe the national interest, and both have articulated it with clarity and force. For instance, Mr. Modi, in Houston in September 2019 and Mr. Trump in Davos this week, went great lengths to lay out figures that presented their respective regimes as the most effective guardians, and ushers of progress, of India and America in history.

Both have a cultural and an economic agenda. Both dispensations believe that “the people” had been given a raw deal by earlier regimes, controlled by the elites and the experts who were in collusion with their global counterparts. They are now leading a national reawakening, and working hard for the hard-working people, they point out. Both believe that cultural nationalism is a force for the good; and both believe that Islamism is a major challenge to the nation. Though it is transnational, Islamism has collaborators and facilitators within the borders, as per their shared world view. Both believe that national borders need to be strengthened by stricter monitoring and setting new bars for entry. “JOBS, JOBS JOBS” as Mr. Trump tweets frequently in all capital letters, has been the loudest promise of both of them. Both leaders try to renegotiate the contract between the union and the States, and between citizens and the state within their respective countries; they assert the supremacy of the executive over the legislature and the judiciary. Both have a grim view of critical and independent media.

Despite his success in installing a legion of conservative judges, Mr. Trump has not gotten much far with his project of remaking America; for instance, the U.S. Supreme Court stalled a move to insert a question on citizenship in the census. Mr. Modi has been undoubtedly successful in warding off any meaningful scrutiny by the judiciary, and in subordinating Parliament. Categorical that the nation could not assert its rightful place in the world until they came to power under inept predecessors, they are trying to rework the terms of engagement of their respective countries with the world. The notion of shared values of India and the U.S. has acquired a whole new meaning under Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi.

True to their politics

Supporters of stronger U.S.-India ties had thought the nationalist politics of these two leaders would have a limited impact on bilateral ties that have autonomous drivers of convergence. But both leaders have been remarkably true to their politics in their governance. Mr. Trump has forced significant turns in the American approach to the world, blunting resistance from the security and corporate establishment, while Mr. Modi commanded the wholehearted support of the Indian military and security establishment for his disruptive security and strategic steps at home and abroad, though corporate India protests under its breath. Shared values notwithstanding, national interests as perceived by these leaders have several points of divergence and therein lies in the current tumult in India-U.S. ties. While Mr. Trump has been outspokenly confrontational with the “world order” that he says has worked against American interests, Mr. Modi swings between calling for adherence to order and chipping away at it. America under Mr. Trump has wrecked treaties such as the Paris climate agreement and institutions such as the World Trade Organization and the United Nations, making a mockery of “rule based order”.

India under Mr. Modi continues to push for more space for itself in global affairs by seeking a permanent seat in the UN Security Council and membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. There has also been the cancellation of several bilateral investment treaties, based on the understanding that they were negotiated on a weak footing. India’s approach of cautiously challenging the world order predates Mr. Modi, as seen in its nuclear ambitions, but the current regime has been audacious, pre-emptive military action in a foreign country being the most instructive.

Under Mr. Trump, America expanded the principle of pre-emptive strike to include the assassination of a senior official of Iran. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi tried to renegotiate the neighbourhood policy of America and India, respectively. After dismantling the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Trump forced Mexico and Canada to accede to his demands in a new trade deal. Mr. Modi’s spirited outreach in the neighbourhood is still playing out, as it has touched raw nerves in small countries always wary of a domineering India. India’s historically warm ties with Bangladesh have been frayed. While Mr. Trump does not care about its forward posturing, India also cannot expect any American support in realising its ambitions of reordering the global power structure in its favour.

China and Pakistan

India’s ties with the U.S. are impacted by America’s ties with India’s adversaries and neighbours, China and Pakistan. Mr. Trump’s bluster against both had lit hope that there would finally be a near-complete alignment between India and the U.S. on strategy. Mr. Modi asked his audience in Houston which included President Mr. Trump: “Whether it is 9/11 in America or 26/11 in Mumbai, where were the conspirators found?” But there is no guarantee that cultural politics can align them.

Despite his avowed opposition to America’s endless wars in West Asia, the cultural warrior in Mr. Trump has been tricked bythe country’s military establishment into going against Iran headlong, which is not in India’s interest. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi share strong bonding with the Gulf Cooperation Council kings, but their courses in the region are diverging. The American President’s impatience to get out of Afghanistan before the polling day had already pushed his administration closer to Pakistan, which is now further necessitated by his adventurist Iran policy.

As he appears to be lurching into fresh conflicts in the region, Pakistani generals are back in demand. While professional strategists have continued to read from the checklist on China in the last three years, Mr. Trump has been singularly focused on one question — trade. He cares little about China’s expansionism and at any rate that is not a factor in his ties with other Asian countries. He forced new trade deals on Japan and South Korea, and continues to look for a grand deal with China itself.

Points of fission

Far from seeing India as deserving special concessions to counterbalance China as old wisdom demanded, Mr. Trump has bracketed India and China as two countries that have duped his predecessors to gain undue advantage. He has accused both countries, in the same tweet, of raising trade barriers, having weak intellectual property protections, and stealing American jobs. He finds little value in Mr. Modi’s climate policy. And he has followed it up with restrictions on H-1B visa, ending of India’s status under the World Trade Organization’s Generalized System of Preferences and other punitive actions. This has been matched by India’s own protectionist measures, in response to American actions and independent of it.

By increasing hydrocarbon imports from the U.S., the Modi government is trying to reduce India’s trade surplus. Meanwhile, the intemperate mobilisation of Indian diaspora in America by the government has resulted in the inevitable blowback. The diaspora has been divided, and the bipartisan support for India is now squandered. Progressive sections on the Democratic side and religious libertarians and evangelicals on the Trump side are both concerned about India’s majoritarian turn. Nobody can shun India; but nobody celebrates India either.

A robust economy has allowed Mr. Trump the political space to temper his polarising rhetoric while Mr. Modi has had to double down on his, amid a sluggish economy. Partnership with America is critical to Mr. Modi’s plans for India, but the inverse is not true for Mr. Trump. The U.S. President’s India visit scheduled for next month will be part of an ongoing exploration of a new equilibrium in ties.

413,2020/01/25,Rap on the knuckles,"Thursday’s ruling by the International Court of Justice where it has ordered Myanmar to protect the its Rohingya Muslim minority strikes a blow for human rights even though it might take a long time for the final verdict to arrive. The stunning role played by tiny the Gambia in this case cannot be understated.

The ruling must also be seen in the backdrop of the defence by Nobel laureate and Myanmar’s civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her country’s stand. It has also unmasked the overwhelming nature of offences committed by the Myanmar military. Now it is for the international community to see how well this order is honoured and implemented by Myanmar (‘World’ page, “ICJ orders Myanmar to protect Rohingya”, January 24).

414,2020/01/25,A careful crafting,"The article, “The origin of the Constitution” (OpEd page, January 24), is an eye-opener to an ordinary citizen like me: that the framing of the Constitution was actually the culmination of much discussion and deliberations spanning over 40 years. What was more exhilarating was that even colonial Britain had facilitated the framing of the strong ideas of democracy through Round Table conferences in London.

One only wishes that there should have been a robust provision in such an arduous work to prevent for eternity, the trampling down by a majoritarian government of the core ideas encompassing the equality of India’s citizens.

415,2020/01/25,Prisoner rights,"What is imperative is that the tenets of the law should be followed in letter and spirit and all convicts including those on death row should be permitted to exhaust all the legal remedies available to them. This is even more relevant in cases of capital punishment as it is a matter of life and death. There have been instances in the past of Presidents of India taking time to make decisions on mercy petitions despite receiving clearances from the Home Ministry and where in all such cases the onus rests on them and not on the convicts. Hundreds of nations have abolished capital punishment but India is not one of them so it is essential that haste of any kind is avoided in execution of death warrants and that the right to a free and fair trial is not abrogated at any point (Editorial, “Needless impatience”, January 24).

C.V. Aravind,

Bengaluru

It is axiomatic that prisoners in the death row should be provided with opportunities to seek the state’s mercy and a judicial review of the sentence that is irreversible once it is carried out. The law, besides being a philosophy and a moral force, is an institution that has preserved social order. It is rule-based and is driven by processes. The remedies available to prisoners awaiting execution should be precise and time-bound. Anomalies and grey zones of ambiguity facilitate dilatory litigation that is initiated as a desperate yet mischievous intent of postponing the execution. The tension between individual rights of prisoners and the demands of the collective conscience of the society tilts in the latter’s favour in respect of heinous crimes like the Nirbhaya case once the Supreme Court has examined the evidence and ruled out the possibility of reversing the death sentence. The barbarity and depravity of the crime perpetrated in the Nirbhaya case have shocked the nation so much that it is difficult to either plead for mercy for the convicts or initiate a debate whether or not we should abolish capital punishment.

V.N. Mukundarajan,

This daily’s pursuit of a single point agenda, of decrying all that is being done or attempted to be done by the Narendra Modi government, quite often breaches the endurance capabilities of many readers. The Editorial is an instance of this. By decrying the government’s action in seeking Supreme Court guidelines in curbing the practice of dilatory tactics by condemned prisoners, there has been scant concern for public mood.

417,2020/01/25,Bombay HC asks MIFF to explain selection process,"The Bombay High Court on Friday directed the Centre to state the process that was followed by the selection committee of the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) while rejecting three documentary films.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a petition filed by filmmakers Anand Patwardhan and Pankaj Kumar after their documentaries were not selected for screening at MIFF.

Mihir Desai, the petitioners’ counsel, argued that no reasons were officially given by the MIFF organisers while rejecting the films. The petition claimed the films may not have been selected as they are critical of the current political dispensation and critical of the political philosophy that they claim to espouse. Mr. Desai argued that the petitioners were not aware at what stage their films were rejected or on what grounds.

On Friday, the Bench directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the Centre, to submit on January 27 the records and process followed by the selection committee while rejecting the films.

The Bench said, “The petitioners have an apprehension that their films showing certain content will not be allowed to be screened. Show us what process was followed by the committee. We are not going to curtail your [selection committee’s] freedom to select.”

The petition claimed the selection committee acted in an arbitrary and malafide manner by rejecting the three documentary films. Mr. Patwardhan’s film Vivek/Reason documents the ascendancy of a particular political ideology in recent times. The film covers the murders of rationalists such as Narendra Dabholkar, Govind Pansare, M.M. Kalburgi and Gauri Lankesh, and investigates the connection of these crimes to the various sectarians outfits.

The documentary also looks at violent attacks on Muslims and Dalits in the name of cow protection, the caste-based discrimination that led to the suicide of young student leader Rohith Vemula, and numerous other outbursts of violence, large and small, connecting them to present an overview of the turmoil that India is currently witnessing.

Mr. Kumar’s movie, Janani’s Juliet, follows the story of Indianostrum, a Puducherry-based theatre group, that is disturbed by a spate of honour killings in India and sets out to study the implications of caste, class and gender. His second entry, Two Flags, chronicles the life and politics of Puducherry.

The petition has sought the HC to order the film festival director to screen the three films. The five-day festival, scheduled to begin on January 28, is organised by the Films Division of the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The festival aims to provide a platform for documentary and short film makers from all over the world to meet, exchange ideas and explore possibilities of co-production and marketing of documentary, short and animation films.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bombay-hc-asks-miff-to-explain-selection-process/article30650186.ece
418,2020/01/25,Mumbai 24x7: it’s baby steps yet,"The city, they say, never sleeps. Or does it?

From this weekend, Mumbai will do its best to live up to the tag. Forget about London or Singapore, all you want to do at night will be made available right here, with the State government officially opening up the city’s services 24x7.

Tourism Minister Aaditya Thackeray, who has been pushing his Mumbai 24x7 plan for years, announced this week, “From January 26, the policy will be implemented in Nariman Point, Kala Ghoda, BKC and mill compounds.”

Malls, stores, restaurants, multiplexes, salons and all establishments can now stay open 24x7 provided they do not serve alcohol. They will not require additional clearances, as long as they have all the requisite permissions from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), Mumbai Fire Brigade and police.

A senior civic official, who did not wish to be named, said any commercial establishment that does not serve alcohol located inside a gated community, mill compound or a commercial area will be allowed to stay open 24x7. “They do not need separate permissions, but the rules for serving alcohol stay the same,” the official said. Alcohol can currently be served only up to 1.30 a.m.

Some of Mumbai’s establishments have taken cue, staying open through Friday night. They plan to keep the buzz all the way to Sunday, while others are still testing the waters. But more than them, the Mumbai 24x7 plan is a test of political will.

Who will stay open?

So far, malls such as R City in Ghatkopar, Atria Mall in Worli, Phoenix in Lower Parel and Kurla, Growel’s 101 in Kandivali, Infiniti in Malad and Andheri, Star Mall at Dadar, Fun Republic in Andheri, apart from several restaurants in Kamala Mills, have expressed interest in staying open through the night this weekend.

The Multiplex Association of India has said multiplexes such as CR2 in Nariman Point and Viviana Cinepolis in Thane will have late night shows on an experimental basis this weekend.

McDonald’s has announced that its seven restaurants will stay open through the night over the weekend. Apart from these, most large establishments will wait to see the response this weekend before committing to the proposal. Also, most have said they are yet to have the logistics and infrastructure in place.

Those who are on board have welcomed the initiative and are laying out on the benefits.

R City, for instance, has lined up late night offers, deals and entertainment options. “We have given the liberty to our retail partners to choose work timings and the deals they would like to offer to consumers,” said Santush Kumar Pandde, head, R City Mall.

The Tourism Department’s idea of trying it out over the weekend, he said, will help the malls understand consumer behaviour and the profitability for various businesses, “basis which this initiative can be tweaked in the long run.”

Westlife, which has 315 restaurants — 94 in Mumbai and 46 within the BMC jurisdiction — will keep all its seven McDonald’s restaurants open and plans to scale this up. “We are very excited about this move and believe that this will truly make Mumbai a ‘maximum city’. It will help boost business for brands and generate employment,” said Saurabh Kalra, senior director, strategy and operations, at Westlife Development (McD). “McDonald’s restaurants in many parts of the globe operate 24X7 and have seen significant success. We hope to replicate this in Mumbai,” he said.

Sachin Dhanawade, chief operating officer, retail and real estate, Grauer & Weil (India) Limited (Growel’s 101), said, “We appreciate the concept of 24x7 in Mumbai and are happy to support the initiative; however, it is imperative that we take feedback from our retail partners.”

While Growel’s 101’s entertainment and food and beverage tenants have responded positively to the plan, most retailers are working on their revenue versus expense projections to assess the financial impact, he said. “We are also reviewing the cost impact that would be generated for tenants to support the initiative partially, if not fully. To begin with, we may consider trying this out on Fridays and Saturdays.”

The logistics

The initiative will mean the police will need to beef up its monitoring, whereas for the BMC, it is only a question of increasing awareness on the new state of affairs.

“This is an enabling provision; the laws were already in place. No new permissions will be needed,” said a senior BMC official on condition of anonymity. The BMC, he said, is putting up frequently asked questions on its website and plans to start a helpline for anyone who wishes to report untoward activities. “This is a self-regulatory policy: establishments will themselves have to adhere to guidelines, else have their permissions revoked.” For instance, the Excise Department will revoke the liquor licence if anyone is serving alcohol after the deadline. Food trucks, he said, cannot be started yet as a policy is in the offing.

The police, on the other hand, is keeping close watch on a few locations — with some help from the establishments themselves.

The government on Thursday directed the Commissioner of Police to prepare a proposal regarding additional deployment that may be required.

Nine locations are on the police radar, where malls and eateries will be allowed to stay open all night, and if private establishments require police security, they will have to pay for it, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh had said on Thursday.

The Mumbai Police said the fact that the malls will have their own security measures in place will help enforce law and order once the change comes into effect. With ample lighting, security personnel and CCTV cameras in place inside the establishments, the police will focus more on the area outside and around them.

“We will be increasing patrolling as well as deployment in the relevant areas to ensure that there are no law and order issues. We already have a CCTV camera network in place which lets us view events in real time in the control room,” Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Vinoy Kumar Choubey said.

Mr. Choubey said meetings with the establishments’ managements will be held at the police-station level so that police can get a sense of the existing security measures and accordingly work out deployment and patrolling.

Activities like keeping a check on antisocial elements, especially those who commit thefts in crowded areas, will need to be stepped up.

Police officers said only weekends will need special focus as on other days, people will have to go for work, or take their children to school the next morning.

Political pow-wow

Apart from being a step towards making the city a truly international one and boosting tourism, the success of the plan is a litmus test for Mr. Thackeray. The Shiv Sena scion said, on Friday, that London’s night economy is worth £5 billion, and the nightlife proposal can lead to large-scale employment generation. Mumbai’s service sector employs around five lakh people, he said.

Mr. Thackeray had conceptualised the Mumbai 24x7 project when he was still in the Yuva Sena. The move was seen as another attempt by the Sena to distance itself from its former ‘anti-Valentine’s Day’ avatar, and make it more youthful.

But the going has not exactly been smooth. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Ameet Satam had demanded night markets be allowed in the city instead, and the two parties sparred in the BMC several times over the proposals.

In 2018, the BJP-Sena government gave it the go-ahead and even issued a notification subject to police approval.

The police had concerns related to law and order, and it was never implemented.

But earlier this month, Mr. Thackeray, now Tourism Minister and Guardian Minister for Mumbai Suburban District, convened a meeting with Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi and Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve, along with representatives of various establishments. It was decided that the government would go ahead with the policy.

However, based on a 2017 report of consultancy firm Accenture, Mr. Barve is believed to have conveyed to the government that 6,500 additional police personnel will be needed if the nightlife plan has to be implemented across the city and not just in pockets.

On Friday, Mr. Thackeray said there would be no strain on the police. Since establishments cannot serve alcohol after 1.30 a.m., police will only have to focus on law and order issues, if any.

Political parties are not convinced, though.

The BJP has criticised the project, bringing its oft-repeated argument out of the bag: “it is against Indian culture.”

On Friday, Mr. Satam tweeted, “Mumbai needs ease of living, good roads, clear footpaths free of encroachment, proper hawking policy, public transportation… Night life is not the priority at the moment. Aping the West is not the solution.”

Mr. Satam has written to the Municipal Commissioner to not introduce nightlife in Juhu for security reasons.

What the people want

If social media is any indication of what Mumbaikars think of the idea, it appears not everyone is gung-ho. One Twitter user @ViolentVeggy wrote: “So, I can get a haircut at 2 a.m., go to the bank, but I cannot get a drink. Non-drinkers can get food all night long #Mumbaineversleeps.”

Another user @amind1970 wrote: “...Does that mean our festivals can also be celebrated beyond 10 p.m.? Nightlife comes with serious security threats and burden on police. The staff in all these establishments also have to commute to and fro, please think about their safety too. Plus, the burden on trains, buses, autos, police, traffic police etc.”

The move may be big-bang for now, but almost everyone in Mumbai is watching if it will work.

What the 2017 report said

The previous BJP-Sena government in the State had commisisoned Accenture in 2017 for an Ease of Business Report on the hospitality industry.

The report had predicted that tourist expenditure and average length of stay in Mumbai will double if the 24x7 plan is implemented. The stay is pegged at two days for domestic and four for foreign tourists in Mumbai.

The average tourist expenditure per day is ₹6,718 for foreign tourists and ₹3,141 for domestic tourists.

The report also predicted a rise in employment opportunities from the existing 60 million (direct and indirect) jobs generated by the tourism sector in Maharashtra.

Of the 71 permissions required at the operational level by bars and restaurants, many are insignificant and should be deleted, the report said.

Of the 142 licences, 29 should be merged, while the remaining 113 should be brought down to 20, it said. The report recommended the abolition of permit rooms and permits for drinking.

On the basis of the report, the government announced it would do away with drinking permits. However, the Mumbai Police objected to this.

A note from the Maharashtra Home Department had asked the then police commissioner to speak to the municipal commissioner to identify select spots where nightlife could be opened up. But that never happened.

The to-do list

The BMC has issued several instructions to establishments. Some of them are:

Give an undertaking to the Excise Department stating they will not serve alcohol beyond 1.30 a.m. Display this notice to customers

Permissions to play music by live bands in concourse areas within malls may be considered, provided there are no tickets being sold

Permission to extend screening time in theatres beyond 1 a.m. can be sought (Labour Department to issue clarification)

If the scheme is successful, establishments may have to pay the police for their services

Authorities might consider extending the timing of public transport like BEST in these areas

420,2020/01/25,Coronavirus: U.K. citizen quarantined in Mumbai,"Three people, including a 65-year-old U.K. citizen with a travel history to Hong Kong, have been quarantined at the civic-run Kasturba Hospital as a precautionary measure against the novel coronavirus (nCoV), which has led to an outbreak in China.

While the senior citizen was admitted to the isolation ward of the hospital on Friday, the two others — a 36-year-old man and a 31-year-old woman — with a travel history to China were admitted on Thursday. Those two however tested negative for nCoV.

A statement from the Union Health Ministry said that one of the Mumbai patients had tested positive for Rhinovirus, while the other had a common cold. The test reports of the U.K. citizen are awaited.

State health officials said more than 1,700 travellers have been screened at Mumbai airport and seven people are currently under surveillance in Maharashtra, including three in Pune and four in Mumbai.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s executive health officer, Dr. Padmaja Keskar, said samples of all three patients at Kasturba Hospital had been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.

The U.K. citizen, who is attached to a multinational engineering firm implementing major infrastructure projects in Mumbai, had travelled to London for Christmas and thereafter spent nine days in Hong Kong before returning to Mumbai on January 10.

When in Mumbai, he lives in an apartment rented by his company at a hotel in Bandra. On Friday, he visited the Asian Heart Institute to seek treatment for a sore throat and headache, but looking at his travel history, the hospital gave him an N95 mask (a mask with efficient filtration) and referred him to Kasturba Hospital, which has an isolation facility.

Created since the H1N1 outbreak in the State, the isolation facility — ward 30 — has six glass cabins and four side rooms for quarantined patients.

“When we came to Kasturba Hospital, the doctors insisted that he get admitted. They have taken his throat swabs and blood samples for testing,” said a colleague who was accompanying him, expressing concern about the quality of care at the isolation facility.

In a press statement, Health Minister Rajesh Tope said there is no reason to panic. “For suspected patients, isolation facilities have been created in Mumbai’s Kasturba Hospital and Pune’s Dr. Naidu Hospital,” said Mr. Tope, adding that those who have travelled to Wuhan in China and have symptoms like cold and fever should seek medical advice.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses with some causing less severe ailments, such as the common cold, and others more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).

The bandh was called to protest the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The day went off amid tight bandobast by the police, even though the bandh received a lukewarm response from citizens.

The most serious incident was reported in Chembur, where an unidentified person threw a stone at a Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) Undertaking bus.

422,2020/01/25,Ahmedabad youth held for running flesh trade racket,"The Anti Human Trafficking Unit (AHTU) of the Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested a 20-year-old Ahmedabad native for allegedly running a flesh trade racket in Mumbai. The police have also rescued four victims, one of whom is a minor. Two others involved in the racket have also been arrested.

According to AHTU officials, the accused, Aditya Chawda, works for a logistics support company. Earlier this month, officers received a tip-off that he was involved in flesh trade rackets in Mumbai.

Trap in Mumbai

“We got in touch with him using a dummy customer and set up a meeting with him at the Starbucks outlet in Mahavir Nagar, Kandivali. While he was initially reluctant to come to Mumbai, he agreed when we insisted that we would only close the deal with him,” a Crime Branch officer said.

On Thursday, Mr. Chawda reached the Starbucks outlet along with two female pimps and the four victims. “The victims were supplied by the two pimps and the collective price for all the four women was fixed at ₹3.5 lakh,” the officer said.

Three actors rescued

Mr. Chawda, the pimps and the victims were all taken into custody as soon as they showed up at the coffee shop. “One of the four victims is a minor, while the other three are actors and have worked in television or web series. They are all based in Mumbai,” the officer said.

Mr. Chawda and the two pimps were handed over to the Kandivali police, who are now trying to find out how long the youth has been active in the racket. All three have been charged under the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act.

423,2020/01/25,IndiGo to run direct flights to Chinese city,"Amid the coronavirus scare in China, IndiGo has announced direct flights from Mumbai to Chengdu from March. This will make it the third direct flight between Mumbai and a Chinese city. While Air China flies to Beijing, RwandAir connects to Guangzhou.

In a bid to enhance point-to-point connectivity, IndiGo announced the launch of daily direct flights connecting Chengdu with Mumbai effective March 15.

Currently, it connects two destinations in China: Chengdu with Delhi and Guangzhou with Kolkata via daily direct flights.

With the launch of these flights, Mumbai will be the third metro connected with China directly, while the frequency will be 42 IndiGo flights operating between India and China each week.

William Boulter, chief commercial officer, IndiGo, said, “We are pleased to announce our third daily direct connection between India and China on the auspicious occasion of the Chinese New Year 2020. Having entered China in September 2019, IndiGo is now connecting India’s financial capital Mumbai with China’s city of the pandas, Chengdu.”

Mr. Boulter said the airline was aware of the concerning situation of the virus in certain areas of China and was working with the authorities to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew. “At present, our flight schedules are unaffected,” he said.

IndiGo said that besides being a popular destination for Indian travellers, China is also the world’s largest source of travellers, with over 100 million outbound trips estimated in 2020. “We strive to build Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata as gateways from China to connect with over 60 destinations in India,” Mr. Boulter said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/indigo-to-run-direct-flights-to-chinese-city/article30648182.ece
424,2020/01/25,State to invite banks to invest in govt. housing projects,"In a bid to revitalise the real estate industry, the Maharashtra government is planning to invite major banks and financial institutions to promote and invest in government housing projects, State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said on Friday.

Mr. Awhad said, “The real estate industry needs to be promoted and infused with money to ensure the completion of housing projects. For any economy to thrive and grow, the real estate industry has to be powerful and in a working condition. The government since its formation has been reviewing the sector and has found that it needs a financial push.”

The Minister said a meeting will soon be arranged between representatives of the State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of Baroda and Japan International Cooperation Agency and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray and Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar to discuss the issue.

Mr. Awhad said, “There is unrest within the housing sector and it has to be dealt with immediately. Unless one finances the government housing projects, they won’t be completed on time. We are seriously considering the option of asking these financial institutes to extend their helping hand.”

The Minister had recently held a meeting with SBI officials to invite them to invest in the real estate sector. Two weeks ago, in a review meeting of the Housing Department, Mr. Thackeray had said a thriving real estate industry would help revive the State’s economy.

Mr. Awhad said he has been pushing the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) to develop its land bank instead of handing over the task to private builders. He said, “Let the MHADA earn the money by constructing houses. It is already in profit and more money coming its way would mean that the MHADA will be in a position to help the government financially.” The Minister said a study group has been organised to find out methods to develop the MHADA land bank and a report on it will soon be submitted.

Mr. Awhad said a decision to reserve 10% of MHADA houses for police constables and another 10% for grade IV government employees is on the agenda. He said, “We are also planning to place reservations on vacant government land to build houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tdprd8/article30648180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMJITENDRAAWHAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/state-to-invite-banks-to-invest-in-govt-housing-projects/article30648181.ece
425,2020/01/25,"Minor was sexually assaulted, say police","The Matunga police on Friday confirmed that the minor girl who was found injured near King’s Circle on Wednesday morning had been sexually assaulted.

According to the police, the five-year-old victim stays with her parents on the pavement under the Matunga flyover. At around 4 a.m. on Wednesday, her mother woke up to find her missing and woke up her husband. The couple started searching for their daughter and found her in an injured state four hours later.

“The victim was admitted to Sion hospital, where she underwent a medical examination. During this time, it was confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone IV) Saurabh Tripathi said.

Mr. Tripathi said some leads regarding the identity of the accused had come to light and were being worked on. The police have registered a case of sexual assault on a minor under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The victim, who had sustained an injury to her head, is still in Sion hospital and her condition is said to be stable.

“We are scanning CCTV camera footage from the spot as well as around it. We suspect that the accused is from the same area and had his eye on the victim for some time. The spot where she was found is a secluded one during nights and early mornings, and she was only spotted at around 8 a.m. by a college-goer, which further indicates the accused had knowledge of the area,” an officer with the Matunga police said.

427,2020/01/25,‘Government following divide and rule policy’,"Communist Party of India leader and former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Kanhaiya Kumar on Friday said if the government does not consider a section of the population to be citizens of the country then the citizens will not accept the government.

Mr. Kumar was in Mumbai to attend a protest at the YMCA ground in Agripada, which was organised by the Aligarh Muslim University Alumni Association, Maharashtra, in collaboration with Chhatra Bharati. Over 20,000 people took part in the protest, which began at 4 p.m. To thunderous applause from the crowd, Mr. Kumar said, “The current fascist regime is following in the footsteps of the British with its policy of divide and rule. They claim to have broken the back of terrorism, but I think that just because there is no terrorism left, the ruling party is using the police to spread terrorism. If you do not consider us citizens then we do not consider you as our government.”

Mr. Kumar said while people are raising concern over unemployment and the lack of women’s safety, the government is using the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to distract them from the real problems in the country.

“According to the Prime Minister, Smriti Irani is the true definition of women empowerment, but the true faces of women empowerment are Fatima Sheikh and Savitribai Phule,” he said.

Richa Singh, former president of the Allahabad University Student’s Union, and Padma Shri awardee Ganesh Devy were among the speakers at the protest.

Mr. Devy recalled how the ‘Quit India’ slogan was raised in Mumbai for the first time, and said it is now time to raise a new slogan: ‘Fix India’. “All of us should start a civil disobedience movement, where we stick a letter on our doors saying that no inquiry related to CAA or NRC will be entertained,” Mr. Devy said.

Ms. Singh said, “We will not show our documents to the Prime Minister. Instead, we would like to see a report card of what he has done.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/brl91q/article30648115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMKANHAIYAKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/government-following-divide-and-rule-policy/article30648116.ece

State Home Minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh said, “I strongly condemn the Centre’s decision to transfer the case to NIA without taking permission from the State government. This action is unconstitutional,” he said.

He said the Centre’s decision comes a day after the State government decided to go deep into the case by forming a Special Investigation Team (SIT).

NCP spokesperson Mahesh Tapase said, “Within a day of NCP president Sharad Pawar demanding an SIT in the Bhima-Koregaon riot probe, the Ministry of Home Affairs has transferred the case to the NIA. What is the BJP afraid of? Why have they suddenly lost faith in Maharashtra Police? These are some questions that the BJP will have to answer,” he said.

On Thursday, Mr. Deshmukh had said an SIT of the Maharashtra Police will be formed to investigate the violence at Bhima-Koregaon in 2018. NCP chief Sharad Pawar had written to Mr. Deshmukh demanding such a probe, raising questions over the earlier investigation where Dalit and Ambedkarite activists were labelled Urban Naxals and jailed.

In a review meeting held by Mr. Deshmukh and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Thursday, the latter had raised doubts over the letters submitted by the Pune Police against the activists, claiming to contain an alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The police have seized goods worth over ₹43 lakh from him.

According to officials, Crime Branch Unit X conducted the raid based on information provided by the Enforcers of Intellectual Property Rights (EIPR), an independent body that works against counterfeiting.

“Based on the information, teams led by police inspector Sunil Mane and assistant police inspector Dhanraj Chaudhari raided a commercial space in AH Compound on Andheri-Kurla Road and found a workshop in which the counterfeit goods were being made,” a Crime Branch officer said.

The teams found a large number of toners, cartridges and inks, which were similar in their make to products by companies like HP, Epson, Samsung and Canon, which were allegedly being passed off as bonafide products. The Crime Branch then arrested Narshi Chaudhary (42), who was the brains behind the racket.

“The collective value of the seized goods comes up to ₹43.47 lakh. The accused was passing off the counterfeit parts as branded ones and making huge profits in the process, while also flooding the market with goods of substandard quality. Apart from the customers not getting value for their money, such rackets also harm the reputation of the companies in whose name the products are being sold,” the officer said.

430,2020/01/25,Nanded runway incursion: DGCA takes stern action,"The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has suspended the flying licences of the pilot-in-command and the first officer of charter operator Taneja Aviation in connection with the runway incursion at Guru Gobind Singh Ji Airport in Nanded last year. All five people on board the flight, including the two pilots, were unhurt in the incident.

The DGCA investigation into the mishap that occurred on September 11, 2019, revealed serious lapses. The probe found that the requirements for adverse runway landing performance were not met and the loading of the aircraft was beyond the permissible level. The investigation also revealed that the Air Traffic Control gave the pilots clearance to land the plane on Runway 28, but the pilots opted to use Runway 10 where the approach light system was not serviceable.

The runway incursion left the aircraft damaged and the DGCA issued show-cause notices to the pilots. When they failed to give a satisfactory response to the notices, the DGCA decided to suspend their licences for a year. Arun Kumar, director general of DGCA, has confirmed the action.

On the day of the incident, the aircraft was operating as an air ambulance and there were doctors from Mumbai on board to harvest the heart and liver of a brain-dead patient. The patient died before the doctors could reach the hospital.

While landing, the aircraft skidded off the runway and travelled about 1,000 feet on the airstrip before losing control. The aircraft then entered the fields 50 metres across the runway and got stuck in the mud. Officials said the ground was soggy owing to persistent rain.

A team of officers and technicians from the South Central Railway had to be roped in pull out the aircraft from the muddy fields. The team used hydraulic jacks, wooden packing, mild steel sheets, released sleepers and two road mobile cranes to retrieve the aircraft.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/2g63d6/article30648054.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BMTaneja,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/nanded-runway-incursion-dgca-takes-stern-action/article30648055.ece
431,2020/01/25,Pizza maavu: Welcome to Mr. Mathroobootham food recipe website,"Respected Madam/ Sir

Welcome to Mr. Mathrubootham food recipe website. Today I am going to make tomato and cheese pizza totally 100%. Why because totally free on Friday evening and suddenly during news reading on website one picture of pizza is appearing. And then many YouTube videos are saying pizza and all easy-o-easy even small children are making within one hour.

I will give step by step instructions. First of all you must announce pizza plan to entire family during morning breakfast time. Then please wait for 10 minutes for wife and son to laugh BabaBabaBaba like diesel generator behind wedding tent.

Next make list of all ingredients. Then go to kitchen. You will immediately find that out of 11 items required for pizza only two items are available. Water and salt. So you will tell wife, “Kamalam, I am going to shop to buy pizza items.” She will say, “Old man, don't buy ₹3,000 items to make ₹15 pizza. I said, “Thank you for moral support Kamalam, without you what I will achieve in life.”

Next step is optional: immediately leave the family and start new secret life in Bengaluru or Ernakulam. If this is not possible, then please proceed to shop for purchasing items.

Next step is very important, please avoid shopkeeper and assistants like anything. If you say, “Thambi, what all items needed for pizza, please help,” they will look as if you have put one speech in Hindi during DMK meeting. Then they will say, “Uncle, people are spending crores to make food delivery company that is making crores of loss. You just order on the Internet no?”

After 45 minutes you will come home with all items. Wife will say, “How much wheat you bought? We cannot use in 15 years also.” Madam/ sir, make sure that right now tension and kolaveri are filling up body and brain of chef. Don't worry whatsoever. It is very useful in the next stage when you have to mix water and flour and salt and mix and mix and mix. Just think of face of your family and within 10 seconds you will have nice pizza maavu.

Now put maavu in bowl and then make tomato and cheese and all. Recipe is saying please keep maavu in warm place. Just you put it in one corner and then put one towel on top then to avoid any confusion, put in the most corner of corners, behind a banana.

Then wife will come and say, “Old man, maid has come to clean house.” You will say, “No problem, I will come after 20-30 minutes. Brain is non-stop thinking of pizza. Will it be tasty? Will it be big? Should I have for lunch or dinner? Should only put tomato and cheese? Maybe mushroom also?

Mouth is watering like anything.

Next step come home. Wife is not talking. Son is in bedroom working from home. Nobody is speaking. What is the problem? Mystery of mysteries. Then I go to storeroom. Maavu is gone. Like Harold Holt, old Prime Minister of Australia, totally disappeared.

“Kamalam, where is maavu?” Like talking to bougainvillea. No answer.

Then maid will come and say, “Uncle, I thought some fungus is growing, put everything into dustbin. Very sorry. Please don't get angry.”

Whether I got angry? Never. Immediately I went to Internet and told billion-dollar company to send pizza. I sat alone in the bedroom and ate happily. Kamalam came and said, “Old man, eating alone or any sharing is there?” I said, “Pizza for you is ready. It is in the dustbin.”

This is the end of recipe.

Yours in satisfaction,

432,2020/01/25,Collision warning system for buses,"Imbibing modern technology for accident prevention, the Kerala Development and Innovation Strategic Council (K-DISC) has entered into a collaboration with the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) to trial a collision-avoidance mechanism that could go a long way in monitoring driving behaviour and reining in rash driving.

Ten buses of the State-run transport utility have been equipped with telematics devices in the pilot phase. Introducing early warning systems, the K-DISC has adopted a two-pronged strategy involving a collision-avoidance system and Advanced Driver Assist Systems (ADAS) technology to constantly monitor the movements of buses, even while providing real-time alerts to the drivers.

The council has partnered with Mobileye, a subsidiary of technology giant Intel, to equip the buses with its collision-avoidance alert system Mobileye 630, which comprise a display unit and a camera unit with buzzer and have multiple features including warning systems for forward collision, pedestrian collision, lane change, and speed limit indicator. Bolstering the precautionary mechanism, Intel has engaged with Pune-based startup Intangles Lab Private Ltd. to incorporate another device that constantly monitors vehicle health, monitors fuel stock and vehicle usage, and also relay GPS data.

The mechanism will also map ‘grey spots’ that will enable authorities to identify vulnerable (or accident-prone) hotspots along the bus route. The proposed addition of a road experience management feature in the device will capture information about road landmarks such as traffic signs, traffic lights, road marking, and potholes.

According to Deepthy Mohan, programme manager, K-DISC, the initial results of the pilot project has been encouraging since its launch two months ago. While studies have proven that 80% of the accidents can be prevented with simple early warnings of less than three seconds, there is much scope for assimilating the technology in the operations of the KSRTC.

“Besides warning drivers of possible collisions, the mechanism also enables the company to keep track of various aspects of driving behaviour such as speeding, gear utilisation, idling, hard braking as well as risky lane change,” the official said.

Currently, the collision avoidance system has been equipped in buses being plied along the Thiruvananthapuram-Nagercoil, Thiruvananthapuram-Bengaluru and Thiruvananthapuram-Kozhikode-Thamarassery. The possibility of utilising the system for wider use will be based of the findings of the study that will be submitted within two months.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/6ng1lb/article30654600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26tv-mobileyecol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/k-disc-trials-early-warning-systems-in-ksrtc-buses/article30652757.ece

434,2020/01/25,Message of nutrition to the grassroots,"Community-based events have been rolled out by the Women and Child Development Department as part of the Sampushta Keralam project to improve nutrition among children, adolescents, and pregnant and lactating women in the State.

The community-based events, held twice a month in the 33,115 anganwadi centres in the State, focus on tapping into traditional milestones in a mother or child’s life (from conception to prenatal and neonatal periods to the first two years) and using them to promote adoption of good health and nutrition behaviour.

The themes of the community-based programmes are associated with maternal and newborn/children’s health and their nutrition. The events are designed as platforms to pass on messages and counsel pregnant and lactating women on healthy practices. The programmes provide opportunities for face-to-face interaction among beneficiaries, community representatives, and facilitators such as anganwadi or ASHA ( accredited social health activist) workers. This is significant for it helps mobilise the community to support the women follow the recommended practices. So, not only the women but also their key influencers become aware of important health, nutrition and child care practices.

Target

The events target improvement in health-seeking behaviour among pregnant and lactating women.

The programmes also go a long way in creating awareness of benefits available to pregnant and lactating women under the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) and Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY).

The community-based events are conducted under five names: Kunjoonu, Seemanthasangamam, Varnasangamam, Dampathisangamam, and Nirmalasangamam.

Women and Child Development Director T.V. Anupama says sensitising mothers is still the best way to ensure health and nutrition of the entire family.

435,2020/01/25,"Teary farewell to Praveen, family","Hundreds of people joined grieving relatives at Chenkottukonam, near here, on Friday to bid farewell to Praveen Krishnan Nair, his wife Saranya, and their three children who died in a suspected gas leak in Daman, Nepal, earlier this week.

The children, Sreebhadra, 9; Aarcha, 8; and Abhinav, 7, were laid to rest in a single grave at Rohini Bhavan, where Praveen’s parents live with his sister. Praveen and Saranya were cremated on either side of the grave.

Saranya’s nephew Aarav performed the last rites.

Employeed in Dubai

Praveen, 39, who was employed with the Kalandoor Group of Companies in Dubai, leaves behind his father Krishnan Nair, mother Prasanna Kumari, and sister Praseeda. Saranya, 34, was pursuing her MPharm and is survived by her father Sasidhara Kurup and sister Aiswarya.

The bodies had been flown in from New Delhi early Friday morning and were kept at the mortuary of the Government Medical College Hospital, Thiruvananthapuram. They were brought to Chenkottukonam in five ambulances.

The tragedy had claimed the lives of eight Keralites who were part of a 15-member tourist group from the State. Praveen’s friend and batchmate Ranjith Kumar, 39, of Kunnamangalam, Kozhikode, his wife Indu, 34, and their son Vaishnav, 2, also died in the incident that occurred at Daman.

The bodies were flown to New Delhi from Kathmandu on Thursday morning after autopsy at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in the Nepal capital.

437,2020/01/25,Many offers for 100-day plan,"The city Corporation is all set to launch a slew of projects announced as part of its 100-day action plan by Mayor K. Sreekumar.

The Subhojanam project to ensure hygiene in restaurants, distribution of drinking water in water tankers, Mayor’s complaint redressal cell, and a few other projects will be launched next week.

Announcing the launch of the projects at a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Sreekumar said that many other projects announced as part of the 100-day action plan were currently progressing. Minister for Local Self Governments A.C. Moideen and Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran will launch the ‘Subhojanam’ project and drinking water tankers at a function to be held at 10.30 a.m. on January 28.

Minister for Health K.K. Shylaja will inaugurate the help desk and punching facility at the Corporation office at 3.30 p.m. on February 3. From February onwards, distribution of drinking water in the city will be allowed only in tankers registered with the Corporation, to ensure the quality of the water being distributed. Under the new system, consumers can place their orders for water online — 500 litres is the minimum volume — for the tanker supply.

Digital passes

The stations will issue water to the tankers after scanning the digital passes issued via the computerised facility of the Corporation that will also maintain a web portal and a call centre for the management of operations. The water for agricultural and industrial use will be supplied from the treated water at the sewage treatment plant in Muttathara. The registration process of tankers in ongoing, with more than 100 already signed up.

The Corporation will launch three more vehicles for septage collection. The Mayor said that the septage collection has garnered the Corporation an amount of ₹1.72 crore since the launching of registration for septage-collecting tanker lorries in April last. The number of complaints of septage disposal in public places and water bodies had also decreased since then.

A new system is also being launched for the collection of chicken waste from stalls. The system will be streamlined using the Green Trivandrum mobile application and portal. The collection vehicles will be equipped with GPS systems. The collected chicken waste will be transported to rendering units. Mr. Sreekumar said the dumping of chicken waste in public places was still rampant as several private parties were involved in illegal collection of such waste.

The registration for the ‘Subhojanam’ licence for those working in restaurants and other eateries will begin on February 1. Licences will be issued after health check-up and basic training. Those who are currently working in the sector should register within one month.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/many-offers-for-100-day-plan/article30647615.ece
438,2020/01/25,Spanish league | Valencia beats Barcelona,"Valencia striker Maxi Gomez scored once and helped produce an own goal by Jordi Alba to beat Barcelona 2-0 in the Spanish league on Saturday.

The loss was the first for Barcelona in three matches under coach Quique Setişn, who was hired to replace Ernesto Valverde last week.

Barcelona’s first loss in 10 rounds means it can lose the league lead if Real Madrid takes a point at Valladolid on Sunday. Barcelona leads Madrid on goal difference.

Valencia went ahead through an own goal by Alba in the 48th minute when Gomez’s volley that was going wide deflected off the Barcelona left back and went into the net.

Gomez put the result beyond doubt in the 77th, making up for his missed penalty attempt in the first half.

Eintracht Frankfurt defeated Bundesliga leader Leipzig 2-0 to throw the title race wide open on Saturday.

Frankfurt defender Almamy Toure scored a brilliant goal just after the break and Filip Kostic sealed the win in injury time to deal Leipzig its first defeat since a 2-1 loss at home to Freiburg in October.

Borussia Monchengladbach cut the gap at the top to two points with a 3-1 win at home over Mainz, thanks largely to goals in each half from French striker Alassane Plea.

Borussia Dortmund is just four points off the top after its 5-1 win over Cologne on Friday with teen sensation Erling Braut Haaland scoring twice more after coming off the bench.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic set up Ante Rebic to score the only goal as AC Milan beat Brescia 1-0 to claim a third consecutive Serie A win for the first time this season.

Ibrahimovic missed a chance in front of goal before the break but provided the cross after 71 minutes that allowed substitute Rebic to finish off his third goal in two games.

Milan has taken 10 points in four games since Ibrhimovic’s return to the club this month.

Europa berths

Stefano Pioli’s side move up to sixth position into the Europa League berths and seven points adrift of the Champions League places.

“It wasn’t a beautiful Milan, but a winner,” said Pioli.

“We can play better, but we had a great attitude, now we know how to suffer. We must continue like this.”

Milan are on a run of four consecutive wins including the Italian Cup, and next plays Torino on Tuesday for a place in the semifinals.

Thumping win

Teenager Erling Braut Haaland scored twice more off the bench as Borussia Dortmund moved up to third in the Bundesliga with a 5-1 thumping of Cologne.

Having claimed a hat-trick as a replacement on his Dortmund debut last Saturday to inspire a 5-3 win away at Augsburg, Haaland, 19, again showed clinical finishing.

“For Erling, it’s simply wonderful — five goals, two games, there are worse starts,” said Dortmund captain Marco Reus.

“Especially here at home — that’s why we signed him.

Good step forward

“That was a good step forward from us — also from me personally,” added Reus who was criticised for missing clear chances against Augsburg.

With his team 3-1 up, Haaland came on for his first home appearance with an hour gone and 11 minutes later was on the scoresheet, slamming home the rebound of a saved Julian Brandt shot.

He then showed his speed to beat Cologne goalkeeper Timo Horn, tucking the ball into an empty net on 87 minutes.

The results: Serie A: SPAL 1 (Petagna 23-pen) lost to Bologna 3 (Vicari 24-og, Barrow 59, Poli 63).

La Liga: Valencia 2 (Alba 48-og, Gomez 77) bt Barcelona 0.

439,2020/01/25,ISL | FC Goa beats Kerala Blasters in five-goal thriller,"Moroccan forward Hugo Boumous inspired FC Goa to a thrilling 3-2 win over Kerala Blasters FC in an action-packed Indian Super League match here on Saturday.

First-half goals from Boumous (26th) and Jackichand Singh (45th) saw FC Goa take a 2-0 lead only for Raphael Messi Bouli (53rd) and Bartholomew Ogbeche (69th) to peg them back.

But Boumous managed to grab a winner seven minutes from time to hand Sergio Lobera’s team all three points.

The victory saw FC Goa go two points clear at the top of the table while Kerala remain eighth, with its chances of reaching the play-offs taking a huge beating.

Enterprise

Kerala showed a lot of enterprise in the early exchanges and showed confidence on the ball. However, FC Goa did not take that long to hit its stride with Boumous and Ferran Corominas forcing errors from the Kerala defence.

Kerala continued to threaten from the wide areas, with Bartholomew Ogbeche glancing wide Mohammed Rakip’s dangerous cross from the right-wing in the 19th minute.

A few minutes later, Ogbeche had to be alert inside his own box to pull off a goal-line clearance from Mourtada Fall’s header from a corner.

But in the 26th minute, FC Goa did have its lead. Kerala defence allowed Mandar Rao Dessai to run on to Brandon Fernandes’ ball over the top down the left-wing. The full-back squared the ball for Boumous to tap in at the far post.

Kerala tried to respond to the setback through their wide men but failed to really trouble the defence of the Goan side.

A few minutes before half-time, Goa doubled its lead. Corominas got on to a loose ball on the edge of the box on the right. He whipped a low cross into the box which was deflected into the far corner by the outstretched boot of Jackichand Singh.

Renewed vigour

Kerala started the second-half with renewed vigour and pulled a goal back within eight minutes of the restart. Seityasen Singh whipped a ball into Ogbeche on the edge of the box who sent Messi Bouli clear on goal with a deft touch and the Cameroonian finished with aplomb to give the visitors a lifeline.

With confidence surging through its veins, Kerala continued to fashion chances and put FC Goa under pressure. Messi almost equalised after being sent through on goal again while Jackichand wasted a chance at the other end for FC Goa.

Kerala was finally rewarded in the 69th minute when Ogbeche was left unmarked during a corner. Cidoncha’s delivery was headed in at the far post by the Nigerian to pull Kerala level.

Kerala continued to be on the ascendancy as it sought a winner but it was FC Goa which managed to find one in the 83rd minute. Ahmed Jahouh picked out Boumous inside the box with a lovely chipped ball and the Moroccan’s volley was enough to beat TP Rehenesh in the Kerala goal and spark joyous scenes at the stadium.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/faxyp5/article30654205.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26ISL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/isl-fc-goa-beats-kerala-blasters-in-five-goal-thriller/article30654206.ece
440,2020/01/25,I-league | East Bengal stumps Chennai City,"Spaniards Marcos Jimenez Espada scored in the 68th minute and Jaime Santos converted a penalty nine minutes later to seal a 2-0 win for East Bengal over defending champion Chennai City FC in their I-League clash at the Nehru Stadium here on Saturday.

It was the red and gold army that took early control of the game. It marched forward and threatened to bulldoze the otherwise strong Chennai City backline, manned by its ever-reliable captain Roberto Eslava.

The Chennai men looked a bit confused with those speedy runs by the Kolkata side. In the 15th minute, one such fast-paced move earned the visiting side a penalty.

The host tried hard to stop an East Bengal move only to find the ball strike the hand of its defender and the referee was quick to show to the spot.

It broke the hearts of the Chennai fans but not Nauzet Santana, the Chennai City custodian. Santos, who took the shot, hammered it hard but Santana dived full length to his right to effect a smart save. And the crowd roared in delight and the Chennai City men heaved a huge sigh of relief.

Jan Muzangu, the 19-year-old loanee from FC Basel, made his debut for the home side in a bid to boost the front-line but he could not do much.

Japanese forward Katsumi Yusa did pull out a few tricks from his bag and, so did Adolfo Miranda, better known as Fito, but failed to create telling contributions. In the end, it was East Bengal which went home happy with a well-deserved win after having suffered three defeats in a row.

The result: Chennai City FC 0 lost to East Bengal 2 (Marcos Eusebio 68, Jamie Santos 77-pen).",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/5q8zci/article30653722.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26CFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/east-bengal-stumps-chennai-city/article30653669.ece

446,2020/01/25,ECI imposes 48-hour campaigning ban on Kapil Mishra,"The Election Commission on Saturday imposed a 48-hour-long ban on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Model Town candidate Kapil Mishra restricting him from campaigning for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections over his recent controversial tweets in relation to the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh.

The ban order, approved by the Chief Election Commissioner and two fellow Election Commissioners, came into force from 5 p.m. on Saturday, according to EC officials. The order referred to Mr. Mishra’s tweets of January 22 and 23 and comes a day after the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) of Delhi wrote to the police asking it to register a criminal case against the suspended Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator.

“Delhi mein chote chote Pakistan bane (A number of mini Pakistans have been created in Delhi)”, “Shaheen Bagh mein Pakistan ki entry”, “India Vs Pakistan February 8 Delhi” and a tweet in which he had alleged, in Hindi, that just like the AAP and Congress had created “mini Pakistans” in Shaheen Bagh “India would stand up” to teach them a lesson on February 8, the day that the city goes to the polls were among the tweets referred to in the EC's order.

While Twitter had taken down one of his controversial tweets on Friday following the directions of the EC, an FIR was lodged against him under section 125 of the Representation of the People Act dealing with creating enmity among classes. The order said the poll panel was not satisfied with Mishra’s reply to the show cause notice issued to him.

“Now, therefore, the Commission hereby condemns the statements made by Sh. Kapil Mishra through the aforesaid tweets on 22 and 23 January 2020. The Commission, under Article 324 of the Constitution of India...bars Sh. Kapil Mishra from holding any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, road shows and interviews, public utterances in media...in connection with ongoing general election...for a period of 48 hours...” the order read.

Mr. Mishra, on his part, took to Twitter to react to the development stating, “Keep quiet. Quiet when you see buses burning, quiet when you see the police being assaulted, quiet when you hear slogans of ‘Azadi’. Quiet when you see politicians licking the heels of the Tukde Tukde gang because of vote bank politics. They will stand with Shaheen Bagh but you must remain quiet. Quiet when you see the occupation of streets.

448,2020/01/25,FIR filed against against BJP’s Kapil Mishra over tweets,"An FIR was filed against BJP’s candidate from Model Town, Kapil Mishra, over certain tweets found in violation of the Representation of the People Act, a spokesperson from the CEO office said.

While the official also claimed that the offending posts had been deleted by Twitter upon the request of the CEO Ranbir Singh, the tweets were still up late on Friday evening

CEO Ranbir Singh said. DCP (North West) Vijayanta Arya confirmed that a complaint has been received and that an FIR would soon be filed.

The returning officer for Model Town had on Thursday sent a show-cause notice to Mr. Mishra, asking for a reply over certain tweets comparing the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections to a fight between India and Pakistan and describing Shaheen Bagh, the site of an ongoing agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, as a “mini Pakistan”.

The notice highlighted provisions of the model code of conduct which state that candidates should not engage in any activity that may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or tension between different communities, as well as relevant provisions of the RPA. It said his tweet was a violation of these provisions and was punishable under the law and asked him to furnish a reply by Friday afternoon.

‘Seditious’ slogans

In a four-page reply, Mr. Mishra defended his tweets arguing that protests at Shaheen Bagh had witnessed “antisocial” elements raising “seditious” slogans “intended to disturb communal harmony”.He also argued that the statements should not be considered election-related, attacked Aam Aadmi Party leader Manish Sisodia for “stoking the fire” by stating that he stood with the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, and made other arguments condemning the use of “azadi” sloganeering. Additionally, he claimed that his comments had been taken out of context and misrepresented. “My statement must be seen in the context of Pakistan’s attempt at sending their proxies to take undue advantage of a prevailing law and order situation in Delhi,” he wrote.

The show-cause notice stated that failing to provide a satisfactory reply, further action would be taken against him. CEO Ranbir Singh also said that the matter was escalated to the Election Commission of India, which wrote to the social media website asking it to take down the offending tweets termed as “appealing to communal feelings”. As of Friday evening though, the offending tweets had not been taken down.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/s5brqa/article30647718.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE25-P1KAPILMISHRA,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/fir-filed-against-against-bjps-kapil-mishra-over-tweets/article30647719.ece

451,2020/01/25,Book review of Modiplomacy: Through a Shakespearean Prism by T.P. Sreenivasan,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarkable activism in external affairs has provided endless opportunities to critics and advocates to evaluate it. He barely completed his first year in office when the first books on his foreign policy began to appear. But T.P. Sreenivasan wisely waited for the end of Modi’s first five-year term before producing Modiplomacy: Through a Shakespearean Prism. A definitive take on the subject is not due yet, as Modi is likely to be in office for many more years. It is worth recalling that even over five decades after Jawaharlal Nehru’s departure, his foreign policy triggers passionate debate.

A veteran diplomat, prolific writer and public speaker, Sreenivasan packages his analysis within the framework of a Shakespearean play — one with five acts that opens with an exposition, moves to complications, then to the climax, before presenting the reversals which pave the way for the denouement. Even readers without a specialised knowledge of Shakespearean drama will find the story fascinating. The author notes, “Narendra Modi is nothing if not theatrical.”

Five acts

The first act opens with Modi’s grand swearing-in as PM in 2014. All leaders of South Asia and a few more attended it — a historic first. From then onwards, followed “a period of visibility, speech-making, vision-building, daydreaming, sloganeering, fashion-setting, innovating, positioning and promising change.” Among his many visits abroad — a “virtual odyssey across continents” — the visit to China (May 2015) was significant, a finale to the first year. Modi took with him “not only Nehru’s dream of Asian solidarity, but also Patel’s scepticism of China.” As attempts to build ties afresh with China and the neighbours ran into difficulty, Modi focused on strengthening cooperation with the U.S., first through Obama’s visit (January 2015) and then his own (September 2015). The second act clarified the contours of “Modiplomacy” and its “transactions approach.” Another outreach towards Pakistan was attempted via the meeting with Nawaz Sharif at Ufa (July 2015), but the India-Pakistan dialogue failed to take off. And, turmoil in relations with Nepal came to surface.

The third act was marked by noticeable progress in India-U.S. relations, as Modi spoke of “a new symphony in play.” Modi’s next visit to the U.S. (June 2016) helped advance his priorities — development, security, neighbourhood and diaspora. Yet, hurdles remained, the greatest being New Delhi’s “wariness” over U.S. support to Pakistan and American “concerns” over close India-Russia relations. The fourth act was mostly about coping with “the Trump Effect.” The author rightly judges that Modi did better than most other leaders in connecting with President Trump. However, India’s growing proximity with Washington cast a shadow on relations with Russia and complicated ties with China.

Disappointment with Trump led Modi to re-adjust India’s equations with China and Russia through informal summits with their leaders. Relations with Pakistan were marked by a continuous slide, with the terrorist attack in Pulwama and India’s robust air attack on Balakot. The events in the last act made Modi “strong domestically as well as internationally”, concludes the author.

‘Streak of overconfidence’

Sreenivasan defines Shakespearean heroes as full of many great qualities but also with a few tragic flaws that caused their undoing. It was jealousy for Othello, ambition for Macbeth, vanity for King Lear and indecision for Hamlet. In Modi’s case, the “streak of overconfidence” and “illusions of grandeur” are the tragic flaws.

Sreenivasan’s assessment of Modi’s foreign policy record is generally positive. The author, however, believes that India should not have abandoned its leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement.

Though the author frankly concedes that Modiplomacy is “an impressionistic narrative of current history”, not a research work, it may be of considerable interest to students of international affairs. A timeline of major developments covered and a list of select readings would have been welcome additions.

452,2020/01/25,"Book review of Fire and Fury: Transforming India’s Strategic Identity by Anil Kakodkar, Suresh Gangotra","Nuclear energy, as a source of power, has remained elusive. Generations of scientists and administrators have looked upon it as a clean source. Unfortunately, proliferation of nuclear weapons and global rivalry to acquire them as strategic deterrents led to concerted attempts by major powers, especially the U.S., to contain them through unequal arrangements like the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Horrors of ‘dual use’ continued to haunt. As Anil Kakodkar, former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, reveals in an anecdote, it was not possible to get even steel tubes made by Indian companies with U.S. collaboration!

After the peaceful nuclear explosion (PNE) of 1974, India became an outcast and could not get nuclear technology or components and was driven to rely solely on indigenous sources. It could not get uranium to run ongoing plants and companies in the U.S. and Canada reneged on contractual obligations. These thwarted efforts to develop nuclear energy even for peaceful use.

The Department of Atomic Energy (AEC) and its agencies spared no efforts to promote self-reliance and indigenisation. Kakodkar recalls how he was able to conceptualise, design and fabricate nuclear power projects at various locations in the country. When he joined the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in 1964 he felt that he had ‘found his true calling.’ He says atomic energy ‘transformed’ his life. Indeed, this is not an exaggeration if one studies the contribution made by him in AEC projects, especially in designing and fabricating the equipment required for the PNE and later for Pokhran-II in 1998. He records with meticulous care innumerable interactions between various scientists, engineers, etc. It is rare to find this atmosphere in other organisations. This was in great part due to Kakodkar’s style of functioning. In one of the last chapters, his wife Suyasha describes his “qualities of being self-reliant, modest, determined, dedicated, objective and scientific.” Incidentally, his wife did not know that he was the man behind the PNE until the news broke. She writes without regrets how leaves usually lapsed.

U.S. machinations

Kakodkar felt that after Pokhran, India had become a strategic power. A large part of the book is devoted to negotiations with the U.S. on the civil nuclear deal. It offers valuable information on the nature and intensity of negotiations and the issues which came up. It was evident that the Bush administration had changed its geopolitical strategy which could involve India into U.S. efforts to contain China, break the NPT and seek India’s support on Iran sanctions. There was also the objective of creating a market for U.S. exports of nuclear machinery. India, on its part, was keen to get rid of sanctions to be able to acquire equipment and technology. Kakodkar says his sole aim was to retain strategic autonomy. At one meeting, Kakodkar felt he was on one side, and other senior members were against him; it was only after Dr. Manmohan Singh agreed with him that the final agreement was signed. He narrates this episode without bitterness.

This book is essential reading for those who wish to understand the development of nuclear power and negotiations on the signing of the nuclear deal with the U.S.

453,2020/01/25,Book review: The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative by Shashi Tharoor and Samir Saran,"Most, if not all, geopolitical analysis today looks at three separate factors for the world’s problems: the rise of China, the retrenchment of the Western world order led by the United States, and the growing power of populism and strongmen (and women) leaders. Right at the beginning of their book, The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative, Shashi Tharoor and Samir Saran make it clear that they will discuss all three.

Their prologue of events lists U.S. President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from the Climate Change agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership; China’s Belt and Road Initiative; the election across Europe of far-right Euro-sceptics and the vote for Brexit as the context for their discussions. It is these events, and the trends they portend, that make the basis for the New World Disorder that India must respond and shape a counter to, according to the authors.

UN’s iniquities

As a former United Nations official for decades, who once even ran the election to lead the organisation, Tharoor, a Member of Parliament, is best placed to discuss the iniquities of the UN system and why it has led to this disorder, while Saran, a scholar on climate change, global governance and digital technology, who heads India’s best-known think-tank and organises the government’s flagship conference Raisina Dialogue each year, is extremely qualified to speak about India’s claims and aspirations to contribute to the next version of the “New World Order” when it is formed out of the crucible of the present disorder.

The book includes thoughtful reflections, well ordered into chapters on sparring over energy and other resources that drove conflict in the past, the fight for the environment and the debate over sustainable development and cyberwars of the future.

Two of the best chapters deal with what a “New World Order” would constitute, and how India must take leadership in it.

While the book looks at hard-nosed realities, and finds the world failing on challenges of equality, global warming, terrorism, communal and ethnic tensions etc., the authors can be faulted for being over-idealistic about India’s capacity to stand tall above them.

“India may well be the only country with the credentials and capability to script an equitable ethic for a new international order,” write Tharoor and Saran, which may seem a stretch given its present situation, rising populism and protectionism, a right-wing government itself accused of authoritarianism, and the threat of religious majoritarianism.

The authors hope that India as a “relatively wealthy, democratic, multicultural state with an instinct that privileges multilateralism and rules-based order” is welcome in the New World Order.

‘Rights of Man’

The New World Order that Tharoor and Saran refer to has had many avatars and meanings. In 1835, poet Alfred Lord Tennyson spoke about building “the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world” in his famous poem ‘Locksley Hall’.

The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative; Shashi Tharoor & Samir Saran; Aleph; ₹799.

More than a century later, U.S. President Harry Truman carried the poem in his wallet as he began deliberations on the UN charter, calling it his inspiration. H.G. Wells, in his 1940 book The New World Order, spoke of a global idea to reconstruct human society through a common belief in the “Rights of Man”.

At various points in the 20th century, many right-wing thinkers claimed the “New World Order” (NWO) was in fact a Communist conspiracy of a secretive group of elites, aimed at the overthrow of governments around the world in order to form an “authoritarian world government” in their place. While that may be extreme, it is impossible to deny that those desirous of a peaceful and stable world order are most often the status-quoists, who have the most to lose from any churning in it.

Falling apart

Peace and democracy, then, should hardly have been the preserve of colonial powers, who subjugated much of Asia, Africa and South America, or interventionist powers, who selectively demolished authoritarian republics but spared brutal monarchies, while maintaining a heavily racist society at home, or of single-party communist dictatorships that deprived ordinary citizens of rights, property, and even the agency over how many children they could have. And yet, the old world order, as the last century ended was very much ruled by a UN Security Council controlled by such powers.

It is to highlight just this that Tharoor and Saran begin their book with words from W.B. Yeats’ 1919 poem ‘The Second Coming’: Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;… Surely some revelation is at hand/Surely the Second Coming is at hand... A remarkable reminder that the more things change, the more they stay the same.

454,2020/01/25,"Love, sex and dhokha: Review of Shuma Raha’s ‘The Swap’","Soon to be a major web series,’ announces the blurb on the cover of Shuma Raha’s The Swap. A couple of chapters into the story, which is about two couples whose lives get remarkably intertwined, the reader realises that the book would translate very well onto celluloid indeed, offering as it does an intimate look at the sordid comings and goings of the glitterati, some purely wannabe, of Delhi.

The book actually paints a grimy picture. Delhi is, quite literally, a hot mess. Our protagonist, Priya, and her husband, Akash, are bored in their marriage and are waiting for something, anything, to spark passion again. Enter a rich socialite couple who invite a surprisingly large number of their friends to a spouse-swapping party, and the sexual games begin.

Sex parties, adultery, emotional affairs, revenge; all in all, there’s a lot of drama in the book, some of it uncomfortably realistic in its examination of marriage and sex in and out of marriage. What happens when you find your marriage has fallen into a rut? Does true love have to be everlasting to be truly true? What does it take to call it quits? What do you do once you are finished at a sex party but your husband isn’t? These are some of the pertinent points journalist Raha addresses, via a strong voice that effectively leaps out from the page and grabs your attention. Also, thanks be, the sex scenes are handled in a most matter-of-fact manner.

The strong thread of cynicism, though, can get a bit wearisome after a point. Priya is a difficult person to like, judgemental and bitchy, as are Akash and their friends, Dileep and Anuradha, with whom they have affairs. Other characters fit a tad too neatly into types, like the friend who feels strongly about women’s rights, the Bengali boss at the newspaper office, the moustache-twirling villain-of-sorts.

And yes, there is a subliminal message couched in a question: is sexual game-playing likely to mess people up? Well, could it be otherwise? Then again, a considerable number of urban Indians in our metros now seem to be stepping out of their fantasy into this chosen reality. Or so the Internet tells me.

The writer is a manuscript editor and novelist based in Bengaluru.

455,2020/01/25,"Old city, lingering flames: Review of Jane Borges’ ‘Bombay Balchão’","They forgot that they were characters in a novel, not a short story. In this novel, every chapter was connected to the others. And retribution was not too far away.”

One could argue about the fairness of the retribution Borges extracts from her well-crafted characters over 70-odd years, from the 1940s to 2015. One could well read each chapter as a short story that attains closure on a singular narrative thread, leaving one amused, sad, or just plain wistful. But one would be mistaken.

There is no clear beginning, nor a distinct linear end, but once Father Augustine Fernandez “catches fire” at a momentous Christmas Eve mass in a quintessential Bombay Christian neighbourhood’s local chapel, Borges has you reeled in, hook, line and sinker. And the web she weaves stretches wider than the confines of a chapter or even the realm of this book.

As the priest rushes out of the chapel to douse the fire, the clouds burst into an unlikely spell of December rain — a ‘Christmas miracle’ that enthrals the community. The priest doesn’t see it that way, but plays along... his secret eventually known only to Michael Coutinho, who comes closest to what you may call a protagonist. That 1945 night in the small community chapel, sparks also fly between adolescent Michael and his first love Tracey D’Lima, re-united briefly amidst the frenzy over the priest’s flaming liturgical vestment.

On Valentine’s Day, three decades later, the priest returns to preside over a twisted turn of events, including an unanticipated funeral. Love lingers throughout, sometimes stillborn; lost, found; found only to be lost; but mostly just meandering along, as it usually does. Above the gripping plot lines, this maiden fiction effort is really about the charms of an old city with a rich past, lost to today’s nuclear, concrete Mumbai.

Balchão is known as a fiery, almost picklish delicacy from Goa. With its endearing well-researched garnishes — be it the typing courses at Davar’s College, the logistics of hooch supplies during Prohibition, the hierarchies within the city’s Roman Catholic community, or a photo studio that Subhash Chandra Bose visited — this improvised prawn version of Bombay Balchão leaves you yearning for more.

456,2020/01/25,Notes from a bad year: Review of Meena Kandasamy’s ‘Exquisite Cadavers’,"An invention by the French surrealists, exquisite cadavers refers to a game in which words are assembled into a piece of writing by each player in turn. Playing on this technique in her new novel, Exquisite Cadavers, Meena Kandasamy gives importance to both the story and her process.

This may be a slim book, but she manages to pack in two powerful stories. This is as much a book about the personal as it is about the political; about Britain and Tunisia as it is about India; and about Maya and Karim as it is about Kandasamy.

Far removed

Exquisite Cadavers is a brave experiment. Every page is divided into columns. One contains the story of an interracial and intercultural young couple, Maya and Karim, who are British and Tunisian, journalist and filmmaker, in love and forever quarrelling. The second, in smaller font, contains Kandasamy’s own notes, the raw material she dips into to create characters and shape their anxieties and world views.

Kandasamy provides no guidance on how to navigate the book. You can read an entire chapter and then the marginalia or both simultaneously or, as I did, the whole story at one go and then her notes.

The book is a reaction to the response to her previous novel, When I Hit You. Annoyed at being bracketed, at reviewers calling that book a memoir though she insists it’s a novel, Kandasamy decides that this time she will “create characters as far removed as possible from my own life”. She writes:

“The reception enforced my perception that, to a Western audience, writers like me are interesting because

-we are from a place where horri

ble things happen, or,

-horrible things have happened to

us, or,

-a combination of the above.

No one discusses process with us.

No one treats us as writers,

only as diarists who survived.”

About others

And so Kandasamy is determined that Exquisite Cadavers will be a story about others, and she will discuss her process with us. Initially distracting and at places self-involved, the marginalia slowly grew on me. But the question on reading both the columns is: how successful is Kandasamy in keeping Maya and Karim’s story detached from her own? Where do their lives, worries and anger end and hers begin?

Kandasamy situates the couple first in their home in London, a closed space and therefore a breeding ground for arguments. This allows her to dissect their personalities and reveal their faults. Maya and Karim are equally watchful of each other. They share a passion for films. Karim feels “he learns more about his wife from watching her watch a screen than from any joint therapy session or remedial holiday”. In the notes, Kandasamy writes about her old marriage when she observed, in fear, her violent husband watch the same three films over and over again. She also read the films to read him.

Fact and fiction

Karim, like Kandasamy, also carries the burden of expectations of a Western audience. Kandasamy makes Maya “relatable to the British readers” by stealing a “little of every Englishwoman” she sees. Karim realises as a student pursuing a course in film studies that “an immigrant can be sad, hopeless, embittered, lost or angry — never articulate”. All his suggestions on making films on extremism are shot down, and the rejections passed off as concern for his well-being. He wants to make films about the Islamic State, but they say “interest in extremism is itself a sign of being attracted to radicalism”. Why can’t he make a film about the hijab, they ask.

The concern for Karim at his workplace takes the shape of curiosity in social gatherings. Maya tackles the loaded statements and the questions about Karim’s family and home. Is he fitting in? Does he have many wives? Does she know what she is doing? Being under the scanner shatters her sense of self; the Islamophobia is so deep-rooted that she finds herself trapped while trying to escape. Slowly, Maya’s concerns become her concerns, says Kandasamy. She makes Maya pregnant, just as she was while writing the book.

Towards the end, when Karim suddenly takes off to Tunisia leaving Maya to make a difficult choice, Kandasamy’s own notes on her life and family and the horrors playing out in India disappear. Fact and fiction seep into each other. Maya tells Karim about filmmaking: “You don’t have to play to the stereotype. They want you to interrogate your identity, use that as a weapon to interrogate them... Dress it up in the cloak of high art.” Kandasamy does just that.

Filled with insight, wry humour and uncomfortable observations, Kandasamy’s work is a clever little rebuttal. I found the format interesting, but her notes heavy-handed in parts (the chapter titled “A Good Man is Hard to Keep” especially) and veering off in different directions. However, as a novella, Exquisite Cadavers manages to grip as well as rattle.

457,2020/01/25,We don’t have to have a single identity or a single home: M.G. Vassanji,"M.G. Vassanji was born in Kenya and raised in Tanzania — his parents were part of a wave of Indians who immigrated to Africa. Vassanji studied at the University of Nairobi, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania, from where he earned a Ph.D in nuclear physics. He moved to Toronto in 1980 and continues to live there. He has eight novels, two short story collections, memoirs and a biography of Canadian writer Mordecai Richler to his credit.

I met him on a mellow December evening at Delhi’s India International Centre when he was on a book tour for his latest novel, A Delhi Obsession. His graciousness and quiet humour were disarming: unlike the acerbic Naipaul, the literary giant Vassanji is often compared to, Vassanji embraces India and East Africa — his two homelands — wholeheartedly, warts and all. Excerpts from the interview:

Your latest novel, A Delhi Obsession, is a love story weighed down by religion and centuries-old tradition.

Yes. As I mention in the endnote, in India, you cannot just be. You are branded a Hindu, a Muslim... branded communally. The day I landed in Delhi, a friend told me that I could have met a Muslim family who stays nearby if they were in town. Why suggest a meeting with complete strangers? He meant well, but it’s still stereotyping.

In A Delhi Obsession, when the lovers meet, Mohini Singh sees Munir Khan first as a Muslim. She accuses his people of ruling over her people for years.

The Mohini-Munir affair is a moving story with a violent, shocking end.

The violence at play in India right now is shocking. I hear about it on the news all the time. Violence against minorities and women. Horrific incidents of communal violence, sexual assault, rape. “Gang-rape” has become just another compound word that appears in the news. The brutal violence that was unleashed during Partition, the violence writers like Manto wrote about, violence on that scale has returned. I know India is a complex place, but how can this brutality be allowed? I could have ended my novel on a subtle note, let nuances and epiphanies convey the message. But I wanted to say it bluntly. To make a statement about the vehemence and violence of divisive rhetoric.

You published your travel memoir about India, A Place Within, in 2008. What prompted you to return to India to explore it in depth?

I knew nothing about the Indians in Africa (where I was born) when I was young. I come from a people who were not written about. When I went to America as a student, I was totally adrift. I read up on Indian philosophy, took a course in Sanskrit, gained an understanding of bhajans. I read a lot of history. I was looking for answers: how did Asians go to Africa? Where did they come from? What kind of Indian am I? These questions eventually brought me to India. I was received warmly — almost like a prodigal son. My idea of India, which I had gained from watching films (particularly Satyajit Ray’s), listening to Indian classical music, reading Nehru and Gandhi, newspaper and magazine reports, evolved over the course of my visits. When I am in India, I feel like a part of me has come home.

Where is home for you? East Africa, India, Toronto?

Toronto is my practical home. I feel safe there, perfectly comfortable in my skin. Home of my heart is Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, where I grew up. I speak Swahili fluently and visit Tanzania often. I am very attached to the land. My boyhood years were fun despite the hardships. My father passed away when I was four and my mother brought us up. As for India, it is the home of my soul. We don’t have to have a single identity or a single home. It’s a privilege to be able to observe life from different parts of the world.

But I must admit that I feel very envious of people who are rooted in a single place with just one home. Their past is all around them. If you move, your past is gone. Your stories disappear.

Is your writing an attempt to record those stories?

I was trained as a nuclear scientist and at times I despair about the choice I made. Fiction writers don’t have it easy today. Books and literature did play an important part in people’s lives, but readers are getting lazy these days. They’d rather watch Netflix or read a biography of Bill Gates or Michelle Obama. But writing is something you have to do. If you have stories to say that haven’t been told you must keep at it. I’ve had strangers come up to me and say, “Are you the author of The In-Between Life of Vikram Lall? Your novel changed my life... you wrote my story.” That’s gratifying.

Is a new book in the works?

There’s a collection of short stories I’m putting together. I’m working on a novel — the hero is a scientist, a particle physicist. I have a rough draft. It’ll work out. I think it’ll work out...

458,2020/01/25,"Wuhan: coronavirus cases estimated at 4,000","Researchers at the Imperial College London have revised the estimated number of novel coronavirus cases in Wuhan city in China from 1,723 to 4,000. The earlier estimate was made on January 17 and was based on 41 confirmed cases in China as on January 16 and three exported cases – two cases in Thailand and one in Japan. The revised estimate of 4,000 is based on 440 confirmed cases reported from 13 provinces and nine deaths as on January 21, seven exported cases reported from five countries, confirmed human-to-human transmission and confirmed cases in 15 healthcare workers.

Mode of estimation

The estimate has been made by taking into consideration that the Wuhan International Airport has a catchment population of 19 million individuals, a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection, volume of travel from the airport has been 3,301 passengers a day, exit screening that began on January 15 had no impact on exported cases till January 16, and all exported cases are detected at airports outside China.

The researchers note that the estimated cases in Wuhan might be higher than 4,000 if exit screening at Wuhan airport has reduced the number of exported cases and if exported cases are actually more than what has been detected.

“Our estimates of the size of the outbreak in Wuhan have more than doubled since our first report. This is a result of the number of cases detected outside mainland China having increased from 3 to 7,” they write.

They caution that the revised estimate should not be interpreted as implying that the outbreak has doubled during the period January 12-18. Rather, the increase in the number of estimated cases only reflect the delay in confirming and reporting exported cases, the small number of exported cases, and incomplete information about dates of symptom onset. These limitations have led to the inability to truly estimate the epidemic growth, they note.",sci-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/wuhan-coronavirus-cases-estimated-at-4000/article30653318.ece
459,2020/01/25,Coronavirus outbreak revives calls to stop wildlife trade,"The outbreak of a new virus linked to a wildlife market in central China is prompting renewed calls for enforcement of laws against the trade in and consumption of exotic species.

It’s also raising questions about how it could happen again after the lessons learnt from the 2002-03 outbreak of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which was traced to consumption of wild animals in the southern city of Guangzhou.

In response to the crisis that has been centered in the big industrial city of Wuhan, China’s Agriculture Ministry issued an order earlier this week ordering tightened controls on trade in wildlife.

The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, meanwhile, appealed for an end to wildlife markets everywhere, not just in China.

Zoonotic diseases, or those contracted by humans that originated in other species, account for a large share of human infectious illnesses. Not all of them come from wildlife trade — rabies is endemic across many species and one of the biggest causes of death in the developing world. But mixing species of wild animals increases the risk of diseases mutating and growing more virulent as they spread in unregulated markets, experts say.

The emergence of such diseases is a “numbers game”, said Christian Walzer, executive director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s health program.

“If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal,” he said.

The order issued by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, dated January 21, banned all shipments of wild animals out of Wuhan. It also called for stepped up inspections and raising public awareness about the risks of eating them.

Researchers have not yet announced a definitive source for this latest outbreak, which like many other viruses can infect multiple species.

One of the first measures taken by Wuhan authorities was to close down the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where 41 of the first cases originated.

“That’s the big black box right now,” said Jon Epstein, an epidemiologist with the Ecohealth Alliance.

Bats are known to harbor coronaviruses, but scientists have yet to fully understand the new virus and how it leapt from animals to people.

Epstein said researchers suspect but haven’t proven that the Wuhan virus came from bats. Before it infected humans, it likely first jumped to an as yet unidentified mammal.

“There’s no plausible evidence to support snakes being involved with this virus,” Epstein said, referring to recent media speculation criticized by a recent article in Nature. Researchers don’t know which species exactly were sold in the Wuhan market, but Epstein said mammals commonly found in such markets — such as ferret badgers, raccoon dogs or civets — might be involved in the transmission of the new virus to people.

The crackdown on wildlife trafficking and sales persisted only about six months after the SARS outbreak faded in mid-2003, Walzer said.

“The solution is simple,” he said. “In the sense that we know where the problem is.”",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/w6b4ga/article30651096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTH-VIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/coronavirus-outbreak-revives-calls-to-stop-wildlife-trade/article30651097.ece
460,2020/01/25,"France confirms 2 cases of virus from China, first in Europe","France on Friday announced two confirmed cases of the deadly new virus from China, the first reported in Europe, the country’s Health Minister Agnes Buzyn said.

More cases are expected, Ms. Buzyn said.

""We see how difficult it is in today’s world to close the frontiers. In reality, it’s not possible,” she said.

""We have two cases,” she added. “We will probably have other cases.”

Ms. Buzyn said speed in diagnosing new cases will be essential in slowing the spread of the virus. She said she believes that one reason why France is the first European country to have confirmed cases is that it has developed a test allowing medics to rapidly diagnose the sickened.

""You have to treat an epidemic as you would a fire, that’s to say find the source very quickly,” she said.

One of people sickened, a 48-year-old man, passed through Wuhan, the epicenter in China for the virus, before traveling to France on Wednesday, the minister said. That person is hospitalized in Bordeaux.

The other person is hospitalized in a large city hospital in Paris. The minister said that person also traveled to China but that she had little other information about the case. It was confirmed shortly before she spoke at a news conference.

The Bordeaux patient was in contact with about 10 people before he was taken into care, the minister said. French authorities are seeking to contact them.

The minister urged people who suspect they’ve sickened to call emergency services and to stay at home to avoid spreading the virus. She said those who came into contact with the Bordeaux patient would be told likewise.

The number of confirmed cases around the world has climbed sharply to more than 850, the bulk of them in China. There have been at least 25 deaths, all of them in China.

The vast majority of cases have been in and around Wuhan or involved people who visited the city or had personal connections to those infected.

Fewer than two dozen cases in all have been confirmed outside mainland China, in Hong Kong, Macao, the U.S., South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam.

The U.S. reported its second case, involving a Chicago woman in her 60s who was hospitalized after returning from China.

461,2020/01/25,Women’s hockey | Indian women thrash New Zealand,"Skipper Rani Rampal struck twice as the Indian women’s hockey team started its first tour of the Olympic year with a confident 4-0 victory over New Zealand Development squad here on Saturday.

Besides Rani’s double, Sharmila and Namita Toppo also sounded the board, while the hosts drew a blank.

India played with an intent to win after arriving here on Thursday for the tour where they will play the hosts in four matches and Great Britain in one match.

The visitors took the first half to shake off the starting blues with Rani fetching the opening goal in the third quarter.

India continued to build on their 1-0 lead by creating back-to-back PCs in the following minutes but could not convert.

Youngster Sharmila then doubled the lead in the third quarter and Rani stretched it to 3-0 when she scored her second goal of the match in the fourth quarter.

Namita Toppo then earned India’s fourth goal.

“In the beginning we struggled a bit with the jet lag but after that we played a very controlled game and created a lot of opportunities,” said Chief coach Sjoerd Marijne after the match.

“The last two quarters New Zealand created a lot of pressure and they pressed hard but we continued to remain positive with our attack.”

Marijne said he will try out a few things during the tour, including changing the players in the squad.

“Today we played with 16 players just like the Olympic Games and every match we will change the players. Whether they make the squad depends on these matches and how they cope under pressure,” said the Dutchman.

“We tried a few new things in the match today but we still need improvement and that’s why we are here, to improve our game in every match.”",hockey,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/hockey/womens-hockey-indian-women-thrash-new-zealand/article30654033.ece
462,2020/01/25,"Nilgiris: high pesticide levels in potato, carrot","A study of fruits and vegetables grown in the Nilgiris has found that some of the produce might be harbouring high levels of pesticide, beyond what is considered advisable. This was mainly true of potato and carrot. The study was published in the journal Food Chemistry.

While the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) prescribes a maximum residual level (MRL) for some of the organophosphate pesticides used, it does not prescribe it for some other pesticides used in the cultivation of fruit and vegetables. Hence, the team of researchers took the maximum residual levels from European standards.

Sensitive method

Using liquid chromatography in tandem with mass spectrometry, the team developed a sensitive method to estimate the levels of organophosphates in the fruits and vegetables. “Our detection method has a limit that ranges from 0.1 microgram per kilogram to 1 microgram per kilogram. It has a higher sensitivity than methods used earlier,” says S. N. Meyyanathan from Department of Pharmaceutical Analysis, JSS College of Pharmacy, JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research, Udhagamandalam who led the study.

It is known that organophosphate pesticides such as acephate, malathion, profenofos, chlorpyrifos and quinalphos are used in the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. The study measured the levels of these pesticides in 659 samples of fresh fruit and vegetables collected during the agricultural season of 2018-2019. Samples of 18 varieties of fruit and vegetable were collected from four cities of the Nilgiris – Ooty, Gudalur, Kothagiri and Coonoor. Of these, the researchers did not detect pesticides in approximately 57% of the samples. Close to 34% had pesticides used below the MRLs and the remainder — about 8% — showed usage of pesticides above the MRLs.

Potato and carrot

Of the 659 randomly picked fruit and vegetable samples studied, 53 had higher levels of pesticide. These were mainly in strawberry, potato, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, garlic and broccoli. “About 85% of these samples contained chlorpyrifos, which was the most common, followed by quinalphos at 72%, acephate at 56.6%, profenofos at 54% and malathion at 17%,” says S.T. Narenderan who is a PhD student in JSS Academy of Higher Education and Research and the first author of the paper. Among the varieties of vegetables and fruits studied, potato and carrot had the highest usage of these pesticides. “It is essential to control and reduce the level of pesticide. Residual monitoring in fruits and vegetables is important to ensure minimal pesticide residue level to safeguard consumer health,” says Narenderan.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/8hpkvy/article30653158.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-SCINARENDERANjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nilgiris-high-pesticide-levels-in-potato-carrot/article30653159.ece
463,2020/01/25,A safer alternative to treat aggressive prostate cancer found,"A study shows why drugs used for treating prostate cancer which mainly functions by blocking the activity of androgen receptor signalling or stopping the production of androgen or testosterone is actually counterproductive in the long term. While both methods initially produce encouraging results, the cancer very often returns in a more aggressive form, and becomes resistant to these drugs. With cancer no longer responding to these drugs, it grows unchecked and ultimately causes death.

For the first time, the study sheds light into why the FDA-approved drugs against androgen signalling to treat prostate cancer can backfire after initial success.

Mechanism of return

The study was done by a multi-institutional team led by Bushra Ateeq from the Department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur. The team has also found a mechanism by which the cancer growth at aggressive stage can be safely reduced. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.

Several studies have already shown how stopping the production of androgen or androgen signalling through ‘androgen deprivation therapy’ at some point unintentionally helps the prostate cancer cells to become resistant towards this therapy and progress further to lethal forms. Now, Prof. Ateeq’s team has found the mechanism.

Using mice implanted with prostate cancer tumours, the team found how administering anti-androgen drugs (enzalutamide and apalutamide) results in increase in the expression of a particular gene (SPINK1) which is generally associated with the aggressive type of prostate cancer present in 10-25% of the patients.

“When androgen signalling was inhibited using anti-androgen drugs, an increase in the levels of SPINK1 protein was recorded, which makes the cancer cells more aggressive. The tumours isolated from the mice treated with these drugs exhibit elevated levels of the protein as well as markers for neuroendocrine prostate cancer, which triggers change in cellular plasticity,” says Prof. Ateeq.

Role of SPINK1 protein

“In another set of experiment, we implanted mice with prostate cancer cells with basal levels of SPINK1 protein and we found manifold increase in the protein levels when we administered anti-androgen drugs,” she says. There was also an increase in the levels of neuroendocrine markers which are only found in most aggressive form of prostate cancer. These results reflect a catastrophic situation similar to prostate cancer patients undergoing anti-androgen therapy. Neuroendocrine prostate cancer is an aggressive subtype of prostate cancer which may arise de novo or as a mechanism of resistance due to anti-androgen therapy.

“Our findings emphasise the importance of SPINK1 protein in maintaining neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The results highlight the repercussions of using anti-androgen drugs which are meant to control the prostate cancer but actually aggravate the disease,” says Prof. Ateeq.

Repressor of SPINK1

“Using mouse models, prostate cancer cell lines and patients’ samples we discovered that androgen receptor functions as a repressor of the SPINK1 gene. Using drugs to inhibit the androgen receptor actually results in stopping the repressive activity of the receptor,” says Nishat Manzar from the IIT Kanpur and one of the first authors of the paper. “And this leads to increased level of SPINK1 gene expression.”

“We found the SPINK1 gene is also responsible for maintaining the characteristic features of neuroendocrine prostate cancer. The tumour becomes aggressive when the SPINK1 protein level increases while upon inhibiting the protein a decrease in the neuroendocrine markers was observed,” says Prof. Ateeq.

In addition to androgen receptor, the researchers found that REST, which is a cofactor of androgen receptor, too, has repressive action on SPINK1 gene. “Our study is the first to show the role of the androgen receptor and REST in repressing the SPINK1 gene expression. This was not known so far,” says Prof. Ateeq.

The SPINK1 protein level is high when the amount of REST is low in prostate cancer, and also in the case of neuroendocrine prostate cancer. A particular protein (Casein Kinase 1) is responsible for reducing the level of REST. “When we used an already approved drug to inhibit the activity of Casein Kinase 1 protein, the levels of REST increased,” says Manzar.

Clinical trials needed

And when the REST level increases there is a reduction in the SPINK1 protein level accompanied with a reduction in the oncogene properties of prostate cancer cells. Treating prostate cancer cells showing elevated SPINK1 with a drug against Casein Kinase 1 show reduced cancer cell growth as well as aggressiveness.

“We need to conduct clinical trials using Casein Kinase 1 inhibitor to investigate whether it can reverse neuroendocrine prostate cancer and reduce SPINK1 in prostate cancer patients,” Prof. Ateeq says.

“Our study warns about the possible adverse effect of androgen-deprivation therapies, and the benefits must be considered against treatment, before putting the patients on this therapy.”",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/j9cx9b/article30653148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-SCIIITKJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/a-safer-alternative-to-treat-aggressive-prostate-cancer-found/article30653149.ece
464,2020/01/25,Kangaroo mother care improves infant survival,"Kangaroo mother care (KMC) or the intervention where babies are placed in skin-to-skin contact with their mothers and exclusively breast fed has been recommended worldwide for stable low-birthweight newborns. Stable babies are defined as babies who do not need respiratory support or intravenous fluids and can accept oral feeds. Though previous studies have shown that keeping the baby in contact with the mother improves survival in babies (less than 2 kg weight at birth) when compared to standard hospital care, global data show that barely 5% receive such care. Also, there is no much evidence on kangaroo mother care impact when initiated at homes in India.

To understand this, a team of researchers led by Nita Bhandari, Director at the Centre for Health Research and Development, Society for Applied Studies, New Delhi, carried out a study in Haryana. The results recently published in The Lancet show that kangaroo mother care improved survival by 30% and 25%, in babies till 28 days and six months of age, respectively. The paper adds that such care for all infants with low birthweight could substantially reduce neonatal and infant mortality.

Developing countries

About 97% of the world’s low-weight babies are born in developing countries, and India accounts for about 40% of this, implying an urgent need of effective interventions. Sarmila Mazumder, lead author of the study says, “In developing countries, even today, babies are born at home or even if born in hospitals, are discharged too soon without kangaroo mother care initiation. It is imperative therefore that such care is initiated at home.”

For the study, over 8,000 stable low-birthweight babies weighing less than 2.25 kg, were enrolled from two districts in Haryana, during 2015-2018 and randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Kangaroo mother care intervention was initiated at home, at an average age of 33 hours and delivered during the first month of life, through home visits. The enrolled babies were followed up at one, three and six months of age.

Multiple benefits

Dr. Mazumder adds that kangaroo mother care benefits are much beyond preventing hypothermia. “The care improves exclusive breast feeding, duration of breast feeding, and also reduces infections. It also promotes growth and development of the child and increases mother child bonding, and also reduces stress in both mother and baby,” she explains.

When asked how long babies need to be kept in such care, Dr. Mazumder explained that in the study, mothers were advised to keep the babies as long as possible, preferably 24 hours in day and night and till 28 days of age. An average of 11 hours of skin-to-skin contact was achieved, and mothers reported giving kangaroo mother care till 27 days of baby’s age. WHO recommends that it be continued till baby attains a weight of 2.5 kg or till babies wriggle out, indicating that they do not need kangaroo mother care any further.

Dr. Mazumder added that an implementation research was also conducted by the same team with the Haryana Government to scale up kangaroo mother care across 16 districts of the state. The paper adds that kangaroo mother care has the potential to prevent thousands of neonatal deaths in our country if 90% coverage can be achieved.",science,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/gw55zf/article30653124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26TH-SCIKANGAROOMOTHER,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/kangaroo-mother-care-improves-infant-survival/article30653125.ece
465,2020/01/25,Why are there more men than women in the field of STEM?,"Across the world, there are more men who are active in science, technology, engineering and medicine (STEM) than women. What is the sociology behind this gender-divide? Research shows that when men and women apply for jobs — be in the labour market, or in places where high level qualifications are demanded, men candidates engage in self-promotion, and are boastful while equally qualified women are more ‘modest’ and ‘undersell’ themselves. Even in groups and situations where men and women are present as colleagues, the views of women are either ignored or listened to less seriously than those of men. As a result, women tend to underestimate their ability relative to men, especially in public settings, and negotiate less successfully.

This last point has been particularly brought out in a detailed set of studies by Dr. Sapna Cheryan and colleagues of the University of Washington, Seattle, in their paper: ’why are some STEM fields more gender balanced than others?’ (Psychological Bulletin 2017;143:1-35, open access). They point out that in the United States while over 60% of BS, MS and PhD degrees in biological and chemical sciences are from women, only 25-30% of them do computer science, physics and engineering. Why this imbalance? The authors suggest three socio-psychological reasons, namely (1) masculine culture, (2) lack of sufficient early exposure to computers, physics and related areas compared to boys in early childhood and (3) gender gap in self-efficacy.

Stereotypes and role models

What is ‘masculine culture’? This is due to stereotyping that men are fitter for certain jobs and skills than women, and that women are more ‘delicate’, ‘tender’ and thus unfit for ‘hard’ jobs. In addition, there are not enough female role models whom women may admire and follow. (Of the 866 Nobel winners so far, only 53 have gone to women. And even in life sciences and medicine, of the over 400 Lasker awards, only 33 have gone to women). Regarding point 2, namely, lack of exposure in early childhood to certain fields, the supposed stereotyping of computer field practitioners as ‘nerds’ with social awkwardness would seem to have played a role from women shying away into other fields.

The third point, namely, the ‘gender gap in self-efficacy’, appears to have arisen as a result of the above two, and leads to a worry in girls’ and women’s minds as to ‘whether I am really only fit for certain ‘soft’ fields and jobs (such as in social sciences and life sciences)’— or a feeling of diffidence. This is clearly a reflection and product of masculine culture.

But then, even when we turn to life sciences, where both men and women compete for positions and career advancements in universities and research labs, this gender disparity is glaring. Analysis has revealed that research-intensive universities take fewer women students. It has also been noted that many qualified women scientists have stopped applying for grants from the major national agency, the National Institutes of Health, realising that they may be turned down. An extensive analysis by Lerchenmueller, Olav Sorensen and Anupam B. Jena, titled: “Gender Differences in How Scientists Present the Importance of their Research: Observational Study”, has appeared in the 16 December issue this year of The British Medical Journal (BMJ 2019;367:l6573, open access; I strongly recommend reading it). Here, they have analysed 1,01,720 clinical research articles, plus 6.2 million papers in life sciences (appearing in PubMed) for the 15-year period 2002 to 2017, and found that women remain under-represented in the medical faculty and in life science research centres and universities. They also earn lower salaries, receive fewer research grants and fewer citations of their research papers than men colleagues.

India is no better

Men rule the roost here too, and how do they do it? They use more ‘buzzwords’, boosting their own work than women. A total of 25 such buzzwords are noted by the authors- some of the more frequent ones are: novel, unique, trendsetting, robust, and remarkable. In contrast, women are more modest and thus undersell themselves. Sadly enough, this boasting leads to more grants, leading to faster promotions, salary hikes, plus membership in decision-making committees. This self-perpetuation is a reflection of what Cheryan et al. had described as “machismo”. The results of this paper in BMJ were widely reported in the popular press, and one such paper titled it as: ‘Male scientists outshout women’!

Are Indian scientists too guilty of this? There surely must be many papers among the 6.2 million that the BMJ paper had looked at where Indian authors figure. We await such an analysis of the grant proposals, decision making bodies and publications in the Indian context. But that such an imbalance exists in India has been made clear by the recent book by Dr. Namrata Gupta, titled: “Women in Science and Technology: Confronting Inequalities” (SAGE Publications India, 2019). She points out that India has been a patrilineal society with the notion that women need not take on jobs, and that this notion has only recently been revised. She points out that women form only 10-15% of STEM researchers and faculty members in the IITs, CSIR, AIIMS and PGIs. In private R & D labs, there are very few women scientists. Alas, we are no better that the rest of the world.

When we turn to research recognition and honours received by Indian scientists, my colleague G. Ponnari points out that the science academies have hardly 10% women, The Bhatnagar Prize has gone to 18 women out of a total of 548 so far, and the Infosys Prize to 16 out of a total of 52. Interestingly, there are no (or a minute percentage of women experts) women in each of these juries.

It would be interesting to study the ratio in research grants offered by the national agencies (such as DST, DBT, SERB, ICMR, DRDO) and do a Lerchenmueller type analysis of grant titles and descriptions (keeping the names and the texts secret so that copyright and propriety rights are not revealed) to check whether Indian men scientists too outshout. May we request the agencies to do so?
