2,2020/01/20,"Australian Open | Smooth sailing for Federer, Serena and Osaka; Venus crashes out","Novak Djokovic survived a scare before joining Roger Federer and Serena Williams in the Australian Open second round as heavy downpours caused chaos on Monday, forcing organisers to postpone a swathe of matches.

Defending champion Djokovic was made to sweat before beating Germany’s Jan-Lennard Struff in four sets on the first day, when fears over air pollution were replaced by disruption caused by rain.

Big backlog

While play continued at the three stadiums with retractable roofs, half of the 64 scheduled matches were postponed, ensuring a big backlog for Tuesday.

Wet conditions are unusual for the Australian Open, which is more used to extreme heat and was plagued by smog from bushfires during qualifying.

Air quality was rated ‘good’ as the first round began on Monday, but about four hours later play was suspended on outside courts when the heavens opened up.

World No. 3 Federer was briefly hauled off court while the roof was closed on Rod Laver Arena before returning to complete a routine 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over American Steve Johnson.

Serena, on the hunt for a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title, won the first set against Anastasia Potapova in just 19 minutes as she cruised to a 6-0, 6-3 win in less than an hour.

“I feel like I can still improve and get better throughout this tournament, for sure. This is a good stepping stone for right now,” Williams said.

Venus ousted

However, Serena’s elder sister Venus was ousted in stunning fashion by 15-year-old Coco Gauff, who won 7-6(5), 6-3 in a repeat of her first-round upset at Wimbledon last year.

In the late match, defending champion Djokovic dropped his first set since 2006 in the opening round before recovering to beat Jan-Lennard Struff 7-6(5), 6-2, 2-6, 6-1.

“There is a lot of pressure and a lot of different emotions involved. I definitely try to remind myself to stay present and really enjoy,” said the seven-time Melbourne winner, who brought up his 900th Tour-level victory.

Stephens ousted

Former US Open champion Sloane Stephens was the biggest women's casualty on day one when she crashed out in three sets to Zhang Shuai of China — her fourth first-round exit here.

Defending champion Naomi Osaka was done much before the downpour as she dismissed Marie Bouzkova of the Czech Republic 6-2, 6-4 in 80 minutes, smashing one powerful serve that broke a net fastening.

“It was really tough for me trying to control my nerves,” said Osaka. “It's tough to play someone you've never played before in the first round of a Grand Slam.”

Later on the covered centre court, Australian World No. 1 Ashleigh Barty recovered strongly from a set down to beat Lesia Tsurenko 5-7, 6-1, 6-1.

In the men’s draw, Greek sixth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who beat Federer en route to last year’s semis, crushed Salvatore Caruso 6-0, 6-2, 6-3.

Code violation

In other results, Canadian 13th seed Denis Shapovalov argued furiously with the umpire over a code violation for throwing his racquet as he lost in four sets to Marton Fucsovics.

Croatian 25th seed Borna Coric was another first-round loser as he went down to experienced American Sam Querrey, while Australia’s Sam Stosur bombed out against Caty McNally.

But former champion Caroline Wozniacki, playing her last tournament before retiring, safely reached the second round as she beat Kristie Ahn 6-1, 6-3.

Prajnesh’s match rescheduled

India’s top-ranked player Prajnesh Gunneswaran’s first-round match against Japanese Tatsuma Ito had to be rescheduled for Tuesday due to rain.

Prajnesh, ranked World No. 122, entered the main draw of the men’s singles event as a lucky loser in the qualifiers and was slated to take on Ito, ranked 144th in the world on Monday.

Caruso, ranked 95th in the world, looked hopelessly outplayed throughout and his troubles were compounded after a finger on his right hand started bleeding from a cut early in the final set.

Tsitsipas had three match points on Caruso's serve at 5-2 but could not convert any of them. He finally secured victory on his own serve with an ace down the middle of the court after an hour and 45 minutes.

The 21-year-old will next play the winner of the match between Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber and American Marcos Giron.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/38ttyc/article30607860.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1200685763,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-tsitsipas-blasts-past-italys-caruso-in-first-round/article30607861.ece

World no.122 Prajnesh, who entered the main draw of the men’s singles event as a lucky loser in the qualifiers, was scheduled to play Ito, ranked 144th in the world on Monday.

If Prajnesh wins against Ito, he could face world no. 2 Novak Djokovic in the second round.

5,2020/01/20,Australian Open: Naomi Osaka fires back at social media troll after winning round one,"Defending champion Naomi Osaka fired back at a social media user who jeered her arrival on court before her 6-2 6-4 victory over Czech Republic's Marie Bouzkova in the Australian Open first round on Monday.

The 22-year-old from Japan next faces China's Zheng Saisai, who needed just 72 minutes to beat Russian qualifier Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-2.

Osaka, who admitted to some nerves entering the tournament as defending champion, was less than impressed with one social media user who wrote “Boooooooooooo” on the event's official Twitter page as it announced the match was about to start.

Osaka responded after the match with a tweet of her own, asking, “are you big mad or little mad?”, then told reporters she could not understand why someone would attack her for no apparent reason.

“She was hating. What would her children think? You're just going to come on the Internet and boo me for no reason? I didn't do anything to you,” Osaka said when asked about the exchange.

“She was very upset. I also wonder, people like this, if they see you in person, I wonder what they would do?”

Having won her second Grand Slam title on Rod Laver Arena last year, Osaka was given the honour of opening the tournament in 2020 and looked nervous as she walked through the tunnel bearing the banners of previous champions, including her own.

She struggled at times early on but did what she had to by relying on a big serve and powerful forehand against the 21-year-old Bouzkova, who last year made the Toronto semi-finals. Osaka's most potent weapons helped her save five of six break points, but also broke a cord that anchors the net when the ball cannoned into it for a fault.

Play was held up for about five minutes as officials scrambled fixed it. Osaka managed to stay on serve in the first set and while it took her five break-point opportunities in the fifth game, she finally got the advantage she needed before breaking again in the seventh. She sealed the first set in 36 minutes with a forehand winner.

Swirling winds made life difficult for both players and with Osaka making errors after error, the Czech looked to have seized the momentum when she broke in the sixth game of the second set for a 4-2 lead.

Any thoughts of an upset quickly disappeared, however, when she served a double fault on break point in the next game and her angry swipe at the ball earned her a code violation when it sliced into the crowd. Osaka wasted little time in clinching the next three games, with Bouzkova winning a total of just four points, and she sealed victory when the Czech sent a backhand wide after 80 minutes.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/ke2nmv/article30605116.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NAOMI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-naomi-osaka-fires-back-at-social-media-troll-after-winning-round-one/article30605117.ece
6,2020/01/20,'Disco Elysium': a rich video game with isometric role-playing,"The last few months of 2019 flew by, thanks to a maelstrom of excellent games. In between Death Stranding and The Outer Worlds, a dark horse of a game quietly launched in October, and it turned out to be one of the biggest hits of the year. Disco Elysium, I will admit, flew under our radar, but when it started raking in the awards, we did sit up and take notice. This indie game is a unique and fascinating take on the role-playing genre.

ZA/UM is primarily nested in Estonia but also has a London office. It was founded in 2016 by Karelian-Estonian novelist and musician Robert Kurvitz, who is Disco Elysium’s lead writer and designer. In fact, Disco Elysium’s original title was ‘No Truce With The Furies’

Disco Elysium Developer & Publisher: ZA/UM

ZA/UM Price: ₹899 for PC (Steam). Also available on Epic and GOG, but prices may vary.

Disco Elysium is a combination of an isometric role-playing game in the vein of Divinity: Original Sin or the first Fallout. You play a detective who has lost his memory after a serious bender... with a corpse in the backyard. You, along with your extremely patient partner Kim Kitsuragi, set out to find some answers.

Responsive character builds

Disco Elysium is psychological in nature and it reflects in the way you imprint your character on this blank slate of a detective. Rather than the usual adventurer, you select from a range of stats around your psyche, intelligence as well as physical attributes, like motor skills and strength, which is not your traditional bash and smash, but more on intimidation. These skills play a big part in the ‘dice rolls’ in this game.

It is not only about those external conversations with people, but the wonderful depiction of our own little internal conversations. For example, if you chose an empathy-based build, you are outwardly charming and can feel out hunches, but internally you are also unstable with cross thoughts. Yet, these are valuable tools for a detective if used right. The very basis of intuition.

Players are spoilt for choice with umpteen available personalities from which to choose: the mind-palace touting Sherlock-esque detective, a pitiful pushover, a delusional superstar, or a smart-talking conman. You can choose to be the swaying champion with a penchant for licking dried rum off counters. You can be that flakey guy who refuses to pay his bills and cons old ladies off their money, or you could sit back and dabble in poetry and dance.

This is role-playing at its finest and — interestingly — the city and its denizens react to you and your shenanigans.

‘Staggering level of detail’

Experience-wise, it does throw a lot of text at you, but so well-written, that it pulls you in.

The conversation trees are complex, with dice rolls that trigger certain insights or thoughts to pop up. You can verbally bludgeon, annoy or charm information out of people. The staggering level of detail in the writing sees that you either find yourself, or you enjoy your new-found freedom that amnesia comes with and roll with it.

Disco Elysium’s graphics have a unique make-up of polygonal graphics, with a watercolour aesthetic, breathing life into every character, while offering a slice of Revachol, the mind-bending former capital of the world, which is a cold, moody place.

If ever you find yourself in an argument about video-gaming not being an art form or a literary piece, keep a copy of Disco Elysium to throw in their smug faces. If you do not mind a lot of reading, you will not be disappointed.

This is one of the most sophisticated dialogue systems packed into a game that will resonate with you on different levels.

The arrangement had been struck a while back, according to TomTom’s Remco Meerstra, but hadn’t been revealed until now. The company declined to share more details, Engadget reported on Monday.

This partnership is almost providential just as the Dutch location technology firm decided to shift its focus away from hardware and into licensing software and selling services.

And even better, it isn’t affected by the U.S. Entity List ban on Huawei, according to Slash Gear.

The U.S. added Huawei to the Commerce Department’s trade blacklist in 2019, making it difficult for the company to do business with its American suppliers.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/c40xzz/article30606414.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20NETHUAWEI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/huawei-tomtom-ink-deal-for-google-maps-alternative/article30606415.ece
10,2020/01/20,Harry voices ‘great sadness’,"Prince Harry voiced his “great sadness” at bowing out entirely from representing the British monarchy.

Prince Harry said he and his wife Meghan did not want to quit their royal duties but reluctantly accepted there “really was no other option” if they wanted to cut loose from public funding and seek own income. Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer represent the Queen Elizabeth II, must give up their honorary military appointments and will no longer receive public funds.

Under their agreement with the Queen, the couple will no longer be referred to as his or her royal highness.

“It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,” Prince Harry said at a London dinner for his Sentebale charity, which helps AIDS orphans in Lesotho.

The prince and his US former actress wife have struggled with the scrutiny since their wedding in May 2018 and the 35-year-old said there was no alternative way to achieve “a more peaceful life” with their baby son Archie.

“I haven't always got it right, but as far as this goes there really was no other option,” he said in prepared remarks.

“Our hope was to continue serving the Queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations, but without public funding. Unfortunately that wasn't possible.”

Harry also confessed to some trepidation at taking the momentous step of leaving daily duties and charting a new life in Canada.

“We are taking a leap of faith,” he said.

Harry attended the UK-Africa Investment Summit in London on Monday, seeming in good spirits as he met the presidents of Malawi and Mozambique, and the Moroccan prime minister.

Meghan, 38, and their son Archie born in May last year, are already in Canada, staying on Vancouver Island on the Pacific west coast.

The “Megxit” crisis began on January 8 when the couple announced their plans to seek a “progressive new role” in North America -- without having finalised the plans with Queen Elizabeth.

That wish for a hybrid role is starkly different from Saturday's announcement following emergency negotiations between the senior royals and their households.

The couple agreed to repay £2.4 million ($3.1 million) of taxpayers' money spent on renovating their new Frogmore Cottage home on the Windsor Castle estate.

They can maintain their private patronages and associations but must uphold the monarchy's values in any commercial arrangements they strike.

The new set-up comes into force in the coming months, while reports said it would be reviewed after a year.

‘Elegant escape hatch’

Monday's newspapers said the clean break could actually strengthen the monarchy and provide a template for other royals in future.

The Daily Express columnist Leo McKinstry said the deal was “the most sensible, constructive arrangement that could have been reached”.

Tim Stanley, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said the agreement was “good for the monarchy because it allows it to define its borders”, as integrity would have been lost by the Sussexes coming and going at will.

The Daily Mail said that “by fashioning an elegant escape hatch for those unsuited to royal life, the Queen may actually have strengthened the monarchy”.

Meanwhile The Sun welcomed the monarch's decision to “show Meghan and Harry the door”.

“Their plan to be half in, half out of The Firm was arrogant in the extreme, and would have set a damaging precedent.”

The Guardian said the deal “looks more like a decree nisi than a trial separation”.

“The royal family is losing the members most attractive and appealing to a younger generation,” the republican newspaper added.

Though the Sussexes want a life lived less in the spotlight, the new arrangements still leave them facing scrutiny.

The couple receive almost all of their funding from the private income of Harry's father Prince Charles.

Whether that will continue -- and who will foot their security bill -- remains to be seen.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/fw30fh/article30609775.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-harry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/harry-voices-great-sadness/article30609777.ece
11,2020/01/20,"Sri Lanka civil war: Missing persons are dead, says Gotabaya","Thousands of persons reported missing since the time of Sri Lanka’s civil war are “actually dead”, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has said.

The President made the remark in a recent meeting with the UN Resident Coordinator, according to a statement from his office. Outlining his plans to address the issue of missing persons, “he explained that these missing persons are actually dead. Most of them had been taken by the LTTE or forcibly conscripted. The families of the missing attest to it. However, they do not know what has become of them and so claim them to be missing,” the statement said. After the “necessary investigations”, steps would be taken to issue death certificates of the missing persons, while their families would be supported, the official media release said.

Families of scores of disappeared persons in Sri Lanka’s war-affected north and east have been relentlessly agitating by the roadside, for nearly three years now, demanding the whereabouts of their relatives, including many that families say they saw surrendering to the Army.

Family members have refused to accept their relatives’ disappearance as “death”, without seeing the body. Some are pursuing court action.

In 2017, representatives of protesting families met with former President Maithripala Sirisena, who promised to release a list of names of those who surrendered to the Army. The families did not receive it. As part of its commitments to the UN Human Rights Council, the former government set up the Office on Missing Persons in 2018 to probe complaints of disappearances — some estimates point to nearly 65,000 — in the war-affected north and east, as well as in the southern parts of the island where several thousands were reported missing, including during the leftist Janata Vimukti Peramuna-led insurgencies against the state.

The OMP held consultations across the island, but its future after regime change remains unclear, amid reports of the new government possibly revising the OMP Act and exploring a compensation package for the families.

A month before his election, President Rajapaksa told a media conference that he would not honour Sri Lanka’s commitments to the UNHRC on post-war accountability and reconciliation. Asked then about the fate of those who surrendered to the Army when he was Defence Secretary in his brother President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s government, Mr. Gotabaya Rajapaksa said, “that’s only an allegation”.

Further, in his recent meeting with the UN representative, President Rajapaksa discussed matters pertaining to poverty alleviation, climate control, digitising government offices, and better management of refugees, his office said in the statement.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pzaj5i/article30609729.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gotabaya,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/missing-persons-are-dead-says-gotabaya/article30609730.ece
12,2020/01/20,Pakistan urges U.S. to get it off Financial Action Task Force grey list,"Pakistan has urged the U.S. to support its bid to exit from the grey list of the FATF ahead of a key meeting of the international terror financing watchdog in Beijing, in which it will scrutinise Islamabad’s efforts to adopt stricter laws against terror financing and money laundering.

A Pakistani delegation arrived in Beijing on Sunday for the three-day face-to-face talks with the Financial Action Task Force Working Group that would start on January 21. The briefing will go over whether Pakistan has complied with an earlier agenda presented to it by the Paris-based financial task force, The News reported.

Black list, next?

The Pakistani delegation is led by Minister for Economic Affairs Division Hammad Azhar, comprises representatives of National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), the Foreign Ministry, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

The FATF in October decided to keep Pakistan on its ‘Grey’ list for failure to curb funnelling of funds to terror groups LeT, JeM and others. If not removed off the list by April, Pakistan may move to a blacklist of countries that face severe economic sanctions, such as Iran.

Pakistan has submitted a 650-page review report to the FATF on January 8. The report was in response to 150 questions raised by the FATF over new Pakistani policies on money laundering. The report outlined the steps taken by Pakistan between October 2019 to January 2020 to implement the group’s recommendations.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had said in Washington on Friday that Pakistan hoped the U.S. would back its efforts to get it off the list at the FATF’s Beijing meeting, the Dawn newspaper reported.

This meeting is very important for us as it leads to a plenary meeting in Paris in April, where the world body will decide whether Pakistan remains on the list or is taken off, he said.

Mr. Qureshi concluded his three-day visit to the US on Friday after a series of meetings with key US lawmakers and officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien.

The Foreign Minister spent the week touring Iran, Saudi Arabia and the US on a diplomatic mission meant to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran.

At his news briefing, Qureshi also urged the US to review its travel advisories for Pakistan and encourage investments in the country. US travel advisories still present Pakistan as a country Americans should avoid travelling because of terrorism threats.

Asked why the FATF’s Beijing meeting was important, Qureshi said that decisions taken in China’s capital would also impact the Force’s Paris plenary, which would decide whether Pakistan stayed in or was taken off the grey list.

We want our American friends to tell us what’s their policy, he said. You share with us what measures you have taken or intend to.

The minister acknowledged that removal from the FATF list could not happen overnight, but said that the US could enhance its engagements with Pakistan while waiting for the removal.

Qureshi noted that in his meetings with Prime Minister Imran Khan last year, US President Donald Trump had said that he wanted to see Pakistan off the FATF grey list. So, we expect US officials to work for it now.

The foreign minister said Islamabad had taken several concrete steps to meet FATF demands and the time had come for the US to fulfil President Trump’s pledge.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-urges-us-to-get-it-off-financial-action-task-force-grey-list/article30609697.ece
13,2020/01/20,Three Sikhs killed in clashes within community in London,"Three British Sikhs were stabbed to death after a street fight between two groups within the community in east London, Scotland Yard said on Monday.

Two men, both aged 29, have been arrested on suspicion of murder.

An investigation was launched on Sunday night, when emergency services’ personnel, who were called in after an altercation erupted between two groups in Seven Kings area of Redbrigde, Ilford, found three men, aged in their 20s and 30s, with stab wounds upon arrival. All three were pronounced dead at the scene.

“We believe the parties involved were from the Sikh community and known to each other. A fight has taken place which has escalated, resulting in three people being fatally attacked,” said Detective Chief Superintendent Stephen Clayman, Commander of the Metropolitan Police East Area Command.

“This investigation remains in its early stages and work continues to establish the exact sequence of events that led to this shocking incident. Residents in and around the Seven Kings area will see extra officers on patrol; if you have any concerns, or information that could assist the investigation, please stop and speak to them,” he said.

Identification of victims

The Police said they are in the process of establishing the formal identification of the victims and informing the next of kin before the names of those murdered can be released following post-mortem examinations.

They said a “thorough investigation”, led by homicide detectives from the Met Police’s Specialist Crime, is being carried out and officers are conducting a full forensic examination.

“The horrific triple stabbing in Seven Kings in Redbridge is a tragic reminder of the evil scourge of knife crime that continues to plague our country,” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement. “The only way we will tackle violent crime is with a laser-like focus on catching criminals by being tough on crime and, just as importantly, by addressing the underlying root causes of violence such as poverty, inequality and social alienation,” he said.

The British capital has witnessed a rise in attacks on its streets, with the London’s homicide figures last year recorded as 149, up from 133 in 2018.

Jas Athwal, the British Sikh leader of the local Redbridge Council of the area, said he believed Sunday’s triple stabbings were an isolated incident involving the local Sikh community.

“An incident like this is unheard of within the Sikh community here in Redbridge,” he said.

“I think tragically there are at least three families who are going to be in mourning and this is going to last a lifetime for the people left behind. We’ve got to look at the causes of why this happened and address those,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/three-sikhs-killed-in-clashes-within-community-in-london/article30609666.ece
14,2020/01/20,Imran Khan to meet Donald Trump at WEF in Davos,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and the U.S. President Donald Trump will meet this week on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, the Foreign Office announced on Monday.

Mr. Khan would attend the WEF in Davos, Switzerland, from January 21 to 23 at the invitation of Prof. Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF.

“On the sidelines [of the WEF], the Prime Minister will hold bilateral meetings with several world leaders. These include Prime Minister’s meeting with the U.S. President Trump,” the FO said.

This would be the third leadership-level interaction between Pakistan and the U.S. since Prime Minister Khan’s maiden visit to Washington in July 2019. The two leaders had also met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in September.

Their meeting comes amid tensions in the Gulf region between Iran and the U.S., and Pakistan’s efforts to drum up support on the Kashmir issue.

Ahead of the announcement of his meeting with Mr. Trump, Mr. Khan on Saturday warned that he feared “an Indian false flag operation.”

He said there was an urgent need for the U.N. Security Council to insist India to allow the U.N. Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) return to Kashmir.

“I want to make clear to India and the international community that if India continues its military attacks killing civilians across the LoC, Pakistan will find it increasingly difficult to remain an inactive observer along the LoC,” Mr. Khan tweeted on Saturday.

India maintains that the UNMOGIP, established in January 1949, has outlived its utility and is irrelevant after the Simla Agreement and the consequent establishment of the Line of Control.

Several other meetings are also scheduled with a wide range of corporate, business, technology and finance executives, and representatives of international financial institutions, the Foreign Office said, disclosing details of Mr. Khan’s programme in Davos.

Imran Khan would deliver a keynote address at the WEF Special Session, and interact with the CEOs and corporate leaders at the ‘Pakistan Strategy Dialogue’.

Prime Minister Khan will also speak to the international media and editors during a session with the Forum’s International Media Council.

Throughout his engagements at Davos, Prime Minister Khan will share Pakistan’s vision and achievements in the areas of economy, peace and stability, trade, business and investment opportunities, the FO said.

He will also highlight the current situation in Kashmir and Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and international issues, it said.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Forum.

In keeping with the significance of this milestone, political leaders, business executives, heads of international organisations and civil society representatives will deliberate on contemporary economic, geopolitical, social and environmental issues at Davos summit.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sggf63/article30480447.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05-DESPATCH-MEHMAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imran-khan-to-meet-donald-trump-at-wef-in-davos/article30608183.ece
15,2020/01/20,BBC boss Tony Hall to step down in six months,"Embattled BBC boss Tony Hall will step down in six months’ time, he told staff on January 20, as the British broadcaster grapples with a damaging equal-pay ruling and scrutiny over its funding.

“I will give my all to this organisation for the next six months... but in the summer I’ll step down as your Director-General,” he told staff in a group email.

“If I followed my heart I would genuinely never want to leave. However, I believe that an important part of leadership is putting the interests of the organisation first,” he added.

Mr. Hall took up his post in 2013, tasked with restoring the reputation of the world’s biggest broadcaster after late presenter Jimmy Savile was exposed as one of Britain’s most prolific child-sex offenders.

But the corporation now faces the fallout of last week’s shock equal-pay ruling, which could end up costing it many millions of pounds (dollars, euros), and hostility from the government over the licence fee.

An employment tribunal ruled the corporation discriminated against female presenter Samira Ahmed, paying her one sixth of the amount given to Jeremy Vine for hosting a similar show.

The ruling opens the door to many other claims.

The BBC is also facing pressure from Britain’s new government, headed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which accuses it of bias in reporting in the recent general election.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/er5bn7/article30607741.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20TONYHALLBBC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bbc-boss-tony-hall-to-step-down-in-six-months/article30607742.ece
16,2020/01/20,Online campaign to save malnourished lions at Sudan park,"Online calls grew Sunday to help save five ""malnourished and sick"" African lions held at a park in Sudan's capital, with some demanding the creatures be shifted to a better habitat.

The five lions are held in cages at Khartoum's Al-Qureshi Park in an upscale district of the capital, but for weeks now they have been suffering from shortages of food and medicine.

""I was shaken when I saw these lions at the park... their bones are protruding from the skin,"" wrote Osman Salih on Facebook as he launched an online campaign under the slogan #Sudananimalrescue. ""I urge interested people and institutions to help them.""

Park officials and medics said the lions' conditions deteriorated over the past few weeks, with some losing almost two-thirds of their body weight. ""Food is not always available, so often we buy it from our own money to feed them,"" Essamelddine Hajjar, a manager at Al-Qureshi park told AFP.

The park is managed by Khartoum municipality but also funded in part by private donors.

Sudan is in the midst of a worsening economic crisis, led by soaring food prices and foreign currency shortage.

On Sunday, crowds of citizens, volunteers and journalists flocked to the park to see the lions after their photographs went viral on social media networks.

One of the five cats was tied with a rope and was fed fluids through a drip as it recovered from dehydration, an AFP correspondent who toured the park reported. Chunks of rotten meat covered in flies lay scattered near the cages. The overall condition of the park itself was also affecting the animals' health, another official at the park said.

""They are suffering from severe illnesses. They are sick and appear to be malnourished,"" said Moataz Mahmoud, one of the caretakers at the park. It is unclear how many lions are in Sudan, but several are at the Dinder park along the border with Ethiopia.

African lions are classified as a ""vulnerable"" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Their population dropped 43% between 1993 and 2014, with only around 20,000 alive today.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iasn1r/article30607723.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001NY08V,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/online-campaign-to-save-malnourished-lions-at-sudan-park/article30607725.ece
17,2020/01/20,Iran’s foreign minister cancels attendance at Davos summit,"Iran’s top diplomat has cancelled his trip and will not be attending the Davos Forum, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said Monday amid a crisis with Washington and disputes with Europe over Iran’s nuclear steps.

The summit in the Swiss resort also comes after Iran earlier this month shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board. Tensions also remain high between Iran and the U.S. after an America drone killed Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.

18,2020/01/20,Former German military translator on trial as Iran spy,"A German-Afghan man who worked for years as an interpreter and adviser for the German military went on trial Monday on charges of spying for Iranian intelligence.

The 51-year-old man, who has been identified only as Abdul S. in line with German privacy rules, is charged with “a particularly serious case” of treason and with breaching official secrecy laws in 18 cases.

Prosecutors have given few details of the case. Media and the public were excluded from the trial at the Koblenz state court before the indictment was read, the dpa news agency reported.

Presiding judge Thomas Bergmann said the trial would be held behind closed doors “until further notice” because of security concerns. The public was later allowed back into the courtroom, but further exclusions were expected during the course of the trial, which is scheduled to last until at least March 31.

The man’s wife, Asiea S., also a German-Afghan dual citizen, has been charged with being an accessory to treason. Prosecutors have said she supported his passing of secret documents to Iran from the beginning, without detailing the nature of that support.

Defense lawyer Ulrich Sommer said neither has responded to the charges. He said he has found “no direct evidence” to support them.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/former-german-military-translator-on-trial-as-iran-spy/article30607444.ece
19,2020/01/20,Iran says it may pull out of nuclear treaty over Europe dispute,"Iran said Monday it will consider withdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) if a dispute over its atomic programme goes before the UN Security Council.

Britain, France and Germany launched a process last week charging Iran with failing to observe the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal, a move that could eventually see the Security Council reimpose international sanctions on the country.

Iran has accused the three EU member states of inaction over sanctions the United States reimposed on it after unilaterally withdrawing from the landmark accord in 2018.

The European move ""has no legal basis"" and if they take further measures ""Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be considered,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif was quoted as saying by the Iranian parliament's website.

The landmark 2015 deal reached with Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.

Since the U.S. pullout, Iran has progressively rolled back its commitments to the accord in retaliation.

It has hit out at the three European nations that remain party to the tattered deal for failing to live up to their promises to ease the impact of U.S. sanctions on its oil-based economy.

""If the Europeans return to the commitments, Iran will also stop reducing its commitments, but if the Europeans continue as they have been... we have different options,"" said Zarif.

The foreign minister said Iran's President Hassan Rouhani had warned former EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini about such consequences in three letters sent in 2018. ""It was stated in the president's letter that if this issue is referred to the Security Council, Iran's withdrawal from the NPT will be discussed but before that we can consider other (options),"" he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/k8c64t/article30500366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RUSSIA-IRANLAVROV-ZARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-says-it-may-pull-out-of-nuclear-treaty-over-europe-dispute/article30607262.ece
20,2020/01/20,Refined palm oil cargoes stuck at Indian ports after import curbs: sources,"Thousands of tonnes of refined palm oil are delayed or stuck at various Indian ports after the world's biggest edible oil buyer placed restrictions on imports amid a diplomatic row with key supplier Malaysia, multiple sources told Reuters.

India announced the curbs on imports of refined palm oil on Jan. 8 in a bid to help domestic refiners raise their plant utilisation rates, according to industry officials familiar with the matter. In a typical year India relies on imports for almost all of its supply of the vegetable oil used in everything from soap to cookies.

But Malaysia, the world's second-biggest producer and exporter of palm oil, has publicly bridled at New Delhi's move even as India has stepped up orders from Indonesia, according to Refinitiv data. India has been its biggest market for the last five years, and the row sent benchmark Malaysian palm futures to their worst weekly fall in more than 11 years on Friday.

“More than 30,000 tonnes have been stuck at various (Indian) ports. All these vessels were loaded before the government restricted imports of refined palm oil,” said a Mumbai-based vegetable oil dealer, who declined to be named citing company policy. “Usually customs officials allow unloading of commodities that are in transit before any change in regulation. But in the case of refined palm oil, there is some confusion and that is leading to delays.”

New licence

A source in New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter said the restrictions mean importers will need a licence to buy, a tool that could be used to deny or delay shipments from Malaysia. The person declined to be identified citing the sensitivity of the matter.

Another vegetable oil importer said some vessels were stuck at Kolkata port in eastern India, with some others on the west coast. In one incident at Mangalore port on the west coast, crude palm oil was unloaded from a vessel, while refined oil was not permitted ashore, said the importer, who also declined to be named citing the sensitive nature of the situation.

Reuters could not ascertain which vessels contained the cargoes that have been held up at Kolkata and Mangalore, nor who the buyers were. A source in Kuala Lumpur, who requested anonymity citing the sensitivity of the matter, said the refined palm oil was from both Indonesia and Malaysia. Officials at Kolkata and Mangalore ports did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

Malaysia's Sime Darby Plantation, the world's largest oil palm planter by land size, said none of its refined palm oil was stuck at Indian ports. The company, which has operations in both Malaysia and Indonesia, exported more than 436,000 tonnes of refined palm oil to India last year. Sudhakar Desai, president of Indian Vegetable Oil Producers' Association, said refined palm cargoes that reached before the restrictions were placed had been cleared but none after that. “We don't think any licenses have been issued for any origin,” Desai said.

A spokeswoman for India's trade ministry did not immediately respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sxa6zv/article30606634.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-PALMOILIMPORTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/refined-palm-oil-cargoes-stuck-at-indian-ports-after-import-curbs-sources/article30606635.ece
21,2020/01/20,Bangladesh sentences 10 to death for 2001 political bombings,"A court in Bangladesh on Monday sentenced 10 members of a banned Islamist militant group to death for a bomb attack on a Communist Party rally in 2001.

Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Court’s Judge Mohammed Rabiul Alam made the order in a crowded courtroom while four of the defendants were in the dock. Six of the defendants sentenced to death have absconded. The court acquitted two others who fled. All of them belong to the banned group Harkat-ul Jihad al-Islami.

The group considers the Communist Party an anti-Islamic force. On Jan. 20, 2001, bomb attacks on a party rally in Dhaka killed five people and wounded 50 others.

Alam said investigators found Harkat-ul Jihad al-Islami’s former chief Mufti Abdul Hannan responsible for the party attack but his name was dropped from the case because he was executed in 2017. He was hanged for a separate case involving a grenade attack on a British high commissioner in Bangladesh.

22,2020/01/20,"Document trove shows how 'Africa's richest woman' stole fortune, says investigative team","An award-winning investigative team published a trove of files Sunday allegedly showing how Africa's richest woman syphoned hundreds of millions of dollars of public money into offshore accounts.

The New York-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) worked with newspapers such as Munich's Suddeutsche Zeitung to reveal the “Panama Papers” tax haven scandal in 2016.

Its latest series called “Luanda Leaks” zeros in on Isabel dos Santos, the daughter of former Angola president Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

Angola's prosecutors last month froze the bank accounts and assets owned by the 46-year-old businessperson and her Congolese husband Sindika Dokolo, which she described as a groundless political vendetta.

“Based on a trove of more than 715,000 files, our investigation highlights a broken international regulatory system that allows professional services firms to serve the powerful with almost no questions asked,” the ICIJ wrote.

The group said its team of 120 reporters in 20 countries was able to trace “how an army of Western financial firms, lawyers, accountants, government officials and management companies helped (dos Santos and Dokolo) hide assets from tax authorities”.

Dos Santos took to Twitter to refute the claims, launching a salvo of around 30 tweets in Portuguese and English, and accusing journalists involved in the investigation of telling “lies”.

“My fortune is built on my character, my intelligence, education, capacity for work, perseverance,” she wrote.

She also blasted “the racism and prejudice” of SIC-Expresso, a Portuguese TV station and newspaper, and member of the ICIJ, “that recall the colonial era when an African could never be considered equal to a European”.

Dos Santos's lawyer dismissed the ICIJ findings as a “highly coordinated attack” orchestrated by Angola's current rulers, in a statement quoted by The Guardian newspaper.

Dos Santos herself told BBC Africa the file dump was part of a “witch hunt” meant to discredit her and her father.

The former president's daughter headed Angola's national oil company Sonangol. Forbes magazine last year estimated her net worth at $2.2 billion.

Her father's successor Joao Lourenco forced her out of the oil company after becoming president in 2017.

Dos Santos said on Wednesday that she would consider running for president in the next election in 2022.

The ICIJ investigation said Western consulting firms such as PwC and Boston Consulting Group were “apparently ignoring red flags” while helping her stash away public assets.

“Regulators around the globe have virtually ignored the key role Western professionals play in maintaining an offshore industry that drives money laundering and drains trillions from public coffers,” the report said.

Its document trove included redacted letters allegedly showing how consultants sought out ways to open non-transparent bank accounts.

One confidential document allegedly drafted by Boston Consulting in September 2015 outlined a complex scheme for the oil company to move its money offshore.

The investigation also published a similar 99-page presentation from KPMG.

24,2020/01/20,Dust storms and giant hail batter bushfire-weary Australia,"Thunderstorms and giant hail battered parts of Australia’s east coast on January 20 after “apocalyptic” dust storms swept across drought-stricken areas, as extreme weather patterns collided in the bushfire-fatigued country.

Australia has since October been overwhelmed by an unprecedented bushfire season made worse by climate change.

Swathes of the country have burned, hundreds of millions of animals have died, more than 2,000 homes have been destroyed and at least 29 lives have been lost.

Violent hail storms

Violent hail storms pelted the capital Canberra on January 20, with footage showing the storm ripping branches off trees.

Emergency services warned people there to “move cars undercover and away from trees and power lines”.

The bureau of meteorology told people in the southeast of New South Wales, including Sydney, to brace for the approaching storm.

“Severe thunderstorms are likely to produce damaging, locally destructive winds, large, possibly giant hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding in the warning area over the next several hours,” the bureau said.

Two people visiting the popular tourist destination the Blue Mountains were taken to hospital when a 16-year-old boy was hit by lightning and a 24-year-old man suffered injuries while leaning on a nearby metal railing.

“These people are extremely lucky to be alive,” Ambulance New South Wales duty manager Greg Marshall said in a statement.

“One centimetre either way and they would have faced a direct hit which could’ve been fatal.” They both remain in hospital in a stable condition.

Dramatic images captured over the weekend from western New South Wales show a massive wall of dust rolling through outback towns. Locals reported being cast into darkness in the middle of the day.

“We are used to the ritual and rush of bringing in washing, turning air cons off, closing windows and doors, before a big dust storm hits,” Ashleigh Hull from the rural town of Dubbo told AFP.

This one was “more spectacular” than the typical dust storm, she added.

“It was honestly like an apocalyptic movie, a huge wave coming towards us, really quite impressive, but I just wish it actually brought a good amount of rain, not dust.” The southern city of Melbourne was also lashed by huge hailstones late Sunday.

‘New dangers’

In Victoria, where bushfires continue to smoulder, heavy rainfall overnight was welcomed in fire grounds in the north, but authorities said it also brought with it new dangers.

State Premier Daniel Andrews said the rain meant “much more dangerous conditions” for those operating heavy machinery to get into areas damaged by bushfires, while landslides complicated efforts to open up closed roads.

The wet weather has brought a reprieve for many fire grounds along the east coast, but authorities remain on high alert, warning that the bushfire season still has weeks to run.

Tourism industry hit

Experts expect Australia to lose billions of dollars in tourism revenue as a result of the fires.

The government over the weekend announced a Aus$76 million ($52 million) recovery package to aid in the tourism recovery.

The number of travellers booking visits to Australia has fallen 10-20% since the fires began in September.

Tourism Australia was forced to suspend an upbeat advertising campaign launched in the middle of the crisis featuring pop star Kylie Minogue after the ad was met with incredulity about what many saw as poor timing.

“This is one of the biggest, if not the biggest — I would say the biggest — challenge the tourism industry has had in living memory,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on January 20.

Australia’s conservative government has come under intense criticism for its response to the fires and climate change, which scientists say is a major contributing factor to the crisis.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ikooml/article30606099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20AUSTRALIA-WEATHERHAILSTORM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dust-storms-and-giant-hail-batter-bushfire-weary-australia/article30606100.ece

26,2020/01/20,"Japan’s Abe strikes conciliatory note on S.Korea, row may be easing","Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that South Korea was its “most important neighbour” and that the two shared basic values, taking a conciliatory tone towards the country that has been locked in a bitter row with Tokyo for over a year.

The comment comes after South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week proposed the two countries work together to resolve the issue of wartime forced labourers, and called Japan “our closest neighbour.”

It also follows some fence-mending steps in recent months, including Seoul's reversal of its decision to scrap an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, and Tokyo's partial easing of curbs on the export of high-tech materials to South Korea.

“Under an increasingly severe security environment in Northeast Asia, diplomacy with neighbouring countries is extremely important,” Mr. Abe told parliament in his policy speech.

“Essentially, South Korea is the most important neighbour with which Japan shares basic values and strategic interests.”

In a parliamentary speech in October, Mr. Abe simply referred to South Korea as an “important neighbour.”

But Mr. Abe and Mr. Moon met in China in December and stressed the need to improve ties, officials from both sides said.

Also, Mr. Moon told a news conference last week South Korea would actively cooperate for the success of this year's Olympic Games in Japan, and that he hoped the sporting event would provide a good opportunity to fundamentally improve ties.

Relations between Japan and South Korea, two of the United States' major Asian allies, plunged to their lowest in decades after South Korea's top court ordered Japanese firms in 2018 to compensate some wartime forced labourers.

Japan says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalised bilateral relations following Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula.

“I sincerely hope South Korea honours the commitments between the two counties and works towards building future-oriented relations,” Abe said in his Monday speech, reiterating that the onus is on Seoul to put ties back on an even keel.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/so0d5j/article30386219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDNIP1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japans-abe-strikes-conciliatory-note-on-skorea-row-may-be-easing/article30605130.ece

Shipments of unwanted rubbish have been rerouted to Southeast Asia since China banned the import of plastic waste in 2018, but Malaysia and other developing countries are fighting back.

Environment Minister Yeo Bee Yin said another 110 containers are expected to be sent back by the middle of this year.

Ms. Yeo said the successful repatriation of a total 3,737 metric tonnes (4,120 U.S. tons) of waste followed strict enforcement at key Malaysian ports to block smuggling of waste and shuttering more than 200 illegal plastic recycling factories.

She said the Malaysian government didn’t pay a single cent, with the costs of sending back the waste fully borne by the shipping liners and importers.

Yeo said talks were ongoing with U.S. authorities to take back another 60 containers this year. Canada also has 15 more containers, Japan 14, the U.K. 9 and Belgium 8 from 110 more containers that are still being held at Malaysian ports, she said.

30,2020/01/20,China confirms spread of coronavirus as new cases surge,"An outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has spread to more cities, Chinese authorities said on Monday, as the number of patients tripled and a third person died, stoking concerns about the containment of the virus.

The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province's health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen. They mark the first cases in China beyond the central city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged.

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain had been found in the city over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases. A third death occurred on Saturday, the authority said in a statement.

Also Read China counts sharp rise in coronavirus cases, 2 in Beijing

This brings the total number of known cases worldwide to more than 200, underscoring the challenge for health authorities seeking to contain the outbreak.

Hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period that starts later this week.

A report by London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.

Containment efforts

Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travellers from Wuhan. Outside China, two cases have been reported in Thailand and one in Japan, all involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.

The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.

Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.

China's National Health Commission said on Sunday it will step up prevention efforts, but acknowledged it still doesn't know the source of the virus.

Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.

The outbreak was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where many users expressed concerns about their safety.

“Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?,” one user said.

China's Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS. Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumours forced it to reveal the epidemic.

“Concealment would be a serious blow to the government's credibility and might trigger greater social panic,” the editorial said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/hgbkyz/article30567852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-confirms-spread-of-coronavirus-as-new-cases-surge/article30604841.ece

Seven bodies have been pulled from the water as far as 12 km from the bridge that broken Saturday afternoon in Kaur district of Bengkulu province.

Rescuers are searching for 3 others, between 14 and 17 years old, still missing and feared dead, said Ujang Syafiri, who heads a local disaster mitigation agency.

“It was apparently [beyond] its capacity. Some teens even had rocked the bridge while joking,” Mr. Syafiri said.

Photos released by the agency showed rescuers using an inflatable boat while they searched for victims near the broken bridge and villagers using bamboo and clothes to carry a body.

32,2020/01/20,Trump hails China trade deal as ‘much better’ than expected,"President Donald Trump on Sunday hailed the trade deal signed last week with China for dramatically improving relations with Beijing, saying it was ""much better"" than he expected.

The ""phase one"" deal marks a truce in the two countries' trade war after nearly two years of tensions. But with tariffs still in place on two-thirds of more than $500 billion worth of imports from China, US consumers and businesses will be left to foot the bill.

""This is an incredible success for our entire country,"" Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening at a rally in Austin, Texas. He was speaking to a convention of the American Farm Bureau Federation.

""I think China's gonna go all out to prove that the agreement that was signed is a good agreement. It's much bigger and much better than I ever thought we'd get,"" he said.

Mr. Trump also praised a new chapter in relations with Beijing, calling it ""the best relationship that we've ever had with China in many, many years.""

""China respects us now,"" Mr. Trump said. ""They didn't respect us. They couldn't believe they were getting away with what they were getting away with.""

The U.S. and China signed ""phase one"" of their trade deal on Wednesday, bringing relief to stock markets after prolonged trade friction.

The deal is also a boon for Mr. Trump as he faces an impeachment trial in the Senate this week, followed by a tough re-election fight.

The agreement includes pledges from China to beef up purchases of U.S. agricultural goods and other exports for two years, provides some protections for U.S. technology, and new enforcement mechanisms that allow Washington to quickly impose penalties that Beijing cannot respond to.

Chinese state-run newspapers hailed the signing of the ""hard-fought agreement"", but warned that it would ""not take much to banjax the deal"" and bring tensions to a head again.

The most difficult issues remain to be dealt with in ""phase two"" negotiations, including China's massive subsidies for state industry.

And elements of the deal the administration has touted as achievements effectively take the relationship between the two powers back to where it was before Trump took office.

Additionally, a senior administration official told reporters on January 16 that China has not made any specific commitments to cut tariffs it has imposed on U.S. goods in retaliation.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly touted the trade pact as a win for American farmers, who were hit hard by the tariff war.

34,2020/01/20,Trump thanks farmers for backing him through China trade war,"President Donald Trump thanked farmers on Sunday for supporting him through a trade war with China as he promoted a new North American trade agreement and a separate one with China that he said will massively benefit farmers.

""We did it,” Mr. Trump said, recalling his campaign promises to improve America’s trading relationships with other countries. At one point during his address to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s convention, Mr. Trump said he has strong support among farmers following his signing last week of a preliminary trade deal with China.

When he spoke to the American Farm Bureau Federation’s last year, he urged farmers to continue supporting him even as they suffered financially in the fallout from his trade war with China and a partial shutdown of the federal government.

""You were always with me,” Mr. Trump said. “You never even thought of giving up and we got it done.” The Republican president wants another term in office and is seeking to shore up support among his base, including farmers.

Mr. Trump announced he is taking steps to protect the water rights of farmers and ranchers by directing the Army Corps of Engineers to immediately withdraw a new water supply rule and allow states to manage water resources based on their own needs and what the agricultural community wants. ""Water is the lifeblood of agriculture and we will always protect your water supply,” he said.

Mr. Trump signed a preliminary trade deal with China at the White House last Wednesday that commits Beijing to boosting its imports of U.S. manufacturing, energy and farm goods by $200 billion this year and next. That includes larger purchases of soybeans and other farm goods expected to reach $40 billion a year, the U.S. has said, though critics wonder if China can meet the targets. In Austin, Mr. Trump described the trade agreement with China as “groundbreaking” and said, “We’re going to sell the greatest product you’ve ever seen.”

Also last week, the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a successor to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement. The administration designed the new agreement to return some factory production to the United States, mostly automobiles.

Mr. Trump said in Austin that U.S. farmers will also benefit under USMCA, which he said will “massively boost exports” for farmers, ranchers, growers from “North to South” and “from sea to shining sea.”

NAFTA had triggered a surge in trade among the three countries, but Mr. Trump and other critics blamed it for U.S. job losses brought about when American factories moved production south of the border to take advantage of low-wage labour in Mexico.

The House passed the U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal in December. Mr. Trump said he would sign it after he returns from a trip to Europe this week. In his remarks to farmers, Mr. Trump claimed his administration is doing things no other administration has ever done.

""And what do I get out of it? I get impeached,” he said. “That’s what I get. By these radical-left lunatics, I get impeached. But that’s OK. The farmers are sticking with Trump.” The president’s trial in the Senate gets underway in earnest on Tuesday.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-thanks-farmers-for-backing-him-through-china-trade-war/article30604638.ece
35,2020/01/20,Violence escalates in Beirut as anti-government anger flares,"Lebanese security forces used tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets in clashes with hundreds of anti-government protesters outside the country’s Parliament on Sunday, as violence continued to escalate in a week of rioting in the capital.

At least 114 people were injured in the protests, according to the Red Cross and the Lebanese Civil Defense teams. 47 of those injured were transported to hospitals for treatment. Reporters on the scene said most of the wounds were from rubber bullets, some in the face and the upper body.

Demonstrators used rocks and other projectiles, including shooting a stream of fire from ignited aerosol cans. Security forces responded by firing several rounds of tear gas canisters and water cannons, before turning to rubber bullets in an attempt to disperse the crowds. A few protesters tried to climb over the metal barriers separating them from the riot police. Hundreds more, some chanting “revolution,” gathered farther down the blocked street that leads to the Parliament.

Army troops deployed to the area briefly, and the violence stopped. Protesters cheered the army’s arrival. Minutes later, the army pulled out and the clashes resumed with security forces barricaded behind the barriers.

Security forces reinforced the metal barriers surrounding the Parliament building in central Beirut earlier on Sunday, after the worst night of violence since the unrest erupted several months ago.

Some protesters tried to scale the barriers outside the legislative building on Saturday, sparking nine hours of pitched street battles with security forces.

Saturday’s clashes left at least 377 people injured, according to the Red Cross and the Lebanese Civil Defense. More than 120 of those were treated in hospitals, including a protester who sustained an eye injury, as well as security force members. Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces said 142 of its members were injured, including 7 officers, some with serious concussions.

Lawyers defending protesters said a total of 43 were arrested Saturday, including two minors. They said that 11 of the arrested were released the same day, and the remaining 32 were released Sunday pending investigation. Most of the detainees were beaten in custody, the lawyers added.

Lebanon’s military made a show of force on Sunday, heavily deploying in downtown Beirut and in the country’s south, patrolling ahead of the rallies. Riot police were in the front line guarding the Parliament.

The clashes took place amid a rapidly worsening financial crisis and an ongoing impasse over the formation of a new government. The government headed by Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned in late October. Prime Minister-designate Hassan Diab had been expected to announce a new 18-member Cabinet on Sunday after meeting with President Michel Aoun. But after a 90-minute meeting, there was no announcement, signalling another delay among Lebanon’s fractious political leaders.

The protests, which began in October, took a violent turn this week as popular frustration began to rise. Demonstrators say the Lebanese political elite has ignored their calls for forming an independent government to tackle the deepening crisis.

""We don’t accept the government the way they are forming it. They are using the old method to form the government ...so it’s not acceptable,” said Jil Samaha, a protester. “We want a different way of forming a government.”

The protesters have been rallying against the country’s political elite in power since the end of the 1975-90 civil war. They blame politicians for widespread corruption and mismanagement in a country that has accumulated one of the largest debt ratios in the world.

Panic and anger have gripped the public as their local currency, pegged to the dollar for more than two decades, plummeted. The Lebanese pound lost more than 60% of its value in recent weeks on the black market. The economy has seen no growth and foreign inflows dried up in the already heavily indebted country that relies on imports for most of its basic goods.

Protesters targeted commercial banks earlier this week, which have imposed informal capital controls, limiting withdrawal of dollars and foreign transfers.

Interior Minister Raya El Hassan condemned Saturday the attacks on security forces and public and private properties as “totally unacceptable.”

""There was no justification for the brutal use of force unleashed by Lebanon’s riot police against largely peaceful demonstrators in downtown Beirut,” said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at HRW.

Security forces and the military had prepared for more violence Sunday, blocking access to some buildings in central Beirut with razor wire, and closing off access to areas that included a popular tourist site. Workers also welded fencing together across roadways that lead to Parliament to make it harder for demonstrators to push through.

Earlier Sunday on the quiet rainy streets of Beirut, shopkeepers, banks and other businesses swept up broken glass and boarded up windows. Workers at one bank took down the large sign with its name to remove any identifier and avoid soliciting anger from protesters, who smashed the windows and the facade of Lebanon’s Banking Association headquarters with metal bars the previous night. The demonstrators widely blame Lebanese financial institutions, alongside government corruption, for the crippling economic crisis.

36,2020/01/20,Firework plans to become the go-to platform for short video content,"According to Sunil Nair’s Twitter bio, in his spare time, he’s a “secret agent, cooker, and a kiddie book writer” — with two published books, and another on the way. The 45-year-old CEO of Firework India may not take himself too seriously, but in the world of streaming media services, when he speaks, people listen. And with good reason: back in 2006, he set up the first online video distribution platform, nautanki.tv. Before heading the newest short-form video platform on the block, he was the COO of Alt Balaji, where he built India’s first subscription-based original video content platform, and held leadership positions at Reliance Jio and Star India.

These experiences should come in handy in his new role — considering Indian over-the-top (OTT) media will overtake South Korea by 2023, to become the eighth biggest market in the world. Revenue is set to increase to $1.7 billion from the current $638 million (according to PWC Global Entertainment & Media Outlook 2019-2023). “While the audience numbers have exploded, the fundamentals of creating content for any video platform have remained the same. People consume content and not platforms,” says Nair. The question is how to create content that keeps the audience hooked.

Nair explains, “While we may think that the ‘sweet spot’ is three minutes (on Facebook) and 20 minutes (on YouTube), we have to understand that each platform caters to a different need. Long format content is mostly watched by Gen X and the millennials, while Gen Z prefer the short format.” He believes that “one has to have the skills of an ad film maker who can sell a ₹50 lakh car in 30 seconds”.

Great storytelling mandatory

In India, OTT developed rapidly in the last four to five years, and currently, we have 32 active players including broadcasters and international players. China pioneered short format content with Kuaishou (better known as Kwai), which catered to people who had a long commute. “It is tough to watch something with a complex storyline while in transit. Short format content allows you to consume a steady stream of things without committing a long stretch of time,” explains Nair.

The reveal option

He believes that if you tell the audience a great story they will consume it in volumes. Calling Firework the Netflix equivalent of short-form videos, he says, “There’s too much of reliance on memes and mimicry, which leads to a monoculture that is neither innovative nor fulfilling. We are woefully short of good original content. For a population such as ours, currently, we only have around 1,200 hours of original content from all platforms put together. We need at least 30,000 hours.” Openly critical of lip-sync and cringe content, Nair admits that he will happily trade 300 million users for 50 to 60 million “who can be part of high-quality content creation”.

Medium vs content

Firework has been busy, collaborating with well-known talent to create original content. They have launched a series of 30-second short films (@Flashfiction), directed by award-winning Kannada director Chaitanya KM. The films span different genres, including horror. Reel, Reveal, Rajeev is another reality/docu-series on popular actor Rajeev Khandelwal. Regular users like vegan advocate Chaitali Pisupati are documenting everyday life — including her trek to the Annapurna Base camp. “Then there is Rena Abraham, a 14-year-old who belts out the blues, or Harish Bijoor, a brand consultant who gives management gyaan and interesting trivia about market trends. Quality is maintained by content moderation, which is a priority. This happens in real-time, with a combination of the machine-human interface at our US facility.” This is to ensure that explicit, vulgar or bigoted content is weeded out.

This year, Firework aims to reach three to five million daily users in India. “We will be investing $20 to $30 million to build a content base and start creator programmes to encourage the community. The advertising is not based on vanity metrics be it likes or reposts; it is purely based on video views and engagement,” he concludes.

37,2020/01/20,Hacker leaks passwords for 5 lakh Internet-connected devices,"A hacker has leaked usernames and passwords of over five lakh servers, routers and Internet of Things (IoT) devices on the Dark Web, which can be used to install malware on Internet-connected devices at home or at work.

Attackers could use those credentials to gain remote access to the affected devices, like we have seen recently in some home cameras and devices, including Amazon-owned Ring security cameras.

According to a ZDNet report on Sunday, the list of Telnet credentials has been published on a popular hacking forum that includes each device’s IP address, along with a username and password for the Telnet service.

Telnet is one of the earliest remote login protocols on the Internet. It is a client-server protocol that provides the user a terminal session to the remote host from the telnet client application.

“Hackers scan the internet to build bot lists, and then use them to connect to the devices and install malware,” said the report.

The list has been published online by the maintainer of a Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) botnet operator.

However, some of these devices might now run on a different IP address, or use different login credentials.

“Some devices were located on the networks of known Internet service providers (indicating they were either home router or IoT devices), but other devices were located on the networks of major Cloud service providers,” the report mentioned.

The five lakh devices still remain at hacking risk as a hacker can use the IP addresses included in the lists and then re-scan the internet service provider’s network to update the list with the latest IP addresses.

Amazon’s Ring subsidiary came in the news for all the wrong reasons where customers’ in-house cameras were broken into and the hackers tried to intimated the residents, including children.

38,2020/01/20,WhatsApp hits 5 billion installs on Android,"Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp for Android has now notched up a staggering five billion downloads, making it only the second non-Google app to achieve this milestone.

As with most Android applications that reach large amounts of installs, this number does not just include downloads from the Play Store, but also pre-installed copies like Samsung and Huawei has bundled the app with some smartphones in the past, AndroidPolice reported.

According to Statista, WhatsApp is most popular global mobile messenger app worldwide with approximately 1.6 billion monthly active users, outranking Facebook Messenger at 1.3 billion and WeChat at 1.1 billion users in 2019. Following Facebook and YouTube, it is the third most popular social network worldwide.

As for the Google Play store, South Korea was the fastest-growing WhatsApp market, with downloads of the mobile messaging app increasing almost 56% in 2019.

Additionally, Google for the first time in five years, unseated Facebook as the top publisher of mobile apps.

In the last quarter of 2019, Google amassed close to 850 million downloads compared to Facebook’s nearly 800 million, analytics firm Sensor Tower revealed recently.

When it comes to overall downloads for the year, however, Google still trails behind Facebook.

While Google raked in nearly 2.3 billion downloads, Facebook gained almost 3 billion downloads over the past 12 months.

Facebook owns four out of the top five most downloaded apps worldwide, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, that does not come as a surprise.

41,2020/01/20,"Serving aces, with a dollop of cream on top: The all-female Australian Open Chef Series","The year’s first tennis Grand Slam — the Australian Open — has begun. Even as Australia continues to battle the bushfire crisis in the background, tennis is raising funds for those affected by the calamity with their Aces for Bushfire Relief project that has players, organisers, and fans contributing.

But fans entering stadiums to cheer on their favourite tennis stars are in for a treat of a different kind as well at this year’s tournament: thanks to the AO Chef Series.

The new initiative will see an all-female line-up of food icons be part of the Open, and host special degustation dinners they’ve created especially for the tournament.

Food stylist and Australian icon Donna Hay, India-based restaurateur Sarah Todd, Hobart-based restaurant Franklin’s head chef Analiese Gregory, and Thai chef Duangporn ‘Bo’ Songvisava will each host two lavish dinners during the course of the AO, as the culinary world comes forward to meet tennis in an ace combo. The chefs will present their menus in personalised pop-up restaurants at The Glasshouse, during the two-week Melbourne fest.

Ahead of hosting their special dinners, two of the most recognised names in the line-up: Sarah Todd and Donna Hay talk about the preparation that’s going into their tournament menus, their cooking mantras and of course, the players they will be rooting for.

Sarah Todd, chef, TV host and food influencer

Tennis and food: what do you see as the connection between these two diverse fields?

The Australian Open is the first of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments held annually. With hundreds of thousands of fans visiting each year, it has evolved into a jam-packed entertainment package which includes live music, gourmet food, evening sound-and-light shows and lots of activities for kids. Oh and of course some great tennis!

For the first time, the AO Chef Series in 2020 is an all-female line-up and I am honoured to be invited. It is also great that the prize money is equal for both male and female players at this event.

How important is it for you to be featured in a line-up like this?

This really is a special moment for me. Five years ago, my goal was to open an Indian restaurant in Australia. Well, the universe had other plans for me and I opened an Australian Restaurant in India. I am excited to showcase my cooking style at this prestigious event in Australia. I am also excited and honoured to be sharing the culinary stage with women who have carved out a successful career in a male dominated industry.

What are you planning for your degustation menu?

I have travelled extensively across India over the past five fears. I have been welcomed into the home of a Mishing family in Assam, stayed with a tribe in Nagaland, participated in a cultural festival at a Rajasthani Fort in Kashmir, fished in the backwaters of Goa and cooked freshly-caught crab xacuti with a family on the banks of a river. These travels and experiences have influenced the way I cook.

My menu at the Australian Open will take guests on a journey of flavours from across India while incorporating native Australian ingredients. Australian produce is the best in the world, and I will be using Southern Rock lobsters, Milly Hill lamb, Epicurean Harvest fairy-tale eggplant and nettle, to name a few. I’m looking forward to sharing the story behind each dish with my guests.

I’m presenting a five-course menu with five vegetarian and five non-vegetarian. My menu pays homage to both India and Australia.

Will there be any Indian-themed recipes or dishes in your menu?

I spend an equal amount of time in India and Australia and I feel at home in both countries. I feel grateful and honoured that the people of India have opened their hearts to me. Indians have such a love of food and food and the style of cooking varies from State to State. I have learnt so much that my cooking style has changed and adapted to incorporate some of what I have learned during my travels.

I have drawn inspiration from India to create a menu using Australian produce. My wish is to make both India and Australia proud of my Indian-Australian cuisine.

How much did you learn from the other chefs at the tournament?

I have followed Donna Hay over the years and really admire her work. I am learning all the time and it is inspiring to see other female chefs like Analiese and Bo being acknowledged for their hard work.

Are you a fan of the AO? A female tennis star who’s always inspired you?

Australians are sports-mad, whether it’s playing it or watching it! I love tennis and my son Phoenix and I have had some lessons. Tennis is the main topic of conversation at present, especially considering the number one female tennis player in the world is our very own Ashleigh Barty. She is certainly the player I will be watching out for at the Australian Open. Ashleigh’s hard work and determination has seen her excel in tennis and cricket. She is a great role model for young women

A perfect dish to sample while watching tennis at the Australian Open, if you had to pick one?

One of my favourite things to do when I am in India is to sample the street food. And, one of my favourite street foods is papdi chaat. This ultimate street food with pops of flavours would fit the bill perfectly while watching a tennis match.

The country is going through a crisis at the moment due to the rampant bushfires: how do you want the hospitality and cooking community to come forward to fight this?

The bushfires are hard to watch and the devastation is so wide spread. At a time like this, Australian communities come together to support each other. Offers of help come in many different forms. Restaurant owners are supplying food and water to families in shelters.

The owners of an Indian restaurant and their staff in East Gippsland where fires have destroyed homes are cooking curry and rice for those living in temporary shelters. The meals are being distributed by a team from Melbourne charity Sikh Volunteers Australia. This is just one example of many acts of generosity.

Fundraisers and auctions are also being organised to raise money. I will be offering a dining experience for four and will design a menu and cook in the home of the winning bidder.

Who are you rooting for at this year’s AO?

Of course I’ll be rooting for Ashleigh Barty. I’m also looking forward to seeing Alex de Minaur play. This young Australian is rapidly rising up the ATP ranking. He is calm and hard-working and I think he is one to watch.

Donna Hay, food stylist, author and editor

How are you looking forward to this year’s tournament?

I am thrilled to be part of the Australian Open 2020, I’m even more excited that I get to be part of something so unique. The food industry has always been male dominated but as we can see by the incredible talent participating in this event — there are loads of amazing women creating brilliant food, so it’s flattering to have been asked to be part of the line-up.

Could you give us some insight into your cooking philosophy for the AO?

My style of cooking is not fussy or over the top. I write recipes for home cooks that are simple but taste delicious and to be honest, that’s how I cook even when I’m entertaining. So that’s how I approached my menu... as though you were coming over to my house for dinner. Intimate, informal, tasty and hopefully, lots of fun!

How many dishes are being planned and is there a theme?

I will be serving six courses. I know that sounds like a lot, but they’re all light and form part of my story. Each course is intrinsically tied to a moment, a highlight or memory of my childhood, growing up in Australia and my career. But most importantly, they all focus on the flavours of ingredients at their best. Oh, and there are two desserts, because let’s face it... dessert is clearly the best part of any meal!

Tell us about growing up in Australia.

I consider myself lucky to have grown up in Australia. Sydney is my hometown and there’s nothing I love more than spending my free time enjoying the sunshine, sparkling sights, and beautiful food. The city has a lot to offer, warm weather and so many world-class beaches within just a few kilometres of the CBD (Central Business District.)

There’s so much to do with lots of options to have a great time outdoors with my boys. Plus, thanks to the Australian restaurant and café culture, there are loads of casual places with great fresh food to take the boys to dinner.

Do you enjoy watching tennis? Rooting for anyone at this year’s games?

I have always loved tennis, the intensity and focus of the players when they are on court is breath-taking. As a small girl, I went to tennis lessons, there I would admire the stylish ladies who played and ate chicken sandwiches every week. So I thought that’s what ladies who played tennis ate... chicken sandwiches. Well, I’m not much of a tennis player, but I can make a fabulous chicken sandwich!

42,2020/01/20,Deccan Comedy was started to promote local talent and make comedy a common mode of entertainment,"Smile and the world smiles with you. Laugh and the world laughs with you. Deccan Comedy — by friends Askhay Sharma and Utsav Dixit — intends to make the laughter-filled evenings, a wholesome entertaining experience. While Utsav cracks jokes Akshay works on the logistics of running Deccan Comedy (DC), and both the friends are constantly searching for new talent to introduce them to the audience. DC is more or less like a platform for comedians looking for a break or to be discovered by lovers of standup comedy.

Akshay, a law graduate who runs a digital marketing firm talks about the idea behind the club, “We started the club 10 months back with Utsav doing the comedy. The response was overwhelming and within no time, we had people approaching us for events. Standup comic is the new popular genre of entertainment and unfortunately we don’t have enough names. However, there is no dearth of talent. We don’t see new talent because there aren’t many events where first-timers can participate. As we started frequenting open mic sessions we were surprised at the kind of talent we got to see. Each one had their own style, the acts were brilliant and most importantly we discovered that the talent here cracks jokes and leave the audience in splits without using cuss words to seek attention.”

Akshay and Utsav’s prime motive is to offer a platform to newcomers. Utsav, manges their family business and has performed in clubs across USA and the duo wants to bring the same level of professionalism and seriousness to comedy in India. “Making people laugh is a serious business,” says Utsav, who is also the producer for all DC events.

Utsav Dixit

Ever since they started in March 2019 they have been successfully doing three shows every month, showcasing newer talent each time. “When we started, it was a struggle. As we started meeting more people, doing shows and opening the stage for the audience we realised the amazing talent pool,” says Akshay.

In less than a year, DC had talents such as Sai Kiran, Vivek Murlidharan, Rohit Swain, Hriday Ranjan, Pensy Antall, Rupali Tyagi and many more. “Over 25 comedians have performed around 1000 minutes of comedy under the DC umbrella so far,” says Utsav.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/6y4yj7/article30605740.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DC,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/utsav-dixit-akshay-sharma-deccan-comedy/article30605742.ece
43,2020/01/20,How to understand bird behaviour better...,"When an issue has an in-built complexity as big as the size of a paw, the prudent course would be to avoid trying to put a finger on it. The explanation is likely to be inadequate, and sometimes grossly misleading. In some of its facets, bird migration is one such issue. The question on most birders’ lips in Chennai today is: “Why have the migratory birds not arrived in impressive numbers this season, despite a good monsoon?”

We have zoomed past mid-January, and wintering birds are thin on the ground. Some species even seem to have stood us up. The situation is starkly evident in the prominent birding spots in Chennai, especially the Kelambakkam backwaters and the Perumbakkam wetland. Some of those I know are heading to far-flung spots to catch a glimpse of their favourite winter visitors. Trying to tackle the afore-mentioned question without a larger perspective, can lead to answers that are both plausible and fallacious at the same time.

Recently, when I discussed this issue with Hopeland P, an independent wildlife researcher, he said while trying to analyse local factors, it is absolutely necessary to factor in the global perspective.

“That is why larger regional bird counts such as the Asian Waterbird Census are a valuable tool in understanding bird migration patterns, and a seeming break in them. Local results should always be interpreted in the global context, understanding the various dynamics impacting a species across its home and wintering range. In the current scenario involving Chennai, a multiplicity of governing factors fusing the global and the local can be at play. Widespread availability of resources, such as the availability of food, can scatter bird populations. Environmental regulators, such as wind, can also have a role in migration.”

So, it seems to boil down to the fact that birders from across the globe have to be more connected to understand some blind spots in migratory patterns. Such knowledge sharing has helped us understand bird behaviour better.

Here is an example. Now, you will see whimbrels and common curlews in the shallow Kelambakkam backwaters, running their bills — longer, the common curlew’s bill is a walking symbol for the kinked-demand curve theory — through the muddy brackish waters for crustaceans like crabs. Now, there are any number of omnivorous birds that have a varied diet plan. But to think of the whimbrel having a frugivorous diet as an add-on, while in its breeding habitat, is quite something to chew on. From crabs to a combo of “cranberries and crabs” seems like quite a switch, though in reality not unusual at all. We know this about the whimbrel because of what gets reported from its breeding grounds. Similarly, our understanding of bird migration and its occasional vagaries will be more reality-centred, if there is greater reporting of periodic changes in known patterns.

44,2020/01/20,Discover this unexplored getaway spot located less than 30 kms from Chennai Airport,"For a few seconds, after a colleague mentioned the name of Kumizhi as a possible place to scout for this column, I stood pondering. It is not exactly hidden, is it?

Of course, I was thinking of Kumily (in Idukki district of Kerala), the paradise upon Earth to which I had ridden in the past. But I was mistaken.

“This is near Tambaram,” he told me, and hardly an hour’s ride from my place of stay (according to Google Maps). I was intrigued, more so because of the endorsement he had given it as a quaint spot.

In sight

Note the difference in spelling: this sleepy settlement stowed away from the hustle and bustle of the GST Road (Guduvancherry bus stand located off the National Highway is around 13 kilometres from here) is spelt Kumizhi.

Take a detour off GST Road near Guduvancherry bus stand onto Nellikuppam road, or Vandalur near the Arignar Anna Zoological Park onto the Kelambakkam Road (before cutting right onto Nellikuppam Salai near Kandigai) to access Kumizhi.

I take a colleague along for the bike ride to Kumizhi on a wet winter morning. Rain-fed clouds hang over us throughout the trip like the Sword of Damocles, threatening to play spoilsport. Much later we realise that the dark skies add a whole new hue to the quaintness that we discover in abundance here.

Where to begin? The detour off Kandigai is a good point. The Vandalur-Kelambakkam Road is an unremarkable stretch of asphalt, dotted by concrete structures just as soon as you skip past the zoo — a stark reminder of the extent of urbanisation Chennai and its suburbs have undergone.

However, as soon as you get off the highway, a different world, with an old-world charm that can be found nowhere else in this cosmopolitan city, awaits.

Tranquil settlement

The landscape opens up to reveal a row of huts fixed by the side of a hillock.

Picture this like a shot right out of a car commercial: the two of us driving up the road in an SUV, and one of us puts our hands out to receive the little, crystal clear rain droplets oozing out of the grey skies; all this unfolds in slow motion while some dub step music plays in the background... and Cut!

You get the point, although I could not stop thinking of how this scenery would look like in the backdrop of the setting sun. For now, it is just a perfect wintry morning.

We feel a breath of fresh air, literally. The chill breeze that rubs against our cheeks and bodies is so full of oxygen, and devoid of the coarse particles of dust that most Chennaiites’ eyes are populated with.

And no, it isn’t some Rodney Atkins ‘Take a Back Road’ style course that takes you to Kumizhi; the road has a top grade black top, and offers as smooth a ride as they come.

You don’t reach Kumizhi until you spot a languid bus stop, which has the face of former Indian President APJ Abdul Kalam painted on it.

The row of trees that dot the bank of the freshwater lake | Photo Credit: Pradeep Kumar

The structure was built only recently — in 2016, say locals. Nevertheless, it serves as a mile marker equivalent. A detour to the right from here leads you towards the unexplored wilderness of Kumizhi.

Road to nowhere

A little way past the local school, the road cuts into a freshwater lake. My colleague, perhaps caught in a trance by the beautiful sight in front of her, decides to get off the motorcycle, and walks up to the water body’s edges.

A couple of locals are fishing for fresh catch. Rows of trees which dot one side of the lake’s bank make for a resting spot — the kind where even families can get together for a barbeque. It is an amalgamation of all things deemed perfect for a getaway weekend.

Yet, there is more ground to cover. After spending over 30 minutes by the water body, taking in the bird noises and watching a snake take a swim in the waters, we push ahead.

The off-roading trail in Kumizhi is covered on both sides with thick vegetation | Photo Credit: Pradeep Kumar

The driving conditions don’t remain the same. The black topping gives way to a muddy trail.

What little asphalt is left of a road, that seemed to have been paved decades ago, also provides us a natural off-roading trail. It would have been perfect for a mountain bike, but we decide to push the Royal Enfield through, and it is not a regrettable decision.

The trail itself can feel spooky due to the thick vegetation that envelops it on both sides, and also because the only sound for around 10 minutes is coming off our vehicle. The thumps from the two wheeler, though, are not enough to drown out the tranquility of the place.

After a good 20 minutes of off-road adventure, we emerge on the other side of Kumizhi, at Nallambakkam, when we discover that there are buses which connect Kumizhi to Guduvancherry and Tambaram (55D, 60K, 55K are the few routes we notice).

In the next 15 minutes, the hidden trail is nothing more than a blip on the rear-view mirror, and we are shaken out of our dream visit by the blaring honk of an overtaking truck. It reminds us that Chennai lies ahead.

(This trail is best visited during daytime)

45,2020/01/20,Get your single screen fix at these renovated theatres in Bengaluru,"Cauvery theatre, Sankey Road

Established in 1972 by Narasimaiah, a businessman, it is now handled by his son Prakash N who has grown up around the theatre and can be found there every day. While the first film that played at Cauvery was the Dr Rajkumar-starrer Bangaaarada Panjara, the longest running at 27 weeks is Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.

Says Prakash, “Previously, we renovated the theatre in 1995. Then we renovated again in January 2019. Apart from the seats, the screen was changed to silver screen to play 3D films, projector was changed to Christie 4K, and the sound system was changed to Dolby Atmos.”

While the theatre, which at present has a capacity of 1212, started with screening Kannada films, Prakash says that now “films of all languages are played”. Right now, the Rajinikanth-starrer Darbar is playing at the theatre.

On whether he has any favourite film that has played at Cauvery, he laughs, “Nothing like that. Every film is my favourite.”

Stating that the advent of multiplexes, has affected single screen theatres, he says, “Day by day, collections are coming down. We have to improve and provide facilities. That is also why we renovated the theatre again last year. People think of single screen theatres as something ordinary. So, it is difficult to get people to come.”

Mukunda theatre, Maruthi Sevanagar

Perhaps Mukunda theatre’s renovation is the most visible with gleaming titles at even the point of entry - the box office. Established by N Muniswamappa in 1976, the theatre is now run by his grandson G Venkatesh Reddy.

While in the beginning, the theatre screened many Tamil films (catering to the large Tamil population in the area), the theatre now screens films of all languages, says Bharani V, representative, who has worked at Mukunda for the last eight years.

“Mungaru Male was the longest running film at 100 days. Other films that have done well include Indian, Padayappa, Baahubali 2 and Avatar.”

The theatre was closed for renovation in February 2019 and reopened in June. “Except for the building, A to Z was changed,” laughs Bharani. “Apart from Harkness silver screen, 4K projector was installed, and sound was changed to Dolby Atmos. While seating capacity was initially 814, after renovation it is 761 as we got bigger seats.

On the challenges that single screens are facing, Bharani is firm.

“When we are providing good sound and projection, people will come here only. Even though there is a mall five minutes away, people will come here if we have the facilities. Additionally, ticket prices are lower so it is possible for a wider section of people to come and watch films here.”

Sri Radhakrishna theatre, RT Nagar

Located on the busy main road in RT Nagar, the theatre which was established in 1999, underwent a complete makeover in June 2019.

Seated in his office, Thimmaiah AM, manager for the last 20 years, says, “It was required so everything was changed.” Providing the details, Sathyanarayana, cinema operator, says, “Now, we have a Harkness silver screen which can play 3D films, the sound system was changed to Dolby Atmos (with ceiling speakers), the seats were refurbished and even the projector was changed to a Christie projector.”

Stating that the 738-capacity theatre plays films of all languages – Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and English, Thimmaiah says that Duniya and Mungaru Male were the longest running at 10 and eight weeks respectively. In fact, he adds, “We have also played The Lion King and The Avengers and not dubbed in any other language. We play films only in the original language.”

As for which films do well (at present, the audience is enjoying the latest Mahesh Babu film and making their excitement known), he says, “We see who are the top heroes and play their films. Salman Khan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Hrithik Roshan…their films do well.”

On whether there are any challenges or struggles that single screen theatres such as Radhakrishna are facing, both Thimmaiah and Sathyanarayana are of one mind.

“We play films of all languages and so collections are good. We are not facing any competition from multiplexes.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/lfijzd/article30607301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BGMCAUVERYTHEATRE10,https://www.thehindu.com/society/get-your-single-screen-fix-at-these-renovated-theatres-in-bengaluru/article30607308.ece
46,2020/01/20,Indian firms highly cyber-resilient in APAC region: McAfee,"Indian enterprises are the most cyber-resilient than all their counterparts across Asia Pacific (APAC) region as per a study by McAfee, a device-to-cloud cybersecurity firm.

The study, that covered 480 cybersecurity decision-makers across eight countries, including Australia, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and Thailand, showed that 97% of the organisations in India were familiar with the concept of cyber-resilience compared with Australia (73%) and New Zealand (75%).

As per Sanjay Manohar, India MD of McAfee, cyber- resilience refers to an entity’s ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events. “An astounding 97% of organisations in India believe that they are cyber-resilient, taking the top position amongst all the other countries in the region.’’

The study also found some 98% of Indian enterprises were likely to invest more in security as regulation demanded it. Some 60% of Indian CXOs participated in the study believe that building a culture of cybersecurity was ‘strategic,’ in comparison with Australia (27%) and Singapore (40%).

“The C-Suite is more likely to believe that their organisation’s cybersecurity posture is ‘strategic’ (53%) compared to other levels of management,’’ according to the study.

“Today, organisations are increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks that are designed to cripple their business or permanently destroy their IT systems. As digital transformation has created unintended gateways to risks, vulnerabilities, attacks, and failures, a cyber-resilience strategy can help businesses withstand disruptive cyber incidents. Cyber-resilience is an evolving perspective that is rapidly gaining recognition,’’ Mr. Manohar further said.

India is most likely to have ‘high’ impact (58%) of cybersecurity incidents on the business compared with Singapore (42%) and Australia (16%), as per the study.

McAfee in its threat predictions said, data breach, data tampering and fraud would be the top three risks plaguing enterprises in the APAC region in 2021 as they continue their digital transformation and cloud journey.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indian-firms-highly-cyber-resilient-in-apac-region-mcafee/article30609712.ece

This is the first time the RBI has released the minutes of a board meeting in public domain in a bid to enhance transparency regarding its functioning. The minutes were available under the Right to Information Act.

“In future, the minutes will be placed on the RBI’s website within two weeks from the date of its confirmation at the next meeting of the Central Board and on being signed by the chairman in the same meeting,” the RBI said in a statement.

During the October meeting, the board discussed issues relating to financial markets, impact of the monsoons on the agricultural sector and prices, agricultural infrastructure as also the external sector.

The minutes said, “the specific case of PMC Bank [Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank] was also discussed.”

The central board does not discuss interest rates, which are set by the monetary policy committee. It’s objective is to provide a broader guidance to the central bank.

52,2020/01/20,"Vodafone Idea, Bharti move Supreme Court to modify AGR order","Telecom majors Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel moved the Supreme Court on Monday for modification of its October 24, 2019 order for payment of dues to the government within three months, saying the direction would have huge ramifications on the telecom industry and “severely hamper” programmes like Digital India, Make in India and Skill India.

The pleas come after a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice Arun Mishra, on January 16 dismissed petitions filed by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, among others, for a review of its October 2019 judgment, upholding the recovery of past dues amounting to ₹1.47 lakh crore from them. The recovery by the government was based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of about ₹92,000 crore.

Vodafone urged the court to alter its order and permit it to submit an application before the Department of Telecom (DoT) for drawing up a schedule for payment of the dues.

The review petitions were rejected by the Bench, also comprising Justices Abdul S. Nazeer and M.R. Shah, in their chambers.

Bharti said the exercise for calculating the amounts due, including past demands, are continuing and would require further interaction with the government as it covered licences across 22 circles and period of over 15 years. Besides, it said all the parties would take time to “reconcile” with the calculations.

“Payment of thousands of crores in due amounts without proper assessment and financial calculations and time for payment will not only cause irreparable damage to the appellants (telcos) but also to the telecom industry, leading to possible disruption of a public utility service owing to the bad financial position of the telecom companies,” they appealed.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/cex1e3/article30609445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBUTELECOM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vodafone-idea-bharti-move-sc-to-modify-agr-order/article30609446.ece

54,2020/01/20,No major BS-IV inventory pile-up: Leyland,"With 70 days remaining for the transition to BS-VI norms, commercial vehicles major Ashok Leyland does not see any alarming levels of inventory pile-up of BS-IV vehicles, according to its chief operating officer Anuj Kathuria.

Ashok Leyland, the flagship company of the Hinduja Group, announced the delivery of the first batch of BS-VI trucks for its customers in the Delhi-NCR region, aligning with BS-VI fuel availability in the country.

“We have delivered the ICV range of BS-VI compliant trucks, because it caters to local operations [within the region]. We will slowly start delivery of other product ranges like haulage, tipper and multi-axle,” Mr. Kathuria told reporters. He also said the company had invested about ₹500 crore for BS-VI transition, including creation of a new platform, based on which the vehicles will be launched. Mr. Kathuria also said he did not see any major challenge in terms of BS-VI fuel availability and it was going as per schedule.

Clarity in move to BS-VI

To a query on BS-IV stock, he said it was at a manageable level. “We are much better placed now unlike during the transition from BS-III to BS-IV, which was sudden and chaotic. In the case of BS-VI transition, there was clarity and we were aware about the timing,” Mr. Kathuria said.

While refusing to get into specific pricing details of the company’s BS-VI trucks, he hinted that prices would be higher than those prevalent during the BS-IV transition.

“When we migrated from BS-III to BS-IV, the prices increased by 5-8%. With BS-VI, we are implementing two norms in one [go] and so the prices would be much higher. Having said that, customers should look at the total cost of ownership rather than the cost of acquisition of vehicles. On that metric, ours would be the best in class,” Mr. Kathuria said.

On pre-buying of BS-IV trucks, he said that the experience had been different across segments. “In the multi-axle segment, the demand has not been great. In the ICV segment, the demand has been very good, mainly from the e-commerce segment, as it is not hit by the axle norms. Similarly, in the tipper segment, we are seeing some green shoots now due to demand from infrastructure segment and coal shipments. In the past eight months, the tipper segment has been hit by factors like elections and the monsoon. But that is getting resolved,” Mr. Kathuria said.

The company expects the M&HCV industry to close the fiscal (2019-20) with total sales of about 2 lakh units, a decline of nearly 46.23% compared with last year.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/79sg0e/article30609383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21THBULEYLAND,https://www.thehindu.com/business/no-major-bs-iv-inventory-pile-up-leyland/article30609384.ece
55,2020/01/20,Vassar College looks at contributing to Indian education system through liberal arts,"Vassar College, among the top liberal arts colleges of the United States, is looking at contributing to India’s education system which is being revamped to keep pace with modern day realities.

As the Union government is gearing up to unveil the New Education Policy, the draft of which has been out, with liberal arts courses in the curriculum, Vassar College has offered to help.

Top authorities of the college recently met leading Indian academics to set the tone to augment investments for introduction of liberal arts courses which are expensive to roll out.

“For the first time there is a statement from India that there will be liberal arts in higher education and we want to contribute,” said Elizabeth H. Bradley, president, Vassar College, U.S. in an interview.

“Being involved collectively will help both of us. We want to be a part of the global dialogue on how we need to educate to be creative and effective,” she added.

“We are a liberal arts college and we aspire to have a global perspective. So collaborating with India will help. We have so many students from India, so many alumni and we thought it would be appropriate to come here and contribute,” she said.

Vassar College, started in 1861 in Poughkeepsie, New York, has no tie ups with any Indian educational institutions so far but is now keen to explore possibilities.

“We are definitely thinking about affiliations, exchange programmes and dialogues that we could do together as India is at an inflexion point about liberal arts. This is time when we could work together on something concrete,” she said.

Now talks have been initiated with some leading educational institutions such as Ashoka University, Flame University, IITs, IIMs, Delhi University and Mumbai University, she added.

Liberal arts is an under graduate programme in which a student studies many topics. While 40% of the course is for the major subject, the rest 60% are in all other areas.

“The goal of liberal arts education is that you are generalist and you know how to learn. So as the world changes you have that many skills, vocabulary and tools to adopt and be able to act at times of need in future,” Ms Bradley said.

In many cases the liberal arts provides the best foundation. It is a wider programme of higher education that includes subjects like natural sciences (astronomy, biology, chemistry, physics), social sciences (anthropology, economics, geography, political science, sociology), creative arts (fine arts, theatre, speech, creative writing) and humanities (English literature, modern languages, history, philosophy).

While liberal arts originated in the U.S. and found a resurgence in continental Europe it is evolving in countries such as Singapore, Ghana and Rwanda.

While Vassar gets over 100 applications from Indian students every year, only less than a dozen students make it. It costs $70,000 a year to study in this college.

The study of liberal arts prepares young adults for the most essential aspects of their careers: networking across geographies and demographics, understanding various points of view and incorporating them in decisions, fast-tracking personal growth.

It doesn’t matter which discipline they study. These are essential skills for this fast-evolving world, preparing them for careers and life in general, Ms. Bradley said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/vassar-college-looks-at-contributing-to-indian-education-system-through-liberal-arts/article30609373.ece

58,2020/01/20,Indices slip into red after new intraday highs,"It was a volatile day at the stock market on Monday with the benchmark indices touching record highs during the morning session before profit booking led to the Sensex closing lower by nearly 1%, while the broader Nifty lost a little over 1%

On Monday, the 30-share Sensex gained 329 points in the morning session to touch a new intraday record high of 42,273.87. Profit booking, however, saw the barometer ending the day at 41,528.91, down 416.46, or 0.99%. The broader Nifty closed at 12,224.55, down 127.80 points or 1.03%. Earlier in the day, it touched a high of 12,430.50.

“Markets fell sharply today after touching new high in the early part of the session led by profit booking,” said Siddhartha Khemka, head, Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

“Poor quarterly results announced by some heavyweights like Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank, TCS and Kotak Bank dampened market sentiment. It was further hurt due to the 1% rise in oil prices on account of supply concerns,” he added.

59,2020/01/20,New Indian law to protect foreign investors to exclude tax demands,"New legislation will improve protection for foreign investors in India by offering relief from possible policy changes but will uphold the state's right to tax them, according to its draft and government documents seen by Reuters.

The Bill also attempts to upgrade India's investment climate and boost foreign investment by setting up new adjudicating authorities to swiftly resolve disputes. It is part of India's efforts to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024, from around $2.7 trillion currently, the documents said.

But the draft text of the new law dated November 15 does not cover demands related to enforcement of tax obligations, a critical area of concern for foreign investors.

Several firms including IBM, Royal Dutch Shell and Vodafone have collectively faced billions of dollars in tax claims from India's government in recent years, leading to arbitration cases and protracted legal battles in courts.

A separate internal government document which analyses the draft law noted that taxation issues were of “great interest” to investors and excluding it from the law's purview could reduce the proposal's intent to boost their comfort level.

Nevertheless, the document defended the exclusion, saying ”the power to tax is an integral part of the state's police powers even recognised in international law”.

The Finance Ministry, which drafted the law, did not respond to a request for comment.

Two sources familiar with deliberations on the law said it could still undergo several changes before it is finalised. The Bill is likely to be presented for passage in the upcoming Parliament session that starts on January 31, they said.

The Bill proposes to cover a wide range of foreign investors, including investments from sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance funds, the government document said.

Credible Commitment

One of the most high-profile tax disputes has been India's tussle with Vodafone, which was asked to deposit capital against tax after its $11 billion deal to buy local assets of Hutchison Whampoa in 2007.

Though India's Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that Vodafone was not liable to any tax, the government later amended the law to enable it to tax such deals retroactively. Vodafone and India remain locked in international arbitration over the dispute.

While the draft law proposes to exclude disputes specific to taxation, it offers to provide “credible commitment to investments” by deterring policy changes, the draft said.

In December 2018, months after Walmart paid $16 billion to acquire a majority of India's Flipkart, the government tweaked its foreign investment rules for e-commerce, forcing both Flipkart and Amazon to rework their business structures. The sudden policy change rattled foreign investors.

The draft law stipulates that any new policy or law changes that provide “less favourable” treatment should allow investors to continue enjoying benefits of the earlier policy.

“This clause will significantly improve predictability of investment regime and hence will be a significant boost to investments,” read the government document analysing the draft law. “The investor will have an option of choosing between the new and old policies.”

It was not immediately clear whether protection against such sudden policy changes would be permanent or only for a particular period.

The proposal also seeks to address concerns about the slowness of India's legal system. It proposes setting up two new bodies to provide swift legal recourse: an Investment Ombudsman who will rule on disputes within 90 days, and an appellate Investment Tribunal which would rule within 180 days.

“(This) will eradicate the demand for an international arbitration process as the remedy would be quick, effective and available domestically,” the government document stated.

60,2020/01/20,India ranks low at 76th place on global Social Mobility Index,"India has been ranked very low at 76th place out of 82 countries on a new Social Mobility Index compiled by the World Economic Forum, while Denmark has topped the charts.

The report, released ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the WEF, also lists India among the five countries that stand to gain the most from a better social mobility score that seeks to measure parameters necessary for creating societies where every person has the same opportunity to fulfil his potential in life irrespective of socioeconomic background.

Increasing social mobility, a key driver of income inequality, by 10% would benefit social cohesion and boost the world’s economies by nearly 5% by 2030, the WEF said.

But, few economies have the right conditions to foster social mobility.

Measuring countries across five key dimensions distributed over 10 pillars — health; education (access, quality and equity); technology; work (opportunities, wages, conditions); and protections and institutions (social protection and inclusive institutions) — shows that fair wages, social protection and lifelong learning are the biggest drags on social mobility globally.

In the case of India, it ranks 76th out of 82 economies. It ranks 41st in lifelong learning and 53rd in working conditions.

The Areas of improvement for India include social protection (76th) and fair wage distribution (79th).

The inaugural Social Mobility Report showed that across the Global Social Mobility Index, only a handful of nations across the 82 countries covered have put in place the right conditions to foster social mobility.

The top five are all Scandinavian, while the five economies with the most to gain from boosting social mobility are China, the United States, India, Japan and Germany.

“Creating societies where every person has the same opportunity to fulfil their potential in life irrespective of socioeconomic background would not only bring huge societal benefits in the form of reduced inequalities and healthier, more fulfilled lives, it would also boost economic growth by hundreds of billions of dollars a year,” the WEF said.

“The social and economic consequences of inequality are profound and far-reaching: a growing sense of unfairness, precarity, perceived loss of identity and dignity, weakening social fabric, eroding trust in institutions, disenchantment with political processes, and an erosion of the social contract. The response by business and government must include a concerted effort to create new pathways to socioeconomic mobility, ensuring everyone has fair opportunities for success, said Klaus Schwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the WEF.

The most socially mobile societies in the world, according to the report’s Global Social Mobility Index, are all European.

The Nordic nations hold the top five spots, led by Denmark in the first place (scoring 85 points), followed by Norway, Finland and Sweden (all above 83 points) and Iceland (82 points). Rounding out the top 10 are the Netherlands (6th), Switzerland (7th), Austria (8th), Belgium (9th) and Luxembourg (10th).

Among the G7 economies, Germany is the most socially mobile, ranking 11th with 78 points, followed by France in 12th position. Canada comes next (14th), followed by Japan (15th), the United Kingdom (21st), the United States (27th) and Italy (34th).

Among the world’s large emerging economies, the Russian Federation is the most socially mobile of the BRICS grouping, ranking 39th, with a score of 64 points. Next is China (45th), followed by Brazil (60th), India (76th) and South Africa (77th).

The report also examines which economies stand to gain the most from increases in social mobility. The economy with the most to gain is China, whose economy could grow by an extra USD 103 billion a year, or USD 1 trillion dollars over the decade.

The US is the economy that would make the second-largest gains, at USD 87 billion a year. Next is India, followed by Japan, Germany, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, the UK and France.

Most importantly though, the returns are intangible in the form of social cohesion, stability and enhanced opportunity for more people to fulfil their potential.

The report also makes a powerful case for stakeholder capitalism. The most socially mobile economies all share an emphasis on effective social policies that benefit communities as well as provide a platform for healthy, competitive economies. By comparison, economies that are organized more on shareholder value maximization , or state capitalism , tend to perform less well.

It calls for a new financing model for social mobility: Improving tax progressivity on personal income, policies that address wealth concentration and broadly rebalancing the sources of taxation can support the social mobility agenda.

Most importantly, however, the mix of public spending and policy incentives must change to put greater emphasis on the factors of social spending.

Improving social mobility must be the fundamental imperative of this new decade: As long as an individual’s chances in life remain disproportionately influenced by their socioeconomic status at birth, inequalities will never be reduced,” growth, the green transition, trade and geopolitics,” said Saadia Zahidi, Managing Director, New Economy and Society, WEF.

“In a globalized world where there is transparent information on the gulf between the ‘haves and the ‘have-nots’, we will continue to see discontent, with far-reaching consequences for economic,” she added.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hho159/article30607106.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DAVOS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-ranks-low-at-76th-place-on-global-social-mobility-index/article30607184.ece

62,2020/01/20,Samsung says may invest $500 million to set up display factory in India,"South Korean flat screen maker Samsung Display plans to set up a factory in India with a $500 million investment as parent Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd seeks to expand smartphone production there, a regulatory filing showed.

The move would be a boon for India which is vying with nearby rivals such as Vietnam to attract global smartphone firms under the government's “Make in India” drive.

Under the plan, Samsung Electronics will provide ₹35 billion ($492.31 million) in loans and transfer a parcel of land in Noida for ₹920 million to its display unit, Samsung India Electronics Private Ltd said in a filing dated Jan. 3.

Samsung Electronics started making smartphones in Noida on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi in 2018. Last year, it stopped production in China where it had to contend with competition from domestic rivals.

The new display factory will help Samsung Electronics secure local supplies of one of the most expensive smartphone components at a time when the South Korean firm is also struggling to fend off competition from Chinese rivals in India.

Samsung did not disclose further details when contacted by Reuters. Samsung India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Samsung, the second-biggest smartphone vendor in India after China's Xiaomi Corp, saw its market share fall to 20% in the country in the third quarter, from 25% three months earlier, showed data from researcher Counterpoint.

Those firms include 70 listed companies and over 160 are valued at more than $1 billion, according a speech made by Tencent President Martin Lau at a conference last week which the company posted on its social media account on Monday.

Tencent is known to have stakes in firms such as food delivery giant Meituan Dianping, e-commerce site Pinduoduo and video game companies such as Riot Games and Supercell.

But the company, worth $490 billion and the second-biggest company in Asia by market value after arch-rival Alibaba Group Holdings, rarely gives an overview or discloses details of its investment activities.

“Previously our traditional investment sectors were mostly focused on video games content and frontiers of science and technology,” Lau told a gathering of more than 500 Tencent-backed companies.

The event was held in New Delhi in the run-up to the first-ever three-day Global Investors’ Summit to be held in Srinagar and Jammu in April. The summit was to have been held last year, but was postponed.

Mr. Murmu said. “We grab the headlines for militancy and terrorism. These are not the headlines conducive to investment. However, the ground realities are quite different. First, after the abolition of Article 370, the duality in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir existed has vanished...”

“Externally sponsored militancy is well under control. There are a few isolated incidents, which are so rare that they can be classified as crime. Only 10% of the area is affected by militancy and law and order incidents. We are tackling those pockets and will ensure safety and security in a systematic manner,” he said. Some delegates questioned Mr. Murmu about the communication restrictions impacting trade. Chief Secretary B.V.R. Subrahmanyam responded that more relaxations were on the way.

On August 6, 2019, Parliament revoked the special status of the erstwhile State, which was bifurcated into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. The Valley and Jammu regions have been under an Internet clampdown for the past five months.

Mining reserve

K.K. Sharma, Adviser to the Lt. Governor, told The Hindu that Jammu and Kashmir had a huge mining reserve and it was one area that could be exploited for production. “J&K has reserves of limestone and gypsum that we can exploit for production. For that, we are revamping the policy; industrialists from J&K can participate. The land allotment policy will also be revised. The Internet has been suspended for a limited period, it will not be long time before it is restored,” he said.

Mr. Murmu said that in the past one-and-a-half years (since the President’s rule was imposed on the erstwhile State), a tremendous change had been brought about in governance and the “rule of law” had been established.

“Momentous decisions have been taken in the last six months, which have changed the constitutional order. The legal architecture and system prevailing in the rest of the country has been made applicable to Jammu and Kashmir, while securing the rights of citizens to assets and local employment opportunities,” he said. The incentive package extended by the Centre in December 2018 did not produce any “appreciable results.” Manufacturing was lagging, and the largest factory, Chenab Textiles, was set up over 50 years ago, he said.

Sathasivam, a retired Chief Justice of India, on Monday said normally the State government may as a form of “courtesy” apprise the Governor in advance before challenging an important legislation in court.

Speaking to The Hindu, Justice Sathasivam said the courtesy may be extended to the Governor as he was the constitutional head of the State. “In case of an important legislation, normally the State government may apprise the Governor as a form of courtesy,” Justice Sathasivam said.

He was speaking in the context of the recent controversy concerning the Kerala government’s move to challenge the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Kerala Governor Arif Khan has sought a report from the State government on why it chose to sue the Centre in the Supreme Court under Article 131 without first informing him.

But jurists say there is no constitutional requirement for a State to inform the Governor about its executive decision to file a case.

No convention

“There is no such constitutional convention. This is a suit the State has filed against the Centre. The Governor is the representative of the Union. Why should he be consulted before-hand? He cannot go beyond what the Ministry of Home Affairs anyway,” former Attorney- General K. Parasaran said.

Senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan said the Governor need not be consulted before filing an Article 131 suit just as he is not consulted for the thousands of cases that the State files every year.

The former Congress president tagged a news report on the latest inequality report, released by Oxfam ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) that attracts world’s top business leaders.

The Oxfam report claimed that India’s richest 1% hold more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up the bottom 70% of the country's population.

Nirbhaya’s mother also said the convicts were wasting the “court’s time”.

Their remarks came after the Supreme Court on Monday rejected the plea of Pawan Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the case, challenging a Delhi High Court order which had dismissed his claim of being a juvenile at the time of commission of the gruesome crime.

“It is a matter of happiness that the court has rejected his plea. But whenever a petition comes up in the court regarding our case, our heartbeat goes up. But in the end, we get positive news only,” Nirbhaya’s father told the PTI.

Claiming that the four convicts were using “delaying tactics” by filing pleas, he urged the apex court to frame guidelines to ensure that victims can get time-bound justice.

“The case has been heard thrice by the lower court, the Delhi High Court and the SC. The SC should use some special powers to set some time limit for filing applications. It is not about Nirbhaya but other daughters too. We request the court to frame guidelines so that Nirbhaya and other daughters get justice in a time-bound manner,” he said.

The four convicts – Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan Gupta (25) – were sentenced to death and a Delhi court had issued their death warrant early this month scheduling their execution for January 22.

However, their execution was postponed after one of them filed a mercy petition before the President.

A fresh death warrant was issued against them last Friday setting up their execution on February 1.

Pawan Gupta’s plea claiming he was a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence was filed after the second death warrant was issued.

Nirbhaya’s mother expressed hope that they will be hanged.

“They are wasting the time of the Court and are playing with [the] law. They are using ‘delaying tactics’. They should be hanged,” she said.

In a statement released to the media, students demanded an immediate rollback of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 (CAA). “This Act shakes the pluralistic foundations of India and tarnishes the principle of equality in the country,” the statement said.

‘Reject hatred’

“We believe that the CAA is a divisive law and the Act deliberately kept the Muslims out of the loop to send an Islamophobic message to the nation,” said Mohammed Ghayasuddin of the Faculty of Life Sciences and a Member of the AMU Court, the university’s governing body. “We reject the BJP’s (Bharatiya Janata Party) hate for Muslims and want the union government to roll back the CAA,” he said.

On the Prime Minister’s ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’ (‘discussion on examinations’) student interaction event, Mr. Ghyasuddin said no student had shied away from exams. “But the government of the day should provide a suitable atmosphere to study,” he said, and added, “The State did not consider us as students when we were protesting on December 15. Students were beaten up like hardened criminals and the police showered religious slurs on us.”

‘Waiting to discuss’

Ansab Aamir, a student of the engineering faculty, said the PM should also listen to those who did not agree with his views. “He took very obvious questions on Monday. Be it the women of Shaheen Bagh or the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and AMU, all are waiting to have a charcha with him,” he said.

Students further demanded the immediate closure of the National Population Register (NPR) exercise as it was the first step to a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). The statement described CAA-NRC-NPR as “anti-poor, anti-Dalit and anti-marginalised”.

Students demanded stern action against the police/ Rapid Action Force (RAF) for entering the AMU Campus on December 15, 2019 and using disproportionate force.

Resignations demanded

The immediate resignation of the AMU Vice-Chancellor, Registrar and Proctor was also sought for granting permission to the U.P. Police and RAF to enter campus, and for forcing students to leave the campus without the declaration of sine die.

Later in the day, the AMU administration released a new schedule of examinations, starting January 27. After his meeting with some protesting students last week, Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor has also formed a seven-member committee of teachers for further dialogue.

Mr. Aamir said they expected the authorities to wait for January 22, when the Supreme Court would take up petitions against the CAA. “We would take a call after discussions because there is a section of students that does not want to further boycott the examinations,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qbuk12/article30608371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200120-WA0039,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amu-students-boycott-classes/article30608372.ece
75,2020/01/20,J&K DGP supports establishment of deradicalisation centres,"Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh on Monday supported the Chief of Defence Staff chief General Bipin Rawat's idea to establish de-radicalisation centres in Kashmir. Meanwhile, three Hizbul Mujahideen militants were killed in encounter in south Kashmir.

""Pakistan was trying (to radicalise youth) in Kashmir. In fact, some youth do got radicalised. If any such (deradicalisation) facility comes up in Kashmir that will be a good sign, it should happen. It will definitely help people, especially who have gone astray,"" said DGP Singh in Srinagar.

The DGP made these remarks in response to a pointed question on General Rawat's recent remarks that ""deradicalisation camps in Kashmir was necessary to isolate people who are completely radicalised”.

DGP Singh said the security agencies in Kashmir have observed that the detained Kashmiri youth did not seem to be talking much sense during their conversations with officials. “So if any kind of arrangement having good people from the civil society and experts in this subject. besides religious people, is made, it would be good,” Mr. Singh said.

Three Hizb militants killed

The security forces killed three Hizbul Mujahideen militants during a cordon and search operation in Wachi area of Shopian.

""We neutralised three militants in the operation. Slain 'commander' Wasim Ahmad Wani was active since 2017 and was on the top position in the Hizb. He faced 19 FIRs and was involved in killing of four civilian and four cops,"" said DGP Singh.

The DGP said the Hizb ""is on the verge of being completely wiped out in south Kashmir"".

The police officer hinted that the recent clampdown on the Hizb in south Kashmir is an outcome of the arrest of Deputy Superintendent of Police Devender Singh and top Hizb 'commander' Syed Naveed Mushtaq alias Babu recently in south Kashmir.

DGP Singh also hinted that previous cases lodged against DySP Singh ""may be investigated"".

Meanwhile, the other two slain militants identified were policeman-turned-militant Adil Bashir and Hidayatullah Malik, both residents of Shopian. Bashir was involved in the loot of eight weapons from a legislator's house in Srinagar in 2018.

""Incriminating material including arms and ammunition were recovered from the site of encounter,"" the police said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fv4tjf/article30608057.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THDILBAGHSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jk-dgp-supports-establishment-of-deradicalisation-centres/article30608058.ece
76,2020/01/20,"Difficult to predict war scenario with Pakistan, says CDS Rawat","Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Bipin Rawat on Monday said it was very difficult to predict if a scenario of a war with Pakistan would emerge or not but all the defence services were prepared to take on any challenge.

The top general, who inducted the Sukhoi-30 MKI squadron here, was responding to a question about any possibility of a war emerging between India and Pakistan.

“All the defence services are tasked to be prepared for any option that may emerge. It is very difficult to predict a scenario. But, we are always prepared for any task that may be assigned to us,” Gen. Rawat said.

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) said his new role was aimed at integrating defence systems and the three services (the Army, the Navy and the Indian Air Force).

It was for this reason the post of CDS was created, he said.

”...we will keep moving towards better integration and jointness,” Gen. Rawat, who was appointed the country’s first Chief of Defence Staff on December 30 last year, added.

On strengthening the Air base here, Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria said it will undertake the role of the southern peninsula’s air defence.

The Indian Air Force commissioned a squadron of Sukhoi-30 MKI at the Air Force Station here, the first such base in south India for the high profile fighter jets, seen as a gamechanger in guarding the strategically important Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

The ‘Tigersharks’ squadron of Sukhoi 30 MKI jets integrated with the BrahMos cruise missiles was inducted in the presence of the Air Chief and top officials.

The Su-30 MKI is a state-of-the-art all weather multi-role fighter aircraft capable of undertaking varied air defence, ground attack and maritime missions.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oookok/article30607996.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THBIPINRAWAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/difficult-to-predict-war-scenario-with-pakistan-says-cds-rawat/article30607997.ece
77,2020/01/20,"Akhilesh Yadav pitches for caste Census; criticises NRC, NPR","Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav on Monday called the Centre’s plans on NPR and NRC anti-poor and pitched for conducting a caste census.

Mr. Yadav has made the suggestion in the past as well. His demand now comes days after the Odisha cabinet adopted a resolution seeking revelation of caste details in the next Census.

Referring to an earlier Census, he said,“We all wanted a caste Census but the Congress did not let that happen and the numbers did not come out.”

“The reason is that the day the caste Census takes place, the Hindu- Muslim conflict will come to an end,” he said without elaborating. He added that once this happens nobody will be upset with Yadav brothers .

Mr. Yadav was addressing party workers at an event here to welcome new members to the SP. They included leaders at the Block Panchayat level and those who had fought elections in the past.

Criticising the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, he claimed it had created a rift in that State.

Lakhs of people in Assam had found themselves excluded from the NRC at the end of the exercise intended to weed out illegal migrants.

The SP chief claimed that the NRC and the recently enacted Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) are anti-poor .

In an apparent reference to the recent criticism of the NRC and the National Population Register (NPR), he said the poor will find it difficult to get their date of birth certificates.

“Earlier there were no calendars and the birthdays of most people in villages were based on festivals,” he said.

He compared this to the inconvenience people went through when the Narendra Modi government demonetised high-value currency notes.

“The BJP created a rift between the rich and poor through demonetisation. All of us stood in queues. Tell me how many farmers benefitted. And the dream that corruption and terrorism will be eradicated, what happened to it?” he said.

Hitting out at the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, the former Chief Minister claimed that the State has now become number one in cybercrime, crimes against women and children, bad quality mid-day meals, fake encounters, unemployment and farmer suicides.

He claimed that the laptops given by the previous SP government to meritorious children are still working, while the toilets provided by the BJP government have stopped functioning.

“The farmers were promised that their incomes will double, and they voted the BJP to power in the State and at the Centre. But what have poor people and the farmers got in return?” he asked.

He also accused the BJP of “stealing” the SP principle of taking everyone along, referring to the Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas slogan.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fvyixm/article30607500.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THAKHILESHYADAV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/akhilesh-yadav-pitches-for-caste-census-criticises-nrc-npr/article30607501.ece

79,2020/01/20,"Who is JP Nadda, the new BJP national president?","For J.P. Nadda, 59, being elected the eleventh president of the BJP tops off a steady rise that began with student politics with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) the student wing of the RSS, to State politics in Himachal Pradesh and finally, from 2010, an important stint in national politics.

Also Read J.P. Nadda elected unopposed as BJP president

Born to Krishna and Narain Lall Nadda, on December 2, 1960, he did his early schooling from St Xavier’s Patna as well as getting his graduation degree from Patna College, Patna University. He got involved with the ABVP while in Patna and continued this association with the organisation when he and his family moved back to their native Himachal Pradesh after the senior Mr. Nadda retired from Patna University.

Here, Mr. Nadda enrolled for a law degree from Himachal Pradesh University, Shimla, and remained active in student politics, becoming the first ever ABVP nominated president of the student’s union there.

His organisational skills were recognised and he moved from State to a more centrally back organisational role as organisational general secretary for the ABVP in Delhi between 1985-89. These were heady days for not just student movements but also for the BJP which was coming out of a bad performance in the Lok Sabha polls of 1985 to raising the pitch for the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in Ayodhya. Mr. Nadda’s stint in Delhi helped him fight his first Assembly polls in 1993, in all he has won three Assembly polls and has been minister twice in the Himachal government.

It was however in 2010, when Union Minister Nitin Gadkari was party president that he got his big break in the organisation. Mr. Gadkari, a contemporary of Mr. Nadda, gave his old friend a break when he put together his team as president, making him first national general secretary and later getting him elected to the Rajya Sabha in 2012.

He was made a minister in the first Modi government but returned to organisational work in the second run of the government. His role as the election in-charge for Uttar Pradesh for the 2019 polls was much appreciated and he managed to hammer out a valued, trust worthy space for himself in the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah equation soon. This resulted in him being made BJP’s first working president ever in June 2019, the understanding being that he would be made president once Mr Shah’s tenure ends, as it did in January 2020.

For Mr. Nadda, not only is the role of the third wheel in the Modi-Shah equation going to be a tightrope walk, but it will also be tough to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Mr. Shah, whose control over the party organisation and meticulous electoral planning have acquired legendary proportions. The fact that he faces two tough polls immediately after taking over, in Delhi and Bihar, is significant. The BJP hopes his smooth rise to the top post in the party may be a harbinger of as smooth a tenure there.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/iugbvy/article30607087.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PTI1122020000106ATHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/who-is-jp-nadda-the-new-bjp-national-president/article30607088.ece
80,2020/01/20,Supreme Court throws out Nirbhaya gang rape convict’s plea,"The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a plea of Nirbhaya gang rape convict Pawan Kumar Gupta against the Delhi High Court's rejection of his claim that he was a juvenile at the time of the crime in 2012.

A three-judge Bench led by Justice R. Banumathi said that though the plea of juvenility could be made by an accused at any stage of the case, it cannot be reagitated time and again once successive courts have rejected the claim.

During the two-hour long hearing that continued through the lunch break, advocate A.P. Singh, for Gupta, said there was a “big conspiracy” afoot to conceal his client's real age.

Reading out the order in open court, Justice Banumathi, for the Bench also comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan and A.S. Bopanna, said the claim of juvenility and materials produced were considered and decided unfavourably to Gupta by the magistrate in 2013 and later on by the Delhi High Court and finally the Supreme Court in July 2018 in review.

“Your issue that Pawan Gupta is a juvenile was argued and decided against you in the review on July 9 by the Supreme Court. This issue was heard and dismissed on the same material. Can this be repeatedly agitated, this will be never-ending...” Justice Bhushan addressed Mr. Singh.

“The magistrate had considered your juvenility plea and rejected it in 2013. The High Court also rejected. The Supreme Court rejected in review. How many times, Sir... How many times, Sir, will you raise this plea?” Justice Banumathi remarked.

The special leave petition filed against the December 19 dismissal came after a five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice N.V. Ramana last week rejected the curative petitions of two other Nirbhaya death row convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh.

The President has also rejected the mercy plea of Mukesh.

The Supreme Court recently dismissed a review petition filed by another one of the four condemned men, Akshay Singh, to review its May 5, 2017 judgment confirming the death penalty in the case.

Akshay, Mukesh, Pawan and Vinay had brutally gangraped a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012. She died of her injuries a few days later.

The second Budget of the Modi 2.0 government will be presented on February 1.

Finance Secretary Rajeev Kumar, Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty, DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey, and Expenditure Secretary T.V. Somanathan too attended the customary pre-Budget event.

“To maintain the secrecy of Budget, there is a ‘lock-in’ of the officials involved in making the Budget. Budget Press, situated inside North Block, houses all officials in the period leading up to the presentation of the Union Budget,” the finance ministry said in a statement.

These officers and staff will come in contact with their near and dear ones only after the Budget is presented in Parliament, it said.

Later, the Finance Minister took a round of the press and acquainted herself about the Budget printing process.

As part of the ritual, ‘halwa’ is prepared in a big ‘kadhai’ (large frying pot) and served to the entire staff in the ministry.

The significance of the event is that after the sweet dish is served, a large number of officials and support staff, who are directly associated with the Budget making and printing process, are required to stay in the ministry and remain cut off from their families till the presentation of the Budget in the Lok Sabha.

They are not even allowed to contact their near and dear ones through phone or any other form of communication, like e-mail.

Arguments on the quantum of sentence will be heard on January 28.

Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha convicted Thakur for aggravated sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, gang rape, rape and other related offences under the Indian Penal Code and the Juvenile Justice Act.

Vicky, one of the accused, has been acquitted.

The court had postponed the verdict and sought a response from the CBI, following allegations by the accused that the testimonies of the victims were not trustworthy.

The case pertains to the allegation that at least 34 girl inmates of the shelter home were sexually assaulted. The CBI took over the probe in 2018 following a Supreme Court directive. It recorded statements of the victims and also made several arrests, including that of Thakur.

It was alleged that Thakur would bring in people for sexually assaulting the inmates. Some of them were also taken to hotels where they were raped.

After the CBI filed a charge sheet, the court framed charges against the accused persons on March 30, 2019. They were tried for a range of offences, including gang rape, sexual assault and harassment, cruelty to child under the authority of shelter-home functionaries and Social Welfare department officials, and administering drugs to the victims.

The shelter home was run by NGO “Sewa Sankalp Evam Vikas Samiti”.

Also read: Who is JP Nadda, the new BJP national president?

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was at the party headquarters to felicitate Mr. Nadda on his election, called him an “outstanding karyakarta” (party worker). He said the event reflected the party’s long time policy of promoting workers vertically while expanding the party horizontally across the country. “That is the reason why generation after generation we have leaders to take the party forward.”

‘Opposition spreading untruths’

Mr. Modi also took the occasion to make a few points on his government’s policies, and without naming the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), alluded to the Opposition “misinformation campaign” against it.

“There are people who dislike the principles which guide us. Our problems are not because we are doing something wrong, it is because the people are blessing us. Those rejected in the polls have very few weapons in their arsenals, one of which is to spread falsehood. They repeatedly spread lies and conspiracy and spread it through their ecosystem. At such a a time, BJP workers have to know that they are unlikely to get any help from ‘madhyams’ [media] and nor are we used to it. We have been growing because of direct conversation with the people and that is our strength, and that is what we must do,” he said.

Mr. Modi was also fulsome in his praise for outgoing party chief and Home Minister Amit Shah who, he said, not only expanded the party’s base exponentially in his tenure but also managed to tread the thin line between the party and the government. “It is very easy for a ruling party to cross lines, and it is to Amit Shah’s credit that all the ‘maryadas’ [decencies] of the separation of party and government were maintained.”

Earlier in the day, Mr. Nadda was declared elected unopposed by former Union Minister Radha Mohan Singh, who was in charge of the polls. Three former party presidents – Mr. Shah, Ministers Rajnath Singh and Nitin Gadkari, filed nominations on behalf of Mr. Nadda, as did the State unit presidents. His election was a foregone conclusion since June, 2019, when he became the first working president of the party, with Mr. Shah having joined the Cabinet in May.

Mr. Nadda was escorted to the party president’s office, where he assumed his seat. “It is only in the BJP that somebody like me without a political background can rise to this position, it is a party that respects its ‘karyakartas’,” he said.

At the felicitation ceremony in the evening, Mr. Shah said Mr. Nadda’s organisational skills and his rise from a ‘karyakarta’ to party chief was an example of a policy continuity in the BJP.

A challenging year ahead

Mr. Nadda, who has been a member of the Union Cabinet as Health Minister in the first Modi government as well as Minister and Leader of the Opposition in the Himachal Assembly, will have a challenging year ahead of him, with the coming Delhi and Bihar Assembly polls. The more challenging part of his tenure would be maintaining the successful innings of his predecessor. Mr. Shah is considered the most successful BJP chief till date with more than 14 Assembly victories since he took over in July 2014 and the thumping victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Considered a soft-spoken and affable consensus builder, Mr. Nadda will be expected to exercise a tight rein on the party organisation and revive its prospects in the States where it has lost the polls, especially in the Hindi-belt States like Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chattisgarh and also in big States like Maharashtra.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l1g75f/article30606394.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JPNADDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jp-nadda-elected-unopposed-as-bjp-president/article30606680.ece

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman issued the notice on the petition, which said welfare schemes cannot be based on religion. The plea, filed by Neeraj Shankar Saxena and five others, claimed that Hindus were discriminated against on the ground of religion, as schemes worth ₹4700 crore were initiated in favour of only some religious minorities.

“The government and Parliament cannot promote minoritism and cannot show inclination towards them and allure them to flourish by initiating beneficial programs for them. Such an action will be detrimental for the sovereignty and integrity of India and give rise to separatists and may create a situation for another division of the nation,” the petition said.

It also challenged the validity of the establishment of the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) .

“The Parliament cannot make any law for the benefit of any religion maybe, for minority religious groups. Special benefit and advantage within the sweep of Article 15(4) can be provided only to those communities who are found ‘socially and educationally backward’ classes of citizens by a Commission established under Article 340 of the Constitution of India.

A bench headed by Justice R Banumathi is hearing the plea of convict Pawan Kumar Gupta.

Gupta’s counsel told the bench that the convict was minor at the time of commission of offence in December 2012 and the High Court had wrongly dismissed the plea.

The bench said the claim of being a juvenile was not taken initially during trial in the Nirbhaya case. However, Gupta’s lawyer contended that it was taken as a ‘mitigating circumstance’ at the time of sentencing in the case.

Gupta had moved the apex court on January 17. He has also sought a direction restraining the authorities from executing the death penalty, scheduled for February 1.

87,2020/01/20,Supreme Court seeks Centre’s response on plea challenging NIA Act,"The Supreme Court on Monday asked the government’s response on a petition challenging the National Investigation Agency (Amendment) Act of 2019, saying the law concentrated police powers in one centralised agency which would act on the “whims and fancies” of the Central government.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman issued notice to the government on a writ petition filed by Umar M., secretary of the Solidarity Youth Movement based at Kozhikode in Kerala.

The petition, represented by advocates Jaimon Andrews and Naresh Kumar, said the phraseology of the Amendment Act was suspect. In one of its Sections, the Amendment Act brought within its ambit acts committed “against the interest of India’ without clearly explaining what these actions would be.

“So, can it be that sloganeering against a Central law would be ‘against the interest of India’ under the Act?” Mr. Andrews asked.

“Legislations aimed at countering terrorism, often employ specific phrases such as ‘national security’, ‘national integrity’, ‘sovereignty’, so as erase any scope for arbitrary exercise of powers by the enforcement agencies. In the instant case, no attempt has been made to provide for a structured definition of the term, in the absence of which, the same would be open to enlarged interpretation, thus arbitrary and violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution,” the petition contended.

Additional offences

The Amendment Act, the petition said, had introduced additional offences such as human trafficking which were at odds with NIA’s fundamental objective to counter terrorism.

With this Act, the NIA could encroach into the jurisdiction of the States’ police forces to investigate crimes within their jurisdiction. “This is wholly in contravention of the principles of co-operative federalism,” the petition said.

The Amendment Act did away with the prosecution’s law in registration and probe of offences.

Section 6(8) of the Act confers the Centre with powers to direct the NIA to register a case and probe anything which occurred outside the country, which in the government’s opinion, formed a scheduled offence.

88,2020/01/20,"Students can speak to me openly, says PM Modi during ‘Pariksha Pe Charcha’","At a time when young people across the country are fighting for the rights of citizens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the duties of citizens during an interaction with high school students on Monday. ""Our rights are directly dependent on the duties performed by others,"" he said, using the example of students, whose rights cannot be guaranteed unless teachers carry out their duties.

In the recent agitation against attacks on students and teachers at Jawaharlal Nehru University, a section of faculty have vowed an academic boycott, refusing to teach classes as a form of protest.

The Prime Minister was answering questions during the third edition of Pariksha Pe Charcha, an annual event organised by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on the issue of examination stress. About 2.6 lakh students from Class 9 to Class 12 participated in an essay competition, out of which 2,000 were selected to attend the event in Delhi.

In response to questions on the rights and duties of citizens by students from Arunachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the Prime Minister said that there's a connection between rights and duties, invoking Mahatma Gandhi’s words on the importance of fundamental duties enshrined in the constitution.

He pointed out that today's high-schoolers are likely to be leaders of the country by 2047, 100 years after independence. ""If you get a broken and dilapidated country when you become a leader, would you be able to lead well?"" he asked.

Mr. Modi encouraged students to learn their own mother tongues, English, Hindi and other regional languages as a way to celebrate the unity and diversity of the country. He exhorted them to buy products made in India, and go on holidays to Indian, rather than foreign locations. Small steps, such as cleanliness, saving electricity and water, buying tickets for train travel are all important ways to carry out their duties as citizens, he said.

While the PM introduced the 90-minute interaction as a “hashtag without filter” conversation, it was clear that the students’ questions were pre-planned and well practiced. Mr. Modi referenced the Chandrayaan moon landing and cricket matches as examples of his motivational mantra that failure was only a step to success. He also encouraged students to participate in extra-curricular activities apart from academics, so that they would not end up as “robots”, he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q1yxqi/article30605816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/speak-to-me-hashtag-without-filter-pm-to-students-during-pariksha-pe-charcha/article30605817.ece
89,2020/01/20,Won’t stay electoral bonds scheme even now: CJI,"Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde on Monday orally made it clear that if the Supreme Court had found it unnecessary to stay the electoral bonds scheme (EBS), it may not stay the scheme even now.

The comments came on a fervent plea by advocates Prashant Bhushan and Shadan Farasat that new facts had come up indicating that the scheme was being frequently opened to allow funds to fill the coffers of the ruling party.

Mr. Bhushan said the scheme would be opened again now with the Delhi elections scheduled on February 8. Instead of opening the scheme exclusively for the Lok Sabha elections, as envisaged, it had become a mechanism to funnel benami funds to fuel political parties. Both the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had strongly objected to the scheme and raised the red flag against it.

Mr. Farasat said that over ₹6,000 crore had been drawn in through the scheme recently. They sought a stay of the scheme.

On April 12 last, the Supreme Court passed an interim order directing political parties to provide complete information to the ECI in sealed covers on every single donor and contribution received by them till date through electoral bonds. However, it did not stay the operation of the scheme.

“If the matter has been argued for stay and it was not granted, we will also not grant it,” the CJI said.

Mr. Bhushan reiterated that the court should consider the scheme with a new eye as many novel and disturbing facts had come to the fore since April 12.

The court initially gave four weeks to the ECI to file a reply to the plea for a stay on the scheme. However, Mr. Bhushan argued that it would be too late by then as Delhi elections were due on February 8. The court then asked the ECI to file its reply in a fortnight.

Also read | Explained: What is an electoral bond and how do we get one?

Directive to political parties

The April 12 interim order was meant to ensure that the balance was not tilted in anybody’s favour before the May last general elections. The court then ordered political parties to forthwith provide the ECI with “detailed particulars of the donors as against the each bond; the amount of each such bond and the full particulars of the credit received against each bond, namely, the particulars of the bank account to which the amount has been credited and the date of each such credit”.

Mr. Bhushan, representing petitioner NGO Association of Democratic Reforms, argued that 95% of the payments through electoral bonds till date had been routed to the BJP. The ECI submitted that a lion’s share of the contributions via electoral bonds had gone to the ruling party.

Also read | The opacity around electoral bonds

The government has justified the scheme as an experiment to eradicate black money. It claimed that the impact of the EBS would be known only after the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It should meanwhile be allowed a free hand to execute its policy and the apex court should not pass any orders in the matter for the present.

The government’s position is in stark contrast to the ECI’s stand. The ECI has expressed reservations about the transparency in political funding. It submitted to the apex court that electoral bonds legalised anonymity of political donors and the parties receiving contributions. It maintained that the right to vote also meant the right to make an informed choice. It said that knowing the candidate was only “half the exercise”. The voters should also know the source of funding of political parties who prop up these candidates.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/y3fqkg/article30609938.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-electoral-bonds-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-declines-stay-on-electoral-bonds-scheme/article30605530.ece

91,2020/01/20,NRI businessman Thampi arrested in connection with London property,"NRI businessman C.C. Thampi has been arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with a London property that was earlier bought by defence dealer Sanjay Bhandari. The accused is currently in the agency's custody.

It is alleged that Sky Lite Investment FZE, a Dubai-based company through which the property was acquired, was controlled by Mr. Thampi.

Mr. Bhandari's company, Santech International FZC, had bought the house for 1.9 million pounds in 2009 by acquiring 100% shares of British Virgin Islands’ firm Vortex Management Holdings. It was transferred to Sky Lite in June 2010 at the same price, according to the ED.

The name of Sky Lite, which was incorporated in April 2009, was later changed to Mayfair Investment FZE. Mr. Thampi then handed it over to his nephew allegedly without any monetary consideration.

The Income Tax Department conducted searches against Mr. Bhandari in April 2016, following which a case under the Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act was instituted. Investigation revealed that his company had received about $5 million in June 2008.

Soon after the searches, Mayfair Investment was allegedly sold to a United Arab Emirates national.

Robert Vadra statement recorded

Last year, the ED recorded the statement of Robert Vadra, husband of Congress general secretary Priyanka Vadra, in connection with multiple London properties. He has denied any links with Mr. Bhandari, who is on the run and is suspected to be currently in the United Kingdom.

Mr. Thampi of the Holiday Group had come under the scanner in another case for alleged wrongful approval by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) to an engineering college at Kerala’s Thrissur in 2009.

The ED had also served a show-cause notice on him for alleged foreign exchange violation involving ₹288 crore.

As alleged, Mr. Thampi had advanced unsecured loans to his three companies, which were later converted into equity in his name and in the name of his family members in these companies. The funds were used to buy agricultural land in Haryana’s Palwal and Gautam Buddha Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, through the companies.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/va8c26/article30606825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Thampi-,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-arrests-nri-businessman-thampi-over-london-property-deal/article30605284.ece

In Lucknow and Prayagraj, protesters, a majority of them women, against the CAA and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens, have accused the police of non-cooperation and hostility.

At a rally in support of the CAA in Gorakhpur on Sunday, Mr. Adityanath used the allegory of the disrobing of Draupadi in Mahabharata, to blame the Opposition of trying to “malign” the country’s image globally.

94,2020/01/20,"PF benefits should be extended to contractual employees, rules Supreme Court","The benefits of the provident fund should be extended to contractual employees, the Supreme Court has held in a recent judgment.

A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Indu Malhotra has held that employees who draw wages or salaries directly or indirectly from a company are entitled to provident fund benefits under the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) Act.

The judgment came on the basis of a petition filed by M/s Pawan Hans Limited, a government company which provides helicopter support services to the oil sector for its offshore exploration operations, services in remote and hilly areas, and charter services for the promotion of tourism.

Company Vs. union

The company had filed the petition against its employees’ union, the Aviation Karmachari Sanghatana, which sought uniformity in service conditions among employees.

Of a total workforce of 840 employees, the company had engaged 570 employees on regular basis, while 270 employees were engaged on “contractual” basis.

The company implemented the PF Trust Regulations only with respect to the regular employees, even though the term “employee” had been defined to include “any person” employed “directly or indirectly” under the PF Trust Regulations.

The contractual employees have been seeking parity with the regular employees, who are covered under the Pawan Hans Employees Provident Fund Trust Regulations.

‘Uniform service conditions’

“We find that the members of the union, and all other similarly situated contractual employees, are entitled to the benefit of provident fund under the PF Trust Regulations or the EPF Act. Since the PF Trust Regulations are in force and are applicable to all employees of the company, it would be preferable to direct that the members of the union and other similarly situated contractual employees are granted the benefit of provident fund under the PF Trust Regulations so that there is uniformity in the service conditions of all the employees of the Company, "" Justice Malhotra, who wrote the judgment, ordered.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yvjz3j/article26609999.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/EPFOBUILDINGATBANDRAMUMBAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pf-benefits-should-be-extended-to-contractual-employees-rules-supreme-court/article30601030.ece
95,2020/01/20,146 Irrawaddy dolphins sighted in Odisha's Chilika,"Odisha Forest Department officials, wildlife experts and researchers on Sunday sighted 146 endangered Irrawaddy dolphins in Chilika Lake, which boasts of the highest single lagoon population of the aquatic mammal in the world.

The dolphin census was simultaneously taken up in Chilika and off Odisha coast. The Chilika Development Authority (CDA) is elated that the direct sighting of 146 dolphins meant that its population in the lake would stabilise well above 150. According to last year’s census, the Irrawaddy dolphin population in Chilika was 151.

‘Direct sighting’

“The direct sighting of 146 dolphins only corroborates the estimate of the CDA, which does counting of dolphins round the year using hydrophones. Our estimated population range is 133-172,” said Susanta Nanda, Chief Executive Officer, CDA.

His confidence stemmed from the fact that dolphins were colonising new areas, which had been freed from encroachments by prawn farming gherries.

“We have noticed dolphin movements in new areas in the central and southern sectors, more specifically in the areas near Kalijai and Rambha. These areas were made free from encroachments,” said Mr. Nanda.

He expressed hopes that that the population is likely to increase in the next couple of years as there are enough signs of dolphins migrating from the Satpada side to other areas.

Hydrophone monitoring

According to hydrophone monitoring carried out round the year in Chilika, the highest number of Irrawaddy dolphins (20-25) was moving around Rajhans, followed by the Magarmukh and Malatikuda areas, where dolphins numbering between 17-20 were expected.

The total population of these aquatic mammals in the world is estimated to be less than 7,500. Of these, more than 6,000 Irrawaddy dolphins have been reported from Bangladesh, while the dolphin distribution in Chilika is considered to be the highest single lagoon population.

The wildlife wing of the State Forest and Environment Department would provide a more precise number of the adult and calf population of Irrawaddy dolphins after detailed analysis.

According to the CDA, the water-spread area of Chilika varies between 1,165 to 900 sq. km. during the monsoon and summer respectively, making it the largest brackish water lake in the country.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9x11q2/article30600862.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dolphin-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/146-irrawaddy-dolphins-sighted-in-chilika/article30600863.ece

The exercise will give the government a picture of who owns what kind of drone in which part of the country and will help in making policy decisions that should ideally become the base for understanding the scale of operations.

One-time opportunity

The Ministry issued a notice providing a one-time opportunity for voluntary disclosure of all drones and operators starting from January 14.

While the DGCA issued the Civil Aviation Requirements (CAR), Section 3 - Air Transport Series X, Part I, Issue I, dated August 27, 2018 which regulates use of drones and provides the process for obtaining Unique Identification Number, Unmanned Aircraft Operator Permit (UAOP) and other operational requirements, there are drones that do not comply with the CAR.

Along with registrations, officials said a larger number of queries and suggestions had landed at the drone cell. “While no proof of purchase is being sought, all registrations after February 1 will have to be accompanied by an invoice.”

January 31 deadline

As the census led to confusion and myths making the rounds, the Drone Federation of India — a non-government, not-for-profit, industry-led body working in the unmanned aviation space — issued a fresh set of FAQs on Sunday. An official said there was a myth that enlisting of a drone would lead to its confiscation.

“In reality, if a drone is not enlisted by 5 p.m. on January 31, then it will most definitely be confiscated. Plus there would be other consequences as per law,” the official said.

Ms Roper, who was in India last week to attend the government’s Raisina Dialogue, met officials of the Ministry of Women and Child Development to discuss possible India-U.K. collaboration on gender equality issues. She also interacted with school and college students and British businesses operating in India, with whom she held talks on tackling sexual harassment in the garment sector.

Long term impact

Advocating a greater role for women in conflict resolution to ensure sustained peace, Ms. Roper told The Hindu, “Supporting women and girls’ meaningful mobilisation and participation in political life, mediation, conflict prevention, peace-building and in post-conflict processes to rebuild their countries and communities, is essential to building lasting peace and stability.”

“The U.K. will pursue diplomatic policies at multilateral and bilateral level to influence and transform the political environment in fragile and conflict-affected states to enable and encourage the participation of women in decision-making and support initiatives to enable women to play leadership roles,” the U.K.’s first Special Envoy for Gender Equality added.

“Women account for a mere 2% of mediators, 8% negotiators and 5% witnesses to peace processes.

They demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should settle the community living as “refugees in their own country” for the past 30 years at one place in the Valley.

Also Read Nearly three decades after leaving Kashmir, a Pandit reflects on being and belonging

In the backdrop of Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s film Shikara on exodus of Kashmiri pandits, to be released in February, several Kashmiri pandits have taken to social media to express their love and willingness to return to their homeland in the Valley to “live and die” there.

“Haji Sahib, we will come back. We will live and die in Kashmir. Our ashes will be immersed in river Vitasta in Kashmir,” is one such video clipping among many similar ones doing the rounds on social media.

Kashmiri pandits consider ‘safety and security’ as the biggest hurdle in their return to their roots in the Valley.

The displaced Kashmiri pandits across the world commemorated January 19 as ‘holocaust day’, when over 70 thousand pandit families numbering over 3.5 lakh were forced out of the Valley due to killings and terror by Pakistan sponsored terrorists in 1990.

The event this year was held against the backdrop of abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and the Citizenship Amendment Act.

“We are hopeful that after the epochal decisions on August 5 and amendments in Citizenship Act, Union government under the visionary leadership of PM Narendra Modi will address the pain and agony suffered by Hindus of Kashmir for last 30 years”, Panun Kashmir convener Agnishakher said.

He said while Panun Kashmir bats for separate territory to be carved out in Kashmir for 7 lakh Kashmiri pandits, it is for government to discuss with the community the ways and means of the basis of return and rehabilitation of exiled community in accordance with the principle of non-refoulement.

Sitting in one-room quartet at Jagti camp on the outskirts of Jammu city, 89-year-old Mohan Lal Dhar wants one place settlement for all Kashmiri pandits in Kashmir.

He is hopeful that the government under PM Modi will rehabilitate them in Kashmir again.

Dhar, who is among the seven lakh-odd Kashmiri Pandits who had to flee Kashmir Valley in the wake of spread of terrorism in 1989-90, says they are living as “refugees in their own country” for three decades but nothing is being done for their return and rehabilitation, because terrorism is still on.

Somawati, who living Muthi camp after their migration from North Kashmir’s Wadipora belt, wants to return to the valley to die there as she urges Modi ji to create condition at one place in valley.

“I want to die there. That is my last wish. Modi ji should settle us at one place in a secured environment. We are hopeful that our dream will be fulfilled”, she added.

'One place-settlement'

Spelling there demand, All State Kashmiri Pandit Conference (ASKPC) General Secretary Dr T K Bhat said tmost Kashmiri pandits feel that “one place-settlement” is only alternative for return and rehabilitation of the minuscule community in Kashmir after ensuring their safety and security.

“Our core concern is safety and security for the community in Kashmir Valley,” Mr. Bhat said.

Stressing on the security aspect, Bhat said, “You can guard our houses, colonies...but it is not possible to provide security to each and every Kashmiri Pandit when they go out in the market. Security is the most important aspect connected to the return of the community.”

The UPA-1 government had offered a rehabilitation package for KPs that proposed Rs 7.5 lakh to every Kashmiri Pandit family willing to return to the Valley.

Several families volunteered to return and filled up the forms. Eight years after that, there has been no progress,” said Poshker Nath, who has been living Roopnagar in Jammu.

The Ministry of Home Affairs had in a written reply in Parliament said that only one family has returned.

Prof B.L.Zutshi, a prominent social activist said, “one place homeland is the political empowerment of the community, and we look forward to this political empowerment.

He said, right since 1947, Kashmir was gradually moving into grip of fanaticism and theo-fascism and 1990 saw the culmination of a well orchestrated ploy to dislodge Kashmir Pandits — the epitome of Indian Nationhood in Kashmir.

Bihari Kak, a popular artist and member of Athwas Cultural Association also feels that the security of the community is prime and first thing for return to the valley.

The Kashmiri pandits say their return to the Kashmir Valley is linked to employment, as the youths willing to return need to have a source of livelihood.

“The proposal to rehabilitate the community in composite townships in the Valley was mooted by the Narendra Modi government, which faced opposition not only from separatists but also the mainstream political parties in Kashmir.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sakfce/article30602178.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THAVDPANDITS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/30-years-in-exile-kashmiri-pandits-demand-one-place-for-their-settlement-in-kashmir/article30602179.ece

Inaugurating the session on the premises of Isuzu Motors plant at Sri City, Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories M.V. Siva Kumar Reddy asked the managements of hazardous factories to remain cautious round the clock and be prepared for emergency situations by maintaining constant surveillance on the risk areas.

“In spite of the best steps taken towards industrial safety, it is unfortunate that sometimes disasters do break out, leading to loss of human lives and property as well. By adhering to the modules of emergency preparedness, such untoward mishaps could not only be tackled, but also prevented beforehand,” he said.

The official said that the technical crew should regularly undertake inspections of the risky zones in the factories and nip the problems in the bud by immediately replacing the overused infrastructure and equipment.

Extra precautions should be in place in industrial zones with dangerous working conditions, he added.

‘Safety kits must’

The team of experts from Chennai, including those from Indian Oil Corporation Limited(IOCL), presented demos on various risks faced by the hazardous industries.

The IOCL Unit head, Gurumurthy explaining to the participants the different hazards to be fought in industrial safety aspects, said that the workers could prevent them at the initial stages by adhering to preliminary safety norms by maintaining the safety kits.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/qevcm4/article30609526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VJPAGEHAZARDOUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/be-prepared-to-tackle-emergency-situations-factory-managements-told/article30609527.ece

105,2020/01/20,Jagan Mohan Reddy agrees to order probe into ‘insider trading’ in Amaravati,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy informed the Legislative Assembly that he would order a comprehensive investigation into the alleged insider trading of lands in Amaravati as directed by Speaker Thammineni Seetharam amidst heated arguments between the latter and former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu over the powers of the Speaker to seek a probe in the matter.

Following Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy’s statement on Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the Assembly was a quasi-judicial body which vested powers with the Speaker as ‘a judge’ to instruct the government on major issues such as the dubious purchase of 4,070 acres in a span of six months before Amaravati was declared as the capital.

‘Benami deals’

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said Mr. Chandrababu Naidu had first said that the capital would be set up at Guntur and then Nuzvid and announced Amaravati as the capital after lands were bought by the TDP leaders in the names of their near and dear ones and fictitious persons and entities.

He alleged that Mr. Chandrababu Naidu himself purchased 14.22 acres in Kanteru mandal in Guntur district in the name of Heritage Foods and other TDP leaders who acquired lands were Public Accounts Committee Chairman Payyavula Keshav, former Advocate-General Dammalapati Srinivas and present MLA Gorantla Butchaiah Chowdary, who then rushed to the Speaker’s podium and challenged that he would resign if proven guilty.

Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said the TDP government had leased lands in Amaravati at ₹1 crore to ₹4 crore per acre to Central government departments/agencies but sold larger parcels of land to private institutions like VIT University (200 acres), SRM University (200 acres), Amrita University (200 acres), Indo UK Institute of Health (150 acres) and Medicity Health (100 acres) at the rate of ₹50 lakh per acre.

Besides, lands were allotted to star hotels in PPP mode at prices far lower than that of the lands given to the Central government departments which include the Indian Army and Navy.

Intervening in the debate, Mr. Seetharam said since people needed to know the facts, the government was duty-bound to get the matter probed and as the Speaker, he could ask for a clear picture lest it should become a subject of intense speculation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ipp1u/article30612886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21JAGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-mohan-reddy-agrees-to-order-probe-into-insider-trading-in-amaravati/article30608938.ece

Hundreds of villagers tried to lay siege to the Assembly protesting against three capitals proposal. The police took several persons into custody and shifted them to different places.

Tension prevailed in Mandadam, Thullur and other capital villages when members of Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS) and activists of various political parties marched towards the Assembly demanding that the government retain the entire capital in Amaravati.

The police dispersed the mobs who made a bid to organise ‘Chalo Assembly’, ‘Jail Bharo’ and ‘Assembly muttadi’. Heavy police forces were mobilised on all the roads leading to the Assembly to prevent any untoward incident at the Assembly.

Krishna Government College on Monday with many celebrating by greeting one another and sharing sweets after the announcement on formation of Executive capital in Visakhapatnam.

Party activists and leaders thronged the office and remained glued to the TV to watch the Assembly proceedings. They indulged in serious discussions on the impact of the decision in deciding the fate of Visakhapatnam and other areas of North Andhra.

A bike rally was taken out later from the office to Sampath Vinayak temple via MVP Colony raising slogans in support of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy for his decision to create three capitals to ensure decentralised development.

“We are grateful to our leader Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy for his bold step to make Amaravati the legislative capital, Visakhapatnam the executive capital and Kurnool the judicial capital. It’s a historic decision and will lead to removal of backwardness due to distributed development,” VMRDA Chairman Dronamraju Srinivas told The Hindu.

YSRCP city president Vamsi Krishna Yadav said Visakhapatnam would become a world-class city due to the decision to make it the executive capital. He said the region would get a lot of projects in future.

Several students and employees of Andhra University and members of the YSR Congress Party conveyed their thanks to Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy by paying tributes to his father the late Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy at the latter’s statue on the university campus.

They lauded the decision to set up zonal boards.

108,2020/01/20,Yet another heritage building on the verge of fading into oblivion,"Anantapur district is on the verge of losing its yet another heritage building to the “development” of an ultra modern Mother and Child Hospital(MCH) block on the premises of Victoria Memorial Hospital, now known as Chest Diseases Hospital near old bus-stand (Old Town).

This will join a long list of ancient buildings and monuments that have been vanishing gradually from the cityscape.

The Taluk Kacheri or Taluk Office, for one, built in 1910, which was the first Collector’s Office and one of the finest reminiscences of the British-era constructions, was razed to ground a couple of years ago. It used to house the Collector’s Office, Rural Police Station, Sub-Treasury, Revenue Divisional Officer’s office, and the Sub Jail - all in one complex.

Widely popular

Foundation for the Victoria Memorial Hospital was laid on December 2, 1901. Popularly referred to as the Headquarters Hospital, it was the first-ever major hospital for the entire region till Government General Hospital(GGH) and Medical College were built in 1961-62.

As the new buildings started springing up, the main hospital got shifted to new building and it was called Old Hospital and later, when tuberculosis was rampant in the district, it was rechristened as a Chest Disease Hospital.

It has a 20-bed in-patient functional hospital with three doctors, five nursing staff and ten other support staff and gets 300 outpatients.

Sorry state of affairs

Member of Anantapur unit of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage(INTACH) Ramkumar told The Hindu that they have appealed to the Collectors many a time to protect the heritage of the city, but due to lack of “political willingness and patronage”, many of the important landmarks vanished from the changing skyline.

Another century-old heritage building, Peace Memorial Hall, which came up in 1919 to commemorate the end of World War I in November 1918, was converted into NTR Museum by those in power previously, Mr. Ramkumar lamented.

The members of INTACH Anantapur chapter on Monday requested District Collector Gandham Chandrudu to protect the heritage buildings and sites in the city. They appealed to the Collector to take measures for preserving Victoria Memorial Hospital.

Office-bearers A.G. Venugopal Reddy, N.R. Chandrhas Reddy and R. Ramkumar also apprised the Collector of the dilapidated conditions that the Munro Building, that houses the Collector’s office, is in.

The Collector promised to look into the issue and do the best possible.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/mshh9x/article30608857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21VJPAGEHERITAGEBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/yet-another-heritage-building-on-the-verge-of-fading-into-oblivion/article30608858.ece
109,2020/01/20,K-4 missile successfully launched off Vizag coast,"India has successfully launched its K-4 SLBM (submarine launched ballistic missile) from an underwater platform, somewhere in the Bay of Bengal, off the coast of Visakhapatnam, on Sunday.

The missile developed by DRDO is one among the five K series or Kalam series (named after former President APJ Abdul Kalam), and has a range of about 3,500 km. The missile is developed to be launched from INS Arihant, India’s indigenously built nuclear submarine.

As per government sources, an early warning to ships sailing in the direction of the missile was given and no fly zone was declared prior to the firing of the missile.

After take off from an underwater pontoon at an undisclosed location from a depth of about 50 metres, the missile shot over the water surface to travel 3,500 km and drop at the pre-set target in the Indian Ocean.

Said to be about 12 metres in length and weighing around 17 tonne, the missile has the capability to carry a nuclear warhead of about 2 tonnes. It is also said to be intelligent and has the capability to dodge incoming anti-missile articles and K-4s circular error of probability is reported to be very low.

The successful test puts India in the elite club of nuclear triad, which means that the country now has the capability to launch nuclear-tipped ICBMs (inter-continental ballistic missile) or SLBMs (submarine-launched ballistic missile) from air, surface and underwater platforms.

The K-4 missile system is being developed for India’s nuclear submarine fleet or the Arihant class of nuclear submarines. At present only INS Arihant which is called S2 is operational and the other two INS Arighat or S3 and S4 are under development stage.

According to a senior naval officer, the successful launch of K-4 SLBM gives the country an edge, as only a few countries such as Russia, China and the USA have the triad advantage.

Moreover, SLBMs are stealth weapons and have complex technology, which needs to be developed with two propulsion system: one sub-surface and the other over the surface, he added.

Sources also said that DRDO has developed two underwater missile system for the nuclear submarine fleet, which includes K-4 SLBM and K-15 or B0-5 SLBM, which has a range of 750 to 1,500 km.

INS Arihant or S2 was launched in 2006 and commissioned in 2016. The 6,000-tonne vessel built under the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV) project is powered by an 83 megawatts pressurised light-water nuclear reactor. It has four vertical launch tubes, which can carry 12 K-15 or four K-4 missiles.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/k-4-missile-successfully-launched-off-vizag-coast/article30608811.ece
110,2020/01/20,TTD launches scheme to provide one free ‘laddu’ for every devotee,"It’s now official. Every devotee visiting the temple of Lord Venkateswara at Tirumala henceforth will be provided with one free ‘laddu’ by the TTD.

The TTD, which for quite some long time was brooding over the proposal, on Monday formally launched the ambitious scheme much to the delight of the devout spread across the globe.

The scheme which hitherto was strictly confined only to those pilgrims reaching the town (numbering around 20,000 every day) on foot hereafter will be extended to every devotee having the ‘darshan’ of the presiding deity.

According to rough statistics, the hill temple experiences around 80,000 footfalls on an average every day while the manufacturing cost of each ‘laddu’ is put at about ₹39. In a nutshell, the TTD will be providing 80,000 laddus on an average every day to the devotees free of cost.

While grounding the proposal, the TTD was also cautious to lift the ration on the purchase of additional ‘laddus’ which was restricted to just four ‘laddus’ to each pilgrim. Pilgrims desirous of having additional ‘laddus’ were either forced to procure them at exorbitant rates in the black market or run after a few designated TTD officials who were hardly spotted.

Under the new proposal, the TTD has also categorically announced that the devotees are free to purchase any number of ‘laddus’ of their choice at the existing selling price of ₹50 each without any recommendation or approaching the touts.

Subsidies cancelled

With this, all the existing subsidies being provided on the ‘laddus’ to different sections of pilgrims also stand nullified at one go. Earlier, the pilgrims opting ‘Dharma Darshanam’ were provided with four laddus at ₹70 (two ‘laddus’ at ₹25 each and two ‘laddus’ at a much subsidised price of ₹10 each in contrast to five ‘laddus’ to those reaching on foot for the same price.

The interesting factor is that the implementation of the new scheme will no longer burden the coffers of the TTD even by a single pie as the income earned by way of marketing the ‘laddus’ at a uniform selling price of ₹50 each will bail it out from the huge losses it has been suffering since a couple of years owing to the subsidies.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vm1xu9/article30608219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21-VJ-LADDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ttd-launches-one-free-laddu-scheme-for-every-devotee/article30608220.ece
111,2020/01/20,Amaravati not suitable for capital: Buggana,"State Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy has said the government got flood models simulated on the basis of inputs provided by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT-M) and found that 70% of Amaravati is prone to flooding at a level of one metre and 71% at half a metre. This followed a report published by The Hindu with the headline ‘At least 70% of Amaravati prone to floods: IIT-Madras’ on January 12 based on some credible sources in the Andhra Pradesh government.

Initiating a discussion on the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020, in the Assembly on Monday, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said the computerised simulation of possible floods in Amaravati led to the recommendation that the government should give up the idea of developing Amaravati as a single capital city with large constructions given the conditions cited by the experts.

Besides, he said the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which was roped in by the government to study the pros and cons of developing Amaravati as a mega capital city, clearly advised the risks associated with it not only from the investment perspective but also from other factors.

The BCG has observed that the cost of developing Amaravati would be astronomical, estimated to be about ₹3,500 crore per 10,000 population and that it would not be wise to pour in huge sums in a city planned to be built from scratch, on the basis of international case studies.

It (the BCG) stated that only two cities (Shenzhen in China bordering Hong Kong and Navi Mumbai in India) out of 30 cities in the world built from zero in the last 50 years reached the projected populations.

The TDP government had mentioned in the CRDA master plan that the population in Amaravati would reach 1.50 to 2 million by the year 2040 against the present 1.10 lakh. This was proof of how much hyped the Amaravati project was, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said, asserting that it was a big real-estate scheme promoted by the previous government.

‘Futile exercise’

Insisting that it would be a futile exercise to spend time and money on transforming Amaravati into a global city, Mr. Rajendranath Reddy said the government’s thinking was in tune with the models of development suggested by Srikrishna Committee, Sivaramakrishnan Committee, and K.T. Ravindran Committee.

The government engaged the BCG to know the opinion of independent experts as the analysis needed to be broad-based and should not be seen as a mere academic exercise. All the expert panels have said the same thing that A.P. should adopt the decentralisation model to set right the regional imbalances thereby fulfil regional aspirations which caused upheavals and turbulence every 10 or 20 years during the last 100 years.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/amaravati-not-suitable-for-capital-buggana/article30608184.ece

Though some areas have been earmarked for guests with passes, the other parts are open for public, said Mr. Meena.

It is learnt that the district administration has approached the ENC for a flypast and the final nod is awaited.

The ENC has agreed to anchor some of the ships near the coast, as they do it during Navy Day. But the flypast requires some permission and the final decision is awaited, said Mr. Meena.

It is learnt that a bike stunt show is also being planned. The authorities concerned are also gearing up to place five or six big LCDs on the Beach Road stretch with live streaming to enable people to see the programme, even from a distance.

Fast moves

Tabling the Decentralisation Bill, Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy said the Legislative Capital will be in Amaravati. Raj Bhavan, Secretariat and offices of the Heads of the Departments will be located at the Executive Capital in Visakhapatnam. Similarly, the seat of all judicial institutions established under the State legislation, shall, as far as practicable, be located in Judicial Capital of Kurnool.

Also, the Village and Ward Secretariats, which were established a few months ago, were also brought under the Andhra Pradesh Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of all Region Bill 2020.

Assets and laibilities to AMRDA

118,2020/01/20,54 leaders taken into preventive custody in Krishna,"At least 54 political leaders, including one former MP and seven former MLAs were taken into preventive custody on Monday morning across Krishna district. A majority of them belong to the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

The police resorted to preventive arrest of the leaders to foil their bid to join the Assembly Muttadi (Assembly siege) call given by the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi against the proposed three capitals proposal for Andhra Pradesh.

According to an official release by Krishna District SP M. Ravindranath Babu, the leaders who were taken into the preventive custody in different places are: Former B.C.

The Cabinet also gave its nod for the APCRDA Repeal Bill, 2020, paving the way for the formation of Amaravati Metropolitan Region Development Authority (AMRDA) in its place.

The Cabinet has further approved the governments decision to hand over the investigation of alleged insider trading in Amaravati to Lokayukta.

120,2020/01/20,"Andhra Pradesh Cabinet clears decentralised capital across Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool","A special session of the Andhra Pradesh Assembly on Monday passed the A.P. Decentralisation and Inclusive Development of All Regions Bill, 2020 and the A.P. Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) Repeal Bill, 2020, after a heated debate and high drama including the eviction of 17 Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MLAs by marshals.

The decision sparked widespread protests from farmers in the Amaravati region and opposition leaders. TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu and party members were taken into police custody late in the evening as they tried to march to the Assembly. Massive police deployment prevented several ‘Chalo Assembly’ rallies.

All-round development

The Bills will facilitate the development of Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool as legislative, executive and judicial capitals respectively.

While the decentralisation Bill was moved by Finance Minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, the CRDA Repeal Bill was piloted by Botcha Satyanarayana.

During the debate, 17 TDP members were suspended for obstructing Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s speech. The MLAs raised objections to the introduction of the Bills and stormed the Speaker’s podium.

The police mobilised forces to prevent the situation from spiralling out of control in villages close to the Legislature Complex and the Secretariat.

Vigil would continue in the capital villages which have been witnessing protests, Guntur Rural SP Ch. Vijaya Rao said.

Many villagers detained

About 700 to 800 protesters, including a large number of women, from villages like Mandadam, Velagapudi and Tulluru ran across the barren fields and reached the rear periphery of the Legislature complex. Some of them even jumped over the barbed wire fences placed by the police.

As the villagers tried to lay siege to the Assembly, the police took several persons into custody.

Tension prevailed in Mandadam, Tulluru and other capital villages when members of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi (APS) and activists of various political parties marched towards the Assembly demanding that the government retain the entire capital in Amaravati.

121,2020/01/20,Swine flu case detected in Anantapur,"The first case of swine flu (H1N1 flu) in the current calendar year has been registered in Anantapur district, with a man being treated at a special ward in the Government General Hospital here.

While it was rampant in 2018 in Anantapur and Kurnool districts with 12 deaths recorded in Kurnool and 10 positive cases in Anantapur district, 2019 was relatively better with only 11 positive cases detected, with no fatalities in Anantapur district. Most of the serious cases were referred to Kurnool and Bengaluru then, but now a special ward houses these patients and treatment is done at the Anantapur Government Hospital.

A resident of Rudrampeta in the city was diagnosed H1N1 positive and was being treated at a special ward in the GGH, and four other suspected cases were also being treated in other private hospitals. Government General Hospital Superintendent M. Ramaswamy Naik told The Hindu that while the man was being treated and was stable, some other patients too had come with symptoms and serology tests were being conducted for confirming the status.

The GGH in Anantapur has a microbiology laboratory that can test if a patient was H1N1 positive and all cases from the private hospitals too needed to send the samples to the GGH as of now to confirm its status, he observed. “It is generally rampant during October, November and December months, but fortunately in 2019 it was relatively dormant with very few cases reported, and it is surprising that in mid-January cases are being reported,” Dr. Ramaswamy added.

Appealing to the general public not to panic and immediately visit the GGH if they had symptoms of headache, fever and cold to ascertain the H1N1 status, he said it could be treated like any simple fever case easily in the majority of cases.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/8mwmzt/article30605084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/swineflu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/swine-flu-case-detected-in-anantapur/article30605085.ece
122,2020/01/20,Andhra Pradesh art teacher paints his way to fame,"His penchant for art has not only brought laurels, but also fetched him several records. Though eyeing records is itself not the end for Diyya Ananda Raju, it has proved to be the means to reach out to the last art lover in society.

Mr. Raju, who works as an art teacher at Andhra Pradesh Social Welfare Residential School and Junior College, Pulivendula, is a familiar name in the field of school education and the arena of drawing and painting. From Lord Ganesha to Mahatma Gandhi, his style of depicting an icon is loaded with panache.

The art teacher shot to fame with his 1,016 paintings of Lord Ganesha. “For any art lover, the elephant-headed Ganesha is the easiest and most versatile among the Indian pantheon of gods. He can be easily depicted in any number of ways,” Mr. Raju says in an interview to The Hindu.

He claims his to be the largest such collection of Ganesha images in the country, which includes 700 line drawings and the rest in painting format. He depicted Ganesha as a ‘Kalasam’ (earthen pot), Sankhu (conch) and other sacred forms, apart from in standing, sitting and lying postures. The array of paintings was displayed at CP Brown Library on the occasion of Vinayaka Chavithi last year.

The other major attraction is the 71 metre-long national flag designed by him, which was proudly presented at the Kadapa parade grounds commemorating the 71st Independence Day. The interesting feature of the flag is not just its mammoth size, but the way the ‘Ashoka Chakra’ was replaced by a bust image of Mahatma Gandhi, created with one lakh sticker ‘bindis’. The flag idea not only brought him accolades from the then Cabinet Ministers Somireddy Chandramohan Reddy and C. Adinarayana Reddy, but also a coveted place in 20 national and international record books.

On the move

Armed with a bachelor’s degree in fine arts, Mr. Anand Raju has put up over 20 solo and thirty group art shows at various exhibitions in the State.

At Anantapur Collectorate too, people visiting the officials to register their grievances, leave their slippers miles away from the main door of the office continuing the colonial practice.

Gandham Chandrudu, the first-time Collector, has taken a bold initiative at Anantapur District Collector’s office by publicly putting up large posters in public areas asking citizens not to leave their slippers outside the offices/chambers of officials, not to touch their feet, not to stand before them with folded hands and bowing down heads while explaining their grievances.

Last but not the least, he has asked them not to cry in front of the District Collector or officers to explain the gravity of their problem, but boldly put forth their plea in writing or orally. Poster with a striking colour and suggestive pictures about what people should not do has become an instant hit with the Anantapur people and has gone viral on social media.

Even after his humiliating defeat in both constituencies he had contested in the elections, Mr. Pawan Kalyan did not learn any lesson, Mr. Appalaraju observed while addressing the media here on Sunday.

‘Revolutionary decisions’

“Instead of appreciating the revolutionary decisions taken by the government such as introduction of English medium in State-run schools, the JSP president is criticising it,” the MLA said.

Mr. Appalaraju also hit out at TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu for raising a ruckus over the proposal to set up three capitals to ensure decentralised development.

“What’s wrong in trying to ensure balanced development drawing lessons from the Hyderabad model, wherein other areas were totally neglected” he asked.

He also accused Mr. Naidu of instigating the Amaravati farmers just to safeguard his real estate interests.

District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) S. Tirupathi Rao said that in the district, there were 4,69,992 children aged below five, of which 4,56,978 children were administered polio drops.

“Additional vaccination drives will be conducted to ensure that those children who have not been administered the drops today will be immunised,” Dr. Tirupathi Rao said.

“On January 20, 21 and 22, door-to-door drives will be conducted by medical teams, who will check if children aged below five have been given the polio drops. The door-to-door drives will be conducted in rural areas on January 20 and 21,” Dr. Tirupathi Rao said.

A large number of women were seen thronging the PPI booths which were set up at many places including Anganwadi centres, Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) and other hospitals in the district. Several teams went to nearby houses and informed the residents to bring their children to the booths for vaccination.

Special stalls were arranged at the railway station, RTC complex and other public places. The health department has deployed additional teams to Agency areas to ensure that children in the targeted age group are not left out of the immunisation drive.

Earlier, Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana, Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao, Collector V. Vinay Chand, and GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana launched the vaccination drive at a health centre in Akkayyapalem.

Mr. Vinay Chand said that the government has sanctioned funds for repairs of about 400 sub-centres in the district.

Mr. Srinivasa Rao spoke about various health programmes taken up by the State government and urged the public to make use of them.

126,2020/01/20,CREDAI accepts resignation of A.P. chapter Chairman,"The Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Andhra Pradesh, at its managing committee meeting here on Sunday accepted the resignation tendered by its Chairman A. Siva Reddy and requested former Chairman K. Subba Raju to take charge for the rest of the tenure.

Announcing this, CREDAI (A.P.) president Ch. Sudhakar told the media that Mr. Siva Reddy had voluntarily stepped down from the post as he was actively associated with the Amaravati Joint Action Committee (JAC).

“The CREDAI office-bearers are not expected to support or oppose the policy decisions of the government on the issues which do not have a bearing on the construction industry. The objective of CREDAI was to bring the problems being faced by the construction industry and builders to the notice of the government and strive to find solutions,” Mr. Sudhakar told the media.

Mr. Subba Raju said the CREDAI National was formed in 1991 for the welfare of builders and construction workers. It has chapters in almost all the States. The Andhra Pradesh chapter was formed post-bifurcation with 20 local chapters in the 13 districts of the State. It has 1,200 members. The association takes up CSR activities and training for upgrading the skills of unskilled construction workers.

“The association maintains a good relationship with whichever government is in power but that is limited to striving to find solutions for the welfare of the builders’ community. The CREDAI will react to only those issues pertaining to the construction industry but refrains from taking a stand on other issues and policies of the government,” he said.

Acknowledging the services rendered by Mr. Siva Reddy to the organisation, he said that the government was cooperating with the association with the Minister for Municipal Administration Botcha Satyanarayana holding meetings thrice with all the stakeholders on issues concerning the industry. The association would continue to cooperate with the government and was expecting the same from it.

CREDAI general secretary K.S.C. Bose, joint secretary K.

They said that apart from excluding Muslims, the CAA does not give citizenship to persecuted people of Sri Lanka and Myanmar, which is a violation of Directive Principles of the country.

Later speaking about the National Register of Citizens (NRC), they detailed that over 19 lakh people were excluded from the NRC list in Assam, of which only three lakh are Muslims.

Criticising the Central government, they claimed that the government is attacking the intellectuals, constitutional rights, courts, and constitutional bodies.

They also claimed that Hindutva or Islam is not ‘Indianness’ and stressed that the country has a secular fabric.

As far as the members were concerned, they could bring issues to the notice of the House in a proper manner.

130,2020/01/20,YSRCP rallies for Vizag as Executive capital,"North Andhra will not get justice for the next 100 years if Visakhapatnam is not made the Executive capital of the State at this juncture, said several public representatives, industrialists and academicians who took part in a rally organised by the YSR Congress Party in support of the three-capital proposal, in Srikakulam on Sunday.

Participants in the rally urged the government to move ahead with its decision to locate the Executive capital in Visakhapatnam and not cave in to pressure from opposition parties on the issue.

Uttarandhra Abhivriddhi Samiti convener Perla Sambamurthy, who contested as Srikakulam MP on a BJP ticket, said, “North Andhra was denied justice for the last 70 years, and this is the right time for taking corrective steps.”

“The government should not backtrack on its proposal since it is not against any region. Decentralisation will ensure equal development and prevent imbalances among all 13 districts,” said Mr. Sambamurthy.

Former Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University G.S.N. Raju and former V-C of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University Hanumanthu Lajapathi Rai asked the government to follow the recommendations of the Sivaramakrishnan Committee, which favoured Visakhapatnam as the State capital.

PULSUS Chief Executive Officer Srinubabu Gedela, who hails from Srikakulam district, urged the public representatives to discuss the reasons for the migration of 22 lakh people from North Andhra region in the last one decade.

“The debate over the crucial issue in the ensuing Assembly session would make people aware of the pathetic situation of Vizianagaram, Srikakulam and parts of Visakhapatnam district. Political parties should arrive at a consensus on the issue instead of working for the interests of a particular region and section,” Dr. Gedela said.

‘Lessons learnt’

Minister for Roads and Buildings Dharmana Krishnadas, Srikakulam MLA Dharmana Prasada Rao and other leaders participated in the rally. Mr. Prasada Rao, who initiated a discussion on the three-capital issue in the previous Assembly session, said that the government was moving in the right direction after witnessing problems caused due to development being confined to Hyderabad in erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh.

During the 17th general body meeting here, members Shivanand Patil and Siddrammappa Pyati wanted to know from Mr. Raja why there was a delay in taking action against Mehboob Pasha Karatagi, District officer of the Backward Classes and Minorities Department, for his ‘offensive behaviour’ towards girls staying in government hostels here.

The members alleged that he [Mr. Raja] had no control over the officials, and no official was taking the ZP members seriously.

Sanjeevan Yakapur, a member, complained that the students staying at Backward Classes and Minorities hostels in Chincholi taluk had to go without food for several days, allegedly due to the non-supply of foodgrains by the officials concerned.

Mr. Raja directed the District Officer of the Backward Classes and Minorities Department to visit the hostels along with the ZP members and take action against the wardens responsible.

Another member, Ratnavva Kallur, alleged that the officials indulged in the pilferage of milk supplied for children at anganwadi centres. Instead of supplying them to children, the officials were selling the milk to neighbouring districts, she added.

133,2020/01/20,Tongas to get proper stands in Vijayapura,"About 80 tongas, which have so far been parked in open areas in the city due to the absence of proper stands, will soon get a stand with water facility for horses.

The Department of Tourism has decided to construct six stands in different parts of the city after consulting tonga owners.

“The owners have been demanding that the administration provide better stands owing to the large number of tourists. Based on their demand, we have identified six places where the stands will be constructed,” said District Tourism Officer, Mallikarjun Bhajantri.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said the stands will come up at Gol Gumbaz, Jamia Masjid, M.G. Circle, Shivajir Circle, Taj Bawadi, and Ibrahim Roza.

He said that before construction of the stands, a meeting with the owners will be held to elicit their opinion on it.

“During the meeting, they listed out places which are suitable for constructing the stands. We will be constructing them and each stand can provide space to park six tongas at a time. The stand will also have water facility for horses. The entire project will be completed at the estimated cost of ₹37 lakh,” he said.

He said that the primary objective of giving shelters is to provide different places where tonga owners could not only park their carts but earn a better livelihood.

“As of now, there is no designated and covered stands for tongas in the city. Therefore, most of them park either outside Gol Gumbaz or near M.G. Circle. If they are put in different places where several tourists visit, then they will get better exposure,” Mr. Bhajantri said.

Hamik Khan, a tonga owner, said that if the government provides standard tongas, then it will help owners earn a little more. “Today, we earn around ₹300 to ₹400 a day.

134,2020/01/20,Lawyers from across Karnataka turn up to represent woman booked for sedition,"Several lawyers from different parts of Karnataka turned up on the Mysuru law court premises on Monday seeking to represent Nalini Balakumar, who has been booked for sedition.

Over 165 lawyers from Bengaluru, Mysuru, Mandya, Dharwad, and Davangere signed the ‘Vakalathnama’, expressing solidarity with Ms. Nalini after the Mysuru Advocates’ Association passed a resolution against its members appearing for persons accused in sedition cases.

When the bail petition filed by Ms. Nalini came up for hearing in the court of the Second Additional District Judge, advocates Jagadish from Bengaluru and Anees Pasha from Davangere argued for the accused.

The court also took up the bail petition filed by Maridevaiah, president of the University of Mysore Research Scholars Association, who has been named as an accused in the FIR lodged by the Mysuru city police in the sedition case. Raghunath, an advocate from Mysuru, appeared for Mr. Maridevaiah.

The court, which has already given interim bail to Ms. Nalini, adjourned the hearing on the petitions of Ms. Nalini and Mr. Maridevaiah till January 24.

Earlier in the day, the Mysuru Advocates’ Association convened a meeting in the wake of appeals from a section of its members to review the resolution against its members appearing for the accused in sedition cases.

Commotion at meeting

While the meeting was under way, commotion unfolded with a few lawyers allegedly roughing up fellow advocate P.P. Baburaj for allegedly trying to record the proceedings on video. Mr. Baburaj, who is incidentally among the lawyers who signed the ‘Vakalatnama’ to appear on behalf of Ms. Nalini, was later led out of the meeting. The association also resolved to reject the appeals made to review its decision. “We have decided to uphold our earlier resolution,” said Shivanna, secretary of the association.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/naf1om/article30609755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGMYSLAWYERST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/high-drama-in-mysuru-court-complex/article30606450.ece

Speaking to reporters at a function organised to unveil the statue of Sangolli Rayanna at Doddakoppalu in K.R. Nagar on Sunday, he said the BJP should provide ministerial berths to all the 17 disqualified MLAs irrespective of the results of the subsequently held bypolls. “All 17 MLAs, who had resigned, were responsible for the BJP coming to power,” Mr. Vishwanath said, adding that he hoped BJP would take them into confidence.

During the byelections for 15 of 17 Assembly seats, the BJP won 12, but two of the disqualified MLAs – Mr. Vishwanath and N. Nagaraju (M.T.B.) – lost.

Meanwhile, Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj K.S. Eshwarappa met Mr. Vishwanath at the Travellers’ Bungalow in K.R. Nagar and assured him that the BJP would ‘repay the debt’.

In all, 1,621 booths were opened in different parts of the district and 6,484 persons were deployed for the exercise which is part of a nation-wide drive. Though the WHO declared India a polio-free nation in 2014, the Pulse Polio immunisation programme is held to ensure that there is no recurrence of the disease and to maintain the polio-free status.

Mayor Tasneem inaugurated the drive in the city by administering polio drops to a few children at Jayanagar Community Hall.

144,2020/01/20,‘State can have two film cities with one in Mysuru’,"Even as the stakeholders of tourism industry here urged the government to reconsider its move on the film city and retain the project in Mysuru, a noted Kannada film personality observed that there could be no other place than Mysuru for establishing the same.

“If the government wants to set up the film city in Bengaluru, it may as well establish two such projects, retaining the choice of Mysuru. With the rise in number of Kannada films, it is better to have two film cities for the development of the Kannada film industry,” said S.V. Rajendra Singh Babu, director, producer and former chairman of Karnataka Chalanachitra Academy.

Mr. Singh said Mysuru has an 80-year-old history of film-making. It’s rare to find 250 shooting venues in a radius of around 25 km. Mysuru alone has 16 palaces. A Hollywood film was shot in Mysuru in 1946 and the director of the film had apparently described Mysuru as one of the best locations for outdoor shooting, he recalled. More than 400 Kannada films are being produced every year, he added.

Mr. Singh, who had submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s office in this regard, said many Kannada actors had hoped Mysuru would be the location for the project. With Mysuru airport becoming active owing to UDAN flights and the expansion of the Bengaluru-Mysuru National Highway, Mysuru would benefit, he further argued.

Land woes

Confusion had surrounded the project with plans to shift it from Mysuru after H.D. Kumaraswamy, former CM, had announced the setting up of a film university in Ramanagaram. The reports had forced former CM Siddaramaiah, who had announced the project, to intervene and urge Mr. Kumaraswamy to keep the project in Mysuru since land needed for it had been handed over to competent authorities. Himmavu, near Mysuru, that falls under Varuna constituency, that was represented by Mr. Siddaramaiah for two terms and now by his son Dr. Yathindra, was identified for the project. But efforts to move it closer to Bengaluru, the hub of Sandalwood – the Kannada film industry, continued.

One of the reasons cited for moving the project to Ramanagaram was that the industry and people dependent on it were based in Bengaluru and it was convenient for them if the project developed closer to the capital. The idea was to develop the film city as a one-stop destination for film-making.

Now, Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan has spoken about setting up the film city in Bengaluru, creating doubts about the project in Mysuru. The stakeholders here had launched an online campaign to keep Mysuru as the site for the project.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-can-have-two-film-cities-with-one-in-mysuru/article30602548.ece
145,2020/01/20,Rangayana’s Bahuroopi to witness more plays,"This year’s Bahuroopi National Theatre Festival at Rangayana, one of the most sought after theatre events in the State, will be held in February. The schedule of the annual theatre festival had been revised and as many as 13 noted theatre groups from various States will present their productions.

Usually, Bahuroopi is organised in January. It has been moved to February this year since the appointment of the new director happened last month.

The curtains for the festival will go up on February 14 with a series of events till February 19. In total, 26 plays will be staged including 13 plays by noted theatre productions from Karnataka. An amateur theatre group was also staging a play on the theme recommended by Rangayana. In addition, over 25 films will be screened as part of a film festival.

Addanda C. Cariappa, who assumed charge as director of Rangayana recently, said 25 folk troupes will be part of the festival and there will be performances on each day. He said the plays had been carefully chosen and selected based on their merit. More than 60 applications had been received expressing their wish to stage plays at Bahuroopi. Of these, 26 had been selected. “We gave utmost importance to concepts in finalising the plays as we wanted to bring in freshness and avoid repetition. Senior artistes from Rangayana were gearing up for the show with their production,” said Mr. Cariappa, adding that the seminar, exhibitions and other programmes had been lined up.

146,2020/01/20,39 farmer suicides in Mysuru district since April 2019,"As many as 39 farmers were found dead between April 1 last year and January 15 this year in Mysuru district, with Periyapatna and Hunsur taluks recording the highest number of suicide cases. As per figures from the Department of Agriculture, 14 farmers ended their life in Periyapatana taluk, and in Hunsur 11 farmers did the same.

Mysuru taluk recorded a case while there were three from Nanjangud, six from K.R. Nagar, and four from H.D. Kote taluks. Officials in the department said that there was a marginal decline in cases of farmers’ suicides in the district.

“Earlier, it used to be higher, sometimes in excess of 60, compared to the 39 so far this financial year,” they added. Of the 39, a compensation of ₹5 lakh has been approved in 20 and rejected in two cases. The compensation will be released with respect to other cases after completing the inquiry, said officials. “It transpired that in two cases where the compensation was rejected, the victim did not have any pending loan. Hence, the cause for suicide was not linked to agriculture,” they added.

However, farmers’ organisations pointed out that the ground reality in the agrarian sector has not changed. “The decline in the number of suicide cases this year is welcome but this could be a one-off development as the agrarian crisis and mounting debt of the farmers have not eased one bit,” said Kurubur Shanthakumar, president, Karnataka Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association. He also hoped that the official figures were not fudged with to present a rosy picture.

Mr. Shanthakumar said farmers continue to bear the brunt of government policies that are discriminatory.

“In the case of paddy procurement this year, the government has put a ceiling on the quantity to be procured from farmers. The support price and procurement will only be from small and medium-sized landholding farmers and those with more than 5 acres of land will not be considered. This comes at a time when agricultural income is on the decline and the cost of production has increased which will add to the farmers woes,” said Mr. Shanthakumar.

The view was seconded by Atahalli Devaraj of the association who pointed out that there are ups and downs in the number of suicide cases every year and it could not be claimed that the agricultural sector was making a revival as farmers continue to be in debt.

147,2020/01/20,"Ready for census, not NPR, Kerala govt. to inform Centre","The State government on Monday decided to inform the Centre that it was hard-pressed to cooperate with the work related to the drawing up and revision of the National Population Register (NPR). However, Kerala would fully cooperate with Census 2021. Earlier, Kerala had joined West Bengal in suspending all work on the NPR.

The special Cabinet, which convened here, concluded that the people were deeply concerned that the NPR, a biometric roster of citizens, was a precursor to the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The highly controversial NRC was purportedly an extension of the NPR. The NRC envisaged a taluk registrar of citizen registration to oversee the preparation of the list of ‘Indian citizens’ at the sub-district level to exclude people of ‘doubtful citizenship’ from the safety and welfare net of the State.

The Cabinet said any move to implement the NPR against the backdrop of the NRC would cause deep insecurity in Kerala and adversely affect the law and order situation.

The State government was constitutionally bound to allay the fears of the people and uphold public peace. Hence, the State was constrained to inform the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, Union Ministry of Home Affairs, that it could not collaborate with the preparation of the NPR.

‘Anti-Muslim’

The government said District Collectors had reported that any move to link the Census process with the NPR would trigger law and order issues.

The Cabinet’s decision is consistent with the political position of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the NPR were the two sides of the same coin and patently anti-Muslim.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/30cpfn/article30454145.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THCM-KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-says-no-to-npr-will-take-part-in-census/article30609948.ece

Inaugurating a district-level electricity adalat at Kattappana on Monday, he said the aim to achieve complete electrification was realised and load-shedding was avoided so far. The government was giving importance to the complaints of people and the department was redressing people’s grievances, he said. The Minister himself led the adalat aimed for hearing the complaints of power consumers. There were complaints with regard to power distribution and those of household connections. He ordered immediate steps for reducing the power tariff bills of household connections, in addition to removing the electricity supply lines that posed a threat to houses.

The Minister said steps would be taken to lay cables for power distribution in view of the traffic problems created by electricity posts at Kattappana town. Roshy Augustine, MLA, who presided over the function, pointed out the issue to him.

As many as 714 complaints were received at the adalat. These included 367 for removing electric posts, 76 regarding power tariff and 139 on low voltage.

149,2020/01/20,State’s Census move is worrying: Chennithala,"The State government’s decision to go ahead with the Census is a cause for concern, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said.

He was speaking to reporters here on Monday. Mr. Chennithala urged the government to bring clarity regarding the Census. “The State Cabinet has decided not to cooperate with the preparation of the National Population Register (NPR). At the same time, it has promised to collaborate in the Census process. This is worrying. The Union government has made Census and NPR inseparable. The Census is inevitable, but linking it with the NPR is a plot. The State should stop the Census until there is clarity in this issue,” he said.

Mr. Chennithala alleged the State had tried to implement the NPR through the back door. “Even after publicly denouncing it, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government tried to implement the NPR in secret. The Opposition has busted the government’s plans. Now, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan is inviting the Opposition for joint protests. This is to mislead the public,” Mr. Chennithala said. He said the Chief Minister was showing double standards with regard to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). “He is publicly speaking against the CAA. At the same time, the State government is unleashing violence against those protesting against the CAA. People are being booked under non-bailable sections. Even in BJP-ruled States, protesters have not been targeted and subjected to brutality like in Kerala,” he said.

Governor’s policy

Mr. Chennithala said that Governor’s policy address should reflect the spirit of the unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly against the CAA.

Launching the upgraded KSWIFT portal here on Monday, Industries Minister E.P. Jayarajan, said the State government had taken proactive steps to improve the ease of doing business environment in the State.

The modified KSWIFT platform was a decisive step in that direction.

Live website

“The live website will be a boon for entrepreneurs. There are 1,38,000 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) in Kerala and around 52,000 of them were set up after this government came into power.

An investment of ₹4,500 crore has come to this sector during this period,” Mr. Jayarajan said.

He noted that food processing, furniture cluster, steel manufacturing, tourism, hospitality and travel had been identified as the top MSME sectors in the State.

MSME sector

The MSME sector also provides employment to 8.9 lakh people and around 1.2 lakh jobs had been created by this segment during the last two years, the Minister noted. “The huge response from entrepreneurs at the recently held Global Investors Meet ASCEND Kerala 2020 is a reflection of high investor confidence Kerala now enjoys and an endorsement of the measures the State government has taken,” Mr. Jayarajan added.

152,2020/01/20,Armed Maoists spotted in Kannur,"Suspected Maoists, brandishing guns, visited Ambayathode here on Monday morning and handed over pamphlets to two persons near a shop. They pasted posters and raised slogans before returning to the forest, the police said.

According to the police, the public saw at least three gun-wielding persons at 6 a.m. The group spent at least 15 minutes there. On receiving information that they had returned to the Kottiyoor wildlife sanctuary, the police inspected the forest. Later, the police and a team of Thunderbolt, the commando force of the Kerala Police, carried out a combing operation in the forest.

The posters called upon the people to “avenge the blood spilled at Attappady,” a reference to the killing of four Maoists in an alleged encounter with the police last year. The Union and State governments were answerable for this bloodshed. They demanded that Operation Samadhan, aimed at countering Maoist movement, be withdrawn. They appealed to the people to make the bandh against the operation on January 31 a success. Last year, four alleged Maoists, including a woman, had reached Ambayathode during the same period. The group bought groceries from a nearby shop and returned to the forest after raising slogans against the BJP and the CPI(M).",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ff0127/article30609878.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvkrmaoists,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/armed-maoists-spotted-in-kannur/article30609874.ece

The review critically examined the status of carrier-building, which is in a very advanced stage, as the carrier is scheduled to begin basin trials early this year followed by sea trials in the middle of the year.

13th EAC review

Monday’s was the 13th EAC review of the carrier-building project and the first since the signing of Phase III of the IAC contract on October 31, 2019 between the Ministry of Defence and the Cochin Shipyard.

Mr. Kumar was accompanied by Vice Admiral G. Ashok Kumar, Vice Chief of the Naval Staff; Vice Admiral G.S. Pabby, Chief of Material; Vice Admiral S.R.

154,2020/01/20,Protest at Cusat after car of SFI leader rams student,"Students of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) staged a protest on the campus on Monday demanding action against leaders of the Students Federation of India (SFI) in connection with an alleged attack on an engineering student near University Junction on Sunday night.

Aasil Abubacker, 19, a BTech Instrumentation student, was allegedly attacked by a gang led by Rahul Peralam and Prajith K. Babu, both MTech students and unit president and secretary respectively of the SFI at Cusat.

The Kalamassery police have registered a case against both the accused under Section 308 of the Indian Penal Code for attempt to commit culpable homicide. According to a complaint filed at the Kalamassery police station, Aasil alleged that Rahul and Prajith deliberately dashed their car onto his motorbike when he was waiting near a hotel at University Junction. The student alleged that the gang came out of the car and hit him with an iron road on his head. He was shifted to a nearby hospital.

Follow-up

The police suspect that the incident was a follow-up to the differences that had cropped up between the complainant and those who had attacked him two days ago at the university hostel during the annual day celebrations. The university authorities said they had ordered an inquiry into the incident.

The Kerala Students Union, in a release, said the incident exposed the double standards of the SFI that it would not protect members with criminal backgrounds. Prajith K. Babu, SFI unit secretary, had been ousted from Maharaja’s College, Ernakulam, in connection with the burning of the chair of the Principal in 2017.

Probe sought

The union alleged that the accused had secured admission in Cusat despite the negative remarks in his conduct certificate.

155,2020/01/20,Have aided school postings gone to Public Service Commission?,"The interpretation of a recent Supreme Court order on appointments to minority-run educational institutions in West Bengal is now a hot topic of debate in academic circles in Kerala.

While a widely forwarded message on social media claims that the order restores the government’s right over appointment of teachers in aided schools, a section of school managements point out that such an interpretation is misleading.

The Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U.U. Lalit on January 6 upheld the constitutionality of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act, 2008 for appointment of teachers in madrasas, claiming that there is no absolute or unqualified right of appointment for minority educational institutions.

The message being circulated on the social media claims that the order ‘made invalid’ the current practice of appointment of teachers in aided schools by their managers. It also says the Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) can now appoint teachers to aided schools and there is no need for a government order for the purpose.

However, K. Gokulan, secretary, Management Association of Private Schools, told The Hindu that the order would not have any relevance to the ongoing appointment process which follows the statutory Kerala Education Rules (KER), 1959.

“As per Section 11 of the rules, managers are the appointing authority who can choose teachers if they have qualifications as prescribed by the government. There should be vacant posts of teachers and enough student strength also,” he points out.

Cost-cutting steps

A functionary of the Indian Union Muslim League-affiliated Kerala School Teachers’ Union points out that the ongoing examination for teachers’ appointment has nothing do with the Supreme Court order, but it is linked to the government’s cost-cutting measures.

Meanwhile, sources in General Education Minister C. Ravindranath’s office say the order would strengthen the government’s position in cases filed in the Supreme Court by aided school managements opposing the amendment to the KER that deals with the appointment of protected teachers.

The amended rules direct that all vacancies in schools opened or upgraded after May 22, 1979, except in the pre-upgraded section, be filled by managers by appointing protected teachers from a Teachers’ Bank. The additional posts, irrespective of the category, on staff fixation should be filled by appointing protected teachers and other teachers in the ratio of 1:1, says the amendment",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/has-aided-school-postings-gone-to-psc/article30609857.ece

158,2020/01/20,DFA will bear treatment cost: MLA,"The District Football Association (DFA) will bear the expenses for the treatment of those injured in a gallery collapse at Noorani on Sunday night.

Over 50 football lovers were injured in the accident that took place minutes before a celebrity match was being staged to help the family of R. Dhanaraj, former Santhosh Trophy player who died in a playground at Perinthalmanna a few days ago.

DFA president Shafi Parambil, MLA, said here on Monday that the DFA would not wash its hands of the responsibility. “We will cooperate with all the legal proceedings. We expect an additional burden of ₹4 lakh,” he said.

Reimbursement

Mr. Shafi, however, said that the money raised to help Dhanaraj’s family would not be siphoned off.

While 23 people injured in the accident were treated at the District Hospital, others were admitted to Cooperative Hospital, Paalana Institute of Medical Sciences, Thankam Hospital, Malabar Hospital, Welcare Hospital, and Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore. Mr. Shafi said that all hospital managements were told not to levy cash from the injured. Those who already paid the bills would be reimbursed, he said.

Mr. Shafi denied the allegation that the gallery contract had been given to an inexperienced person. He said the contract had been given to a person with good experience. He said those blaming him for the gallery collapse were using the situation for political gains.

He said ₹18.59 lakh was raised to help Dhanaraj’s family. “The entire money will be given to the family. Not a paise will be taken from that for other expenses,” he said.

He also said that a philanthropist had come forward to take care of the education of Dhanaraj’s daughter until Plus Two. The MLA provided details of those who donated cash to help the player’s family.

159,2020/01/20,Bill may fast-track delimitation of local bodies in Kerala,"The Cabinet decision on Monday to pilot a Bill in the Assembly for delimiting local body wards on the basis of the 2011 census report is expected to fast-track the process and make good the time lost for clearing the air on a draft ordinance forwarded by the government for gubernatorial nod.

Local Self-Government Department sources told The Hindu that once the Bill is passed in the upcoming Assembly session, the government would fix the strength in each local body and the Delimitation Commission would be able to initiate the process in the right earnest. But it would have to strive hard to make amends for the time lost by debating over the merit of the ordinance cleared by the Cabinet earlier.

Legal problems

The chances of the delimitation procedures getting bogged down in legal tangles are too remote since most of the arguments raised against the government decision to go by the 2011 census report are unfounded, sources said.

Rules do not prevent the government from redrawing the boundaries once or twice on the basis of one census report. Successive governments had resorted to such measures and those were not legally questioned too.

The previous delimitation held in 2015 had only covered about 10% of the local bodies and the exercise was largely confined to the panchayats that were carved out either through merger and redrawing of boundaries.

Anomalies

The grave anomalies in delimiting the wards of a number of local bodies on the basis of the 2001 census report and certain others on the basis of the 2011 report still prevail.

Addressing such anomalies is not an easy task for the Delimitation Commission either. Complaints were aplenty and a vast majority of the panchayats and most importantly municipalities still do not have the basic amenities for providing efficient public service, sources said.

The current decision to add one ward to each local body, though decided mainly due to financial constraints of the government, would not be as cumbersome like a full-scale exercise and could be completed well ahead of the time set for the next local body polls, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/y3bkta/article30606316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KERALAASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bill-may-fast-track-delimitation-of-local-bodies/article30608127.ece

161,2020/01/20,A struggle against odds at Chengara,"The 3,500-odd people belonging to 573 landless families that encroached on the Kurumbatty division of Harrison Malayalam Limited’s rubber plantation at Chengara, near Konni, in Pathanamthitta 12 years ago are a deserted lot.

Settlers on encroached land, they have not yet been provided with ration cards, voter identity cards, and house number for their dwellings, despite repeated pleas from different quarters and directives issued by the State Human Rights Commission, Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, and State SC/ST Commission.

Claims belied

“Authorised or not, Chengara is a human habitation that has not yet been electrified, making a mockery of the State’s claim of attaining total electrification. Similarly, a good number of households in this settlement do not have toilets, exposing literate Kerala’s declaration in 2016 as an open defection-free State,” says T.R. Sasi, president of the Ambedkar Smaraka Matruka Grama Vikasana Samiti that co-ordinates activities of the settler families at Chengara.

As many as 60 people died and more than 200 children were born in this encroached area over the past 12 years, but none of their names have been entered in the birth and death registers, he says.

As many as 300 landless families, under the aegis of the Sadhu Jana Vimochana Samyukta Vedi, encroached on nearly 145 ha of the HML rubber plantation at Chengara under the cover of night on August 4, 2007 demanding five acres for farming and ₹50,000 in cash towards initial farming expenses to each of the families. They pitched tents on the occupied land, Samarabhoomi as they named it, and started tapping latex from the rubber trees at the estate to eke out a living.

At one point of time, the Kerala High Court directed the State and the district administration to clear the encroachment without any bloodshed. But the official machinery could do little, as it was a do-or-die battle for the encroachers. They threatened to commit mass suicide when there were official moves to evict them.

National attention

The Chengara land struggle gained national attention early on. Prominent socio-political leaders, including Medha Patkar, Arundhati Roy, Govindacharaya, and Oommen Chandy, were among those who visited the encroachers in a show of support. Though the Left Democratic Front government led by V.S. Achuthanandan allotted 831.03 acres across 10 districts to 1,495 eligible landless people at Chengara in 2010, a good number of them turned down the offer, saying that the land allotted to them was rocky and not arable.

Meanwhile, the society divided the occupied land into five sectors - Ayyankali Nagar, Ambedkar Nagar, Panchami Nagar, Sree Buddha Nagar, and Kallara Sukumaran Nagar.

It allotted 50 cents each to the landless families staying on the occupied land since 2007. They fenced the land allotted to them and started cultivation there. Many of them constructed permanent houses, as the government failed to provide them with habitable land all these years.

Two shops at the Samarabhoomi are solar-powered with mobile charging facility. A few solar lamps installed at some points are defunct now, leaving the hapless families dependent on diesel and kerosene lamps at their homes. But it has largely become a safe locale for these families that cultivate a variety of crops, including banana, vegetables, tapioca, and coconut.

“We want to make Chengara Samarabhoomi a model village where people live happily and with mutual respect. Our religion is the religion of poverty, self-esteem, and hope,” says Sasi. “We work hard in the 50 cents allotted to us by our leaders, sell the crops in the nearby markets of Konni and Malayalappuzha to make a living,” says Uthaman, a farmworker.

Motorable road network

A well-planned network of roads run through the Chengara Samarabhoomi taking vehicles to every doorstep.

162,2020/01/20,"Betrayed, Wayanad tribes on the warpath","When agitations for land intensified in Wayanad under the aegis of tribal fronts of political parties in 2012, thousands of landless tribespeople took part in it.

They claimed their right to land by erecting huts on forestland. Those who took part in similar agitations till 2004 had been assigned land under the Forest Rights Act, 2006 and it inspired them to participate in these agitations.

The tribespeople thus opened 53 protest centres across the South and North Wayanad forest divisions. Though Forest Department officials arrested 826 protesters, including 296 women, they returned to the same place after local courts granted them bail.

A few of them called it quits once the intensity of the agitations subsided. Those who did not possess even a single cent of land chose to stay back, many among them embarking on cultivation of ginger, coffee, and pepper on the land.

Plight of tribes

Balakrishnan, 70, is the head of the Aanapara Kattunayakka settlement (a particularly vulnerable tribal group). As a boy, he was told by parents that his grandfather possessed nearly 60 acres. “We do not own a single cent now, nothing even to cremate our dead,” he laments. A ramshackle one-room hut in a piece of encroached forestland at Irulam, near Pulpally, has been his home for five years now.

Balakrishnan’s grandfather was illiterate. When settler farmers began migrating to Wayanad in the 1960s, a few of them offered alcohol and tobacco to the tribals, who had no proper title deeds, and usurped their land. Two hundred such tribal families have been living on the slopes of Irulam and Cheeyambam in the South Wayanad Forest Division since May, 2012.

Balakrishnan has planted nearly 300 pepper vines and 200 coffee plants over an acre of vested forestland ‘assigned’ to him by leaders of the Adivasi Congress, an outfit of the Congress at its Irulam protest centre near Pulpally.

Apparently, the activists promised him that he would not be evicted from the land at any cost.

Sujatha, 35, a resident of the Kottakkolly Paniya hamlet and an activist of the Adivasi Kshema Samiti, the tribal arm of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), said her party men had told her not to leave the agitation venue at Cheeyambam, near Pulpally, till she secured own land.

But their life is in makeshift huts plagued by a dearth of drinking water, unhygienic surroundings, and vulnerable to attack by wild animals.

Nowhere to go

“If we are evicted from the land, we have no idea where we will go along with my three children,” Sujatha said. Though the Poothadi grama panchayat constructed toilets for a few of them, at least some are in a state of disuse thanks to acute water shortage.

According to the Census of 2011, there were 4,84,839 tribal people, including 2,46,636 tribal women, in the State and about a half of them had made the inner parts of Wayanad their home.

Data available with the Tribal Development Department revealed that as many as 11,474 tribal families, including 8,263 families in Wayanad district, were landless.

Agitators, including tribespeople, who rallied under the All India Krantikari Kisan Sabha and the Adivasi Bharath Mahasabha, feeder organisations of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Red Star, to take possession of forestland early last year had a tough fate.

They encroached on 110 ha at Thovarimala under the Meppadi forest range of the South Wayanad Forest Division on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections in 2019. The land was earlier under Harrisons Malayalam Ltd. and had been used for cultivating softwood trees to meet the demand of firewood in its tea factories. The Achutha Menon Ministry in 1970 resumed nearly 5,000 acres, including estate land, at Vythiri and Sulthan Bathery taluks, as surplus land.

The Forest Department is its custodian. The land was intended to be assigned to the landless but successive governments failed to adopt steps towards this end, said the leaders of the organisation.

Following their eviction from the land, they have been continuing their agitation in front of the Collectorate for the past nine months.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/gohc8/article30604810.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvwyatribalhutatalandagitationcentre1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/betrayed-wayanad-tribes-on-the-warpath/article30604811.ece
163,2020/01/20,Arippa Bhoosamaram: Kerala’s seven-year-old land struggle,"At the entrance to the Arippa protest site you will find colourful strips of cloth hanging from tall rubber trees. Come closer and you will see the noose, sturdy and perfect.

A few metres into the nondescript forest in Kollam district stand the shanties – nearly 500 families constrained to a pitiable existence. Rainwater seeps into every makeshift shelter and snakes frequent the settlement. There is no electricity or public tap as the residents are denied all access to basic facilities, an extended ordeal they have been enduring for the past seven years.

Arippa Bhoosamaram (land struggle) started on December 31, 2012 when an assorted group of landless Adivasis and Dalits encroached on 51.7 acres of forest in Kulathupuzha, near Kollam, demanding land for housing and cultivation.

“Initially, there were around 150 people, but soon the number swelled to a thousand. This part of Arippa forest started teeming with landless people cutting across communities, the majority being Dalits. On January 11, we erected huts and refused to leave,” says Sreeraman Koyyon, president of the Adivasi Dalit Munnetta Samiti (ADMS), a collective that leads the struggle.

Sabotage bid

Soon, revenue officials visited the place and eviction notices were served. “We turned down offers of three-cent plots as our motto is colony vittu krishiboomiyilekku (from colony to farmland). We also resisted their attempts to create a rift among the protesters through preferential treatment. Then some political parties launched a parallel strike demanding 10 cents to sabotage our struggle,” he says. The situation turned volatile in May, 2013 following an altercation between the protesters and local residents, who started a slow and steady social boycott. Those living in the Arippa protest site were denied jobs and shops stopped selling provisions to them.

“Then they started harassing us and molesting our women. Some families fled the place after the women were violated and the police sided with the perpetrators,” says Anil, another protester.

Many hurdles

Later, some local gangs, allegedly led by political parties, laid siege to the forest entrance point, trapping the protesters inside. “What followed was a nightmare that left us sick and starving. All essential items ran out and we had to survive on bare minimum food. Men walked long distances through core forest and carried back some rice which was always insufficient to feed some 500 plus families,” he adds.

Nobody was allowed to enter or exit the forest and finally the authorities had to intervene.

Another blow came when the district administration decided to ban paddy cultivation in the forest, tagging it as ‘subversive activity’. There was a vast expanse of land that offered them sustenance for long. Now, the eight-acre polder is covered with weeds.

“Among all things they did, this hurt the most,” he says. Paddy farming wasn’t an easy task as they had to face many challenges, including irrigation. But that problem was solved by diverting a stream and setting up an indigenous irrigation system. Since they couldn’t afford machines or bullocks, the large stretch of land was ploughed manually. They found the area is strewn with oil palm needles from the nearby plantation, but bleeding heels did not stop them from tilling.

“We had cultivated paddy in nine seasons. When we were all set for the next njattuvela with the land ready for sowing seeds, the authorities arrived. They whipped up some story about the presence of extremist elements and an order prohibiting paddy farming was issued in 2017.” Seven years into their struggle, the families are still treated as second class citizens and offered lower wages due to their rebel status. Eighty three-year-old Maria and 90-year-old Saraswathy spend the whole day making brooms. If they work without any break they will make two pieces that will be sold for ₹25 each.

“Many of the elderly women walk four to five km daily to collect palm leaves from the farms of Oil Palm India Limited. After the ban, this is our only income,” says Kumaran, who came to Arippa from Chengara.

Medical camp stopped

Medical aid is another issue as the settlement has many elderly persons and children born at the protest site during the last seven years. In an attempt to shoo them away, the monthly medical camp for Adivasis was stopped by the authorities long back.

Sixty-year-old Lalitha was living in one of the ramshackle shanties till she breathed her last on January 18. With her leg amputated and a feeding tube connected to her nose, the bedridden patient never received proper medical attention. According to the residents, nearby hospitals are not very keen on taking in protesters. “

Children huddle around the dim glow of diesel lamps at night, struggling to study in poorly-lit rooms. Udayan, another protester, points to power cables running over the settlement to electrify another colony in a more interior part.

Arippa has protesters from seven districts, some even from Chengara land struggle who allege they were given non-arable plots.

Protesters say an unholy nexus of bureaucrats, politicians, and private players has been blocking all serious attempts to redistribute the forestland.

“Revenue officials conducted surveys in 2017 and 2018, finding a total of 479 families living in the area. They came for field verification unannounced and the list they made excluded many families who had gone out of the settlement for work. Now they argue only a few are residing here permanently and many of us have land elsewhere. But they are not ready to cross-check facts. But this never-ending neglect cannot douse our spirit as we plan to continue the struggle till the end,” says Sreeraman Koyyon.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/y261vt/article30604787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19tvko-Arippa1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/arippa-bhoosamaram-keralas-seven-year-old-land-struggle/article30604791.ece

165,2020/01/20,"Kerala Governor cites lese majeste, demands answer","Even as the Kerala government denied that it had infringed on the prerogative of the gubernatorial office, Governor Arif Mohammad Khan invoked his authority to ask the executive on Sunday to submit why it kept the Raj Bhavan in the dark about the move to appeal against the citizenship law in the Supreme Court.

Mr. Khan reportedly pointed out in a letter to the Chief Secretary that the Chief Minister was duty-bound under the rules of business of the government to refer specified category of cases that concerned Centre-State relations or involved the Supreme Court to the Governor before the administration acted.

Informed sources said Mr. Khan had extensively quoted rules and SC judgments to lay out his case.

Last week, Mr Khan had repeatedly said he felt short-changed by the government, which he suggested had crossed a line by not informing the constitutional head of State about its decision to challenge the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a Central law, in the Supreme Cout.

Bid to defuse tension

Law Minister A.K. Balan had attempted on Saturday to defuse the political tensions. He said the government was legally obliged to answer the Governor’s questions and allay his “apprehensions.”

Mr. Balan also took legal sanctuary in the argument that the apex court had not turned down the State’s prayer on the ground that the lawsuit required the Governor’s consent.

Mr. Balan contended the State was not in conflict with the Centre. Hence, there was no imperative to inform the Governor. The State had merely invoked the provisions of Article 131 of the Constitution to file a civil suit in the Supreme Court against the CAA, which it felt discriminated against Muslims seeking citizenship status in India.

The placatory tone struck by the government was not echoed by the CPI(M). Party State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan wrote in its newspaper, Deshabhimani, on Sunday that Mr. Khan had acted like an apparatchik of the BJP. Several leaders who attended the party’s Central secretariat meeting here were also critical of the Governor.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/h2szf/article30602509.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20ARIF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-governor-cites-lese-majeste-demands-answer/article30602510.ece

170,2020/01/20,Bappi Lahiri’s ‘Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re’ recreated for ‘Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan’,"Veteran music composer Bappi Lahiri’s 1980’s hit song Yaar Bina Chain Kahan Re is returning in a new avatar for romcom Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan.

The disco track, “Yaar Bina...” from the 1985 film Saaheb, featured Anil Kapoor and Amrita Singh. It was penned by Anjaan.

After 35 years, music director Tanishk Bagchi and lyricist Vayu have recreated the song for Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan, which stars Ayushmann Khurrana along with Jitendra Kumar.

Billed as a quirky rom-com, the film, directed by Hitesh Kewalya, is a same-sex love story which aims at conveying an important message to parents and families across the country.

“The song is the quintessential mid-80’s number and has the appropriate vibe for our film. It’s like a coffee shot for the movie. Tanishk Bagchi and Vayu have recreated the disco track, and have retained the energy. Bappi da’s voice has been retained in this number, and is such that you can’t help but groove to it. Ayushmann loved the recreated version as it captures the essence of the story,” Kewalya said in a statement.

The song will be choreographed by Vijay Ganguly, whose father Anil Ganguly directed Saaheb.

171,2020/01/20,‘Hacked’ trailer: Hina Khan is stalked by an obsessive cyber bully,"The trailer of Hacked sees Hina Khan play a successful businesswoman, who becomes friends with a teenager. However, when the latter becomes obsessed with the older woman, the story takes a turn as the teen begins to implant cameras in her house, stalk her and eventually blackmail her too.

Filmmaker Vikram Bhatt, who has directed Hacked, feels people’s privacy is in danger in the age of social media.

“I have been making films based on horror and paranormal, but this time I chose to use a subject very close to reality by showcasing to them the real horror of matters in their daily lives. In this age of social media, everybody is vulnerable to being hacked and nobody knows about it and it would take one clever hacker to ruin our lives within few minutes.

“We are all being hacked across mediums. It is imperative that we are aware especially in today’s times. Our privacy is fragile and in danger,” he said.

The film explores the dark side of the digital and the social media world.

Talking further about the project, Bhatt said: “Hacked is based on the horrors of technology, how no one is safe. It just takes one man with enough knowledge of technology and a heart filled with hate to destroy you.”

172,2020/01/20,Mysskin’s movies are painterly: Aditi Rao Hydari on ‘Psycho’,"Aditi Rao Hydari is refreshingly honest and earnest about her craft, even if she were meant to be typecast in characters that are traditionally perceived as ‘docile’ and ‘submissive’ — as was the case in movies like Kaatru Veliyidai (KV), Padmaavat and Chekka Chivantha Vaanam (CCV) to name a few.

The actor got a new lease of life when she landed the lead role in Mani Ratnam’s Kaatru Veliyidai, which, she says, was a “rebirth” in more than one way. “Working with Mani sir was a dream come true for me. He altered my perception about cinema. It is the kind of experience you keep wanting again and again,” says Aditi over phone from Mumbai, where she lives and shuttles between industries. Conversations with Mani Ratnam became an inevitable part of her acting process when she worked on KV and CCV. Mani Ratnam, in fact, mentioned Mysskin when he was discussing new-age filmmakers with her.

“Mani sir suggested a bunch of directors to watch out for,” she explains. Among them was Mysskin, a daring filmmaker who can rightfully be called an ‘auteur’. Aditi says she began to follow his work — Nandalala, Yuddham Sei and Super Deluxe [which Mysskin co-wrote and acted] — hoping to work with him someday. And that day arrived when she got a call from Mysskin, who introduced himself along with her character description for Psycho — something drastically different from what Aditi has done before, both in terms of theme and character. “It was something I was very keen to do. As an actor, you encounter certain challenges when you work with such directors [Mysskin]. There’s a sense of fear developing in your gut — whether I would be able to pull this off. That is what drives me,” she says, about how Psycho was an instinctive ‘yes’.

Visual poetry

Those who are aware of Mysskin’s filmography can safely say his movies are a tough watch. For, his approach to life and cinema is deeply philosophical and transports the audience into a metaphorical state — like a therapeutic session with a psychiatrist. But this visual narrative of his was what intrigued Aditi when she signed up for Psycho, slated for release this Friday. “He is well-read and dips deep into human psychology. His visual narrative is metaphorical and leaves a lot to the imagination,” says Aditi, who is now familiar with his filmmaking wizardry. “When he narrated the script, I was trying to figure out what he wanted to create.”

She describes his movies “painterly” but cautions, “A painting that makes you uncomfortable” — an interpretation you cannot help but agree with. “Somewhere, I loved the juxtaposition of the two worlds. His subjects are violent, even though there’s a painterly quality to his movies. I like to play characters that make you uncomfortable,” she adds.

From the trailer, Psycho seems to be an exploration into the mind of a psychopath and the circumstances that push him into becoming one — it has Beethoven’s symphony remodelled by maestro Ilaiyaraaja. Aditi dodges questions about her character, but says she plays a radio jockey who has a desire to help society. She proudly says that she is a “director’s actor” and is instinctive about her performance. “I am very much at the moment. But there are characters that stay with you subconsciously because of the kind of experience you go through. That happened with Kaatru Veliyidai before. And now, with Psycho,” she says.

A date with a psychopath

Violence is an integral part of Mysskin’s movies, just like in life. But Psycho appears to be his most violent movie yet. However, Aditi says there is as much blood and gore as there is love, “Mysskin sir told me once that he is worried that people might perceive his content as violent. But it is not just about blood. It is more about dealing with human minds, fighting your own demons and grappling with you own fears,” she says.

When Aditi is working, she does not make an attempt to “decode” a filmmaker’s style. That takes away the fun of shooting, she says. “What I love to do is observe the director and perform to his commands. Of course, I do try to involve myself in the process, but like an outsider.” She remembers one funny incident when she was to deliver an intense monologue, but the camera was positioned near her toes — a filmmaking trait of Mysskin that has earned laurels and brickbats. “But that shot would mean something, visually. There was also a close-up shot that he had [accidentally] taken. I remember Mysskin sir telling me, ‘My frame has never looked this beautiful before’,” says Aditi with a chuckle.

Been there, done that

Our conversation shifts to casting and how she has been typecast in certain ‘paavam’ characters. While acknowledging that there are issues with regard to casting, Aditi, however, has an interesting take on playing those. She believes that there is “courage in showing vulnerability” on screen. “Vulnerability is your greatest strength if you’re comfortable with it,” she begins, “To be able to feel that emotion... I think it is the strongest and most fearless thing to do. You don’t have to hold a knife to show your strength. The most courageous thing is to be transparent.”

There is a fair bit of stereotyping, admits Aditi. At the same time, she makes an effort to break away from the mould, and does not wish to be boxed into a particular category. “Of course, there are things that need to be said about casting. But I have tried to show variation in my performances, based on my own understanding and life experiences. That’s why I try to reinvent myself and take up movies across genres.”

Could that be the reason why she is offered characters of substance down South? “I just mentioned this to my director-friend recently. I’ll go wherever there’s challenge. If directors feel there is untapped potential in me, it’s a good thing, no?”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/l9dunb/article30607287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21MPAditijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/aditi-rao-interview-for-psycho/article30607290.ece

174,2020/01/20,Dwayne Johnson reveals that his dad Rocky died of ‘massive heart attack’,"Hollywood action star Dwayne Johnson has revealed that his father, veteran WWE wrestler, Rocky Johnson died of a “massive heart attack”. Rocky ‘Soul Man’ Johnson, whose real name was Wayde Bowles, died last week at the age of 75.

Dwayne shared his father’s cause of death in a video he posted on Instagram.

“A lot of you guys wanted to know what happened to my dad. He had not been feeling well, had been battling a cold and infection and on Tuesday he had what’s called a deep vein thrombosis, which is essentially a clot in the leg. It was a big ole blood clot that broke free, traveled up his body, and went right to his lung, clotted his lung and he died very quickly from a massive heart attack, just like that,” Johnson said.

“That did give me great comfort in knowing that it wasn’t prolonged, the actor added, noting that his father, who started his wrestling career back in 1964, “had been in a lot of pain for a very, very long time“.

The 47-year-old actor also thanked his followers for all the love and support.

“Hey everybody I just wanted to stop in on this very blessed Sunday to say thank you so much. Thank you. My heart is so full of gratitude. You've lifted my spirits in ways that I hope you can imagine,” he said.

Rocky is best known for becoming the first black tag team champion in WWE history with partner Tony Atlas as The Soul Patrol in 1983. He retired from the ring in 1991 and trained Dwayne for his WWE launch under the name The Rock.

175,2020/01/20,Why the lyrics in ‘Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo’ are a toast to the Telugu language,"It has been a swift rise to the top for Kalyana Chakravarthy Tripuraneni. Known as Kalyan to industry folks, the lyric writer of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo is a native of Gudivada and is armed with a B.Tech and MBA graduate worked in the revenue department of the Telangana government for five years before moving to the film industry to pursue a career as a lyricist and a dialogue writer. He talks of his salad days, “I was introduced to music director Chakri and he was impressed when I wrote a few lines. I was supposed to meet him again but he died the next morning. Then I went back to my home town and ran a private school; I was busy with that for three years. A music director and a few other people came as chief guests to one of our school functions. The welcome song that I had written caught their attention and they advised me to move to the film industry. I did.”

Is there a ‘filmi’ grammar to writing songs? “If you learn Telugu till the X std fluently, you can write not only kavyalu but also kalakhandalu. I am a voracious reader of new poets and I am inspired by Patanjali’s writings,” says Kalyan whose first film was 118 and then he worked on Guna 369. He had written campaign songs for Andhra Pradesh elections too.

Lyricist Kalyana Chakravarthy

The title track of Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo that begins with Bammera Pothana’s lines, continues with Kalyan’s lyrics; it has become an instant hit and fetched him recognition. Title songs are usually given to senior lyricists so he was lucky to bag the assignment, he says. The other songs for the film were written by Seetarama Sastry, Kasarla, Shyam, Rama Jogaiah Shastry and Vijay Kumar. Kalyan shares, “There is diversity and freshness when different people write songs for a film rather than one lyricist getting a single card. It creates employment too. Enni rasavu ani kadhu yela rasavu (It’s not how many you wrote, how you wrote) is important,” he says as a matter of fact.

Kalyan was influenced primarily by his Telugu teachers and his grandmother. He had exposure to literature as his grandparents were littérateurs. His father was an NTR fan who would play Dana Veera Soora Karna VCD innumerable times at home. Kalyan recalls how when someone asked NTR Bhashani yela brathikinchukovali (How do you keep the language alive)? the actor’s reply was matlaadi brathinchukovali (by talking). He adds, “When you keep meeting new people, you observe different mentalities. I was born in Andhra, grew up in Telangana and worked as an engineer in Rayalaseema. I’m exposed to different culture and languages. I remember writing a song in the VII std .”.” He stresses the importance of Telugu being the medium of instruction at least till the V std. Recently when he was writing dialogues for Paruchuri Brothers, he used a word ‘Uppirisindhi’ (the stripes on the collar caused by sweat) and Paruchuri Gopalakrishna was thrilled, he said he could sleep happily for hearing a new word. Such is the power and satisfaction that language can give a person.

He recalls the day Trivikram Srinivas had summoned him to write the title song, “There is intellectual satisfaction working with him. Ninety percent should be understood by the listeners and commercial in nature and the remaining 10 percent demands to be understood,” he sums up.

Kalyan believes that though there are many lyricists, opportunities come to those who try hard. His next projects are Miss India and S5 ..no exit.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/gbgmmo/article30606710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy21-allu-arjun,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ala-vaikunthapurramuloo-lyricist-interview-kalyana-chakravarthy-tripuraneni/article30606714.ece

179,2020/01/20,Room to dream: A six-month training programme for Kollywood’s budding assistants,"Small fish go unnoticed in the presence of a shark. This is an unwritten rule in the film industry. Beneath the glitz and glamour, there are powerful yet tragic tales of the underdog that get watered down by the giant wave called fame. One such is the travails of up-and-coming directors, who spend most of their lives walking in and out of directors’ offices, looking for opportunities.

But what if there was a course that offered essentials to become well-equipped assistants, thereby flattening the process of getting into the industry? Film activist and writer Arun Mo was toying with this rather ambitious idea of starting a six-month training programme for assistant directors, without charging a penny — perhaps the first in the country.

There are similar courses available in the US, but none in India. This, for Arun, formed the basis of launching Assistant Director Training Course (ADTC) in August last year through his Tamizh Studio, whose USP is to create a parallel movement in Tamil cinema. “Even if you make a crass movie, there has to be scope for craft in it. Most of the so-called mainstream movies are carelessly handled with the least bit of professionalism,” says Arun, about what prompted him to start this initiative, “Through the programme, we train assistant directors on how to respect the art form, even in a masala movie.”

Back to basics

The unprofessional attitude that Arun laments about is far seeped into the industry and change, according to him, has to begin from the grassroot-level. “Assistants work with directors closely and are equally responsible for a movie’s success or failure. What we teach here is to get the basics right.” By that, he is referring to shot placements and continuity mishaps, for which assistants are held accountable. Given the halo around directors, would they be willing to pay heed to the voices of assistants? “Of course, they won’t ‘correct’ directors when they go wrong. We don’t teach them that. They are taught how to handle real-time issues like availability of props and so on.”

What Arun noticed, having initiated several workshops and interacted with filmmakers, is the lack of trained assistants who could execute a task without having to spell out every little detail. “Directors expect certain qualities in them [assistants]. Surprisingly, most directors have been insistent on wanting assistants who read literature,” he says, adding that the programme centres on three topics of film production: pre-production, shooting and post-production. Funding has been a major concern for Arun, but he does credit filmmakers such as Mysskin, Vetri Maaran, PC Sreeram and Manikandan for supporting his venture.

Stairway to fame

There is no age bar for the ADTC programme, provided the applicants have genuine love for cinema. Assistants have to give a written exam, where they are asked to critique their favourite movie — an effort to gauge their tastes and sensibilities. Out of the 200-odd applicants for the current batch, only 15 were shortlisted. “With whatever limited funds were left, we have been able to support only 15 of them, since the course is free of cost,” says Arun, adding that there are students travelling from as far as Tiruttani every day.

There is no definitive curriculum for the course, nor do they have exams. For the first two months, students are asked to read literature, particularly fiction. The reading sessions are followed by a group discussion where each one of them has to describe in detail the book they read. The next four months are spent on theory and practicals — the latter is when they are taken to a live shooting spot, where they interact with the crew.

Senior technicians, who are also domain experts in the industry, are routinely brought in to take classes.

“Recently, we had a session with director Shankar’s assistant, who spoke about the challenges he faced while making Enthiran, when Shankar sir wanted a particular fruit for a scene. Director Mani Ratnam’s assistant also taught us,” says Shajan Kavitha, one of the students at Tamizh Studio, in Vadapalani. He adds that they recently worked on a short film directed by Vicky of Traffic Ramasamy fame.

Arun does not guarantee placements. Instead, he has provided a platform where students can directly interact with filmmakers over the course of the programme. “Eight of them have already been booked by directors,” he adds.

The course is held at Tamizh Studio, Vadapalani.

180,2020/01/20,"Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio to act in Martin Scorsese’s ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’","Martin Scorsese’s favourite leading men, Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio, are coming together for the director’s next film.

DiCaprio, who was on the stage to present De Niro the Life Achievement Award at SAG Awards, confirmed that he and The Irishman star will be in Killers of the Flower Moon.

De Niro, 76, and DiCaprio, 45, are the only two actors to have worked with Scorsese on multiple projects though separately.

This is the first time that the two actors, who have been awards-season fixtures this year thanks to their performance in The Irishman and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, are collaborating on a Scorsese full-length film though they appeared in the director’s short movie The Audition.

Based on David Grann’s best-selling 2017 nonfiction book Killers of the Flower Moon is based on the 1920s Osage murders, when several Native Americans of the Osage Nation were killed after oil deposits were discovered beneath their Oklahoma land. The newly formed FBI starts investigating the murders.

The screenplay is by Eric Roth of A Star Is Born and Forrest Gump fame.

De Niro has starred in some nine Scorsese movies, most notable being Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, Cape Fear and The Irishman while DiCaprio has worked with the director on Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island and The Wolf of Wall Street.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/e30kt/article30606114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-BAFTASNOMINATIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/robert-de-niro-leonardo-dicaprio-to-act-in-martin-scorseses-killers-of-the-flower-moon/article30606115.ece
181,2020/01/20,"‘Parasite’ scores historic upset at SAG awards, boosting Oscar chances","South Korean thriller ”Parasite” was the upset winner at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards on Sunday, while Joaquin Phoenix and Renee Zellweger were named best actors, cementing their roles as frontrunners at the Oscars next month.

“Parasite,” the Korean language social satire about the wealth gap in South Korea, was the first film in a foreign language to win the top prize of best cast ensemble in the 26 year-history of the SAG awards.

Despite an unknown cast, it beat homegrown Hollywood movies ”The Irishman” and “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood” which both have A-list stars.

The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

“Parasite” director Bong Joon Ho said backstage that no-one could predict what might happen at the Oscars on Feb. 9

Speaking through an interpreter he added; “It is true that the momentum is building and we are a part of the awards race and campaign. But what happened today, whats truly important, is that these actors were acknowledged by fellow peers as the best ensemble cast of this year.”

Phoenix's terrifying performance as a loner who finds fame through violence in “Joker” has swept awards season.

“I am standing on the shoulders of my favorite actor, Heath Ledger,” Phoenix said on Sunday, referring to the actor who won a posthumous Oscar in 2009 for his turn playing the comic book villain.

Zellweger, likewise, has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic ”Judy.”

Brad Pitt picked up another trophy for his supporting role as a charming stunt man in “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,” while Laura Dern was named best supporting actress for playing a ruthless divorce lawyer in Netflix domestic drama ”Marriage Story.”

“It was a difficult part,” quipped Pitt of his role. “A guy who gets high, takes his shirt off and doesn't get on with his wife. It was a big stretch,” he said to laughter, riffing on his own life as a twice-divorced Hollywood heartthrob.

Sexual harassment drama “Bombshell” went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods but emerged empty-handed.

Meanwhile, Martin Scorsese's $170 million Netflix gangster movie “The Irishman” had another disappointing night, despite a cast that includes Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci.

Several of the contenders for best picture at the Oscars on Feb. 9 were not nominated for best movie cast ensemble at SAG.

Those left out include immersive World War One film “1917,” the big winner at the Producers Guild Awards on Saturday, as well as “Joker,” “Marriage Story,” and novel adaptation “Little Women.”

De Niro, whose lead performance in “The Irishman” has been snubbed by the Oscars, Golden Globes and SAG, was given a lifetime achievement award at the SAG dinner and used his speech to take a veiled shot at U.S. President Donald Trump.

In television, Jennifer Aniston was an upset winner for her role as a TV anchor in “The Morning Show,” bringing the second award this year for the new Apple TV+ streaming service. Her co-star Billy Crudup won a Critics Choice award last week.

Comedy “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel” and British royal drama ”The Crown” took the prizes for their TV ensemble casts. But ”Mrs Maisel” actress Alex Borstein said the comedy prize should have gone to quirky British comedy “Fleabag.”

Moments earlier, “Fleabag” creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge accepted the best television comedy actress statuette, capping a year of multiple awards for her and the show.

“This whole thing has been a dream and if I wake up tomorrow and find it's been just that, thank you. It's been the most beautiful dream,” Waller-Bridge said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/g3xyla/article30605945.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/APTOPIX26THANNUALSAGAWARDS,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/parasite-scores-historic-upset-at-sag-awards-boosting-oscar-chances/article30605946.ece
182,2020/01/20,De Niro takes shot at Trump as he accepts SAG lifetime award,"Robert De Niro, considered one of the finest motion picture performers of his generation, was saluted on Sunday with a lifetime achievement award from his acting peers, and used the occasion to take a veiled jab at U.S. President Donald Trump.

The two-time Academy Award winner and star of Oscar-nominated mob film The Irishman received the annual Screen Actors Guild (SAG) tribute celebrating a 50-year career in films ranging from dramas like The Deer Hunter, Raging Bull and The Godfather: Part II to comedies such as Meet the Parents and Silver Linings Playbook.

Stepping onto the stage to a rousing standing ovation and cheers at the Shrine Auditorium on Sunday evening, De Niro took another swipe at Trump, without mentioning him by name, as the president faces a Senate trial this week on impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

“There's right, and there's wrong and there's common sense, and there's abuse of power, and as a citizen I have as much right as anyone else ... to voice my opinion,” the actor said. ”And if I have a bigger voice because of my situation, I'm going to use it whenever I see a blatant abuse of power. And thats all I'm going say about that tonight.”

He then went on to thank his “comrades in arms” for bestowing the life achievement honor, presented by the SAG-AFTRA (American Federation of Television and Radio Actors) union.

A versatile actor with more than 100 films to his credit, De Niro, 76, also is co-founder of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, established to help revitalize lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that reduced the World Trade Center to ruins.

Although known for his often-taciturn demeanor in public appearances while strictly guarding his private life, De Niro has emerged as one of Mr. Trump's most vocal critics outside of political circles.

In 2018, he launched an expletive-laden attack on Mr. Trump on live television as a presenter on stage of the Tony Awards for Broadway theater. Mr. Trump responded on Twitter by calling De Niro ”a very low-key individual.”

A frequent collaborator with director Martin Scorsese, De Niro built his career with haunting portrayals of loners and tough guys - a deranged ex-convict in “Cape Fear,” a disturbed vigilante in Taxi Driver, a disillusioned Vietnam War veteran in “Deer Hunter,” a ruthless gangster in Goodfellas.

A method actor and perfectionist who trained at the Stella Adler Conservatory and the American Workshop and with Lee Strasberg, De Niro earned a reputation for intense preparation.

He learned to speak a Sicilian dialect to play the young mobster Vito Corleone in The Godfather: Part II, a role that earned him his first Oscar in 1975. And he famously gained 60 pounds (27 kilos) for his second Oscar-winning performance as boxing great Jake LaMotta in 1980's Raging Bull.

He also found success playing his hard-bitten screen image for laughs, in such comedic roles as an insecure mob boss in ”Analyze This” and a retired CIA operative in “Meet the Fockers.”

Nevertheless, De Niro has been largely overlooked this awards season for his acting work as hitman Frank Sheeran in The Irishman, failing to garner nominations as a performer in the Golden Globes, Oscars, or SAG contests. He did, however, share an Academy Award nomination in this year's best picture race as one of four named producers of “The Irishman.”

Jennifer Aniston later won an award of her own for best female actor in a drama series for the Apple TV Plus show The Morning Show. “What!” she said upon reaching the stage. Aniston finished her speech with a shout-out to her Murder Mystery co-star Adam Sandler, whose performance in “Uncut Gems” has gone mostly unrewarded this season despite considerable acclaim. ""Your performance is extraordinary and your magic is real. I love you, buddy,” said Aniston.

The SAG awards, which focus entirely on performances, are closely watched as an indicator of Oscar success because actors form the largest voting group in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Sexual harassment drama Bombshell went into Sunday's awards with a leading four nods for its story of how misconduct allegations by women in 2016 led to the ouster of Fox News network founder Roger Ailes. Ailes denied the multiple accusations from female staffers and died a year later. Charlize Theron, who underwent hours in make-up to transform her appearance for her role as former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, is one of the favorites for best actress.

However, Rene Zellweger has picked up most of the prizes so far for her performance as a desperate, aging Judy Garland in biopic Judy. A win at SAG later on Sunday after a Golden Globe earlier this month will further boost her chances for a second Oscar next month.

Joaquin Phoenix, who played a terrifying loner in Joker and Adam Driver, who played a divorced father in Marriage Story are competing for best actor, along with Leonardo DiCaprio for the nostalgic “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.”

184,2020/01/20,"Indian Nursing Council syllabus permits arts stream students, upsets professionals and academics","The Indian Nursing Council’s (INC) draft rules to revise the syllabus has upset professionals. The syllabus, available on its website, has opened the doors to students from arts and commerce streams.

“The Council has created a curriculum, which is the purview of the university,” said A. Jayasudha, principal of PSG College of Nursing. She also wondered at the wisdom of permitting students without a science background to take up nursing.

Students of Nursing study anatomy, physiology and microbiology. They are expected to not only assist the doctor but also administer treatment (such as providing injections or dressing wounds) and must have thorough knowledge of the subject to be able to carry out their job.

The INC syllabus has also prescribed applied anatomy, physiology and microbiology. “The INC is talking of a bridge course but unless the students complete a year’s bridge course they would not be able to cope with the rigours of the course,” she pointed out.

A member of the State nursing council said the syllabus is decided based on the requirement of the local population. “The National Health Mission has proposed to permit nursing students lateral entry in to MBBS. How will students from non-science background cope with the course,” asked a nursing council member.

The Principal of Omayal Achi College of Nursing S. Kanchana has written to the State Nursing Council and the INC expressing her reservations. She pointed out that even paramedical courses such as pharmacy and physiotherapy accepted only science stream students at the entry level.

“If we have two different disciplines of entry level then planning the teaching, learning process and matching the learning experiences cannot be fulfilled. We will be creating only robots with incongruent theoretical information and not nurses with human values,” she wrote.

University officials pointed out that when it was difficult for even the science stream students to grasp the subjects students from other streams of education would have greater difficulty to study the subject in the limited time frame the course offered.

Sudha Seshayyan Vice Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Dr. MGR Medical University said there were lacunae in the draft rules that needed to be addressed. The issue would be placed before its Board of Studies, which has experts in nursing education before any decision is taken, she added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/indian-nursing-council-syllabus-permits-arts-stream-students-upsets-professionals-and-academics/article30607637.ece
185,2020/01/20,IAF positions BrahMos-armed SU-30MKIs at Thanjavur,"The Indian Air Force inducted a squadron of Sukhoi-30 MKI fighter planes, with the capability to carry BrahMos missiles, at its Thanjavur airbase on Monday. To begin with, five to six SU-30MKI fighter planes with the capability to carry BrahMos Air Launched Cruise Missile would be positioned at the Air Force Station, Thanjavur, and the full capacity of 18 planes would be reached on a later date, gradually.

With the SU-30MKI Squadron getting positioned in Thanjavur, the Indian Air Force would get more air power to strike from long stand off ranges on any target at sea or on land with accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.

The 222 Squadron, also known as Tigersharks, was raised in September 1969 at Ambala, and was moved to Halwara in 1971. It was deployed in active combat operations in the 1971 war. Later it was moved back to Ambala in 1975 and from there to Hindon in 1985. Four years later the Squadron was moved back to Hasimara and stayed there till January 5, 2020, officials said.

Addressing the Air Force personnel at the “Tigersharks” induction ceremony, the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat called upon the Squadron to operate in close coordination with the Navy and Army as the Su-30MKI fighter planes with BrahMos missile was going to be a game changer for the Indian Armed Forces.

Addressing the media later, General Bipin Rawat said that the Armed Forces have been asked to be in a state of readiness. Responding to a question on whether there was any possibility of a war in the near future, especially in the wake of Pakistan’s attitude towards India, he said that though he could not predict a war, the Armed Forces have been told to be in a state of readiness.

Replying to another question on his elevation as CDS, Bipin Rawat said his prime role would be to coordinate with the three Armed Forces for effective utilization of resources available with each of them, for the protection of the Nation.

Responding to a question, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria, said that though there was no proposal for setting up of additional permanent bases in Southern region, temporary or local detachments may come up.

Tamil Nadu already has in place a screening mechanism for influenza-like illnesses, and doctors have been told to stay alert, look out for symptoms of respiratory infections, fever and cough and ask for the travel history of patients, according to K. Kolandaswamy, director of public health.

“Influenza-like illness is under watch in Tamil Nadu, and we have a history-taking system in place for any infectious disease. Now, we have told doctors to focus on symptoms of influenza-like illness, whether or not a patient has travel history and provide prompt treatment. People with such symptoms should report to the nearest health facility,” he added.

Health officials said the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has instructed airports that have direct connecting flights to China such as Delhi to have thermal scanners to screen travellers from China as a precautionary measure.

“The international airport in Chennai is already screening passengers for influenza-like illness, and has a self-reporting system too,” he added.

The Union Health Ministry, in a travel advisory issued earlier, said that travellers to China should follow simple public health measures at all times such as observe good personal hygiene, practise frequent hand washing with soap, cover mouth when coughing or sneezing, avoid close contact with persons who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness, and to wear a mask in case of respiratory symptoms of cough and runny nose.

The advisory asked all travellers to China, in particular to Wuhan city, to monitor their health closely. If a person felt sick on the flight while returning to India, he/she should inform the airlines crew about the illness, seek masks from the crew and follow their directions while disembarking. They should report to airport health authorities/immigration and follow the direction of the airport health officer.

188,2020/01/20,Police offer to two-wheeler riders wearing helmet,"Two-wheeler riders, who have been long wanting to escape the detour from Ambedkar Circle to the District Collectorate have finally got an offer from the Salem city police. Motorcycle riders wearing helmets can now ride straight to the Collectorate via Mullavadi level-crossing escaping several kilometres of detour to reach government offices here.

The City Police has been conducting various awareness programmes to improve rates of traffic rule compliance among motorists here.

The city police has also increased vehicle checks at important points in the city to primarily check helmet-less riding.

During the end of November, the police stopped two-way traffic via Mulluvadi level-crossing after severe congestion was noticed at the area when gates are closed and opened due to flyover works in the adjacent lane. Vehicles moving towards the Collectorate from Hasthampatti via Sundar Lodge and Mulluvadi level-crossing was diverted from Sundar Lodge Junction via Tamil Sangam Road, Shankar Nagar, and Anna Park to reach Collectorate.

Following this, the police also introduced helmet zone from Ambedkar Circle to Anna Park to improve helmet rule compliance.

Motorists without helmets were not allowed in this route and they had to take a detour of three to four kms to reach the Collectorate and nearby areas.

Public here have been requesting city police to open two-way traffic in Mulluvadi level-crossing as it was the shortest route to reach Collectorate for motorists from Hasthampatti and Maravaneri. However, the City Police has introduced helmet zone in the stretch as well and a short designated lane has been allotted for two-wheeler riders wearing helmets from Ambedkar Circle to Mulluvadi level-crossing.

Deputy Police Commissioner (Crime and Traffic) S. Senthil said that following introduction of helmet zones, helmet rule compliance has improved in the city.

“It has been almost a month since the zones were introduced and the rate of helmet rule compliance has increased. Considering public requests to allow two-way traffic via Mulluvadi level-crossing, we have introduced a zone there as well and only riders with helmets are allowed through it,” he said.

Mr. Senthil said that some people despite hanging a helmet in the vehicle, are reluctant to wear it and added that awareness is given and they are also made to wear helmet.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/spkdwk/article30602845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SA20-HELMET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/police-offer-to-two-wheeler-riders-wearing-helmet/article30602846.ece

“My first, and also earnest, attempt, which continues till today, is to decriminalise everything which has to do with company law or related law,” she said, while delivering the Nani Palkhivala Centenary lecture on the topic ‘Road map to $5 trillion economy’. The lecture was organised by the Palkhivala Foundation in Chennai.

She pointed out that there were a number of sections in company law that led to a criminal approach, i.e., penalties or even jail terms. The government also wanted to ensure that other legislations like the Income Tax Act or the Prevention of Money Laundering Act did not have such an impact, she added.

Ms. Sitharaman was responding to the remark made by Tata Sons Chairman N. Chandrasekaran during the Nani Palkhivala Memorial lecture in Mumbai last week, that there was micromanagement and suspicion, and what the industry needed was supervision and not suspicion. “I am impressed by Chandrasekaran’s remarks. The path to a $5 trillion economy would be a lot easier if there is a lot more trust between government and businesses,” she said.

The Finance Minister gave a broader prospective about hitting the $5 trillion economy target, and towards this end, highlighted reforms like the GST and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, the divestment of public sector units and professionalisation of public sector banks, among others.

Responding to a query from the audience on the credibility of government data and the decision to withhold the release of some data, Ms. Sitharaman said it was a strange situation when people tended to cite one set of data, which was questioned based on the methodology, to question the entire data set of the government.

190,2020/01/20,"Imposters threatened TDP politician, demanded bribe","The two imposters arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday on charges of posing as officers of the Central agency and demanding huge bribes from the accused in bank fraud cases had threatened senior politician and four-time Telugu Desam Party MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao with dire consequences.

Investigation revealed that one of the suspects Y. Manivardhan Reddy of Hyderabad made several calls to the mobile phone of Mr. Rao and offered to help him in the bank fraud case.

Last month, the CBI registered a case against the senior politician and others on charges of cheating the Union Bank of India of several crores.

Reddy and his associate Selvam Ramaraj of Madurai made several calls to the mobile number of the former MP, who was the Director and Promoter Chairman of Transtroy (India) Ltd, and offered to help in settling the case in his favour. The duo used a malicious software to spoof the landline number of CBI Headquarters, New Delhi. They made it appear as if they had high-level connections with officials in the agency. In the first week of January, Reddy met Mr. Rao at his Guntur residence and demanded bribe on behalf of a senior CBI officer.

He threatened him of serious consequences if the money was not paid in two days.

Complaint by informant

However, the CBI’s First Information Report (FIR) against the duo was not based on any complaint lodged by the former MP, but by an informant.

Further investigation revealed that Reddy and Ramrajatala collected money from different people in the name of senior Central government functionaries, promising them of favourable action in their cases.

The balloon is expected to reach an altitude of 20 kilometres.

To commemorate the Golden Jubilee of NDRF and the centenary year of Institution of Engineers (India), a national payload design contest for school students was announced on August 30, 2019. The idea was to provide school students an opportunity to design and launch their payloads.

The contest was open to students from classes 8 to 12. Student teams of a maximum of 5 members each were encouraged to propose innovative payload ideas with the condition that it should not exceed 3.8 cubic cm in size and 50 grams in weight.

Teams from about 250 schools across India participated in the initial round of the contest and the NDRF selected 12 teams from Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh and Goa for the launch on Sunday.

NDRF Chairman and Vice-President of Tamil Nadu State Council for Science and Technology, Mylswami Annadurai said, “We have to inculcate higher level of interest about space technology among school students as India has been emerging as power hub for space technology. As part of the contest, students have been given an opportunity to launch satellite (payload) in high altitude using a helium balloon.”

Minister for Higher Education, K.P. Anbalagan urged scientists and researchers working in higher education institutions and research labs in Tamil Nadu to get involved in research based on the needs of society, which would enhance the standard of living of the people.

Their research should address issues like increasing agriculture production, improvisation in industry and framing methods to preserve hygiene and environment, he added.

“Advancements in science and technology play a significant role in the development of key sectors in our country, like agriculture, industry, fisheries and animal husbandry. Developments in science and technology are related to the growth of higher education,” he added.

Enrolment ratio

Chancellor of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), G. Viswanathan, in his presidential address said Tamil Nadu is the number one State in higher education in the country with a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of about 50%, which is double the GER of India.

“It was late Chief Minister K. Kamarajar who laid the foundation for development of school education in Tamil Nadu and late Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran laid the foundation for development of higher education, due to which the State stands number one in India in the education sector.” he said.

“Tamil Nadu is one of the forefront States in India which has contributed a lot for space research. I hope students will learn science seriously so that we will not only as a State, but also as a country be the leader in the study of science. India has been one of the best countries in the world for space research,” he added.

Vice-President, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Sankar Viswanathan, Registrar, VIT, K. Sathiyanarayanan, and founder of Space Kidz India, Srimathi Kesan, also took part in the event.

The move was detrimental to the interests of Sri Lankan Tamils, he said on Sunday.

In a series of social media posts, Dr. Ramadoss said there was every chance that the funds would be used to oppress the Sri Lankan Tamils

196,2020/01/20,Take policy decision against hydrocarbon projects: Stalin,"DMK president M.K. Stalin on Sunday demanded that the Centre recall a recent order removing the need for obtaining mandatory environmental clearance and eliciting public opinion for launching hydrocarbon projects.

In a statement, Mr. Stalin said Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami should urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to recall the order, and a policy decision against hydrocarbon projects should be taken by the Tamil Nadu Cabinet when it meets on Monday.

‘Land of chemicals’

“The Centre has already given permission to private companies to carry out as many as 341 hydrocarbon exploration projects at a cost of ₹20,000 crore. The Centre shouldn’t pass orders that would convert the Cauvery delta agricultural zone into a land of chemicals,” he said.

Mr. Stalin further said the order will lead to severe environmental degradation and turn the Cauvery delta region into a desert.

“Removing the mandate for environmental clearances and seeking the opinion of the people while implementing hydrocarbon projects will only affect the environment and [hurt] the sentiments of the people in the area. The BJP-led Central government is working in a corporate style, and the DMK condemns this decision,” he said.

“Despite stating that it wouldn’t allow hydrocarbon projects in Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK government has not taken any measures, and has been delaying the adoption of a policy decision against them. It has not even advised the District Collectors against granting permission for hydrocarbon projects,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/take-policy-decision-against-hydrocarbon-projects-stalin/article30602679.ece
197,2020/01/20,"It’s unconstitutional for States not to implement CAA, says Sitharaman","“If the State governments say they won’t implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, it is unconstitutional,” Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said.

Addressing an event organised by the Chennai Citizens’ Forum and the New India Forum on Sunday, she said, “They (political parties) can make a political statement; if they are going to pass a resolution [against the CAA] in the Assembly, they can do it. But when it is passed in Parliament, they need to implement it. If they say they won’t, it is against the Constitution.”

According to her, in the last six years, 2,838 people from Pakistan, 914 from Afghanistan and 172 from Bangladesh had been given Indian citizenship, and they included Muslims. Citing the Home Ministry’s data, she said 566 Muslims from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh had been granted citizenship since 2014.

“For those who allege that one section or one community won’t get citizenship may please see this data (sic). From 2016 to 2018, under [Narendra] Modi’s government, 1,595 Pakistani migrants and 391 from Afghanistan have been given citizenship. There is no truth to the allegation that one section will be denied citizenship. We should understand that CAA is [meant] to grant people citizenship and not take it away from them,” Ms. Sitharaman said.

As for Sri Lankan Tamils living in camps, she said, “Nearly four lakh Sri Lankan Tamils were given citizenship from 1964 till 2008. There are many who want to politicise this issue. But instead of doing that, they can ask us questions, and we will certainly answer them.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/10wwqd/article30602668.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20PTI1192020000113A,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/its-unconstitutional-for-states-not-to-implement-caa-says-sitharaman/article30602669.ece

Students leaders who spoke at the programme said that 70% of population in the country are poor and belong to under-privileged sections of the society, who do not have documents to produce as proof of citizenship.

Professor PL Vishweshwar Rao too stressed that a register on unemployed, children who dropped out from schools, children living on streets, number of hospitals, number of people who receive water, is needed.

A contesting candidate said that the election campaigning has become a very prestigious one in the municipal elections. “We have to show our strength by mobilising the public for electioneering.

He said KCR was afraid of facing the jobless youth who were not paid the promised Unemployment Allowance of ₹ 3,016 since December 2018.

Following a complaint lodged by Mr. Sravan on May 28 last year, the BC Commission had directed the vice chancellors of all the 23 NLUs in December 2019 to appear before the Commission to explain the ad hoc manner in which admissions were conducted.

A bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy, hearing a PIL petition on construction of temple in park land, said the authorities can pull down if a structure was built illegally. They can even seek the help of the police for demolition, the bench observed. With the counsel for the temple trust presenting to the court that the deity in the temple was a juristic person, the bench directed that the deity be made one of the respondents in the place.

The temple trust counsel told the court that no new temple was built at the said place but only renovations were being made to the temple already existing there. The village sarpanch had already written a letter to the Endowments authorities conveying this information. However, the bench said that the village sarpanch did not have powers to take a call on the matter.

The counsel submitted to the court that the temple was not built for an individual’s benefit but to serve interests of all the people. However, the CJ made it clear that a structure built without permissions from the authorities concerned had to be pulled down irrespective of the motive behind the construction.

The bench sought to know what permissions were secured under the GHMC Act to construct the temple.

The State Election Commission has notified elections to 2,727 wards in 120 municipalities and 325 divisions in nine corporations for which January 22 is the polling day. The election to Karimnagar Municipal Corporation with 60 divisions would be held on January 24 as notification for the corporation was delayed by a couple of days because of a court case.

The SEC has set up 6,325 polling stations for the 120 municipalities and 1,438 polling stations for the nine municipal corporations which are going to polls on January 22. Elaborate security arrangements had been made in all the urban local bodies that are going to polls and restrictions under Section 144 had been imposed in areas surrounding the polling stations.

More than 12,900 candidates are in the fray for the 2,727 wards in 120 municipalities and 325 divisions in municipal corporations that are going to polls. Though the election authorities have not revealed information regarding the candidates elected unopposed, 69 candidates of the Telangana Rashtra Samiti and three of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen are said to be elected unanimously.

Hectic campaigning was on for almost two weeks as all the major political parties including the TRS, the Congress and the BJP took it as prestige issue. While TRS working president and Minister K.T. Rama Rao supervised the campaign and strategy of the ruling party and State Congress president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy and MP A. Revanth Reddy led the campaign on its behalf.

Buoyed by the success in the Lok Sabha elections when the party secured four seats, BJP state president K. Lakshman conducted road shows in some municipalities as part of the party’s campaign.

A significant feature of the campaign was the participation of all the Ministers who conducted whirlwind tours in the urban local bodies that are going to polls in their respective districts.The Ministers, according to sources, had been entrusted the responsibility of ensuring the party’s victory in all the municipalities and corporations by the TRS leadership and they had accordingly conducted vigorous campaign for the party’s nominees.

207,2020/01/20,Telangana youth urged to participate in municipal polls,"It is not enough for youth to participate in national elections and state elections only as local body polls too are equally important considering municipal bodies deal with key civic infrastructure of roads, drains, streetlighting, sanitation, public health, safety and other basic amenities, said State Election Authority for urban local body (ULB) elections and Director of Municipal Administration T.K. Sridevi on Monday.

Addressing students at the CBIT engineering college as part of the voters awareness campaign being taken up across the municipal regions, she said that if young and first time voters do not participate in the voting it only meant they are not taking part in the decision making process.

Urging them to become ‘ambassadors of democracy’, she pointed out that “democracy provides for negotiation and by voting you are improving your negotiating power. Our country is one of the youngest nations in demographic terms and if youth show apathy, then there’s no redemption.”

The Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department has made lot of efforts this year to increase the voters awareness, she said and expected the voters slip distribution by the municipal bodies going for polls to be efficient enough to make people come out and vote in large numbers.

Ms. Sridevi said there were quite a few municipal bodies in the suburbs going for polls and students studying in some of the educational institutions around are residents and hence, as voters they should exercise their franchise without fail.

“It is not enough to have 70% voting percentage for municipalities when it is above 90% in panchayat polls. We need to increase the figure because as many as 129 ULBs are going to polls this time compared to 56 last time,” she exhorted.

The top five municipalities with high voting percentages in the last ULB polls in 2014 are — Ibrahimpatnam – 86.37%, Narsampet – 85.52%, Husnabad – 85.09%, Madhira – 84.27% and Ieeja – 84.20% . The lows are in — Adilabad – 59.42%, Mancherial – 65.93%, Badangpet – 67.47%, Kamareddy – 67.62 and Metpally – 68.16%.

Among municipal corporations poll percentage has been — Nizamabad – 54.88%, Karimnagar – 59.62% and Ramagundam – 67.40%.

208,2020/01/20,Paytm launches All-in-One QR,"Paytm has launched ‘All-in-One QR’ on Monday which enables merchants to accept unlimited payments through Paytm wallet, Rupay cards, any third party UPI, at zero % fee. Addressing a press conference held in Hyderabad on Monday, vice-president of Paytm, Saurabh Sharma, said that they have launched it concurrently in eight cities across the country.

“A customer has options to pay through Paytm wallet, Rupay cards, Paytm UPI and any other third-party UPI,” Mr Sharma said.

Out of the 210 million digital transaction users in India in 2019 (financial year), 150 million were through Paytm. The payment platform intends to bring on board 1.5 million merchants from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in the next six-months.

The ‘Paytm Business Katha’ complements the All-in-One QR by giving an option to the payment platform’s merchant partners to maintain digital ledgers of customer transactions including cash and credit. Merchants can set payment due date for credit transactions and send automated reminders. Customers will receive a notification with their billing history.

Besides, ‘Paytm for Business’ was also introduced which can be used by merchants to view, manage all transactions. “Settlements can be triggered to merchant’s bank account instantly,” Mr Sharma said.

To deepen engagement with merchants, ‘Soundbox’ is provided.” There are times when merchants do not receive SMS confirming that a transaction is fulfilled owing to latency in network. This transaction will be in limbo. There will be times when four to five customers scan All-in-one QR concurrently. It will be difficult for merchants to reconcile the transactions. So we developed the ‘Soundbox’,” he said. After payment is completed, the device replays the payment advise in vernacular language.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/paytm-launches-all-in-one-qr/article30608919.ece
209,2020/01/20,"Medaram Jatara: MLA to give away 10,000 cloth bags","In order to discourage use of plastic bags and ensure a plastic-free Sammakka Sarakka Jatara, the Warangal West MLA and chief whip D Vinay Bhaskar said he would be distributing 10,000 cloth bags to devotees proceeding to Medaram.

Disclosing this to newsmen here on Monday, he said free distribution of cloth bags would be arranged at bus stands from February 1 to 5. The biennial historic tribal fair Sammakka Sarakka Jatara at Medaram village in Tadvai mandal is scheduled to be held from February 5 to 8. About one crore devotees are expected to attend the four-day jatara from different parts of the country.

“We will distribute the bags to devotees free of cost at the pick-up points of buses bound for Medaram from February 1 to February 5. The NGOs should also take up the initiative to spread awareness among the people not to carry plastic material to Medaram. Nature has a special place in our festivals. That is why we worship trees, animals and birds. The Medaram Jatara is celebrated in a forest. We must strive not to disturb the forest or biodiversity,” he said.

Mr Vinay Bhaskar criticised the Central government for not giving Medaram Jatara national festival status. “The Telangana government is doing everything to ensure that the Jatara is conducted successfully every time. But the Central government is not showing any concern at all towards Asia’s biggest tribal festival. Even after repeated appeals, it is remaining silent over the issue,” he complained.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/medaram-jatara-mla-to-give-away-10000-cloth-bags/article30608856.ece
210,2020/01/20,"Leopard strays into Shadnagar town, captured","A leopard which had created a scare in the surrounding villages by its cattle killing spree, has been successfully captured on Monday, when it walked into Shadnagar town and found itself a rooftop to doze off.

The family members of Manne Vijay Kumar were frightened out of their wits when the leopard was found napping behind planter bins on their terrace, where a family stayed in a penthouse with two children. “In fact, the two children spotted the animal first, when they noticed the tail, and approached to explore. Upon noticing the leopard, they ran to their parents, who called the police control room,” related District Forest Officer, Rangareddy, Bheema Naik. The police, after verifying the claim from a neighbouring terrace, alerted the Forest Department.

The rescue team from Nehru Zoological Park headed by Deputy Director (Veterinary) M.A. Hakim, which arrived from Hyderabad, encountered an unexpected sight. Hundreds of people thronged the surroundings where the feline was spotted, making the rescue all the more difficult.

“By the time we reached, the leopard had woken up, climbed down the terrace and hid beneath the stair case. Rescue operation proved to be very difficult, with curious crowds trailing us wherever we went,” said Dr. Hakim. The police had difficult time tackling the crowds, even after asking the residents in the neighbourhood to stay indoors through the rescue operation.

The team could gain entry into the kitchen, from where they shot the tranquilliser dart through the window.

After being shot, the feline ran for some distance, and collapsed on the premises of another house under construction, from where it was captured using nets. While dashing for cover, the animal hit a police constable trying to control the crowds, injuring him in the process, Mr. Naik informed.

“It is a young male of four to five years of age, and found to be under stress. We have brought it to the zoo park, and kept it under observation. If all is well, we will release it into the forests after 48 hours,” Dr. Hakim said. The leopard is suspected to be the same animal which had been marauding the surrounding villages for three to four months, and lifting cattle, Mr. Naik informed. It is believed to have strayed from the Kammadanam forest block nearby in search of prey or water.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/t7z5z0/article30608823.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21LEOPARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/leopard-strays-into-shadnagar-town-captured/article30608824.ece

212,2020/01/20,Irate chilli farmers ransack market yard,"Scores of chilli farmers went on a rampage damaging computers and furniture at the Enumamula Agricultural market protesting the sudden drop in procurement price of chilli here on Monday.

Chilli produce this year commanded a phenomenal price of ₹ 18,000 to ₹ 20,600 per quintal. The price offered to farmers on Friday was ₹ 20,600 per quintal and on Monday, the traders offered only ₹ 18,000 per quintal. Enraged at the sudden drop of over ₹ 2,000 per quintal, the farmers ran amok ransacking the office at the market. They staged a protest demonstration and halted the procurement by traders for half a day.

On learning the ongoing disturbance at the market, the market committee chairman Ch Sadanandam and police rushed to the spot. They pacified the frenzied mob of farmers and held discussions with them.

The market officials enquired the procurement price of chilli across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The procurement price at the famous Guntur market was only ₹ 12,000 per quintal. The officials told the farmers that they still stood in good stead with ₹ 18,000 per quintal. The price fluctuation was due to international market conditions and increased arrivals at the market.

On Monday alone, over 10,000 bags of chilli arrived at the Enumamula Agricultural Market forcing the officials to procure all the produce and increased arrival slowed the process of procurement.

Though Enumamula market is meant for the farmers of erstwhile Warangal district, the farmers from neighbouring districts and even from far off places bring their produce here expecting high price. The chilli procurement price at the market slowly witnessed a rise from ₹ 7,000 to ₹ 20,600 for the Teja variety and good price for other varieties as well. However, on Monday, the price dropped by ₹ 2,600 per quintal resulting in unrest among the farmers.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/plr9d7/article30608598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21CHILLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/irate-chilli-farmers-ransack-market-yard/article30608599.ece

215,2020/01/20,Plan to port all government online services to single platform,"After putting in place the necessary infrastructure to shift the State wide area network (SWAN) and Secretariat campus network (SCAN) to the new secretariat premises — Burgula Ramakrishna Rao Bhavan — the Information Technology Department has now focused on bringing all the online applications under one roof.

Though a major chunk of applications have already been brought under the purview of the State Data Centre, online services pertaining to the Panchayat Raj and Rural Development, Commercial Taxes and few other departments are yet to come on to the platform. These services are presently being offered through the online services platform created and maintained by the Tata Consultancy Services.

Senior officials of the department held discussions with a team of TCS professionals on the steps that should be taken to integrate these services with the State Data Centre. “Steps have been initiated to segregate services that are being offered through other platforms and link them with the State Data Centre,” a senior official told The Hindu.

Work in this direction is expected to be started soon and “it will take a few days for us to link them to the State Data Centre”, the official said.

Shifting delayed

Shifting of the SWAN and SCAN from the old secretariat premises has, however, been kept on hold after the government has invited applications pertaining to the layout regularization scheme online and other applications relating to the Public Service Commission as these services are hosted on the state wide area network. “Shifting of the network may require switching off the network till the time its functioning from the new premises is tested,” the official said.

The shifting process has therefore been kept on hold to ensure that there is no interruption in the receipt of the LRS applications. Another major factor that had to be addressed was setting up of backup mechanism for the online systems.

There was strong backup mechanism in place for the applications with public interface. However, there were some issues that should be looked into in the backup mechanism related to non-public interface applications including those like inter-departmental communications. “The department is engaged in putting in place a strong backup mechanism for these applications too and it will be set up in a matter of few days,” the official said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6kpz7b/article30610155.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY21BURGULARAMAKRISHNARAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/plan-to-port-all-government-online-services-to-single-platform/article30608230.ece

219,2020/01/20,‘BJP popularity increasing by the day’,"“BJP’s popularity in the State is increasing by the day and TRS is unable to digest it. Therefore, the ruling party is trying its best to win the Nizamabad Municipal Corporation (NMC) by hook or the crook,” said party president K. Laxman.

Appealing to people to not believe the TRS as voting for it would be equivalent to voting for its ally MIM, he said that BJP was the only alternative to TRS. “In the current municipal elections, people will give a fitting reply to the ruling party,” he said.

“If BJP candidates are elected, they will work as public servants and not corporators or rulers,” he said while addressing a roadshow here on Sunday.

“If you want to prevent the MIM from making Nizamabad another Darussalam, you should vote for BJP,” he added.

Challenging MA&UD minister K.T. Rama Rao for a public debate on funds being given by the Centre, he said that TRS was developing the State only with Central funds.

Talking to the media later, he said that people were vexed with the TRS governance as it failed to keep its promises. “As they don’t have a face to come before the public, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and his son KTR are not campaigning,” he said.

Dr. Laxman also said that Mission Bhagiratha was a failed project and TRS could not keep its promise of providing taps to every household. MP D. Arvind, former MLA Y. Laxminarayana, BJP district president P. Ganga Reddy, executive members D. Suryanarayana and B. Laxminarsaiah were present.

220,2020/01/20,A lesser-known but equally fascinating Nagoba Jatara,"The Nagoba Jatara at Keslapur in Adilabad’s Indervelli mandal is known the world over as a mega tribal carnival, but few would know that it is simultaneously celebrated in Chalbadi village of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.

The former is a huge religious and cultural event of the Boigutta branch of Mesram clan of the aboriginal Raj Gond and Pardhan tribes, while the latter is celebrated at a much smaller scale but with equal gusto, hosted by the family of Korenga Govind Rao, a resident of Chalbadi located about 5 km from the Hatti-Jodeghat road and popular for production of bio-electricity in the early 2000s.

Understanding nature

Both events denote the Adivasis’ understanding of nature and the way they adjust to make co-existence with animals a peaceful affair. If the snake god Shri Shek, more famously known as Nagoba, is the clan god of the Mesrams, the Chalbadi Nagoba is worshipped by different clans of Raj Gonds and Pardhans.

“It was in 1997 that we first noticed the ant hill and the cobra in our home in the village. The anthills grew in number gradually and the visitations of the snake increased,” recalls Govind Rao about the incidents related with formation of the temple which is a makeshift structure.

“We assumed that the serpent god needed the place and hence, we abandoned our home,” shares Govind Rao’s wife Marubai, who looks after the temple. “All these are naturally formed anthills, the homes of Nagoba which we worship,” she adds pointing to the raised mud structures which make for a beautiful sight.

The Nagoba puja at the Chalbadi temple starts on January 24, the day of new moon, as does the mahapuja at Keslapur Nagoba temple. The Korenga family also organises annadanam or community meal programme for all those who come for puja.

“We also organise kabaddi competitions for the youth from surrounding villages. Most of the teams are from villages that lie on the Hatti-Jodeghat road but some teams also come from other villages in the mandal,” Govind Rao says.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bxzw3b/article30602324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19-NAGOBA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/a-lesser-known-but-equally-fascinating-nagoba-jatara/article30602316.ece
221,2020/01/20,Work on Kaloji Kalakshetram to resume,"Work on the Kaloji Kalakshetram, a multi-purpose cultural centre being constructed in Hanamkonda in memory of renowned poet Kaloji Narayana Rao, is expected to resume shortly.

Construction of the project, for which foundation stone was laid by Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao in 2014, had been almost abandoned midway. But clearing the air about its future, vice-chairman of State Planning Commission Boinapally, Vinod Kumar said progress was hit by fund crunch as the government diverted funds of all other projects to Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project. However, the authorities have now made alternative arrangements to fund the project and will ensure that it is completed soon.

Mr. Vinod Kumar, along with Chief Whip Dasyam Vinay Bhaskar, visited the construction site in Balasamudram on Sunday and inspected the extent of work completed.

Justifying the priority attached to the irrigation project, he said, “It needed to be completed before the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Act was passed and time was the essence. Providing water to the State is also a promise made by the Chief Minister and Kaleshwaram project is the answer.”

He added that Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao has “immense respect towards imminent personalities hailing from Warangal” which is why he named Telangana’s health university in the name of Kaloji Narayana Rao. He said the university has gained more reputation abroad than its parent university after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh and creation of separate Telangana State.

Mr. Vinay Bhaskar said the local public representatives have taken the issue of the incomplete project to the notice of the Chief Minister, who immediately made provisions to use the funds of Kakatiya Urban Development Authority for the purpose.

“In the erstwhile State, Kaloji Foundation had no place to set up a memorial but the Chief Minister has approved a world class cultural centre to be set up in Warangal to support artists. With the issue of fund crunch solved, the city would soon house the best cultural centre in the State,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/1q49rb/article30602301.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY19-KALOJIKALAKENDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/work-on-kaloji-kalakshetram-to-resume/article30602302.ece

The case has been registered under Sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Indian Penal Code.

Mr. Sharma said another case against 125 persons had been registered for violating prohibitory orders under Section 144.

On Sunday, when more than a hundred BJP workers took out a rally supporting the CAA in Biaora of Rajgarh district without permission, the SDM and Deputy Collector, Priya Verma, tried to disperse them reportedly using force.

Video on social media

In a video doing the rounds on social media, Ms. Verma can be seen dragging the workers by collars to be taken away by the police. During the struggle, a person is seen pulling her ponytail from behind.

In another video, District Collector Nidhi Nivedita is seen slapping BJP’s local media in-charge Ravi Badone. Later, police personnel tried to quell an angry mob advancing in.

The workers, led by former MLAs Amar Singh Yadav and Mohan Sharma, and district party unit president Dilbar Singh Yadav, claimed that the police had also resorted to lathicharge.

On Monday, a fact-finding team of the BJP, led by MLA and former Minister Vishvas Sarang, visited the spot. “The officials acted on the direction of Congress leaders. It was all scripted,” he told The Hindu.

Mr. Sarang claimed that the BJP workers were assaulted on a temple premises where they were singing bhajans and spreading “awareness” on the law. “Even the Tricolours they held were snatched away. The scene represented the Jallianwala Bagh massacre,” he alleged.

226,2020/01/20,Holding caste census will end Hindu-Muslim fights: Akhilesh,"Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Monday said the BJP government was not conducting a caste census in the country along with the usual population count as doing so would bring an end to the “squabble” between Hindus and Muslims.

Mr. Yadav said that like the previous Congress governments, the present ruling party had also decided against conducting a caste census (of OBC population).

“We wanted caste census but Congress didn't allow it. It won't happen, we are not being counted again. And the reason is because they know the day caste census takes place in this country, the squabble between Hindus and Muslims will end,” he said.

The SP chief has been regularly making the pitch for a caste census.

Addressing an event at the party headquarters here in Lucknow, the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said not only would the caste census prevent conflict between Hindus and Muslims, it would also heal the relationship between the Yadavs and the non-Yadav Other Backward Classes communities.

“If castes are counted, nobody will be upset with the Yadav brothers too,” Mr. Yadav said.

Yadavs are the largest OBC community in U.P. and over the past few years the BJP has gained traction among the rest of the OBCs, constituting over 40% of the State population, by using the anti-Yadav plank, accentuated by the concentration of power in the Mulayam Singh Yadav clan and a rainbow coalition built on Hindutva nationalism.

‘Divide and rule’

Mr. Yadav accused the BJP of following the colonial British tactic of ‘divide and rule’ by making people fight on the basis of castes and religion. He also reiterated his stand against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens, saying they not only discriminated against Muslims but also the poor.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1hj9av/article30609814.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE21-AKHILESH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/holding-caste-census-will-end-hindu-muslim-fights-akhilesh/article30609815.ece
227,2020/01/20,Notice to U.P. government on Allahabad name change,"The Supreme Court has asked the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh to explain its decision to change the name of Allahabad district to ‘Prayagraj.’

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government on Monday on an appeal filed by the Allahabad Heritage Society and others, all represented by advocates Prashant Bhushan and Shadan Farasat.

The name-change happened in a matter of five days in October 2018. There was no evidence to back the government’s claim that it was done with public support. The government had claimed that Prayag was one of the 14 religious places in the ancient texts and the only one whose name was changed to ‘Allahabad.’ However, there is no material to support this claim.

Thirdly, the petition said the Adityanath government believed that the earlier name-change from Prayagraj to Allahabad had led to “confusion” among the national and international communities. The October 2018 decision to revert to Prayagraj has put an end to this confusion.

The appeal said the Allahabad High Court rejected their plea on the ground that the State has the authority to alter the name of any revenue area under the Uttar Pradesh Revenue Code of 2006. But the fact was the State government was required under two Central notifications of September 11, 1953 and May 27, 1981 to get prior concurrence of the Centre to change the name of a district. This was not done here.

Again, the State only had power of administration and revenue over land areas under Schedule VII of the Constitution. It could not change the names of the areas for “non-administrative reasons.” The appeal argued there were no “compelling reasons” for the State government to have changed the name.

“Prayag was the place of confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, which was a holy site of pilgrimage. Allahabad was a city established away from this site of pilgrimage. The site continues to be called Prayag,” the appeal said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/notice-to-up-government-on-allahabad-name-change/article30609590.ece
228,2020/01/20,Manipur tribes call truce after decades of conflict,"Umbrella organisations of two tribes have called a truce in Manipur after almost four decades of violence and uneasy existence.

The conflict between the Nagas and the Kukis in 1993 had claimed more than 230 lives and displaced 1,00,000, mostly Kukis.

The working committee of the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) and the Kuki National Organisation (KNO) have signed a declaration to settle contentious issues and inter-community differences peacefully.

The NNPGs, which has been in talks with New Delhi since 2017, comprises the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Unification), the NSCN (Reformation), the NSCN (Khango), the Naga National Council and two of its factions, and the Federal Government of Nagaland.

The KNO, which is seeking a territorial council in Manipur, is the umbrella body of 17 militant outfits now engaged in peace talks with the Centre.

A joint statement issued by NNPGs convener N. Kitovi Zhimomi and KNO president P.S. Haokip said the two sides signed the declaration after a meeting in Imphal, Manipur’s capital, on January 10.

According to the declaration, the two sides will “work together closely to resolve differences through a democratic political process, and by respecting each other’s history and identity”.

Mr. Haokip said, “When two different political groups are keen on co-existence, they converge towards building peace. We don’t want to be the enemy of anyone. I hope the others will follow suit.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/manipur-tribes-call-truce-after-decades-of-conflict/article30609516.ece
229,2020/01/20,Racket offering remedies for erectile dysfunction busted by Mumbai Police,"The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a racket that raked in lakhs of rupees every month by offering remedies for erectile dysfunction.

Crime Branch officers said police inspector Sunil Mane, in charge of Unit X, received a tip-off that a racket was operating at a fake call centre in Andheri (East). Mr. Mane and his team then conducted a raid at Sumer Plaza on Marol Maroshi Road on the night of January 17.

A Crime Branch officer said, “We found 22 telecallers speaking in a western accent to U.S. citizens. We examined the script they were reading from and found them offering drugs like Viagra, Cialis and Livetra. They were all remedies for erectile dysfunction and available only with a prescription in the U.S. The telecallers were offering the drugs in bulk at discounted rates. They accepted money through online transfer but did not send the drugs.”

The Unit X team seized computers, scripts and documents, and arrested Mudassar Makandar (34) and Ashley D’souza (38), residents of Andheri. The statements of the other employees are being recorded. Officers said the documents showed the accused were also offering controlled drugs such as Tramadol, a painkiller used for gunshot wounds that even Islamic State fighters consume before going to battle.

The officer said, “As Tramadol is easier to procure on the black market than Viagra, we need to find out if the accused were selling the drugs illegally, and how their supply chain worked. If the information is verified, the accused could be booked separately under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.”

The officer said the accused are believed to have been active for five years and making a monthly profit of ₹25 lakh to ₹30 lakh. The Crime Branch is scanning the seized documents and computers to find out if there is any record of the number of people cheated and the money made so far.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/z7clz1/article30609344.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BMMudassar-Makandar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/racket-offering-remedies-for-erectile-dysfunction-busted/article30609346.ece
230,2020/01/20,DGP appointment: Punjab approaches High Court against CAT order,"The Punjab government on Monday approached the Punjab and Haryana High Court against the order of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT), which had set aside the appointment of Dinkar Gupta as the DGP.

A division Bench of justices Rajiv Sharma and Harinder Singh Sidhu allowed the hearing of the matter on Tuesday. Additional advocate general Rameeza Hakim appeared for the State government, while senior advocate Puneet Bali appeared for the DGP.

Last week, the CAT had set aside the appointment following an appeal filed by two IPS officers — Mohammad Mustafa and Siddhharth Chattopadhyaya. Both officers had separately moved the Tribunal last year, seeking quashing of his appointment.

In their plea, the officers had submitted that they were ignored for the post though they were senior to Mr. Gupta and had outstanding service records.

The two-member Bench of Justice L.Narasimha Reddy, Chairman of CAT, and Mohd. Jamshed directed the UPSC and the empanelment committee to form a new panel of three senior-most officers for the appointment within four weeks.

The additional manpower comprises various officials of statistical and evaluation cadre, who have been mandated to verify every project being implemented at the ground level in their respective districts of deployment in both divisions of Jammu and Kashmir, an official spokesman said on Monday.

An order to this effect was issued by the finance department, which envisages the officers and officials to complement other statistical staff already present in the district offices, to ensure verification and monitoring process of all the projects, the spokesman said.

A team of officers and officials of the rank of statistical officers, statistical assistants and junior statistical assistants have been provided to each district for carrying out the assignment, he said.

He also said that the order further directs the DSEOs to work out a plan for 100% verification of all projects implemented in the districts with the assistance of the additional staff.

“The DSEO of every district shall also submit reports to the finance department by the 5th of every month that points out achievements made against the target and shortcomings, if any, found in the projects,” the spokesman added.

He said that the current deployment has been made in the backdrop of an earlier government order, which reorganised and allocated the functions between the finance and statistics departments.

The earlier order was made to strictly monitor and streamline the capital expenditure in each department from administrative to block level to improve outcomes with respect to each unit of the money spent, the spokesman said.

He also added that the current exercise has been carried out to strengthen the institution of monitoring and evaluation from the ground level of the official machinery for bringing transparency, accountability and efficiency in government expenditure.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k-deploys-additional-staff-to-verify-implementation-of-schemes-in-union-territory/article30606061.ece
232,2020/01/20,Three Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists killed in Shopian encounter,"Security forces killed three Hizbul Mujahideen militants in an encounter in south Kashmir’s Shopian on Monday. “Three terrorists were eliminated in a joint operation in Shopian’s Wachi,” said a Srinagar-based Army spokesman.

The Army said all the three slain militants were affiliated to Hizbul Mujahideen. “Weapons and war-like stores recovered,” said the Army.

Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Wacchi area of Shopian district following information about presence of terrorists there, a police official said. He said the terrorists were asked to surrender but they opened fire towards security forces’ positions.

One of the slain terrorists was been identified as Adil Ahmad, a special police officer who had deserted the force in 2018 and decamped with seven AK assault rifles from the official residence of then MLA Wacchi Aijaz Ahmad Mir from Jawahar Nagar area of the city, the official said. The identification of the other two terrorists is being ascertained, he added.

Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Wachi, following information about the presence of militants there, a police official said.

He said the militants were asked to surrender but they opened fire. “In the ensuing encounter, the three militants were killed,” the official said.

One of the slain militants was identified as Adil Ahmad, a special police officer who had deserted the force in 2018. He had decamped with seven AK assault rifles and a pistol from the official residence of then Wachi MLA Aijaz Ahmad Mir from Jawahar Nagar area in Srinagar, the official said.

The other two militants were identified as Waseem Wani and Jahangir, he said.

The DGP said Hizbul Mujahideen is on the “verge of elimination” in south Kashmir.

The police force has made a successful start to 2020, he told reporters.

The operations have been successful due to increased movement of security forces following leads provided by militants arrested along with Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh, now suspended, on January 11, he added.

The DGP said Wani was one of the top-ranking commanders of Hizbul Mujahideen. He was involved in 19 cases, including killings of four civilians and as many policemen.

“Adil was also involved in some of these killings after he deserted the police force in September 2018,” he said.

Mr. Singh said the elimination of this group of militants will remove fear from the minds of people in Shopian and bring closure to the kin of their victims.

Stressing the need for deradicalisation centres, he said some of the radicalised youth, who have been caught by police, did not seem to talk sense sometimes.

234,2020/01/20,"‘Saheb’ is four-time CM, I somehow became Deputy CM four times: Ajit","Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar has said that while his uncle and NCP president Sharad Pawar was the chief minister four times, he also had “somehow” become the deputy CM as many times.

He was speaking at a function in Baramati, his constituency, in Pune district on Saturday. “I am a party worker who has seen saheb (Sharad Pawar) become chief minister four times. I too, somehow, became deputy chief minister four times,” the 60-year-old leader said, evoking laughter from the audience.

“If saheb can be chief minister four times, why can’t I [be Deputy CM],” he said. The NCP leader was deputy chief minister twice in the 15-year rule of the Congress-NCP alliance in Maharashtra from 1999 to 2014.

He was again sworn in to the post on November 23 last year after he rebelled against the NCP and joined hands with the BJP. He resigned three days later on November 26, leading to the collapse of the Devendra Fadnavis-led government.

On December 30 last year, he took oath as Deputy Chief Minister for the fourth time in the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government.

Sharad Pawar was chief minister for the first time from July 1978 to February 1980, and later from June 1988 to March 1990.

236,2020/01/20,Shutdown in Shirdi over Sai Baba birthplace row,"The temple town of Shirdi in Ahmednagar district observed a total shutdown on Sunday in protest against Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s reported statement that Pathri in Parbhani district was Sai Baba’s birthplace.

The bandh was called off late on Sunday, in an announcement by Shiv Sena MP from Shirdi Sadashiv Lokhande after a meeting with locals.

Earlier in the day, while the Sai Baba temple remained open for devotees and tourists, Shirdi’s marketplace and establishments downed shutters in an unprecedented shutdown in the history of the town. The Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust and other social outfits made provisions for tea, breakfast and meals in front of the temple to mitigate the inconvenience to visitors.

Residents of around 25 villages near Shirdi, too, joined ranks to support the bandh.

The Shirdi shutdown was countered by events and demonstrations by residents of Pathri to convince the locals of Shirdi that the Parbhani village was Sai Baba’s birthplace.

Sena MPs split

The controversy created a split in the ranks of the Shiv Sena, with the party’s MPs from Shirdi and Parbhani batting for their regional claims.

While Mr. Lokhande, the Shirdi MP, participated in a protest march in the town, Parbhani MP Sanjay Jadhav countered the claims of the Shri Saibaba Sansthan Trust, saying that the Sri Sai Janmasthan Temple Trust in Parbhani had 29 pieces of proof that Pathri was indeed the saint’s birthplace.

Mr. Lokhande said, “I am a Sai bhakt [devotee] first and then an MP… Sai Baba came to Shirdi when he was 16 years of age. The great man always transcended caste and religion and never revealed his birthplace or caste. I will be talking to the Chief Minister tonight and will be leading a delegation from Shirdi to meet him tomorrow.”

At the same time, he stressed that neither he nor anybody else in Shirdi was opposed to Pathri’s development.

“The Chief Minister has announced a grant of ₹100 crore for Pathri’s development … While I am all for that, the government ought not to say that the Parbhani village was Sai Baba’s birthplace,” the MP said.

Fear of competition

In response to the locals and temple trust authorities of Shirdi, their counterparts in Parbhani have claimed that the former were afraid that the development of Pathri would have a detrimental effect on Shirdi’s economy.

“This is a silly controversy … Every time, we see leaders from western Maharashtra play politics over every issue the moment they sense a threat to the status quo. But this time, we have solid proof in the form of municipal records and other sources that Pathri is indeed Sai Baba’s birthplace. The folks at Shirdi are going to have to accept the truth …Why are they getting worried about their existence if their consciences are clear?” asked Mr. Jadhav.

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and MLC Babajani Durrani, a trustee of the Sri Sai Janmasthan Temple in Parbhani, accused the Shirdi Trust of deliberately doing away with proof that showed Pathri to be the saint’s place of birth.

“Marathwada is the birthplace of many saints, including Dnyaneshwar. There should be no controversy on this issue of Sai Baba’s birth ... In fact, a 1972 biography of Sai Baba published by the Shirdi Sansthan mentions Pathri to be his place of birth. It seems they are worried that if Pathri is developed, Shirdi will not attract the same footfall,” he said.

In Parbhani, a bhajan demonstration was observed in front of the district Collectorate, with locals conducting a ‘Sai Jaagar’ programmes to “awaken” their counterparts in Shirdi to the truth about the saint’s real birthplace.

No bandh in Loni

Ironically, even as 30-odd villages observed a total shutdown, it was business as usual in Loni village, the hometown of Congress-turned-Bharatiya Janata Party leader Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, one of the most vociferous proponents of the bandh.

Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar urged opposing parties to take a conciliatory approach. “The CM has called for a meeting tomorrow, in which both contending parties will present their case. Till that time, it is pointless to hurt anyone’s sentiments without reason,” said Mr. Pawar.

Mr. Chalana, 45, a poor Bonda tribal and a father of six, was taking the girl to Jeypore in Koraput district to give her away.

Mr. Chalana’s wife had died during the seventh childbirth.

Some unidentified person from Lamtaput informed the Koraput DCPO about the issue.

239,2020/01/20,Only 35% penalty recovered for not sharing information under RTI in Haryana,"In what raises doubts about the efficacy of the Right To Information Act in Haryana, of the total ₹3.50 crore penalty imposed on officials for not sharing information, only 35% has been recovered since the setting up of the Haryana State Information Commission in 2006, an RTI reply has revealed.

In a reply to an application by RTI activist P.P. Kapoor, Haryana State Information Commission Under Secretary Yagya Dutt Chugh has revealed that 1,726 defaulters, including many belonging to the Haryana Civil Services cadre, had not paid penalty to the tune of ₹2.27 crore till December 31, 2019. The commission had imposed fine on 2,974 officials against the appeals made to it for not sharing information. Of the total fine imposed, only ₹1.23 has been recovered so far.

The officials are penalised with a maximum penalty of ₹25,000 for intentionally not sharing the information.

Collection under regimes

In terms of collection of penalty under the different political regimes, former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda led Congress government fared better with recovery of 56.06% of the penalty from 2006-2014, while only 29.01% of the total penalty amount was recovered during the five-year tenure of Bharatiya Janata Party government led by Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar from 2014-19.

As per the RTI reply, a total fine of ₹78,56,750 was imposed on 984 officials for defaulting on sharing of information during the Congress government regime till 2014, and ₹44,04,950 was recovered from 530 officials. Similarly, the SIC imposed ₹2,71,97,990 penalty on 1,990 officials during the BJP regime from 2015-19, but only 718 officials paid ₹78,90,866.

List of defaulters

Some of the senior officials among the defaulters are: Bijender Hooda (HCS), Shalini Chetan (then CTM, Hisar), Satinder Siwatch (SDM, Ambala), Bharat Bhushan Gogia (Executive Officer-II, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran), Suresh Kumar Singal (District Revenue Officer, Sonipat) and Prashant Ishkan (Regional Transport Authority, Sirsa).

Mr. Kapoor, a resident of Samalkha in Panipat, expressed concern over the gradual weakening of the RTI Act in the State since the setting up of the commission. He said the officials neither shared the information sought under RTI nor paid the penalty. Seeking effective implementation of the law, Mr. Kapoor demanded that the outstanding penalty dues be collected immediately and an enforcement wing of the SIC be set-up. He also sought the settlement of pending cases through a special campaign.

As per SIC website, the appeals in as many as 3,471 cases are pending before the commission.

240,2020/01/20,A nightmare for 45 M.P. tribal labourers far from home,"When 16-year-old Ajeet Kumar, a school dropout, left home for the first time to work — that too 1,100 km away in Maharashtra — he was certain he’d return with enough to at least pay his younger brother’s school fee. He stuffed two pairs of shirts and pants, a shawl and a blanket in a backpack, his only concern being to somehow keep the cold away while harvesting sugarcane for two months.

But within days of work, the 45 agricultural labourers from Gond and Baiga tribes, including him, escaped into the forest to flee confinement by the contractor, whose men caught them later on a highway. What got them safely back home in Surehali village of Mandla district in Madhya Pradesh from Kolhapur district was Mr. Kumar's mobile phone, and grit.

Bonded labourers

“They told us they bought us for ₹4.5 lakh, and so we were indebted, had to work without protest on any condition, and couldn’t leave,” said Mr. Kumar, whose parents, brother and an elder daughter desperately waited for his return home, as a small plot, on which a decrepit two-room hut now stands, is all they own.

Originally promised ₹400 a day per person, a wage startlingly high and unheard of, the labourers felt betrayed upon reaching fields where only ₹250 was offered for a tonne of harvest. Up in arms, the toli (batch), of 14 women carrying three toddlers, and the rest teenagers above 12 and men, refused to work, as 20 persons could harvest 10-12 tonne a day, which meant a paltry ₹125 for each.

On being caught, while the men bore thrashing with sticks and the women threats of sexual assault, and their phones and ATM cards were snatched, Mr. Kumar, along with four others, managed to sneak back into the forest, and call back home to explain the ordeal using the phone he’d kept hidden.

His father then approached the Ghughri police in Mandla district, which contacted the Ajara police in Kolhapur district, which reportedly facilitated a settlement, and both the police units ensured their return.

On Saturday, wary of outsiders, Surehali residents kept sticks, and bows and arrows ready in case of an attack by the contractors, as they had approached the police. “We don’t know if we’d migrate again for work after this harrowing experience. But then, there are no means of livelihood here,” said Pahal Singh, 32.

“They wanted to leave without harvesting sugarcane and returning the advance amount. They were not held hostage, rather they just wanted to run away. In their statement, there is no mention of thrashing,” claimed Ajara police station in-charge Balaji Bhange. “There is no basis for a case.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/7hld0j/article30602767.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19-TRIBAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/a-nightmare-for-45-mp-tribal-labourers-far-from-home/article30602768.ece
241,2020/01/20,Rajasthan government to move resolution against CAA in House,"The Congress government in Rajasthan has decided to introduce a resolution against implementation of the Centre’s contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the budget session of the State Assembly beginning on January 24.

The session will commence with the customary address of Governor Kalraj Mishra. Official sources said here on Sunday that the resolution was likely to be tabled and passed in the House on the first day of the session.

The Kerala and Punjab Assemblies have passed similar resolutions to build pressure on the Union government following the remarks of Home Minister Amit Shah that the Centre would “not go back an inch” to revoke the legislation even if all the Opposition parties came together.

While the budget is likely to be presented in the second week of February, the Assembly will also ratify the Constitution (126th) Amendment Bill passed by Parliament last month for extending the reservation for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies by another 10 years.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal said the Budget session was being convened early this year because the reservation for SC and ST communities was slated to expire on January 25.

‘Would be opposed’

The Opposition BJP said the State government’s move to bring the resolution against CAA would be “strongly opposed”.

243,2020/01/20,Despite heavy rain in 2019 the Nilgiris witnessed slight increase in tourists,"Despite heavy rain and landslips in the Nilgiris in 2019, the number of visitors to the district actually slightly increased by around 1 lakh visitors, statistics from the tourism and horticulture departments suggest.

Officials from the tourism department said that the figures indicate that that there has been a substantial increase in the number of tourists to the district over the last few years.

“In the last two years alone, numbers released by the horticulture department that the number of visitors to the GBG have increased by around 16 % from 25.53 lakh visitors in 2017 to the current figure,” an official from the tourism department said, adding that the increase points to the enormous draw the Nilgiris continues to have as a tourist destination.

“Despite the heavy rain last year and also landslips prompting negative coverage of the safety of tourists in the Nilgiris, tourists continued to flock to the district, which is definitely a great sign,” added the official, stating that with better infrastructure being planned by the government, including more parking facilities and better roads, the tourism sector can only expect to grow in the coming decade.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/despite-heavy-rain-in-2019-the-nilgiris-witnessed-slight-increase-in-tourists/article30609499.ece
244,2020/01/20,Youth stages hunger strike for education loan,"A 21-year-old youth on Saturday staged a hunger strike in front of a bank near Kangeyam demanding education loan for his higher studies.

G. Abishek aka Hariharan, a first-year diploma student at a private polytechnic college in Coimbatore, staged the protest at the Indian Bank branch located at Paranjervali village in Kangeyam Panchayat Union.

Speaking to The Hindu on Monday over phone, he said that his father met with an accident in 2010 causing prolonged illness and that his mother was psychologically affected by that incident since then.

“I finished my Class X examination in 2015 and worked for two years to support the family,” he said.

After deciding to pursue higher studies, Mr. Abishek said that he enrolled in a civil engineering diploma course at the polytechnic college in Saravanampatti in June 2019. However, he was unable to pay the fees, following which he applied for an education loan, he said.

He alleged that the bank officials demanded security for the loan. “Security for education loans under ₹4 lakh is not required,” Mr. Abishek asserted, noting that he applied for a loan amount of ₹1.2 lakh.

Based on a recommendation from one of his uncles, he staged the demonstration outside the Paranjervali branch of Indian Bank, he added.

A bank official said that Mr. Abishek withdrew the strike following talks held with officials from the Indian Bank as well as the police. Claiming that the bank did not ask for security, the official said that the bank merely asked for a guarantee signature ‘as a formality’. “He did not know the difference between security and guarantee, which led to this confusion,” the official aadded.

Following this incident, officials from the bank forwarded Mr. Abishek's petition to the zonal office in Erode. The education loan is expected to be sanctioned by this week and will be presented to Mr. Abishek following the verification of certificates, the bank official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/v2o6sa/article30609495.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cb21-sitt,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/youth-stages-hunger-strike-for-education-loan/article30609496.ece
245,2020/01/20,Longer holidays for industries in Coimbatore,"For several industries, especially those in the Micro, Small and Medium-scale Enterprises, here, Pongal holidays this year are longer.

“The units usually stop operations on Bhogi day and the workers will return to work after five or six days. This year, there was no work and so many of the micro unit owners paid the wages last Saturday and the workers will start returning this week,” said C. Sivakumar, president of the Coimbatore Tiruppur District Micro and Cottage Entrepreneur Association.

While 50 % of the workers returned on Monday or will come back on Tuesday, the rest are expected during the course of the week, he said. Most of the workers at the MSMEs here are from other districts or States.

R. Ramamoorthy, president of Coimbatore District Small Industries Association, said the small-scale industries are having longer Pongal holidays this year because of the slowdown. Since there is no revival of demand, the units have lesser work.

According to J. James, president of the Tamil Nadu Association of Cottage and Micro Enterprises, “We also want the workers to come a little late. If they return to work now, we need to give them jobs. About 50 % of the workers have returned. Usually, if workers come late we will be worried as work will get affected.”

Demand for pumps are expected to revive in the coming days. Automobile and textile sector are still facing slowdown. So industries that were catering to these are also looking at job order opportunities in the pump sector. This will lead to lower price realisations, he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/longer-holidays-for-industries-in-coimbatore/article30609491.ece

248,2020/01/20,Plea to increase number of coaches in NMR,"Following complaints from tourists about the limited number of seats available in the Nilgiri Mountain Railway (NMR) trains, the Heritage Steam Chariot Trust (HSCT) has appealed to the Salem division of Southern Railways to increase the number of coaches to allow more tourists to use the service.

K. Natrajan, founder of the HSCT, said that currently, oil-fired steam locomotives running along the NMR route were only pulling four coaches.

“However, the locomotives were designed to pull up to six coaches at a time without a problem,” said Mr. Natrajan, adding that the railways needs to seriously reconsider restoring the full complement of coaches to the existing engines being used along the line to better serve tourists.

“Right now, especially during the weekends, around 200 tourists miss out on experiencing the joy of riding the NMR due to lack of availability of seats, while increasing capacity will also allow the railways to make the line more profitable,” said Mr. Natrajan.

The HSCT has also written to the senior section engineer of Southern Railway in charge of the locomotive shed in Coonoor to consider his appeal to increase the number of coaches.

“The NMR has gone from strength to strength over the last couple of years, especially with regard to increasing the number of services for tourists, with special services being run from Udhagamandalam and Ketti as well as between Coonoor and Runnymede.

The next step towards increasing revenue for the division will be to increase the passenger capacity in each train,” said Mr. Natrajan.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fn3tg4/article30602879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB20NMR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/plea-to-increase-number-of-coaches-in-nmr/article30602880.ece

Water was recently pumped to the two sumps to check leakages and other errors that were attended by the officials.

A senior TWAD Board engineer said that water is being supplied to a few areas in Suriyampalayam that would be extended to other areas in the coming days. He said that all the works would be completed by March and 81.10 MLD of water would be supplied to the present population of 5.35 lakh, 114.75 MLD of water to seven lakh population in 2032 and 147.69 MLD of water to 9.05 lakh population in 2047. The scheme intends to supply 135 litre per capita per day to the population.

Work order was issued on June 10, 2017 to Larson and Toubro Limited, Chennai and work commenced on June 3, 2017, and was scheduled to be completed by June, 2019. However, due to various factors, work got delayed and would take another two months for completion.

Corporation Commissioner M. Elangovan told The Hindu that works are nearing completion and after the final report from the TWAD Board, the date of commissioning would be decided. “Since it is a major scheme, the Chief Minister would be inaugurating the scheme and the date would be decided soon,” he added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/4s69qo/article30602267.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER20-SUMP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/water-supply-scheme-works-nearing-completion-in-erode/article30602268.ece
258,2020/01/20,Ind Vs Aus | K.L. Rahul has sealed the spot of wicketkeeper-batsman,"A lot can happen in a week. K.L. Rahul entered the ODI series against Australia unsure of his spot in the batting order, and by the end of it, he has emerged as India’s preferred wicketkeeper-batsman.

It all started by accident. In the first ODI at Mumbai, first-choice wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant left the field after being hit on the helmet by Australian pacer Pat Cummins, forcing Rahul to don the gloves. Despite his limited experience behind the stumps, Rahul was up to the task.

Upping the ante

Rahul upped the ante in the second ODI, showing great reflexes and presence of mind to effect a smart stumping to remove skipper Aaron Finch. He shone with the bat as well, smashing a 52-ball 82 in an unfamiliar three-drop spot, to go with his 47 at one-drop in the previous match.

In the third ODI at Bengaluru on Sunday, Rahul kept wickets while a fit-again Pant was relegated to the bench. Rahul and Pant even joked and chatted when Pant entered the field to offer drinks. He had the backing of his home crowd as well, who countered muted chants of ‘Dhoni, Dhoni’ with loud screams of ‘Rahul, Rahul’.

The transition was complete — a fact confirmed by skipper Virat Kohli’s comments in the post-match press conference. Kohli explained that having Rahul as ’keeper brings balance to the team.

Comparisons

The skipper even went so far as to draw comparisons to the time when Rahul Dravid kept wickets — an unorthodox move that worked very well for that side.

“It allows us to play an extra batsman, which strengthens our batting massively. That is a very important factor as far as the team balance is concerned. If you look at the 2003 World Cup where Rahul bhai started keeping, the balance became different because you could play an extra batter, and guys at the top could really play positive cricket.

“Also, Rahul is very open to batting anywhere because he is a proper batsman who can perform in any format. He won’t go slam bang from ball one, but he can do what he did in Rajkot just playing good cricketing shots,” Kohli said.

Kohli added that the team will persist with Rahul as the wicketkeeper-batsman.

“Rahul has done well, so we will have to persist with that for a little bit and see where it takes us. A lack of clarity in terms of positions has really hurt us in the past.

Maintain continuity

“So now that we understand that this feels right, we will go ahead with it for a while. We played an unchanged team and got back-to-back wins (second and third ODIs against Australia). I don’t see any reason why we should change this balance,” Kohli said.

For Rahul, who only a few months ago was dropped from the squad after a string of poor scores, this could be the start of a new chapter in his international career.

He must make the most of this unexpected turn of events.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/2gmy43/article30609426.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21KL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ind-vs-aus-kl-rahul-has-sealed-the-spot-of-wicketkeeper-batsman/article30609427.ece
259,2020/01/20,"Windies rout Ireland, shares series","Opening batsman Lendl Simmons blasted 10 sixes in an undefeated 91 as West Indies routed Ireland by nine wickets in the third and final Twenty20 International at Warner Park here on Sunday.

Simmons, the nephew of West Indies coach Phil Simmons, also hit five 4s in his 40-ball blitz. It was his highest score in the format and came just five days before his 35th birthday.

Needing 139 to win, Simmons won the match in style with a six over midwicket off spinner Simi Singh whose three overs cost 41 runs.

Fellow opener Evin Lewis made 46 with four 4s and three 6s as West Indies raced to victory with 54 balls remaining.

“It was a proper batting surface with the ball coming onto the bat nicely,” said Simmons, whose ambition is to help West Indies defend its World T20 title in Australia later this year.

The three-match series ended 1-1 after Ireland edged a first-game thriller by four runs in Grenada before Saturday’s match at Warner Park was abandoned due to rain.

Earlier, veteran all-rounders Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo shared six wickets as West Indies restricted Ireland to 138. Captain Pollard, who produced the best bowling spell by a West Indian in T20Is (four for 25) in Saturday’s abandoned game, claimed three for 17.

Bravo finished with three for 19 to become the West Indies’ leading all-time wicket-taker in the format with 57 victims in his 69th game. That beat the previous best of 54 by leg-spinner Samuel Badree.

“We need to get early wickets, we cannot have teams get to 40, 50 in no time. I think we need to improve in that area,” said Man-of-the-Series Pollard.

The scores: Ireland 138 in 19.1 overs (K. O'Brien 36; K. Pollard 3/17, D. Bravo 3/19) lost to West Indies 140/1 in 11 overs (L. Simmons 91 n.o., E.

260,2020/01/20,Ranji Trophy | Manoj Tiwari blasts triple ton,"A triple hundred is rare. Even rarer is one made with consummate ease. Like the one Manoj Tiwari scored on Monday.

His unbeaten 303 (414b, 630m, 30x4, 5x6) helped Bengal post a mammoth 635 for seven (decl.) in the Ranji Trophy Group A match at the Bengal Cricket Academy Ground. Then, the host’s seamers took over and Hyderabad found itself in familiar territory.

The visitors finished the second day at 83 for five.

After watching Shreyan Chakraborty departing in the second over of the day — caught at second slip off seamer Ravi Kiran — he was joined by Shahbaz Ahmed, who helped him build another century partnership.

The seventh-wicket stand was worth 108 when Shahbaz (49, 79b, 5x4, 1x6) was run out by a smart piece of fielding from mid-on by Akshath Reddy. Now it was Arnab Nandi’s to play the supporting role to the heroics of Tiwary.

The unbroken eighth wicket partnership yielded 159 when the declaration came in the first over after tea. Nandi (65 not out, 83b, 8x4, 1x6) also played some delightful drives.

Bengal declared when Tiwary reached his triple, square-cutting part-time off-spinner Rahul Buddhi for a boundary. He later admitted that he did not know how to celebrate the moment, for he had never scored a triple hundred before.

That didn’t matter. For the sparse crowd, he had given plenty of moments to celebrate, like the sublime gentle extra-cover off left-arm spinner Mehdi Hasan and those sixes over the bowler’s head.

He had given two chances — the second one, while on 160, was a sitter at slip off the hard-working but hapless Ravi Kiran — but it was a masterly knock nevertheless, as he became only the second Bengal batsman to make a triple ton in the Ranji Trophy after Devang Gandhi, who scored 323 against Assam in 1998.

The stage was now set for the host’s new-ball duo. Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep came up with a remarkable spell of hostile pace bowling.

They bowled unchanged for 20 overs. It was great to watch Akash getting one to rise awkwardly and making Akshath edge to slip and Mukesh knocking Ravi Teja’s off stump out of the ground.

The scores:

261,2020/01/20,Upendra’s double ton has Mumbai reeling,"Upendra Yadav, the 23-year-old from Kanpur, entered the record books in style as the wicketkeeper-batsman’s unbeaten double hundred put Uttar Pradesh in firm control against a lacklustre Mumbai bowling on the second day of their Ranji Trophy Group B tie.

Thanks to Upendra’s masterful 203 not out (239b, 27x4, 3x6), and his ability to bat with the tail, Uttar Pradesh declared its first innings at a gargantuan 625 for eight. Captain Ankit Rajpoot then struck twice towards the fag end to leave Mumbai reeling at 20 for two.

The day started on a bright note for Mumbai, with speedster Tushar Deshpande seeing the back of both overnight batsmen. Deshpande castled Akshadeep Nath with a yorker off the second ball of the day, before trapping left-hander Rinku Singh in front after changing the angle to around the wicket in the fifth over.

At 303 for six, Mumbai would have hoped to restrict UP to a total of 350. But Upendra’s onslaught, coupled with Mumbai’s timid display with the ball and in the field, resulted in UP’s last three wickets doubling its tally. Of the 322 runs UP scored in 68.3 overs since Rinku’s dismissal, Upendra amassed 195 in what was a chanceless knock.

Contrasting partnerships

His three contrasting partnerships for the seventh, eighth and ninth wickets — with Saurabh Kumar (44 off 47b, 8x4), Rajpoot (32 off 63b, 5x4, 1x6) and Yash Dayal (41 n.o., 68b, 5x4, 2x6) — took the game away from Mumbai in each of the three sessions. While Upendra played second fiddle to a flashy Saurabh, who survived two dropped chances before lobbing Royston Dias to square-leg, during their 73-run stand, he protected Rajpoot against Deshpande for much of their 119-run partnership after the captain was hit on the helmet early on.

Once Rajpoot departed after nicking offie Shashank Attarde behind the stumps, he gave Dayal confidence while going on a rampage during their unbroken 131-run partnership. His 27th four, a cut off Dias, was followed with a deserving burst of celebration and an impending declaration.

Rajpoot then took over and further compounded Mumbai’s misery in the last half hour.

The scores: Uttar Pradesh — 1st innings: Almas Shaukat c Mulani b Parkar 22, Aryan Juyal lbw b Parkar 17, Umang Sharma b Dias 2, Akshdeep Nath b Deshpande 115, Mohammad Saif c Tare b Dias 42, Rinku Singh lbw b Deshpande 84, Upendra Yadav (not out) 203, Saurabh Kumar c Sarfaraz b Dias 44, Ankit Rajpoot c Tare b Attarde 32, Yash Dayal (not out) 41; Extras (b-4, lb-10, nb-4, w-5): 23; Total (for eight wkts. dec., 159.3 overs): 625.

262,2020/01/20,"England win third Test v South Africa, take 2-1 series lead","England walloped South Africa by an innings and 53 runs in the third test on Monday to turn the series around and lead 2-1 with one to play.

England needed four wickets on the last day in Port Elizabeth and fast bowler Stuart Broad ticked the first one off in the first over to send Vernon Philander packing for 13.

England went through the South African tail fairly quickly to have the home team 138-9 until a boundary-filled last-wicket partnership of 99 between Keshav Maharaj and Dane Paterson held up the victory charge.

South Africa's Keshav Maharaj in action | Photo Credit: REUTERS

Maharaj hit 10 fours and three sixes. He hit three fours and two sixes off England captain Joe Root in one over. The last ball went for four leg byes and those 28 runs equaled the world record for number of runs in a test over. No. 11 Paterson clubbed six fours in his 39 off 40 balls.

It was temporary frustration. England finally ended it when Maharaj tried a quick single with South Africa in sight of making it to the lunch break. He was run out by a direct hit from Sam Curran.

Despite South Africa’s last stand, the scale of England’s victory was still stark. The tourists now need to add the finishing touch in the last test in Johannesburg. A draw there will be enough for a landmark series victory away from home for Root’s young team.

The way the series has spun around, England expects more than a draw to finish off.

England made 499-9 declared batting first at St. George’s Park with centuries by Ben Stokes and the 22-year-old Ollie Pope, whose 135 not out was his first test century.

England bowled South Africa out for 209 in its first innings and 237 in its second innings on Monday morning for the huge victory.

Spinner Dom Bess, another 22-year-old, took a career-best 5-51 in the first South African innings and fast bowler Mark Wood had 3-32 in the second innings on his return to the team for the first time in nearly a year because of injury.

There were positives everywhere for England but the greatest being that Root’s test team has learned to win again having gone through a lean 2019, when the English lost in West Indies and New Zealand and failed to win back the Ashes at home.

South Africa can still save the series at the Wanderers but will have to do it without leading fast bowler Kagiso Rabada, who is banned, and with its coach, captain and under-performing batting lineup under severe pressure.

South Africa has to make at least one change to replace Rabada but could be forced into a much larger re-think of its team amid suggestions at home that the Proteas are facing their toughest time in recent memory.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/kdbk74/article30606976.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CRICKET-TEST-ZAF-ENG,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/england-win-third-test-v-south-africa-take-2-1-series-lead/article30606979.ece
263,2020/01/20,"Virat Kohli greatest ODI player of all-time, Rohit Sharma in top-five: Aaron Finch","Australian captain Aaron Finch has rated his Indian counterpart Virat Kohli as “probably” the greatest ODI player of all-time, while picking Rohit Sharma in the top-five.

Rohit (119) scored his 29th ODI hundred and Kohli made 89 off 91 balls as they shared a match-winning stand of 137 in the decisive third game against Australia here on Sunday. For Finch, what stood out was that India overhauled the 287-run target with ease despite opener Shikhar Dhawan not coming out to bat due to a shoulder injury.

“They’ve got Virat who is probably the greatest ODI player of all-time, and Rohit who’d probably be in the top five batters of all-time. They’re exceptional, and the thing with the Indian side at the moment is their experienced players are getting the job done in the big games,” Finch said.

“Rohit’s 100, especially without Shikhar there tonight, for them to shuffle and their two most dominant players to still get majority of the runs is a sign of a really settled and really quality top-order,” said Finch at the post-match media interaction on Sunday night.

Australia could not get the final flourish they were looking for, mustering only 63 runs in the last 10 overs at the loss of five wickets, far too many in Finch’s view.

“In the last two games we have had the bowlers batting for the majority of the last few overs. Which we saw in Rajkot the damage that KL (Rahul) could do in the back end because he was a settled batter. I think that’s an area we just missed a couple of tricks. “Just not having an in batter being in and having faced 20 or 30 balls to get us deeper and get us to the back end,” Finch said.

He also praised India’s death over bowling at the same time.

“But credit to India, their death bowling in the last few games was exceptional. (Mohammed) Shami was nailing his yorkers, (Navdeep) Saini in the last two games and (Jasprit) Bumrah. In both games they were exceptional. You can look at where we could have improved but also you’ve got to give some credit to India,” said Finch.

Finch opted to bat at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, unlike the game in Rajkot where he chose to field. However, the pitch did not play as per his expectations.

“It probably played a little bit slower than we expected. It looked like it was really hard. It was probably just a little on the dry side. But it was a damn good wicket, it probably spun a bit more than we expected it to. But I thought all four spinners for the game bowled exceptionally well. A little bit slow with the new ball but it seemed to slip on a bit towards the end there and there was a bit more dew than last night.,” he said.

Finch added there were enough positives for them to take from the series despite being on the losing side. One of them was Marnus Labuschagne making an ODI debut. Can Labuschagne also be an option in the shortest format?

“We’ll have to juggle that. He probably hasn’t played as much T20 cricket as he has one-day cricket throughout his career. He started really well in his two innings. To get 47 and 50-odd in his first two knocks on a little bit of a difficult wicket tonight,” Finch said.

“He played really well and showed a lot of maturity. The Test summer and the Ashes has really made his confidence grow. He looked at home against a very good attack,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/iwrkpb/article30605187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FINCH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/virat-kohli-greatest-odi-player-of-all-time-rohit-sharma-in-top-five-aaron-finch/article30605188.ece
264,2020/01/20,Ranji: TN takes a vice-like grip,"Winning cricket is often about getting those simple aspects right. Such as bowling with control, creating the pressure and then batting with the right blend of caution and enterprise.

Tamil Nadu ticked all the boxes on the day one of its Ranji Elite clash against Railways here on Sunday. In fact, the host took a vice-like grip on the match, first bundling out Railways for 76 and then ending the day at 236 for four.

Young left-arm spinner M. Siddharth — he bowled with the new ball and grabbed four of the first five wickets — and senior off-spinner R. Ashwin — he too scalped four — derailed the Railways after it won the toss on a surface that offered appreciable turn.

All-out attack

Then, Tamil Nadu cricket’s long distance man Abhinav Mukund produced a short burst to get to his hundred, launching a blistering attack on the Railways attack, racing to his century between lunch and tea.

To make the occasion more special, this was Abhinav’s 100th Ranji match for Tamil Nadu. What a way to celebrate the feat! He consumed just 115 deliveries striking 12 boundaries and three sixes.

Not someone with a high back-lift, Abhinav flicked, cut and swept to pulverise the Railways bowling. He punches the ball rather than wade into it. All his three sixes were in the ‘V’ with the southpaw using his feet.

Abhinav put on 156 in 213 balls with the compact L. Suryapprakash (50, 100b, 7x4). Later in the innings, Dinesh Karthik collected runs briskly with an unbeaten 57 off 55 balls (5x4, 2x6).

Accurate and effective

In the morning, the lanky Siddharth impressed with his accuracy. Given his height, he achieved natural bounce, and spun the ball away from the right-hander, sent down the odd arm ball. The lad has a fine temperament.

From the other end, the experienced Ashwin bowled capably, keeping it tight, using the crease, and bringing in subtle variations in trajectory.

It was Tamil Nadu’s day at Chepauk.

According to the police, they received information around 9.30 p.m. on Saturday regarding a quarrel at Tikri. When they reached the spot, a girl, who is a resident of Tikri, alleged that she was sexually assaulted by two men.

A DCW counsellor was called and before her, the girl disclosed that she was known to one Abhishek (19), a resident of the same locality. On Saturday, she called Abhishek and met him at Tikri in the evening. Abhishek, along with his friend Jitender (19), came there on a bike. The girl went with them to the fields on bike.

269,2020/01/20,One more arrested in Madhu Vihar murder case,"A 22-year-old man, who was residing in a de-addiction centre in Ghaziabad by changing his identity, was arrested for allegedly killing an insurance firm employee in east Delhi’s Madhu Vihar in September last year, police said on Sunday.

The accused, Anjar (22) is a resident of JJ Colony in Bawana, they said.

On Thursday, two persons — Mohammad Mazhar (27) and his brother-in-law Mohammad Kamrul (24) — were arrested by the outer north district police for their involvement in robbery and theft cases. Mazhar was the main accused in the incident where the insurance firm employee was shot dead.

“On Friday, the East District police received information from Narela Industrial Area police station regarding the involvement of Mazhar and Anjar in the murder case of Usha Rani,” a senior police officer said.

Mazhar was interrogated and he disclosed that his accomplice Anjar is concealing his identity by changing his name and is admitted in a de-addiction centre in Ghaziabad’s Loni, the officer said. Thereafter, a search operation was launched and Anjar was arrested, police said.

270,2020/01/20,Inter-State racket of psychotropic medicine traffickers busted; 3 held,"The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) has busted an inter-State racket of psychotropic medicine traffickers with the seizure of over 7 lakh tablets and more than 1,400 vials of injection and bottles of cough syrup, officials said on Sunday.

Three people have been arrested as part of an operation that began early this month and spanned across Agra, Ludhiana and in the national capital, NCB Delhi zonal director K.P.S. Malhotra said.

“A total of 7,24,840 tablets and capsules, 1,400 injections and 80 CBCS [codeine based cough syrup] bottles have been seized. These medicines are suspected to have diverted from lawful channels to the trafficking network,” he said.

The seizure was made from a godown in Shahganj of Agra.

The seized tablets also include over 2.87 lakh Tramadol tablets, a regulated drug as it is a psychotropic substance, another senior official said.

The Central government had brought the drug (Tramadol) under the control of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act in 2018, banning it from being sold freely over the counter.

The synthetic opiate was said to be abused on a wide-scale by ISIS terrorists to suppress pain and boost strength during injury and hence known as ‘fighter drug’ among international anti-narcotics authorities.

Tramadol has to be regulated in the country as there have been instances in the past where its huge consignments were illegally routed to foreign shores for diversion to terrorist groups, the senior official said.

Under scanner

The Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is now probing the role of pharma companies, dealers and retailers to unearth the nexus.

“The seized psychotropic medicines are produced in companies having valid license. So the analysis of diversion from the manufacturing and logistic channel is on,” Mr. Malhotra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/inter-state-racket-of-psychotropic-medicine-traffickers-busted-3-held/article30603125.ece
271,2020/01/20,Rollback of amendments to land Act sought,"Dressed in white, people from Delhi, Gurugram and Faridabad took out a symbolic funeral procession march to highlight the grave danger looming over the Aravali forests — the NCR’s lifeline for clean air and water security — and sought the roll-back of the controversial amendments to the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA), 1900, with the Haryana Assembly session beginning on Monday.

Slogans of “Withdraw PLPA Amendment Bill”, “Aravalli Bachao”, “Stop illegal constructions in our forests” reverberated through the air as more than 100 people, consisting of students and people from different walks of life marched from Sikanderpur metro station to Mehrauli-Gurgaon road metro station and back.

Forest cover

“The PLPA Amendment Bill, 2019, which has been signed by the Haryana Governor is the death knell for our forests. If notified that 60,000 acres of PLPA protected Aravalli forests and 10,000 acres of Shivalik forests near Chandigarh will be opened for real estate development. This amounts to a loss of 33% of our forests when Haryana already has the lowest forest cover in India — barely 3.62% as compared to the national average of 20%,” said Dr. Sarika Verma, an ENT surgeon.

“Additionally, at great risk of destruction are another 50,000 acres of Aravali forests that do not have protection of any forest law. This means that effectively, the entire Aravali range in south Haryana, amounting to more than 1,10,000 acres, will get impacted by this government move to implement the amended PLPA,” she said.

This amended bill seeks to make the PLPA totally redundant in Haryana. The retrospective provision since 1966 nullifies all notifications made under the Act since the formation of the State of Haryana.

“The PLPA Amendment Bill seeks to only benefit the real estate sector at the cost of forests, wildlife, water security, air quality and the health and well-being of millions of men, women and children living in the NCR cities, including our future generations and thus needs to be withdrawn by the Haryana government,” said Roma Vinayak, an entrepreneur.

‘Green lungs’

Aravali forests in south Haryana are Gurugram, Faridabad and NCR’s green lungs, barrier against desertification and critical water recharge zone.

“People have invested their hard-earned money to make the NCR their home but they never imagined that they would have such a low quality of life where the average air quality index remains over 300 throughout the year. The PLPA Amendment Bill is equivalent to a mass genocide as it will further destroy our negligible green lungs,” said Rahul Khera, another protester.

Anurag, a Delhi University student, who hails from Gujarat, said he grew up in the lap of the Aravalis and did not want it to be destroyed. To show solidarity with the Aravalis, the protesters held hands and took a sacred oath to be the voice of the forests and the birds, butterflies, mammals, reptiles and insects that live there.

“Awareness about saving the Aravallis is on the rise and the citizens’ movement is growing strong not just in the NCR but all over India with people in different cities joining the cause on Twitter [#AravalliBachao] and other social media platfoms. It remains to be seen if the Haryana government will pay heed and withdraw the regressive amendments in the PLPA,” said Neelam Ahluwalia.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rcqlxj/article30603056.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20ARAVALI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/rollback-of-amendments-to-land-act-sought/article30603057.ece
272,2020/01/20,Domestic violence: court asks man to provide separate house to wife,"Modifying a Magistrate Court order asking a man to vacate his residence, a Delhi court has directed him to provide an alternative accommodation to his estranged wife in a domestic violence case.

Additional Sessions Judge Sudesh Kumar modified the interim order of the Magistrate Court while hearing an appeal by the woman’s husband.

The Magistrate had passed the order on a submission by the woman that she and her children were living in the shared house under constant apprehension of violence by her husband.

Counsel for the man rebutted the charge in the appeal submitting that there was not a single conclusive finding in the entire impugned order (passed by the Magistrate) of any act of violence having been committed by the appellant either upon his wife or upon the children.

However, the couple later reached an agreement in the appeal court by which the woman agreed to live in an alternative accommodation to be provided by her husband. Her husband also agreed to bear her expenses as well as those of the children.

“In the facts and circumstances of the case, appellant is hereby directed to provide an alternative accommodation to respondent/wife and her children in the same locality which shall be similar to the shared household with similar facilities at the earliest, preferably within one week from the date of order and also to continue paying ₹50,000 per month towards the expenses along with all expenses towards children as already undertaken by him till further orders,” the judge said.

“The impugned order passed by Metropolitan Magistrate accordingly stands modified to the same extent. In case, however, any dispute arises in the course of providing alternative accommodation, both parties will be at liberty to approach the trial court which shall pass appropriate order after considering the facts and circumstances,” the judge further said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jcq512/article30604635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE20GAVEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/domestic-violence-court-asks-man-to-provide-separate-house-to-wife/article30603047.ece

An officer said that a total of 20 people, who were granted bail on the ground that they would attend the session, were asked to come to Seemapuri police station as per schedule, but only 13 turned up. He said they would find out why the others missed the session.

“The session lasted for 45 minutes during which the protesters were briefed about the CAA and they were ensured that no one would be asked to leave the country and they would not have to produce any papers,” the officer added.

A team of six police personnel headed by an inspector-rank officer held the session. The queries of the protesters were answered, they said.

A protester on the condition of anonymity said that he had taken part in the protest as all others from his locality were going.

276,2020/01/20,HC criticises insurance firm for denying claim,"The Delhi High Court has observed as “unreasonable” the stand of an insurance company that a man, who suffered a fatal injury while riding a high-end cruiser motorcycle, died of ‘self-inflicted intentional injury’.

Justice Prathiba M. Singh observed that “such a stand would be unreasonable as riding a bike could not per se be construed as a ‘self-inflicted intentional injury’ and considering the report of the surveyor, appointed by the insurance company itself, the same was clearly an accident”.

“When any person meets with a fatal accident of this nature, to term the same as ‘self-inflicted intentional injury’ would be extremely insensitive,” Justice Singh said, adding, “The stand of the insurance company reflects a serious prejudice”.

“Whenever claims for insurance are made, the same ought to be treated with compassion and sensitivity of the family members ought to be borne in mind. The insured and their families ought not to be made to run from pillar to post for getting their claims,” the judge said.

“The effort ought to be to empathise with the insured and families rather than taking an adversarial stand,” the High Court said, while hearing a petition by the wife of the deceased, a lawyer. He met with a fatal accident on February 5, 2017.

The deceased had obtained a Personal Accidental Insurance (Individual) Policy from The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. for a sum of ₹58.75 lakh. The wife was the nominee of the deceased under the said policy.

The insurance company had taken the stand that since the deceased was riding a high-end cruiser bike, the same constitutes ‘self-inflicted intentional injury’. It had appointed a surveyor, who, in his report came to the conclusion that the death took place genuinely in a road accident.

However, despite the investigation report, the insurance company failed to honour the claims and took the position that the injury was a ‘self-inflicted intentional injury’.

The wife of the deceased moved a complaint before the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in April 2018 where the case did not had any effective hearing and subsequently was given a date on November 2020.

She then approached the High Court seeking early hearing of the complaint before the NCDRC as she was in need of the insurance amount.

The High Court has asked the NCDRC to hear this matter on an early date and to dispose of the complaint within a period of six months.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/hc-criticises-insurance-firm-for-denying-claim/article30603021.ece
277,2020/01/20,Loss of land for general public in Central Vista revamp flagged,"The Indian Institute of Architects has objected to the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) proposed change in land use for a part of the redevelopment of Central Vista, flagging the potential loss of land for general public use and a violation of the DDA’s Master Plan of Delhi-2021.

The DDA had on December 21, 2019 issued a notification seeking objections and suggestions for the proposed land use change for eight plots, including for the construction of a new Parliament building and residences, meant for the Vice-President and the Prime Minister.

In its January 18 letter to the DDA by IIA Northern chapter chairperson Shamit Manchanda, the IIA said there would be a “loss of at least 80 acres [32 hectares]” currently earmarked, directly or indirectly, for general public use in the master plan.

One plot of 15 acres currently earmarked for bus terminal/parking/recreational use has been proposed to be changed to “government office”. A 9.5 acre-plot for recreational use was proposed to be changed for “Parliament House”, four plots of 5.88 acres, 22.82 acres, 4.5 acres and 22.82 acres currently earmarked for public and semi-public facilities was proposed to be changed to government office, the letter said. The IIA added that recreational space of 20 acres would be lost, while only 3.76 acres would be added.

“Further, the notice provides no details of compensatory allocation of land to recreational/public/semi-public land use for which reason it is surmised that no such provision is made,” the letter said.

Violation of master plan

The IIA also flagged what they called a violation of the master plan with regard to the decentralisation of offices.

“As per NCR plan, no new Central government and Public Sector Undertaking offices should be located in NCTD. However, the issue of shifting existing government / PSU offices from Delhi as well as restricting the setting up of new offices would only be possible after a time-bound action plan is prepared together with suitable incentives and disincentives,” the IIA quoted the master plan.

The IIA added: “It is clear in the policy document that no new Central government offices should be located in NCT of Delhi.”

Suggestions

Giving suggestions, the IIA said: “In view of the points mentioned above, it is requested that the details sought are made public before proceeding with the proposed land use changes that seem to be conflicting with the Master Plan of Delhi – 2021.”

The IIA also asked if any study had been done to assess the impact of the additional pedestrian and vehicular traffic that the land use change would cause.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/vuouwl/article30602856.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL20-CENTRALVISTA3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/iia-flags-loss-of-land-for-general-public-in-central-vista-revamp/article30602857.ece

Mr. Jaju attacked AAP arguing that it had “created a history of lying to the public” and that people were constantly deserting the party due to the “arrogance of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal”.

Mr. Chawariya said as the chairperson of Safai Karamchari Commission, he was not heard but questions were raised on his decisions.

280,2020/01/20,BJP accuses govt. of trying to shield Nirbhaya convicts,"The BJP on Sunday attacked the AAP government for allegedly delaying justice in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case and trying to shield the four convicts.

At a press conference at the BJP headquarters here, the national president of the party’s women’s wing and Rajya Sabha MP Saroj Pandey said lawyer Indira Jaising had appealed to the victim’s mother to forgive the convicts, who are on death row.

Ms. Pandey said Ms. Jaising had been “connected with AAP” and should have “thought not once but a 1,000 times before making such a statement”.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said the government’s responsibility was to inform the convicts of their punishment when it was handed out by the court in July 2017. He said the government only informed the convicts after two years, delaying the process of them filing mercy petitions.

“Deputy CM [Manish Sisodia] said they don’t have the police under them so they could not do it. But the prison department is with the State government, in Delhi also. It has nothing to do with the police,” he said.

Delhi BJP vice-president Shazia Ilmi, who had been a member of AAP before joining the BJP in 2015, said Ms. Jaising had been “close to AAP” and represented the government in court. She asked how the government was able to amend the jail manual two years ago if it did not have jurisdiction over prisons. Mr. Sisodia had said on January 16: “The BJP-led government and the Home Ministry directs and controls the police and is responsible for law and order in Delhi and for the administration of Tihar Jail. The D-G of Tihar reports to you and then you blame us for the delay?” He added: “Bring the Delhi Police under our jurisdiction for two days, we will ensure execution of Nirbhaya’s culprits.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-accuses-govt-of-trying-to-shield-nirbhaya-convicts/article30602617.ece
281,2020/01/20,AAP government failed to do any development work in 5 yrs: Cong.,"Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra on Sunday said, “Fearing a defeat in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls, AAP has come up with 10 promises in the ‘Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card’ to fool the people of Delhi.”

‘Will counter promises’

This is being done to divert the attention of the Delhiites from the government’s failures in the last five years, he said, adding that the Congress would counter such promises by showing the work “actually” done by it for the development of the city in its 15 years in power.

“Mr. Kejriwal wasted his time clashing with officials, the Centre, the L-G and the civic bodies instead of fulfilling his promises. He woke up to the reality of ‘serving’ the people only in the last five-six months after remaining in deep slumber for four and a half years,” Mr. Chopra alleged.

He said the 54 candidates announced by the Congress was a mix of youth and experience that would work towards the development of Delhi.

‘No new college’

The Delhi Congress chief said the Chief Minister who now talks about providing “world-class education in Delhi” could neither create a new university nor establish the 20 colleges that he had promised.

“The Kejriwal government, which has been supplying dirty water to the people of Delhi for the past five years, is now talking about water after seeing the overwhelming public support for Congress’ ‘cashback’ incentive scheme that encourages people to save water,” he added.

The AAP government that could not set up any new hospital and also failed to ensure the proper functioning of the existing government-run hospitals, is now talking about providing better healthcare facilities, he said.

Mr. Chopra also alleged that the Kejriwal government had neglected public transport in the last five years, which was one of the main reasons for the rising levels of pollution in the city.

On transport

“Over 3,200 DTC buses have vanished from Delhi roads, which should be a matter of shame for the AAP government. They [government] delayed the third phase of the metro works by three years and the fourth phase by nearly five years,” Mr. Chopra added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-government-failed-to-do-any-development-work-in-5-yrs-cong/article30602614.ece
282,2020/01/20,‘Kejriwal is misleading people’,"BJP State chief Manoj Tiwari on Sunday alleged that AAP is now making new promises instead of fulfilling the old ones, thereby misleading the people of Delhi.

The statement comes after AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday launched “Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card”, a 10-point election manifesto of the party.

‘10 new lies’

Calling the card “10 new lies”, Mr. Tiwari questioned AAP on issues of power, water, public transportation, pollution, provision of infrastructure in unauthorised colonies, education, CCTV cameras and others.

He asked why despite AAP promising to remove the web of loose wires in the city, the work was not done in five years. He claimed that if the work was done in time, several fire mishaps could have been avoided.

Mr. Tiwari asked why 500 new schools and 20 new colleges promised by AAP was not fulfilled.

Attacking the proposal to provide marshals at mohalla clinics, he said marshals should be first provided in buses.

He alleged that though AAP had given a guarantee of providing world-class public transport, the Chief Minister created hindrances in the expansion of the Delhi metro.

Mr. Kejriwal is talking about last-mile connectivity, but people in border areas of the city have to wait for hours on end to board DTC buses, Mr. Tiwari said.

With regard to controlling pollution, he said the Centre had done more work by constructing the Eastern and Western Peripheral Highways, which divert thousands of trucks from entering the city.

He said promises like installation of CCTVs and streetlights were made in 2015 but many of them are still not working.

“The Chief Minister, who made the life of the residents of unauthorised colonies hellish, is now giving a guarantee of providing roads, drains, sewers, water supply in the unauthorized colonies...these amenities would be provided by the Centre. He [Kejriwal] has failed to do anything for the people of Delhi during the last five years but now he is giving a guarantee of fulfilling the old promises,” a statement issued by the BJP read.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/kejriwal-is-misleading-people/article30602612.ece
283,2020/01/20,How the Siddi community has been thriving through music and dance,"Elliot’s beach buzzes with activity courtesy the Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha 2020. The main crowd puller? The Siddi Dhamal dancers; a troupe with a story.

How often do you see a crowd relishing every moment of a performance in a language they don’t understand, set to tunes they have never heard, using instruments they have never seen? Very rarely, unless, they are as energetic as the Siddi Dhamal dancers from the Siddi community of North Karnataka.

At the Thiruvalluvar Nagar Pongal Theru Vizha, the crowd does not miss a chance to whistle, clap and encourage these vivacious dancers, for whom this art-form is an identity; something unique to their ethnicity.

Living in harmony

The Siddis of Karnataka, are an ethnic group who descended from the Bantu-speaking people of Southeast Africa.

They were brought to India by Portuguese merchants about 400 years ago. “I have heard from the elders that our ancestors were brought to India blindfolded with their hands tied,” says Lily Jaki Siddi, a member of the Siddi community, who was one among the performers.

Today, about 50,000 Siddi people live all over India, of which, more than a third live in the northern parts of Karnataka. They speak their own language called Siddi Basha, and having lived in Karnataka for generations, they are also fluent in Kannada.

Largely settled in suburbs and forests, Siddis often work as coolies and unskilled labourers on plantations They were recognised as a Scheduled Tribe (ST) in 2004, by the Government of Karnataka.

Dance and music are integral to their cultural identity. They are widely known for their expressive dance form Siddi Dhamal, which portrays their community life.

Dhamal was originally performed as a celebratory dance, when members of the community returned from a successful hunt. Today, the Siddis dance on any occasion — they also sing and dance to cheer themselves up following the death of a community member. While women sing a repetitive song pattern, the men usually play the dammam — a percussive instrument which looks similar to a mridangam, but is made of wood and deerskin on the sides — and set the rhythm. While a singer leads with a phrase, others repeat in unison, in a refrain-like manner.

The dancers are colourfully dressed and adorned with leaves, with their faces painted. The language is predominantly Kannada, and though they are influenced by the Indian culture and language, their ancestral dress code still retains it’s unique identity.

Tracing their roots

The Siddis live in tune with Nature and depend on it for survival. And so, their music and dance are inspired by anything that happens around them.

At Elliots beach, they perform a song called ‘Fish’, which narrates how the elders from their community cook fish, while the younger ones ask how they are harming the ecosystem.

“We sing about fishing, how ants eat and anything that is around us. Nature is our only inspiration,” says Lily, before she and her group break into a a song called ‘Chicken Saadam.’ It talks of how the Siddis can hunt down a chicken easily, but are often not able to buy rice to eat with it.

Having lived in India for more than 400 years, are they curious about their roots? Lily says that her friends recently visited their ancestral town in Africa and the results were very different from their expectations.

“They found that the language they speak is different and the community had a different lifestyle,” says Lily. She explains that though many of them are curious about their origins, they have mixed feelings about returning to Africa for good.

284,2020/01/20,Sites of Delhi’s secret thug ritual,"There is a mosque in Kutcha Tihar, West Delhi, which gossip says, marks the site of the prayer house where the thugs took their secret oath in the last century though the building does not look so old maybe because of renovation over the years. Things have changed a great deal since then and the fearsome band of men who practised thugee no longer pose a danger to society, their place having been taking by the modern-day desperadoes. Still, those who claim to be in the know cannot think of them without a shudder.

It is on record that during the 14th century 1,000 thugs were captured and hanged in the streets of Delhi. And, 200 years later Sher Shah Suri organised a cavalry of 1,200 men to keep them at bay. Akbar and his successors also launched widespread drives against the thugs, though it was only in the 19th century that Sir W. H. Sleeman succeeded in wiping them out after a relentless operation lasting seven years.

The thugs used to travel to Delhi before Dussehra, and the oath-taking took place just after Ravana and his kinsmen had met their preordained fate. Ceremony over, the recruits were taught the secret vocabulary known as Ramasee, which consisted of phrases like ‘Ali Khan Bhai Salaam’, a sign of mutual recognition. Later a guru, an expert strangler, would teach them the art of throwing the handkerchief, known as the roomal round the victim’s neck. It was a large piece of cloth and a sharp wrench with it killed the victim in an instant, without the slightest noise. But for this they had to wait for a good omen and the command word “paan” (blood red).

Meer Sahib Ameer Ali, who alone killed 900 people, had acquired such mastery in throwing the roomal that the victim was dead before his body hit the ground. Ameer Ali was born at Morena, near Agra, and brought up by a group of thugs who had killed his father and mother while they were on their way to Indore. Ameer became such a notorious thug that his name struck terror even in the hearts of the officers sent out against him.

A huge reward was announced for his capture and he was finally betrayed by his own men. Ameer Ali, however, turned approver and saved his neck from the gallows.

In his confessions, Ameer Ali mentions visits to Delhi for the initiation ceremony of the recruits, and the masjid where they stayed. The thugs, incidentally, were both Muslims and Hindus who worshipped Kali, the goddess of destruction. It is interesting to note that people of the so-called lower castes, lepers, nanbais (roti sellers), barbers and Sikhs were never killed by the thugs. Women too were generally spared and also eunuchs and the handicapped.

The main place frequented by them was the Kali Temple in Kalkaji which boasts of a history that goes back 3,000 years, although the oldest existing portions of it date to 1764-1771 when the Marathas were in power and the Mughal ruler of Delhi, Shah Alam, was a puppet in their hands. During this time the Marathas were able to restore many old temples and shrines which had been lying neglected during the Muslim rule. They also tried to control the ravages of the thugs.

Looking at the present-day Kalkaji temple one may find it hard to believe that this shrine to Kali is so old. Folklore is replete with tales of the Kalkaji Temple, and one does not know where legend ends and history begins.

One story says that a king who had lost several battles to an invader took shelter at the spot where he lost his army. Tired and exhausted after the battle in the day, he fell asleep and dreamt of the goddess Kali asking him to try his luck again. When the king got up in the morning, he found to his surprise that the troops he thought he had lost had returned.

He led them to battle again and succeeded in routing the enemy. Despite his heady success he did not forget the goddess and built a temple in her honour. Situated about 14 km from Delhi proper, the temple still has an idol of Kali, draped in red silk brocade, which is enclosed by a marble railing. People flock to it in large numbers every Tuesday, when a small fair springs up near the temple. But the big fairs are held on the eighth day of Chait and Asar, the first one Holi and the second just before the beginning of the rainy month of Sawan.

Small red flags decorate the temple and the belief lingers that some of these were the ones that were offered by the thugs and are made not of paper but the roomals they had used for strangling rich wayfarers whom they killed and looted. But then oral history thrives on gossip and not facts.

285,2020/01/20,How street art plays a role in the Jamia resistance,"It’s about 7.30 p.m. Protests at Jamia’s gate number 7 have dwindled. The crowd that was a part of the loud sloganeering and speeches is returning home. But not a group of artists, illustrators, and volunteers. They stay back, painting the walls outside of Jamia Millia University, near gate 2, on the main road, in the bright colours of resistance meant to attract the attention of an onlooker.

“I have seen how art plays an important role in the history of resistance. As an artist, I feel it’s my duty to be a part of this moment, through my art,” says 21-year-old Simeen Anjum, a second-year student at Jamia’s fine arts department. She talks of the ‘faceless’ artist Banksy being her inspiration, as she works on the layouts. Simeen manages a team of five members with about 20 volunteers. Some draw on walls, others fill in colours, and still others fetch and carry paints, brushes and containers. Then there are those who hold the ladder.

Initially she started to paint alone, but gradually people from her department, volunteers from other departments and passersby began joining her. One such person was Nushtaq, 30, a painter who’s a resident of Okhla village. “Painting is my work, but more than that it’s my hobby; it gives me pleasure,” says Nushtaq who initially wanted to be in the armed forces, but now sees himself as part of the group of protesters.

Some walls already had anti-oppression, pro-protest messages sprayed on them. These are left as is. This is to remind onlookers that these walls were first claimed by students who had suffered and angry, and felt the need to express themselves to the outside world.

It was Simeen’s idea to draw and paint more systematically on others, to give the already-there artwork context. There are portraits of Aishe Ghosh, Rohith Vemula, Najeeb Ahmed, and Bhagat Singh, each telling a silent story. A representation of the women of Shaheen Bagh was done by Anirban Ghosh, from NID, Ahmedabad.

“There are many forms through which people protest,” says 22-year-old Saud Ahmed, another painting protester who’s a student of international relations at Jamia. He adds that art and culture have always played an important role in protests. “Some people sing songs and shout slogans; we have decided to imprint these slogans on the walls,” he says, citing the words of Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge on a wall.

“By looking at this wall art, people are more likely to notice and understand what is going on,” says Simeen. Photographs of the graffiti are doing the rounds on social media. Students and passersby click pictures standing with the art, helping the message reach a larger audience. Aishe recently stood for a photo alongside the one depicting her.

“Even people who consider themselves apolitical come and click a selfie alongside this graffiti, and are [thereby] taking a political stance. These words and the paintings force them to think,” adds Saud.

Students refer to Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano who said, “The walls are the publishers of the poor.” Ironically, in July last year, the same words were used in a letter from the then president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University’s student union, N. Sai Balaji, when the Vice Chancellor had ordered the removal of wall posters.

Th students, who have created more than 30 artworks in the area, hope to do more here and in other areas of protest. Akhtar Choko, 25, a student of international relations, at the college, is from Ladakh, but sees himself as a Kashmiri. He says every piece of work goes through discussion, because, “We understand the responsibility of leaving these works for the world to see.”",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/42pgpa/article30605784.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Aishe-Ghosh-by-Sreekanth-Sivadasan,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/how-street-art-plays-a-role-in-the-jamia-resistance/article30605787.ece

287,2020/01/20,"In Hyderabad’s Sultan Bazar, it’s business as usual","Nothing much has changed in Sultan Bazar over the years. Except for the massive overhead metro rail viaduct snaking into the 500-metre arena with its massive piers, it is the same old bustling market catering to shoppers looking for clothes, footwear, bags, fruits, vegetables, etc.

Normally, on afternoons, it is chock-a-bloc with hordes of people walking in and out, checking goods on offer in the shops and wares being sold by the hawkers. Half-demolished buildings vie with brand new structures, some of them just inches away from the overhead metro viaduct.

The road is yet to be laid and there are water/sewer leakages as two-wheeler drivers try to honk their way into the ‘walkpaths’. Clearly, the agitation against the metro rail is history and there is a sense of expectation about the onset of services and what it is likely to bring to the shopkeepers and vendors.

Eagerly awaiting

“We lost a fair bit of property but this project is for the public good, isn’t it? Our business has been hit during construction but that is for a couple of months only. Now, we are all eager for the metro rail to start here and expect people coming here will make use of it,” says Musasu Khainya, owner of a footwear shop who shares the property with his brother.

Dinesh looks like a college student, but he is the owner of the garment shop started in his name by his father Harish. “We have rebuilt our shop as we lost a fair bit of land to widening. We expect authorities to complete pending civic works like roads, footpaths and drainage before the trains start operating,” he says.

“No one stopped us from doing business from here even during the construction stage. We did not have any problem but they promised to provide permanent spots under the viaduct with better amenities; it is yet to happen,” says Devender, a hawker who has been in business for about two decades here.

Just outside Sultan Bazar and towards Bade Chowdi sits Raj Singh in a garment store, which is smaller than a paan shop. “I opened my shop after one-and-a-half years as most of it was lost to widening. Let us see what is in store,” he says, smiling.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gy9ahf/article30609958.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY20-SULTAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/in-hyderabad-sultan-bazar-its-business-as-usual/article30609955.ece

Kishan Reddy said on Monday.

“It is unfortunate. Does the TRS has the right to seek votes? Let it tell people if they spent a rupee on the municipalities in the past six years. Instead it is spending on votes now,” he said.

Addressing a series of road shows as part of his electioneering for candidates of the Bharatiya Janata Party, the senior leader arrived at Thangadapally in Choutuppal Municipality, met people in the wards, and later moved to Nalgonda town.

He was given a grand welcome by hundreds of party men in a bike rally, carrying saffron and lotus flags. Mr. Kishan Reddy started his road show starting at the popular Hindupur of the old city to colonies on the Hyderabad Road.

“The TRS has not spent a rupee on municipalities, all that was spent was the Centre’s allocations. I challenge Municipal Minister KTR to come out with a white paper on funds allocation during the NDA and the UPA government, for a debate,” he said.

And although, the BJP didn’t have a municipal chairman, MLA or MP in Nalgonda, Mr. Kishan Reddy said it sanctioned ₹ 40 crore under the 14th Finance Commission for development of Nalgonda. He urged people to elect Bandaru Prasad, the party’s chairman candidate.

The Minister also expressed confidence that the BJP would come to power in Telangana in 2023, despite joint efforts of the TRS and the AIMIM.

295,2020/01/20,‘Maintaining vision of the Constitution a big challenge’,"Maintaining the vision and framework of the Constitution is a big challenge that the country is faced with in the present context, said sociologist and Delhi University professor Satish Deshpande.

The issue, he said, assumes significance in the light of attempts under way to make the Constitution ‘non-secular’ which does not care about aspects relating to social justice. “The real people must make their presence felt against these attempts,” he said.

Mr. Deshpande was here on Sunday to deliver the 9th S.R. Sankaran Memorial Lecture on the theme ‘Casteism and communalism: Friends or Enemies?’ organised by the Centre for Dalit Studies. He said the Constitution performed delicate balance between formal equality and sensitivity to substantive inequalities in society. Elaborating on the caste and communal aspects, he said these agendas were fast outstripping “our abilities to understand them” and time had come for action rather than talk to address the issues.

Referring to the situation in pre-Independence era, he said solutions like partition of the country came with their own problems as they were partial and provisional and provided fertile ground for different ideologies. He expressed concern over the attempts directed against minorities by the upper castes to retain their lead, but these would require larger base of support and involvement of lower castes.

“Success of these efforts will depend on the participation of these sections and, therefore, invitations are being extended to these groups,” he said.

In this context, he said not just social issues, economic factors too were important as there was undeniable differentiation on political, economic, regional and other factors between these sections.

299,2020/01/20,Digital door numbering put on the backburner,"The project initiated by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) years ago, to assign unique identification numbers for all properties in place of existing house numbers, has not inched forward even after several starts.

Named ‘Unique Smart Addressing Solutions for Urban Dwellings’ and publicised as ‘digital door numbering’, the proposal has been expanded much in scope but not in execution.

Though a fresh committee was formed three months ago to finalise modalities for carrying out the project, and asked to submit its report by October end, not much has been done so far. Officials blame unforeseen delays such as municipal elections for the same.

Initially mooted after formation of GHMC in 2007 as a simple solution for streamlining the door numbers in the city, the project’s scope was later expanded to geo-tagging of properties by unique numbers, and linking them with town planning and sanitation wings and for computation of property tax, officials informed.

A pilot project was reportedly launched in 2010 at Bagh Lingampally for digital door numbering, but it failed to take off due to various reasons. It was relaunched in 2015, and carried out in Domalguda and Gaganmahal areas. However, the numbers assigned are rarely used for any purpose, let alone finding addresses, officials shared.

“As of now, the house numbers are allotted randomly, merely by adding to the adjacent house numbers. The project was initiated to create a uniform addressing system using geo-spatial and cloud computing technologies,” an official, who is part of the committee, informed.

The existing numbering was done way back in 1986, when the municipal wards were reconstituted. Ward numbers were used as markers in every house number allotted, which alone had some semblance of chronology associated with them.

Post the recent pilot project, a committee was formed and tenders were called for to replicate the model across the city. However, it had failed to evoke any response from bidders, hence the project was shelved, sources said.

The present committee, with CDMA, GHMC Commissioner and other senior officials as members, besides representatives from ASCI, Osmania University and others, was mandated to study models followed in other cities, and examine the proposals by various vendors for formulation of guidelines.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/digital-door-numbering-put-on-the-backburner/article30602265.ece

The vessels will also be more durable than steel ferries, which are prone to corrosion since they operate close to the sea.

The department is also gearing up to launch within a month a sister vessel of Vega-120, which has been operating on the Vaikom-Kochi-Fort Kochi route for the past two years. The new vessel will operate on the Kottayam-Alappuzha-Kumarakom stretch.

Vega-120

Vega-120 was an instant hit with commuters, despite its higher fare structure, since it operates at double the speed of conventional ferries. The collection of the vessel touched ₹40,000 on New Year’s Eve, when it operated up to 1 a.m., keeping in mind the influx of people to view the revelry at Fort Kochi, said Mr. Nair. He termed as untrue reports in a section of the media that Vega-120 was pulled out of service for the past many months. “It was withdrawn from service for mandatory dry docking for about a month, in the last quarter of 2019.”

Mattancherry jetty

On ferries being unable to call at Mattancherry jetty due to shallow waters in the vicinity, the SWTD Director said it was the responsibility of the Irrigation Department to dredge the premises. “We hope it completes the task by March,” he said.

Passengers from the area were critical of SWTD officials and people’s representatives not pro-actively intervening to dredge the waterbody around the jetty, despite ferries stopping service a few years ago.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/swtds-catamaran-type-ferries-in-kochi-soon/article30603129.ece
302,2020/01/20,GH model helps peripheral hospitals manage sepsis cases,"The Sepsis Management Project at the Ernakulam District General Hospital, which was extended to six peripheral hospitals in the district, has brought in some key results as infection-causing microbes were isolated in a case in a neonate at the Perumbavoor Taluk Hospital, the first such case reported from a peripheral hospital. That was on December 19.

The automated blood culture system at the General Hospital isolated the microbe Staphylococus hemolyticus from the child’s blood sample. The clinical microbiologist alerted the taluk hospital as the infant was on two antibiotics — Ampicillin and Amikacin. As the isolate showed resistance to Ampicillin, it was stopped, while Amikacin was continued.

The facility helped the peripheral hospital identify sepsis early and treat it rationally. De-escalation of antibiotics from two to one helped in managing sepsis better. The baby is now stable, according to information received from the taluk hospital.

Another sepsis case was recently identified at the Aluva Government Hospital. This time, the blood culture called for stepping up the antibiotic because of a virulent microbe.

The ongoing sepsis management programme has become one of its kind in the country, making it imperative that other States learn from the experience at GH.

The Sepsis Management Project, started at the GH in 2015, was extended to six peripheral hospitals in the district in 2018 as the GH experience had helped in isolating microbes. The automated blood culture method had helped GH identify organisms early so that proper antibiotics could be administered to manage the infection, thus resulting in reduced hospital stay.

Sepsis management has started showing results, with smaller hospitals becoming more confident of managing cases with GH support. The hub and spoke model was implemented at GH to help smaller hospitals, with advanced diagnostic facilities at the main hospital. National Health Mission district programme manager Dr. Mathews Numpelil had said the hub and spoke model was collecting 70-80 samples a month from peripheral hospitals, which are the spokes delivering them to the hub at the GH or Medical College.

The AMR programme got added to the hub and spoke in November 2019. For the sepsis management programme, GH was the hub with advanced facility, while all the six peripheral hospitals – Perumbavoor, Kothamangalam, Thripunithura and Karuvelipady taluk hospitals, Women and Child Hospital, Mattanchery; government hospital, Aluva; and govt. hospital, Moovattupuzha, were the spokes.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/gh-model-helps-peripheral-hospitals-manage-sepsis-cases/article30603120.ece

305,2020/01/20,Natural gas consumption set for big leap,"Consumption of natural gas in the State is set for a big leap and is expected to reach around 60 lakh cubic metres a day after the 444-km Kochi-Mangaluru pipeline is commissioned by March 2020.

All works related to the commissioning of the pipeline was complete and works related to river crossings in Kozhikode (Kuttiyadi), Kasaragod (Chandragiri) and Mangaluru (Netravati) remained, said GAIL India General Manager Tony Mathew here.

Natural gas consumption in Kochi city touched an all-time high when daily consumption reached 38.3 lakh cubic metres in the second week of January, he said. Industries account for bulk of the gas use. Bharat Petroleum Corporation uses 28 lakh cubic metres; FACT nine lakh cubic metres and other industrial units account for 1.3 lakh cubic metres of consumption.

Automobile sector

Consumption of natural gas by vehicles and households alone is 34,600 cubic metres. The volume is set to go up in the near future as the automobile sector is increasingly switching to natural gas.

The industry sector makes substantial savings when it switches from LPG to natural gas. Switching over to natural gas can help a taxi driver save substantially in fuel cost every month as the cost per kilometre of petrol vehicles is between ₹5.5 and ₹6 compared to the ₹2-per-km for CNG.

Walayar pipeline

Work on the 94-km pipeline to Walayar from Koottanad is in progress. Eighty per cent of the work has been completed and the pipeline can be commissioned by June 30. The pipeline will help the city gas distribution in Palakkad as well as supply of fuel to industrial units in Palakkad and Coimbatore.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/natural-gas-consumption-set-for-big-leap/article30603048.ece

307,2020/01/20,Golkonda Watch Collectors is a meet-group for vintage watch-lovers in Hyderabad,"“My first memory with a vintage watch? Hmm, it has to involve my grandfather; he had quite a few remarkable ones,” says Tarun Oblum. Since 2016, the 27-year-old menswear accessory designer has nurtured a deep love for vintage watches, and it started with HMT, India’s first country-made watch brand which was also a Public Sector Undertaking by Government of India since its birth in 1961. However, it went out of business when Titan and other battery watch brands came to the fore, which led to the untimely corporate demise of the appreciation for mechanism-driven watch engineering.

Tarun Oblum in his shop, examining a vintage watch

However, the legacy this name has left behind is remarkable and is seeing plenty of interest among Gen Y and Z folks in the city. “I can talk about vintage watches for hours. I’ve bought about six watches this month alone... and I love that there are a number of others in India, and in Hyderabad particularly, who feel the same way I do,” Tarun explains, as he twirls one of the watches carefully between his fingers. The watch face and lugs are a little scratched up and the case on the back has deep grooves around the edge from being pried open over the years. The other watches laid out in front of him have similar finishes. These watches need to be wound almost every morning, and when placed close to the ear, there is a cathartic light ticking as the coil tightened from winding slowly releases.

Meet cute

This love for mechanical watches is why, late last year, he formed Golkonda Watch Collectors, a small group which meets occasionally to talk about the realm of vintage watches; the back stories, the mechanisms, and more. “Our first meet was on Novemebr 24 at Zero 40 Brewing... it wasn’t a huge group, but those allotted two hours went by way too quickly [laughs] and our beers were abandoned and had warmed up. I want to point out that I am no expert, I just host these events... I went into this not knowing much about HMT and vintage watches. Yes, I do research daily but when you sit down with other people who have the same respect towards early watch engineering, it is so rewarding because of the emotional and historical relevance.”

At the moment, the group currently has something of an invite-only model but Tarun is more than happy to meet more people, whether they are new to this space or are a self-proclaimed expert. “The age range of the group is also between 18 and 35,” says Tarun. At the meets, the idea is not to contribute to timepiece elitism but to encourage holistic appreciation and critique in a safe space for knowledge exchange, with Tarun adding, “These meets are as much a learning experience for me as anyone else.” And what would a meet about these eye-catching conversation starters even be without a bit of macrophotography?

The group is not all about singing praises for bank-breaking watches, and Tarun cannot emphasise this enough. “Yes, these hugely expensive watches are interesting but, for me and the enthusiastic collector, the back story of a secondhand watch just holds more attraction. He holds up one metal band HMT upon which the clasp has ‘Ravi’ engraved on it, and another with a Nehru-themed face. “HMT rose up in a time when socialism in India was prevalent, and the brand was one of Nehru’s babies. They put India on the watchmakers’ international map.” Remarkably, an authentic HMT costs no more than ₹3500, but do make sure you are aware that the market has seen an influx of duplicates and models with repainted faces.

Junghans, Favre Leuba, Henri Sandoz and Fils as well as Hyderabad-made Allwyn, founded in 1981 as a part of Seiko, also features as a point of pride in Golconda Watch Collectors’ sessions. Luxury timeless labels such as Rolex and Omega also grace the group’s meetings as they are huge players in the mechanical watch world. Tarun recalls coming across a vintage Omega Constellation from the 1950s, which was passed from grandmother to grandson. A frequent traveller, Tarun makes it a point to visit Bengaluru for the iconic HMT Bhavan, where the brand is trying to sell off its remaining products... after all, nothing new is getting manufactured.

After all, if we can love our heritage structures and heirloom textiles, why not pay the same attention to the history we can wear?

308,2020/01/20,Reckless parking hinders pedestrian movement,"Illegal parking in restricted areas is interrupting free movement of pedestrians and emergency service vehicles near the Kozhikode Medical College. Patients and bystanders depending on sidewalks near the Institute of Maternal and Child Health are the worst-hit due to haphazard parking.

Despite the police clamping several illegally parked motorbikes to discourage the trend, it has not evoked a favourable response. Attempts to clear such vehicles using cranes too did not succeed as a few charity organisations opposed the move, claiming that it was mostly troubling poor patients and bystanders.

Shop owners say the available parking area at the medical college is not being used properly thanks to ignorance of vehicle owners. Most drivers leave their vehicles along the road hoping that they can quickly resume the trip after consultations, they add.

“Most illegally parked motorbikes along the road are found handle-locked these days, causing a lot of trouble for others. And, many such thoughtless owners return to take the vehicles after several hours,” says Vineesh, a member of a voluntary service organisation. He adds that there are even drivers who lock horns with local residents for questioning such reckless practices.

Meanwhile, the traffic police have said they will act against unauthorised parking with the help of CCTV visuals. Control room vehicles fitted with cameras will be deployed in such locations to track violators, they say.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/smnlqz/article30602476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-KI-PARKING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/reckless-parking-hinders-pedestrian-movement/article30602477.ece
309,2020/01/20,'I don’t comment on things that affect personal lives',"Ballatha Pahayan hits where it hurts the most. No wonder that this U.S.-based Malayali vlogger named Vinod Narayan’s humorous and often critical take on issues around us in typical Kozhikoden accent strikes a chord on millions around the globe. He was in Kozhikode to attend sessions at the Kerala Literature Festival. Excerpts from an interview.

You have quite a good number of followers on social media. How do you land in here?

I work in the content management field and used to blog earlier. As the nature of content changed from words to images to moving images, my way of communication also underwent a transition. But I am not bothered about if what I say is getting noticed or not. With a good reach among people, however, there comes a certain amount of responsibility.

Your opinions are now being looked upon by many. In Kerala, there is a practice of people with their own views transforming themselves as cultural leaders, who later write books, start giving lectures etc?

(Laughs). Three people have approached me for writing books. It could be in the form of a collection of articles. But actually I don’t need to write a book to explain my experiences or air my views. Honestly, I don’t think I need to publish a book to connect with the people. It is so boring to send my writings to somebody who will sit in judgement. I have not given anybody a yardstick to measure the quantity of my writing. As far as my opinions go, I express them only when I want to say something clearly. I don’t comment on deaths or mishaps or things that could adversely affect the personal lives of people.

As an Indian citizen living in the U.S., how do you look at the comparison between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and U.S. President Donald Trump?

I don’t think it is correct to do so. Because, Mr. Trump has many opponents within the Republican Party. But look at Mr. Modi. Who is opposing him in the BJP? There is none.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/5v5gfz/article30602427.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20-KI-VINOD-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/i-dont-comment-on-things-that-affect-personal-lives/article30602428.ece

314,2020/01/20,Farmers seek Collector’s intervention in functioning of DPCs,"Members of Muthalaikulam Periyar Tank Ayacutdar Farmers’ Association made a representation to Collector T.G. Vinay regarding the operation of direct purchase centres in the district during the grievance redressal meeting held here on Monday.

M.P. Raman, president of the association, said that the centres, which were present in 175 locations across Madurai district, were functioning under political influence. “They do not accept paddy supplied by some farmers citing frivolous reasons. Although Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation (TNCSC) is supposed to run the show, on most occasions, stooges of politicians make their way to these centres and cause problems,” he said.

Mr. Raman said that the centre in Nadumuthalaikulam had particularly been compromised and farmers in the area had been facing much trouble as appropriate price had not been given for their produce. “The Collector’s immediate intervention is needed. He must launch a district-wide enquiry into the matter,” he said.

Mr. Vinay said that though there had been allegations about unjust prices being fixed, employees of the TNCSC were usually vigilant and assessed the value of paddy based only on its quality.

“The DPCs in the district are usually established after we receive petitions from the farmers. We fix the location of the centre depending on paddy yield in the area.

Farmers of Vadakarai area, who had cultivated ‘Ambai 16’ paddy variety and reportedly suffered heavy loss owing to poor germination of the crop, have appealed to Collector G.K. Arun Sundar Thayalan to inspect their paddy fields and recommend to the government for due crop loss compensation.

A group of agriculturists from Vadakarai, led by farmer Abdul Ali, who submitted the petition to the Collector, said farmers, getting water for irrigation from Adavinainar Dam’s three channels had cultivated ‘Ambai 16’ variety paddy during this ‘pisanam’ season after buying the seeds from various sources. Since the variety had not grown properly, the farmers had suffered heavy loss and hence the officials attached to the Department of Agriculture should be instructed to visit the affected paddy fields in Vadakarai area for giving due crop loss compensation, the petitioner farmers said.

Complaining about harassment by the police, a group of paddystraw traders submitted a petition to the Collector. They said around 15 loads of paddystraw was being sent to Kerala every day as the harvested paddystraw was being rolled and loaded in the vehicles to be sent to the neighbouring State.

“However, police at the Puliyarai check-post are harassing the drivers of these vehicles in the guise of ‘overloading’ and forcing them to stop the paddystraw-laden lorries at Puliyarai for 2 or 3 days. Since this issue has badly hit this business, giving employment to over 3,000 persons, the Collector should intervene and sort-out the issue,” the petitioners said.

A group of villagers from Achchanpudhur under Kadayanallur taluk submitted petition seeking free house sites.

A group of residents of Kadaiyaalurutti under Kadayanallur taluk submitted a petition seeking the Collector’s intervention to ensure the erection of shed on a land reportedly belonging to a temple in the village.

The Collector said that more than two lakh devotees are expected to visit the Dhandayuthapani Swami temple during the festival and most of them will be padayatris. For the convenience of the pilgrims, the district administration has set up 11 permanent kavadi mandapams, 12 staying centres inside Chinnakumarar complex, 48 free toilet and bathroom facilities, 28 purified drinking water points and permanent shades in eight places apart from 48 temporary shades.

To combat unexpected power cuts, permanent backup facilities have been set up at 11 places and four temporary backups. First aid centres have been set up at three places and each will have two doctors and eight medical personnel.

Ticket-vending kiosks have been set up at several places in the east and north prakarams, to enable a speedy and hassle-free darshan to devotees. A total of 300 workers have been involved in seven places to facilitate tonsuring of hair and 23 bathrooms with shower for men and 22 such facilities for women have been ensured.

Padayatris reach Palani via the Natham-Dindigul-Palani Road, Kodai Road-Sempatti-Oddanchatram route, Thoppampatti-Palani, Vedasandur-Oddanchatram-Palani, Udumalpet-Palani and Batlagundu-Sempatti-Oddanchatram routes. The Collector directed officials from the Highways department to ensure reflector barricades along the paver block pathways meant for padayatris. The pathway has been repaired and cleaned for the use of devotees.

Over 50,000 reflecting wrist bands and sticks have been distributed by the police and highway departments. Watch towers have been erected in 12 places and fire services will be stationed in nine places inside the hill shrine. Tube lights have been put up along the roadsides where padayatris walk. Temporary dust bins are being provided all along the pathway.

Officials from the Palani municipality and food safety officers have been directed to inspect the quality of food and prices at roadside eateries and restaurants. The Palani municipality has been asked to serve notice to restaurants that have not specified a price list for the food items.

For the benefit of pilgrims, special trains will be operated in the Tiruchi, Palakkad and Thanjavur routes. A six acre land has been allocated for parking buses and vans for free.

Public toilets in Oddanchatram, Reddiyarchatram and Palani surroundings have been repaired and water facility has been ensured for the usage of pilgrims. Information boards on toilets will also be erected along the routes.

Superintendent of Police R. Sakthivel, Assistant Collector Madhubalan, Palani Sub-Collector S. Uma and other officials participated in the meeting.

The hill shrine of Dhandayuthapani swami remained closed for darshan from 6.30 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. on Monday as the ritual of ‘Ashatabandhana marundhu’ was conducted. The ritual started off with the Kalakarshana Pooja after which deeparadhana and special poojas were performed for the deity. Devotees who thronged the temple had to wait downhill for nearly three hours.

At 10.15 a.m. the shrine was opened for devotees to have a darshan.

320,2020/01/20,Paddy fields flooded in Devakottai,"A group of farmers from Devandathavu village in Devakottai taluk of Sivaganga district submitted a petition to the Ramanathapuram Collector here on Monday, seeking his intervention to save paddy crops from flooding due to overflowing water from three tanks in a nearby village Kattavilagam in Ramanathapuram village.

“Devandathavu is located in the border of Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram districts and across the border lies the village of Kattavilagam, where there are three water tanks. With a good northeast monsoon, the tanks are full and overflowing. However, since our farmlands are located close to the tank, the water has entered our lands, submerging paddy crops,” said R. Ramachandran, a farmer.

He added that the villagers of Kattavilagam have closed all the sluices of the tanks, arresting the water from flowing further towards the other tanks downstream.

“We held talks with the Kattavilagam residents, requesting them to reduce the water storage in the tank, so that we can harvest the paddy grains, but they did not agree to it. We have submitted a petition to the Tiruvadanai tahsildar but since there was no action, we approached the Collector,” said Ramachandran.

The farmers claimed that over 250 acres of matured paddy has been submerged and about 120 farmers have been affected.

“The region we live has no source of irrigation and we practise only rain-fed cultivation of crops. Most of the times, our crops wither due to lack of water and we face loss. This time, the crops are wilting due to excess water and we are again facing huge loss. If only we harvest the paddy grains in the next three days, it will be useful. Else, the grains will go waste,” added the farmers.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/7a1ao6/article30608635.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA21DEVAKOTTAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/paddy-fields-flooded-in-devakottai/article30608636.ece

A scheduled caste family from I. Vadipatti village near Oddanchatram petitioned the Collector here on Monday, seeking action against the ex-president of the village panchayat for allegedly abusing them using caste name and assaulting them.

R. Shamugavalli, wife of Ramesh, a resident of MGR Nagar in the village, alleged that R. Jothiswaran, the former president of the village panchayat, along with a few men, barged into their house at night, abused and assaulted them.

She complained that the men belonging to an intermediate caste had objected to her children participating in a sports event held in the village as part of Pongal celebrations. She requested the Collector to intervene and deliver justice to her family.

Sources said that the former president is a functionary of the DMK.

In another petition, A. Srividya of Paraikulam village near Dindigul sought house patta, citing that her neighbours in the village have been granted patta, except her.

324,2020/01/20,"Fishermen to get Kisan Credit Cards shortly, says Kota","Minister for Ports, Fisheries and Muzrai Kota Srinivas Poojary said here on Monday that about 23,000 fishermen, who will benefit from the State government’s decision to waive loans of up to ₹50,000 from nationalised banks during 2017-19, will receive Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) within a week.

Speaking after inaugurating the Kumaradhara ferry service, started by Mahajana Sabha Bengre at Thotta Bengre, the Minister said that the government has taken steps to transfer the loan amount of ₹60 crore to the nationalised banks from where fishermen had taken these loans.

The Minister said that the banks will remove the beneficiaries from their list of “non-productive asset borrowers” once the loan amount is transferred. The banks will issue the KCC to deserving fishermen later.

The loan-waiver scheme of the State government was extended to fishermen at a rally that Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed recently at Tumakuru, the Minister said. Mr. Poojary said that the Ports Department is mulling the idea to own a dredger and allow its operation and maintenance under private ownership as followed in Kerala. A meeting of fishermen leaders will be convened soon to decide modalities of this move to ensure safety of fishing boats using the ports. The proposal for third phase expansion of the old port here at a cost of ₹22 crore will come up for consideration before the Cabinet soon.

Dredging work from the estuary mouth to the north commercial wharf of the old port will be taken up at a cost of ₹29 crore. A sanctuary for country boats will be constructed at a cost of ₹3.5 crore at the old port with financial assistance from the NABARD, the Minister said.

Mr. Poojary said that steps will be taken to set up floating jetties at Malpe in Udupi and Hoige Bazaar in the city at a cost of ₹6.5 crore each.

A demonstration of this technology will be held before a decision is taken on this project.

The Minister later inaugurated a new passenger jetty constructed by the Public Works, Ports and Inland Transport department at nearby Sulthan Bathery at a cost of ₹35.83 lakh.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/xko4r/article30609963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21BGKOTA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/fishermen-to-get-kisan-credit-cards-shortly-says-kota/article30609964.ece

326,2020/01/20,Malpe sea walkway to get improved infrastructure,"The sea walkway at Malpe will soon get a facelift thanks to the efforts by the Malpe Development Committee. The walkway was inaugurated here in 2018.

The walkway is located near the tourist jetty at Malpe, from where boats ferry passengers to the picturesque St. Mary’s Island.

The people who visit the island visit the walkway either before or after their visit to the Island.

The district administration along with the Malpe Development Committee has decided to improve the infrastructure near the walkway to provide better facilities to the tourists visiting the spot and have allotted ₹50 lakh for this purpose.

“As part of the improvement of infrastructure, about 15,000 sqft. of land belonging to the Department of Ports will be handed over to the Malpe Development Committee soon. This will help in developing facilities on this land,” said Chandrashekshar Naik, Assistant Director of Tourism.

Regarding providing facilities at the walkway, Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Ltd (KRIDL) has already drawn up an estimate for the works to be undertaken in the area.

The works to be undertaken include repair of the railings which had got damaged near the walkway, installation of some granite benches near the cafeteria, and the construction of a pathway with interlocking tiles.

Besides this, efforts will be made to improve the landscaping in the area by giving it a green touch. The drainage system in the area too will be spruced up.

“The administration is expected to go through the estimates and give its nod. After getting the administrative approval, the works are expected to start in about a month,” said Mr. Naik.

The intention behind sprucing up the walkway is to attract more tourists to the spot. “There is lot of stress on the Malpe beach owing to the large number of tourists. We want to ensure an near even distribution of tourists between the walkway and the beach. In fact, our plan is to develop the entire stretch from Malpe beach to the sea walkway,” said G.

327,2020/01/20,Bag with explosive substance found at Mangaluru airport,"A bag containing an explosive substance with some basic features of an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) was found near the ticket counter of Mangaluru International Airport on Monday morning.

The Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) of the city police secured the bag in the morning, put it in a Threat Containment Vehicle and took it away to an open plot in Kenjar around a kilometre away, where BDS officials are trying to diffuse the explosive. Police sources said the bag contains a metal coin box in which explosive substance and metal pieces were placed. The timer connected to the explosive substance is reportedly not working.

Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) manning the Airport security, noticed the bag on Monday morning, secured the area and isolated the bag. Dog Squad from the city police indicated an explosive material and BDS was immediately pressed into action.

Police said a person is suspected to have come in an autorickshaw around 9:20 a.m. and planted the bag, around 10ms away from the Air India ticket counter. Police are analysing the CCTV footage of the airport and are said to have zeroed in on certain suspects and an autorickshaw.

Meanwhile, the operations of the Mangaluru Airport were largely undisturbed.

Home minister Basavaraj Bommai termed the incident an attempt to hit at the economic interests of the country, evident in how airport was targeted and said strict action will be taken against those elements behind the incident. “The State government has already identified Mangaluru as a place where anti-national elements are active and accordingly investigation has been taken up,” he said.

330,2020/01/20,IMF lowers India growth estimate to 4.8% for 2019,"The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Monday lowered growth estimate for India to 4.8% for 2019, citing stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth as the major factors for the downward revision.

Also Read Is the Indian economy staring at stagflation?

While providing an update on the global economy ahead of the start of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual summit, the IMF cut its India growth forecast to 4.8% for 2019.

It expects growth to be 5.8% in 2020 and rise to 6.5% in 2021.

India-born IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath said growth in India slowed sharply owing to stress in the non-bank financial sector and weak rural income growth.

China’s growth has been revised upward by 0.2% to 6% for 2020, reflecting the trade deal with the United States, she added.

In India, the IMF said domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid stress in the non-bank financial sector and a decline in credit growth.

India’s growth is estimated at 4.8% in 2019, projected to improve to 5.8% in 2020 and 6.5% in 2021 (1.2 and 0.9 percentage point lower than in the October WEO), supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus as well as subdued oil prices, it added.

Ms. Gopinath also said the pickup in global growth for 2020 remains highly uncertain as it relies on improved growth outcomes for stressed economies like Argentina, Iran, and Turkey and for underperforming emerging and developing economies such as Brazil, India, and Mexico.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/7fpopo/article30608406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Gita-Gopinath,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/imf-lowers-india-growth-estimate-to-48-for-2019/article30608403.ece

332,2020/01/20,Combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires higher than the total 2018-19 Union Budget: Oxfam,"India’s richest 1% hold more than four-times the wealth held by 953 million people who make up for the bottom 70% of the country’s population, while the total wealth of all Indian billionaires is more than the full-year budget, a new study said on Monday.

Releasing the study Time to Care here ahead of the 50th Annual Meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF), rights group Oxfam also said the world’s 2,153 billionaires have more wealth than the 4.6 billion people who make up 60 per cent of the planet’s population.

The report flagged that global inequality is shockingly entrenched and vast and the number of billionaires has doubled in the last decade, despite their combined wealth having declined in the last year.

“The gap between rich and poor can’t be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies, and too few governments are committed to these,” said Oxfam India CEO Amitabh Behar, who is here to represent the Oxfam confederation this year.

The issues of income and gender inequality are expected to figure prominently in discussions at the five-day summit of the WEF, starting Monday. The WEF’s annual Global Risks Report has also warned that the downward pressure on the global economy from macroeconomic fragilities and financial inequality continued to intensify in 2019.

Concern about inequality underlies recent social unrest in almost every continent, although it may be sparked by different tipping points such as corruption, constitutional breaches, or the rise in prices for basic goods and services, as per the WEF report.

Although global inequality has declined over the past three decades, domestic income inequality has risen in many countries, particularly in advanced economies and reached historic highs in some, the Global Risks Report flagged last week.

The Oxfam report further said “sexist” economies are fuelling the inequality crisis by enabling a wealthy elite to accumulate vast fortunes at the expense of ordinary people and particularly poor women and girls.

Regarding India, Oxfam said the combined total wealth of 63 Indian billionaires is higher than the total Union Budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19 which was at ₹24,42,200 crore.

“Our broken economies are lining the pockets of billionaires and big business at the expense of ordinary men and women. No wonder people are starting to question whether billionaires should even exist,” Mr. Behar said.

As per the report, it would take a female domestic worker 22,277 years to earn what a top CEO of a technology company makes in one year.

With earnings pegged at Rs 106 per second, a tech CEO would make more in 10 minutes than what a domestic worker would make in one year.

It further said women and girls put in 3.26 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day — a contribution to the Indian economy of at least ₹19 lakh crore a year, which is 20 times the entire education budget of India in 2019 (₹ 93,000 crore).

Besides, direct public investments in the care economy of 2 per cent of GDP would potentially create 11 million new jobs and make up for the 11 million jobs lost in 2018, the report said.

Behar said the gap between rich and poor cannot be resolved without deliberate inequality-busting policies, and too few governments are committed to these.

He said women and girls are among those who benefit the least from today’s economic system.

“They spend billions of hours cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly. Unpaid care work is the ‘hidden engine’ that keeps the wheels of our economies, businesses and societies moving.

“It is driven by women who often have little time to get an education, earn a decent living or have a say in how our societies are run, and who are therefore trapped at the bottom of the economy, Mr. Behar added.

Oxfam said governments are massively under-taxing the wealthiest individuals and corporations and failing to collect revenues that could help lift the responsibility of care from women and tackle poverty and inequality.

Besides, the governments are also underfunding vital public services and infrastructure that could help reduce women and girls’ workload, the report said.

As per the global survey, the 22 richest men in the world have more wealth than all the women in Africa.

Besides, women and girls put in 12.5 billion hours of unpaid care work each and every day — a contribution to the global economy of at least USD 10.8 trillion a year, more than three times the size of the global tech industry.

Getting the richest one per cent to pay just 0.5 per cent extra tax on their wealth over the next 10 years would equal the investment needed to create 117 million jobs in sectors such as elderly and childcare, education and health.

Governments must prioritise care as being as important as all other sectors in order to build more human economies that work for everyone, not just a fortunate few, Behar said.

Oxfam said its calculations are based on the latest data sources available, including from the Credit Suisse Research Institute’s Global Wealth Databook 2019 and Forbes’ 2019 Billionaires List.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jht0st/article30511711.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/08JANTH-REALESTATE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/combined-total-wealth-of-63-indian-billionaires-higher-than-the-total-2018-19-union-budget-oxfam/article30604631.ece
333,2020/01/20,CCI approves Reliance’s divestment of Jio tower assets,"Fair trade regulator CCI has approved divestment of Reliance Jio’s telecom tower assets to Canada’s Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP and other investors.

The other investors include British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, GIC Infra Holdings Pte Ltd’s subsidiaries Anahera Investment Pte Ltd and Valkyrie Investment Pte Ltd.

In a tweet on Monday, the regulator said it “approves subscription of the units of Tower Infrastructure Trust by BIF IV Jarvis India Pte., British Columbia Investment Management and GIC Investors.”

The proposed transaction involves the acquisition of indirect control of Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt Ltd (RJIPL) by Jarvis, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) noted in a combination notice filed with it.

Tower Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT, currently holds 51% of the outstanding equity share capital of RJIPL. Current Sponsor of the InvIT is Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL).

The deal, as per the notice, is subject to receipt of requisite approvals from markets regulator Sebi. Jarvis would execute the “deed of accession” to the trust deed and be designated as one of the sponsors to the InvIT in addition to RIIHL.

Besides, Jarvis would subscribe to the majority of the units to be issued by the InvIT.

“Jarvis, subscribing to the units of the InvIT, subject to receipt of necessary approvals from SEBI, will discuss and mutually agree with the Parties on suitable mechanism, in accordance with the provisions of SEBI InvIT Regulations, for change of the current investment manager to an entity nominated and controlled by Jarvis,” the notice said.

The parties are Jarvis, British Columbia Investment, GIC investors, InvIT, and RJIPL.

From the proceeds of the issuance of units, the InvIT proposes to acquire the remaining 49 per cent of the outstanding equity share capital in RJIPL.

Additionally, GIC Investors and British Columbia Investment propose to acquire a minority interest in the InvIT by either directly subscribing to units of the InvIT, or by indirectly acquiring an interest in the InvIT through acquisition of shares in BIF IV India Holdings.

In December 2019, RIL said its unit, Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd (RIIHL) has inked binding agreements with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP and its partners for the tower business deal.

Brookfield will buy out 100% equity of the operating tower company.

RIIHL “has entered into binding agreements with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, and its institutional partners, for an investment of Rs 25,215 crore in the units to be issued by the Tower Infrastructure Trust,” the company had said in a statement.

Under the deal, RIIHL, the sponsor of Tower Infrastructure Trust, would issue units in the trust to Brookfield affiliate BIF IV Jarvis India and some co-investors.

After the deal is closed, the Canadian alternative assets manager, Brookfield and its partners would become sponsors of the trust, holding 100 per cent of India’s largest telecom tower company with 1,30,000 towers through Tower Infrastructure Trust, while the RIL subsidiary would become a co-sponsor, but will hold no units.

“Hyderabad has been assessed as the world’s most dynamic city from amongst 130 cities across the globe,” JLL said in the report.

Hyderabad scores among the highest globally across a range of economic indicators such as GDP growth, retail sales and airport passenger growth.

Last year, Bengaluru was at number one position and Hyderabad ranked second.

“India’s fastest growing cities have been drawing a significant level of interest from overseas investors. We are starting to see the benefits of the government’s reforms on the infrastructure and policy front. Despite a slowing pace of economic growth, these reforms are bringing more market transparency, which boosts investment into real estate,” JLL India CEO and Country Head Ramesh Nair said.

The commercial real estate in south Indian cities is growing at a rapid pace, he added.

“Hyderabad has seen tremendous growth in 2019 in line with that of Bengaluru. The city has actively embraced technology driven economic growth and attracted large tech giants and e-commerce players,” Nair said.

The state government’s focus on business friendly policies and provision of high quality infrastructure along with the availability of quality talent pool and superior quality business parks has given Hyderabad a competitive edge, he added.

According to the report, Asia Pacific is home to three-fourth of the world’s top 20 cities, which are the most dynamic urban centres in the world.

The results show a continued shift in global influence from west to east, with Indian, Chinese and Vietnamese cities dominating the top positions.

“India — with seven cities in the top 20, the most of any country — leads the 2020 Index, despite slowdown in the nation’s economy,” the report said.

Several cities in the top 20 stand out as they transform their urban environments in pursuit of a low-carbon future.

In India, Hyderabad is looking at ways to reduce the demand for air conditioning with cool roofs that reflect sunlight and absorb less heat as one of the solutions.

The growth of “micro-mobility” is another positive step, illustrated by Hyderabad’s introduction of smart bikes and rising popularity of electric vehicles.

While Hyderabad and Bengaluru as the top two cities globally for socio-economic momentum, a more active real estate market helped elevate Hyderabad to first position in the overall ranking.

Hyderabad recorded the highest office net absorption in 2019 (as a proportion of existing stock) of any city globally, while it is also among the world’s best-performing cities for prime office rental growth.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/xpsy9g/article30605102.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THDYNAMICCITIES,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hyderabad-bengaluru-top-two-most-dynamic-cities-globally-in-list-of-130-jll/article30605103.ece
335,2020/01/20,Sensex slumps 416 points on profit-booking,"Market benchmarks tumbled from record highs to close deep in the red on Monday as investors booked profits in index heavyweights Reliance Industries, Kotak Bank, HDFC Bank and TCS following their quarterly results.

After hitting a record intra-day high of 42,273.87, the 30-share BSE Sensex gave up all gains to settle 416.46 points, or 0.99 per cent, lower at 41,528.91. Likewise, the broader NSE Nifty sank 127.80 points, or 1.03 per cent, to 12,224.55. It hit a record intra-day high of 12,430.50 in early session.

Kotak Mahindra Bank was the biggest laggard in the Sensex pack, dropping 4.70%, after the lender reported a rise in non-performing assets in Q3. Reliance Industries, HDFC Bank and TCS fell up to 3.08% after the companies reported their quarterly earnings over the weekend.

On the other hand, PowerGrid was the top gainer, rising 3.75%, followed by Bharti Airtel, ITC, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank and L&T. According to traders, domestic investors were seen booking profits at record levels. “As expected, market has approached a consolidation phase due to mildly subdued Q3 results in banking and heavyweights. It is fair to expect this mild consolidation to continue in the short-term after the solid performance of the last one-month with fantastic gains in mid & small caps.

“For further direction a lot will depend on the actual budget announcements and broader performance in Q3 result showing gain across the economy,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd. BSE energy, bankex, oil and gas, finance, metal, IT and auto indices fell up to 2.67 per cent, while telecom, realty, utilities and power rose up to 1.89%. Broader BSE midcap and smallcap indices lost up to 0.57%.

World markets maintained their upward trend as investors digested earnings and macroeconomic data. Bourses in Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul ended higher, while Hong Kong closed in the red. European markets were trading on a negative note in their early sessions. Brent crude oil futures rose 0.66 per cent to USD 65.28 per barrel on supply concerns after exports from Libya were blocked after a pipeline was shut down by armed forces and a strike at a key oil field in Iraq hit output.

Forex traders said the drop in the Rupee was largely due to a spurt in crude oil prices following rising tensions in the Middle East and North Africa.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened on a weak note at 71.07 and fell further to a low of 71.15. It finally settled at 71.11, lower by 3 paise against its previous close.

The domestic unit had settled at 71.08 against the American currency on Friday.

Global crude benchmark Brent was trading 0.56% higher at $65.21 per barrel on supply concerns after exports from Libya were blocked after a pipeline was shut down by armed forces and a strike at a key oil field in Iraq hit output.

“Indian rupee opened with minor gains but gave away all its gains amid lower domestic equities and higher crude oil prices. The strength in dollar against major trading currencies also weighed on rupee,” said V.K. Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities.

Forex traders said the near term focus will remain on crude oil prices and foreign fund flows ahead of the Budget. So far this month, overseas investors have bought $1.71 billion in domestic equities while selling debt worth $1.13 billion.

“This week the focus of the market will be on the World Economic Forum. Trump’s speech at the forum will be closely watched for any geopolitical maneuvers, as he has kept few trade related questions lingering,” said Rahul Gupta, Head of Research- Currency, Emkay Global Financial Services.

The dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.08% to 97.68.

The 10-year Indian government bond yield was at 6.65%.

“On the domestic front, no major economic data is expected to be released but market participants will be taking cues from the policy statements that will be released from Japan and Euro zone,” said Gaurang Somaiyaa, Forex & Bullion Analyst, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

338,2020/01/20,Why ‘Make in India’ has failed,"On September 25, 2014, the Indian government announced the ‘Make in India’ initiative to encourage manufacturing in India and galvanize the economy with dedicated investments in manufacturing and services. Immediately after the launch, investment commitments worth crores were announced. In 2015, India emerged as the top destination for foreign direct investment, surpassing the U.S. and China. In line with the national programme, States too launched their own initiatives. Five years later, as we brace for another Union Budget, it would be appropriate to take stock of the much-hyped initiative as the economy in general, and the manufacturing sector in particular, is on a slippery slope.

The ‘Make in India’ idea is not new. Factory production has a long history in the country. This initiative, however, set an ambitious goal of making India a global manufacturing hub. To achieve this goal, targets were identified and policies outlined. The three major objectives were: (a) to increase the manufacturing sector’s growth rate to 12-14% per annum in order to increase the sector’s share in the economy; (b) to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022; and (c) to ensure that the manufacturing sector’s contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (revised to 2025) from the current 16%. The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital.

Designed to fail?

Given that big-ticket projects for grand initiatives such as ‘Make in India’ have long gestation periods and lag effects, assessments of such initiatives can be premature. Also, governments often use the excuse of inheriting an economy riddled with macroeconomic problems, and demand more time to set things right. This is an argument that the current government invokes frequently. However, five years is a reasonable time period to assess the direction and magnitude of outcomes. As the policy changes were intended to usher growth in three key variables of the manufacturing sector — investments, output, and employment growth — an examination of these will help us gauge the success of the policy.

The last five years witnessed slow growth of investment in the economy. This is more so when we consider capital investments in the manufacturing sector. Gross fixed capital formation of the private sector, a measure of aggregate investment, declined to 28.6% of GDP in 2017-18 from 31.3% in 2013-14 (Economic Survey 2018-19). Interestingly, though the public sector’s share remained more or less the same during this period, the private sector’s share declined from 24.2% to 21.5%. Part of this problem can be attributed to the decline in the savings rate in the economy. Household savings have declined, while the private corporate sector’s savings have increased. Thus we find a scenario where the private sector’s savings have increased, but investments have decreased, despite policy measures to provide a good investment climate.

With regard to output growth, we find that the monthly index of industrial production pertaining to manufacturing has registered double-digit growth rates only on two occasions during the period April 2012 to November 2019. In fact, data show that for a majority of the months, it was 3% or below and even negative for some months. Needless to say, negative growth implies contraction of the sector. Thus, we are clearly waiting for growth to arrive.

Regarding employment growth, we have witnessed questions being raised over the government’s delay in releasing data as well as its attempts to revise existing data collection mechanisms. The crux of the debate has been that employment, especially industrial employment, has not grown to keep pace with the rate of new entries into the labour market.

Thus on all three counts, ‘Make in India’ has failed.

Policy casualness

Accusing the previous governments of policy paralysis, the NDA government announced a slew of policies with catchy slogans. This has resulted in an era of never-ending scheme announcements. ‘Make in India’ is a good example of a continuous stream of ‘scheme’ announcements. The announcements had two major lacunae. First, the bulk of these schemes relied too much on foreign capital for investments and global markets for produce. This created an inbuilt uncertainty, as domestic production had to be planned according to the demand and supply conditions elsewhere. Second, policymakers neglected the third deficit in the economy, which is implementation. While economists worry mostly about budget and fiscal deficit, policy implementers need to take into account the implications of implementation deficit in their decisions. The result of such a policy oversight is evident in the large number of stalled projects in India. The spate of policy announcements without having the preparedness to implement them is ‘policy casualness’. ‘Make in India’ has been plagued by a large number of under-prepared initiatives.

The question that begs an answer is, why did ‘Make in India’ fail? There are three reasons. First, it set out too ambitious growth rates for the manufacturing sector to achieve. An annual growth rate of 12-14% is well beyond the capacity of the industrial sector. Historically India has not achieved it and to expect to build capabilities for such a quantum jump is perhaps an enormous overestimation of the implementation capacity of the government. Second, the initiative brought in too many sectors into its fold. This led to a loss of policy focus. Further, it was seen as a policy devoid of any understanding of the comparative advantages of the domestic economy. Third, given the uncertainties of the global economy and ever-rising trade protectionism, the initiative was spectacularly ill-timed.

‘Make in India’ is a policy initiative with inbuilt inconsistencies. The bundle of contradictions unfold when we examine the incongruity of ‘swadeshi’ products being made with foreign capital. This has led to a scenario where there is a quantum jump in the ‘ease of doing business’ ranking, but investments are still to arrive. The economy needs much more than policy window dressing for increasing manufacturing activity. The government must realise that industrialisation cannot be kick-started by a series of bills in Parliament and hosting investors’ meets.

339,2020/01/20,"Who are the Brus, and what are the implications of settling them in Tripura?","A quadripartite agreement in New Delhi on January 16 allowed some 35,000 Bru tribal people, who were displaced from Mizoram and are living in Tripura as refugees since 1997, to settle permanently in Tripura. The Centre, State governments of Tripura and Mizoram, and representatives of Bru organisations signed the agreement in the presence of Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The “solution” has evoked mixed reactions with rights activists fearing it could “legitimise” the ejection of minority communities by ethnocentric states.

Who are the Brus and how did they become internally displaced?

The Brus, aka Reangs, are spread across Tripura, Mizoram and southern Assam. In Mizoram, they are scattered in Kolasib, Lunglei and Mamit districts. While many Brus of Assam and Tripura are Hindu, the Brus of Mizoram converted to Christianity over the years. Clashes in 1995 with the majority Mizos led to the demand for the removal of the Brus, perceived to be non-indigenous, from Mizoram’s electoral rolls. This led to an armed movement by a Bru outfit, which killed a Mizo forest official in October 1997. The retaliatory ethnic violence saw more than 40,000 Brus fleeing to adjoining Tripura where they took shelter in six relief camps.

Have there been efforts to repatriate them?

The Centre and the two State governments involved made nine attempts to resettle the Brus in Mizoram. The first was in November 2010 when 1,622 Bru families with 8,573 members went back. Protests by Mizo NGOs, primarily the Young Mizo Association, stalled the process in 2011, 2012 and 2015. Meanwhile, the Brus began demanding relief on a par with the relief given to Kashmiri Pandits and Sri Lankan Tamil refugees. The Centre spent close to ₹500 crore for relief and rehabilitation until the last peace deal was brokered over three years since 2015. A final package of ₹435 crore was arrived at in July 2018 and it involved Mizo NGOs besides the governments concerned.

Why did the Mizoram rehabilitation package not work out?

The package covered 32,876 members of 5,407 Bru families, entailing a one-time assistance of ₹4 lakh as fixed deposit within a month of repatriation, monthly cash assistance of ₹5,000 through DBT, free rations for two years, and ₹1.5 lakh in three instalments as house-building assistance. The package also included Eklavya residential schools, permanent residential and ST certificates besides funds to the Mizoram government for improving security in Bru resettlement areas. The refugees were given a deadline, September 30, to move or face harder times at the relief camps. But most stayed back, demanding resettlement in close-knit clusters and an autonomous council for Brus in Mizoram.

What are the implications of the Tripura resettlement?

The demand to rehabilitate the Brus in Tripura was first raised by Pradyot Manikya, the scion of the Tripura royal family. The BJP-led Tripura government agreed. Chief Minister Biplab Deb called the “solution” within Tripura historic, as did his Mizoram counterpart Zoramthanga. Guwahati-based researcher on social issues and conflicts, Walter Fernandes, said the decision was humanitarian from the point of view of the Brus, who were apprehensive about returning to Mizoram, but felt it could lead to conflicts with the locals of Tripura. Delhi-based rights activist Suhas Chakma said it could set a bad precedent, encouraging ethnocentric states to eject minorities of all hues besides making the Brus of Mizoram opt for the rehabilitation package in the relative safety of Tripura. The displaced Brus who returned to Mizoram have already begun demanding a package equivalent to the one those who stayed behind in the Tripura relief camps would be getting. And conflicts between the Brus and the local Bengali non-tribal people have started taking place in Tripura.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uvg8xi/article30602453.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bru,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/who-are-the-brus-and-what-are-the-implications-of-settling-them-in-tripura/article30600913.ece
340,2020/01/20,Bull and gore: On jallikattu,"Seen by the courts as cruelty on bulls, but celebrated in Tamil Nadu as a display of valour, the rural sport of jallikattu is an inevitable part of the Pongal season in the State. It is promoted as a tourist attraction by the government and its appeal as a symbol of Tamil culture remains the same year after year. It is only the odd voice that sees it as a relic of a feudal past. However, one aspect that remains unchanged — through the years in which the legality of the bull-taming sport was questioned, the event itself banned, and then restored by law — is that every season, it leaves a few dead and scores wounded. Often, these wounds are a trauma doctor’s nightmare, given the grievous nature of the bull gore injuries. It is an event that cries for maximum regulation. The regulations have been tightened from time to time, and no event takes place without official permission or medical supervision. The playing arena is protected by double barricades, the entry point and ‘collection point’, where the bulls are to be taken back by the owners after they leave the arena, are supposed to have sufficient protective features to minimise incidents that lead to injuries and fatalities. Yet, some have died in the main events that took place in the last few days; they include bull owners, spectators and an organiser. The victims were mostly gored or stomped upon. Over a hundred are being treated for injuries, some of which are quite serious, marked by internal ruptures that may have a lasting effect on the victims.

Also Read The jallikattu challenge

The truth about jallikattu is that it is well nigh impossible to hold an incident-free event. Even conceding that every sport has an element of the danger of injury, especially contact sports, the distinguishing feature of events involving animals is that they are driven by the instinct of self-preservation and anxiety, and are not bound by rules and reason the way human participants are. Inevitably, the human casualty list is higher, even though it has been long argued, and even judicially determined that jallikattu constitutes a grave violation of animal rights and a perpetration of cruelty on them. Popular sentiment, political patronage and the cultural instinct to preserve practices that hark back to a hoary past contribute collectively to the continuance of the sport. Other virtues attributed to it include giving native breeds a good shot at survival and an opportunity to youth to develop a robust outlook even while earning rewards. What should ultimately matter, above all, is that any activity that endangers participant and onlooker alike should be held under rigorously monitored regulations and restrictions. It is also time that appropriate protective gear is devised and made mandatory for participants.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bull-and-gore/article30601653.ece
341,2020/01/20,Needless fracas: On Governors vs Kerala and West Bengal governments,"The endless squabbles between the Governors and respective State governments in Kerala and West Bengal are disconcerting. Arif Mohammad Khan and Jagdeep Dhankhar, Governors of Kerala and West Bengal, respectively, have arrogated to themselves an activist role, which is at the heart of the tensions. Mr. Khan has made repeated public statements on controversial questions such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019; he has even said that it was his duty to defend the laws made by the Centre. It is a dubious claim to make, and at any rate, there is no discernible precedent as such. His view that his office is not a rubber stamp is true, but he must also be mindful that the Constitution envisages the execution of popular will through an elected government. Mr. Dhankhar has placed himself at the centre of several controversies, and often appears eager for the next spectacular showdown with the State government. Kerala’s Left Democratic Front has been more restrained than the combative resistance by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, but parties barring the BJP in both States are agitated over the proactive, and often provocative roles of their respective Governors. The boisterous profiles of these Governors are symptomatic of a larger malaise of degrading relations between the Centre and States ruled by parties opposed to the BJP, aggravated by an insatiable yearning of the former for centralisation of power.

Also Read Governance and the Governor

The Constitution seeks to bolster centripetal forces in this vast and diverse country, and the Centre’s power to appoint Governors is one such. The Governor’s constitutional role has been debated and interpreted through several cases, but ingenious occupants of the office have managed to push the boundaries with unprecedented moves. Sagacious occupants have used the Governor’s office to promote national integration. Many others have merely acted as agents of the ruling party at the Centre. Using a pliant Governor to undermine a State government or engineer a legislative majority is an old and secular trick used by all parties at the Centre. State government-Governor conflicts have hence not been rare, but what makes the current situation extraordinary is the political context. No other government in the past has sought to construct a centralising narrative for the nation as the current one at the Centre; and no government in the past has been as intolerant towards its diversity. In this schema, the Governor appears to have a critical, instrumental role. The ignominious role played by the then Governor of Jammu and Kashmir in ending its special constitutional status last year is instructive. The Governor’s role as a link between the State and the Centre shall not be an imperial one. The office of the Governor must be a dialogic and consultative one. The combative posturing in Kerala and West Bengal will bring more disarray, no unity. The Centre must treat State governments with the respect that democratically elected governments deserve.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/needless-fracas/article30601641.ece

343,2020/01/20,‘Also survey trees other than those on the side of roads’,"The Karnataka High Court on Monday directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to modify the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed with Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) for conducting a tree survey to also include trees other than those found on the sides of roads and streets.

344,2020/01/20,Fear looms over other settlements after Sunday eviction drive,"Hundreds of families, including young children, who were rendered homeless after an eviction drive, had no option but to spend the night in the open. Several hutments were demolished at Bellandur, Brookefield and Kariyammana Agrahara by authorities with police protection on Sunday.

While a few organisations have come forward to help these families, many have been left to fend for themselves. A petition has been filed in the High Court of Karnataka by the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL).

Suddenly rendered homeless, many children who lived in the hutments were not able to go to school on Monday while the adults could not get to work.

When The Hindu visited Kariyammana Agrahara, families were trying to salvage whatever was left of their belongings. Many women and young children were crying owing to hunger.

“We have not eaten since Sunday. We have lost everything. We are daily wagers. Our daily wages sustain our everyday needs,” said Sahitya Nandan, 53, who works as a sweeper.

Nine-year-old Afshana takes care of her younger brother after coming back from school while her mother goes to work. “My father died last year and my mother is the sole breadwinner. We don't know what to do now,” she cried.

Similar is the case of Rabiya Begum's family. Rabiya, a mother of three young children, said, “My husband is not in town. The hut that offered us shelter is no longer there. How are we supposed to live in this condition?”

Residents of the remaining hutments are living in fear of losing their homes. The police had reportedly detained the owners of the private lands where these hutments had come up. Fearing police action, on Monday, the landowner of a similar hutment colony in Kudlu Gate evicted all the residents and razed their huts.

Akbar Ali Mondal, who works in the solid waste management sector and resides in a hutment in Munekolala near Marathahalli, said that though the residents told the police that they had all identity cards, the police were in no mood to listen to them.

“We had even submitted our records to the police some time ago. I have been living here for the past 11 years. But the police are asking us to go back to our respective States. How can we, citizens of India, be asked to not live here,” he asked.

The police, on their part, claim to be following instructions of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). Senior police officials, on condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that they have no provision to check the authenticity of the documents submitted by the residents of these hutments. “With a lot of attention on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), we don't want to invite any controversy by getting into the act of checking documents,” the official said.

Action against BBMP official

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is looking into the evictions that have rendered homeless hundreds of families belonging to lower socio-economic groups. The Joint Commissioner (Mahadevapura zone) has been directed to inquire and submit a report on Tuesday.

According to the police, they received a letter from the jurisdictional Assistant Executive Engineer, following which the demolition was taken up.

349,2020/01/20,Inline scanners installed at domestic terminal of Chennai airport,"Finally, Chennai airport’s domestic terminal has got four Inline Baggage Screening (ILBS) scanners, which will reduce the amount of time passengers have to wait to get their baggage screened. Up until now, passengers have had to lift their baggage and have it screened through a stand alone X-Ray machine, a process that was very time consuming.

Officials of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said they began operating the four machines early on Monday morning and they have been working fine so far. “This will definitely ease congestion at the domestic terminal to a great extent during the peak hours every day, from 5 a.m. till 7 a.m., when several thousand passengers travel out of the domestic terminal. Usually, passengers have to wait for quite sometime in the morning to first get their baggage checked through these standalone X-Ray machines and now, all they have to do is go to the airline counter and simply leave the baggage in the machine. This will save time for them,” an official said.

Only recently, new upgraded inline scanners were installed in the departure hall of international terminal as well. But passengers need to be informed by airline staff is that they should not be carrying liquids or power banks in their check-in baggage. “We see a lot of first-time travellers on domestic flights. They may not be aware of such rules. So far, when passengers were putting in their baggage through the standalone X-Ray machines, the staff would immediately alert them and remove it from the baggage. But now, since it is inline scanners, if passengers don’t know these rules, their baggage might be taken out at the end and they will be called by the staff and they can even miss their flight. So, airline staff must ensure that they warn passengers in advance,” he added.

Officials said they will continue monitoring the machines for a while to check if there are glitches and fix them immediately, in case they emerge.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/c92g9k/article30606505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20JANTH-AIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/inline-scanners-installed-at-domestic-terminal-of-chennai-airport/article30606506.ece
350,2020/01/20,Three firms to offer expertise in executing first section of Chennai Metro Rail’s phase II,"In an important step ahead for the phase II project of Chennai Metro Rail, general consultants who will play a crucial role in monitoring the project have been appointed.

Three firms — Nippon Koei, Aarvee Associates and Balaji Rail Roads Systems Private Limited — have been given the contract for consultancy work for a part of the phase II project. Though this project covers a vast distance of 118.9 km, nearly 52 km will be executed first and this will cover two stretches — Madhavaram to Taramani and Madhavaram to CMBT. These firms will do consultancy work only for this 52 km stretch that will be constructed first. For the remaining distance, Chennai Metro Rail will call for tenders in a phased manner and then award the contracts.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) will fund this 52 km stretch, and it has been decided that these two stretches will be taken up first. “The general consultant will look into everything from calling for tenders for various work to build these two stretches, to monitoring how they are executed by the contractors. All aspects of the project will be looked into by them, ensuring that the contractor doesn’t compromise on quality of work or safety. They will also provide expertise in several issues of the project,” an official said.

The tenders have already been called for the civil work for the 52 km, and contractors are likely to be identified in two months, officials said. The initial work for part of the project may begin as early as June this year, officials said.

CMRL has already called for tenders for general consultants for another stretch as well.

351,2020/01/20,At least 200 students dropped out of Chennai Corporation schools in 2019,"﻿As many as 200 students of Chennai Corporation schools have dropped out during the academic year 2019-2020. Their families have also shifted from the address given to the school authorities, making it difficult to trace the students, and get them back to school.

The students who dropped out are from high schools and higher secondary schools of the Chennai Corporation at 70 locations in the city, according to officials. The Chennai Corporation has started attempting to trace the students. According to data compiled, the students have dropped out from its schools between June and December 2019.

When teams of teachers visited the homes of the students who dropped out, they found that the families of the students had shifted to a new location, making it difficult for the teachers to include their names on the rolls again.

Around 40% of Corporation schools offer better quality education for their students free of cost, registering better results when compared to other private schools in the neighbourhood.

Corporation officials said the schools could be developed only by acquiring additional land in the vicinity or by the resettlement of families in unauthorised constructions. But most of the schools have been located near slums where resettlement could actually reduce the number of students. Many schools have reported a reduction in number of students after resettlement of slums along the Cooum and Adyar rivers.

Schools in the vicinity of more than 50 slums along the Cooum River have already reduced student strength, after the relocation process was started. Some schools have no students at all.

Resettlement of families along Buckingham Canal is expected to reduce the number of students from 85,000 to less than 50,000 in the Corporation schools.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jrrc5/article30606026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20JANTH-CORPN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/at-least-200-students-dropped-out-of-chennai-corporation-schools-in-2019/article30606028.ece
352,2020/01/20,Meet Madhavan Palanisamy who shot the Indian Army’s ad campaign,"Jazz music suffuses like steam through the cafe. Time slows down in the room with chinoiserie wallpaper and sepia photographs from a century ago. With his sage-like beard and calm, Madhavan Palanisamy seems to belong more to such a time than to today, where he has carved a name for himself as an award-winning photographer and filmmaker.

Coimbatore-born and raised Madhavan, 44, recently, won LensCulture’s B&W Series award for his work ‘Appa and Other Animals’. “Amsterdam-based LensCulture is an authority in contemporary photography. Chosen among entries from 126 countries, mine had nine pictures that celebrate the time spent with my father, famous writer and literary critic Kovai Gnani,” says Madhavan. “He had been unwell and, on my visit home, in between discussing his work, Carl Jung and spirituality, I would go on long walks shooting pictures of abandoned horses and stray dogs with my Contax, the ‘Lamborghini of cameras’. I juxtaposed these pictures with those of my father for the series.”

Madhavan’s work that choreographs portraiture and documentary aims to create an empathetic link between viewer and subject and is a spillover from an eclectic childhood.

“My father lost his vision to diabetes when he was 45, but he considered that a gift, going on to write many books. Even earlier, our home was filled with Marxist thinkers and discussions on the subaltern. As children, we watched the films of Charlie Chaplin, Bergman, Fellini, Godard and Ray. They became my creative force pushing me to approach my work with flamboyance and gut.”

Madhavan followed the beaten path of graduating in the sciences to find his art. “I loved science but my degree in Biochemistry didn’t sync with me. I followed it up with an MBA, participating along the way in ad-zap and story writing contests. I was drawn to advertising visuals of the 1990s, especially the work of Prabuddha Dasgupta. The era’s play of light and shade, the candid approach to telling a story, so different from western visuals resonated with me,” says Madhavan.

“I used to shoot pictures as a child with a Zenith. For portraits, the Minolta with a 135mm lens was my go-to camera. But when I joined the advertising world it was for servicing. JWT, where I worked, held space for experimentation and exploration, short film and photography, and that is where I learnt to prefer ambient light despite the studio set-up.”

Madhavan moved on to work with Bharath Ramamrutham at Graf (“where I learnt a different language of photography”), set up Magicbus Studio with Radha Rathi and shot a conceptual series that “was sweet and innocent but not strong enough. Every two years, I shed my skin and did a round of photography on celebrities, portraiture, sustainable fashion and human stories. My language and intent changed and I returned to JWT as creative director.”

A couple of exhibitions followed, but it was in search of the intensely personal that led Madhavan to strike out on his own. It was then that Grey India offered him the ambitious Indian Army project. The commissioned advertising campaign featured the Army as ‘India’s most exciting workplace’.

For 40 days, Madhavan traversed the country filming officers of the Indian Army in their places of work — Siachen, where snow falls in thick flurries; the rocky defiles of Ladakh; the densely forested training grounds of the Special Forces; the passing-out parades at National Defence Academy, Khadakwasla, and Indian Military Academy, Dehradun; and the children of the Army Public School, Mhow.

“Portraying non-models and showing their vulnerability and power was my strength, and shooting with people who lived the experience helped me put it together well. It is the most amazing project that I have done. The brief was to showcase that there are avenues aplenty for techies, engineers and doctors in the Forces. Shooting in Siachen without acclimatisation was the toughest,” says Madhavan, “but it was surreal.”

The images are hallucinatory — blazing tank guns, soldiers with war paint-streaked faces and hardy resolves standing by bunkers, and laser light from a weapon caught in a flashbulb’s glare. This was followed by grand pictures of the Indian Navy’s International Fleet Review.

Over the past year, Madhavan has shot romantic love through the lives of same-sex couples, magically lit portraits of the people of Malnad and a special one on time spent in Shimla with his son where he came across a museum with wax statues.

Madhavan’s work is compellingly personal but resonates with the viewer, a reflection of his favourite quote from The Gospel of Thomas — If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hn9trm/article30605900.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15MPCover5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/indian-army-ad-campaign-photographer-wins-award/article30605913.ece
353,2020/01/20,Drunk man tries to stab wife but kills self,"A 35-year-old man ended up accidentally killing himself during his attempt to stab his wife in an incident reported near Sevvapet in Tiruvallur district on Saturday night.

Gopal, who was selling juice at Vivekananda Street, came home inebriated and picked up a quarrel with his wife Suganya, police sources said.

His mother-in-law, who was witnessing the quarrel, developed chest pain, following which Suganya rushed her to a hospital.

A fight broke out between the couple when Gopal allegedly refused to allow the two women into the hospital.

According to the police, he pulled out a knife and attempted to stab his wife.

When she tried to push him down, the knife pierced his chest.

Gopal was rushed to the government hospital in Tiruvallur, where he was declared brought dead.

354,2020/01/20,Search on to trace baby,"Even a week after a seven-month-old baby was kidnapped by a woman from the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital premises, the city police are yet to nab the suspect. They have sent pictures of the accused to railway stations and bus terminus in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring States.

John, son of Johnny and Randesha Bosle from Maharashtra, was abducted by a woman who identified herself as Radha. The accused befriended the couple, who sell balloons on Marina Beach, last Saturday and convinced them that the child could act in movies as he had good features.

She approached them on Sunday and took the child, along with the couple, to Omandurar Government Hospital under the pretext of conducting some skin tests and then took them to the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.

Claiming that she had to get a certificate for the child, she took the child into a secluded ward and then disappeared. Since she did not return for long, Ms. Randesha searched the ward. But she neither found Radha nor her son. So she lodged a police complaint.

The police checked the CCTV footage and found a pregnant woman dressed in a pink saree leaving the hospital with the child. “We tracked the footage and she was last seen crossing the Poonamallee High Road towards Gandhi Irwin Bridge,” said a police officer.

He said that all the 11 special teams, formed to rescue the baby, checked the CCTV footage in Egmore and Chennai Central Railway Stations. “But she is not to be seen in any one of them. We have informed all the railway and bus stations in the city and districts. We have also passed on the photo of the woman to Andhra Pradesh police and the railway police,” added the officer.

Those who can provide information about the woman can contact the police control room on 044-23452361; Flower Bazaar inspector on 9003095550; Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital police outpost on 04423452473 and sub inspectors on 7904250724, 9498141297, 8122019987.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/search-on-to-trace-baby/article30603191.ece
355,2020/01/20,Readers’ Mail,"Bridge in urgent need of repairs

Loco Bridge is one of the ancient bridges in north Chennai. It is used by majority of the people in Perambur and beyond. It is an important connect to the city. At present, there are two bridges — one connects G.K.M. colony and Periyar nagar; and the other connects Anna Nagar and Ayanavaram, but needs maintenance. During peak hours and rainy season, it is in a pathetic state. Even autos are parked in the middle of the bridge, and serve as an auto stand. Authorities are not taking any steps. The bridge needs vital repairs, urgently, so that residents don’t face any problems in the long run.

Damaged road poses a threat

The road adjoining Krishna Nagar police booth S-11 and Krishna Nagar 1st Street, down to Shakthi Nagar water tank, is badly damaged.

Motorists find it difficult to ride on the pothole-ridden road, to get to the adjacent main road to reach Tambaram or Mannivakkam.

The problem is compounded during monsoon, as the road gets inundated, and motorists keep falling, as they are unable to see the potholes. Authorities should relay the road, duly repairing the potholes, for the safety of the motorists.

G.N. Chetty road in need of attention

I have been trying to bring to the attention of the Chennai Corporation, that while good work has been done at Pondy Bazaar, Thyagaraja Road, the parallel road — G.N. Chetty Road (which used to be a beautiful tree-lined avenue off the Anna Flyover) — has now become G.N. Cheri Road.

A number of small unauthorised eateries have sprung up on either sides of the road (near the entrance of the Habibullah Road), recently, on the newly-constructed pedestrian footpath, completely blocking the same. Further, there is stagnant water and garbage. The Corporation must look into this and rectify the situation.

357,2020/01/20,Civic works delayed,"Most of the projects taken up for improving school infrastructure with funding from city MPs and MLAs and using Smart City project funds have also been delayed.

Before implementation of the school makeover project, civic works were to be carried out using these funds but most of them have not been taken up and many have been delayed.

Residents have requested better facilities in more than 100 schools to their local MPs and MLAs.

Harbour MLA Sekar Babu said that the government should speed up the process of implementation of projects funded by the local area development funds to improve the condition of schools.

“We funded a work to develop a corporation school in Bander Garden in 2017. But the project was delayed by two years. It was completed only in 2019. When MLAs and MPs decide to use funds for smart classrooms, it is sent to ELCOT, causing a delay,” he said.

Work on development of 16 classrooms has started in school on Wall Tax Road using funds from MPLADS. Such work should be completed without any delay. Any improvement in school infrastructure will help the children of poor labourers get quality education, he said.

The Corporation should form a committee to facilitate implementation of such projects without any delay, he said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/civic-works-delayed/article30603015.ece
358,2020/01/20,Project to makeover Corporation schools hanging fire,"Chennai Corporation’s proposal to give a makeover to all its 281 schools at an estimated cost of ₹200 crore is hanging fire.

As the government has not given its nod for the full funding, there has been a steady deterioration of the structural condition of classrooms, affecting education of poor students and increasing dropouts at an alarming rate.

The proposal to give a makeover to all corporation schools last year was made following a drastic reduction in the student strength, which fell from 1.3 lakh to 85,000 in the last decade. The makeover was expected to increase the number of students in more than 168 Chennai Corporation schools which have been registering a dip in the student strength over the past ten years.

Students from 60% of the Corporation schools have reduced in number in the past few years, with parents transferring their children to private schools. However, over 113 Corporation schools managed to buck the trend, attracting students even from private schools, primarily because of the hard work of the teachers in these schools.

Last year, the Chennai Corporation proposed to give a makeover to all the schools at an estimated cost of ₹200 crore. The infrastructure of schools was proposed to be changed completely, utilising cutting-edge technology, modern smart classrooms and making the buildings more attractive, airy, spacious, well-lit and well-ventilated after the makeover. But the State government is yet to give its nod for the funding of the entire project, officials say. Instead, the Chennai Corporation is planning to take up just three schools in each of the three regions for the school makeover project. As a result, less than 10 of the 281 Corporation schools will receive a makeover by the beginning of the next academic year in June, officials point out.

Former Corporation Councillor S.Mangala Raj said many of the corporation schools have been damaged because of inadequate security personnel. “Anti social elements gain entry into the schools during holidays and in the nights. If the State government is unable to fund the project, the Corporation should at least permit banks to set up ATMs near the gate to promote safety and security on the premises. If ATMs are set up, video surveillance and police patrol may improve,” he said.

“We used to increase the height of the walls of the schools to prevent entry of anti-social elements into the premises of corporation schools. We stopped increasing the height of the walls after many residents died in wall collapse of various schools in neighbourhoods of north Chennai,” said a Headmistress of a Corporation School.

Parents of Chennai Corporation school students have been demanding better toilet facilities, clean drinking water supply and better classrooms.

Classrooms in many schools in north Chennai are small when compared to the government norm of a dimension of 20 feet by 20 feet. Over 25 Corporation schools are yet to get the right size of classrooms with a width of 20 feet and a length of 20 feet.

“Our school is constructed on a small piece of land measuring four to five grounds. The road is 15 feet in width. The school is located in a slum to cater to the poor residents. Giving a makeover to such schools with small land parcels is a challenge,” said a teacher.

Urban planners stressed on the need to give higher Floor Space Index and relaxing other planning parameters for such buildings to accommodate the new architecture, which has been proposed in the makeover project. Corporation officials said they will start work on makeover of the schools after a pilot project shortly.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/6r065d/article30603000.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THCITYMATTERS2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/project-to-makeover-corporation-schools-hanging-fire/article30603005.ece

360,2020/01/20,KPL to set up port-related industries at ₹70 crore,"Kamarajar Port Ltd. (KPL) will develop around 320 acres of land, at a cost of ₹70 crore, to set up port-related industries. Such port-led industrialisation will also help in providing employment opportunities.

Infrastructure, including roads, rail connectivity, warehousing, container terminals, truck parking, lighting, power supply and drainage, will be created by the port.

“We are looking at industries that require the port for imports or exports — for instance, palm oil processing units or lithium-based battery parts units. This will be like a special industrial park that has proximity to the port,” explained KPL chairman and managing director Sunil Paliwal.

The project is being taken up under the Sagarmala programme, with the aim to reduce the cost of logistics and time for the movement of EXIM and domestic cargo, and development of port-proximate future industrial capacities near the coast is a step in this direction. A consultant has already prepared a master plan and business plan, after consultation with stakeholders. The consultant has identified industries such as pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, electronics, engineering, automobile and non-metallic minerals.

The port currently awaits environmental clearance for the project, that proposes to tender and auction the land parcels for 60-year-long leases. “Such leases are usually for 30 years, but we have taken special permission from the Government of India for making the project more competitive,” he added.

Of the 320 acres identified for the project, 187 acres will be land for industrial and logistics development. Rest of the area will be classified as non-processing area and be set aside for facilities, including roads, utilities and green space. The Kamarajar Port presently has eight operational berths, of which one is primarily used for the export of automobiles, and one exclusively for liquid natural gas imports.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/y5demy/article30602948.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/kpl-to-set-up-port-related-industries-at-70-crore/article30602949.ece
361,2020/01/20,NHAI requests STCs to adopt FASTags cards,"The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has requested the six State Transport Corporations (STC) to adopt radio frequency-based FASTag ID cards for their buses.

In a letter to the State Transport Department, it said that FASTags have been made mandatory by the Government of India and that monthly passes cannot be used to cross plazas. It said that NH Fee Rules, stipulated by the Government of India, stated that there was a provision to make 50 journeys a month.

Sources in the NHAI said that, however, with the implementation of FASTags, where the toll due is automatically deducted by the system, monthly passes cannot be provided to these commercial vehicles.

Pending cases

“Over the past several years, many toll operators of the NHAI have raised the issue of non-payment of fee for additional trips made by the STCs. The amount runs to over ₹50 crore,” the official explained. There are also a couple of cases that are pending in the court.

A senior official of the Transport Department said that after the introduction of FASTags, the State Express Transport Corporation (SETC), whose number of trips are very limited, had already migrated to FASTags. However, the issue of the monthly concession pertains to the six State Transport Corporations (STCs) of Villupuram, Coimbatore, Salem, Kumbakonam, Madurai, and Tirunelveli. All the six STCs have gone to court citing that the new rules of the NHAI are not acceptable, the official pointed out.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami has written a letter to the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, requesting the Central government to allow the STC buses to continue with the monthly concession passes for multiple trips, official sources said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8sqwzb/article30602942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THFASTAG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/nhai-requests-stcs-to-adopt-fastags-cards/article30602943.ece

363,2020/01/20,"New wing to protect women, children benefits both victims and police","Formation of the crime against women and children wing seems to have benefitted the 35 All-Women Police Stations (AWPS) as well as the regular police stations in the city.

Freed from bandobast duties, the AWPS takes care of the safety of women and children, while regular police stations focus on crime prevention and ensuring of law and order.

The crime against women and children wing was formed in June 2019, based on a direction from the Supreme Court. Since June 2019, it has registered 292 cases, including 137 Pocso cases, 10 rape cases, 30 dowry harassment cases and 115 women harassment cases.

“We have booked 26 offenders under the Goondas Act, and have been successful in getting conviction in 25 cases. We now work in coordination with other departments , like social welfare, social defence, courts and child and women rights’ activists and organisations,” said H. Jayalakshmi, Deputy Commissioner of Police, special wing for crime against women and children.

A.K. Viswanathan, Police Commissioner, said: “Earlier, the AWPS were under the jurisdiction of the Assistant Commissioner and the Deputy Commissioner. Now they report to me, two additional commissioners and to Ms. Jayalakshmi.”

Personnel from regular police stations are also relieved, as they no longer have to handle cases related to missing women, Pocso or harassment, apart from the regular law and order cases. “Now these personnel can focus on community policing, patrolling and crime prevention,” said Prasanna Gettu, managing trustee, International Foundation for Crime Prevention and Victim Care (PCVC).

“The AWPS now don’t have to worry about other duties, and probably because of this, there is a change in the way they treat the complainants,” she added. Even complainants have started seeing a difference. “When we would approach the station earlier, most personnel would have gone on bandobast duty. Now officers are present at the station,” said K. Vani (name changed), who had come to the Thousand Lights police station to lodge a complaint against her husband.

Sherin Bosko, child rights’ activist and co-founder of Nakshatra, an NGO that works for the rehabilitation of rape victims, said police personnel were now more sensitive when it came to Pocso cases and those concerning women. “Recently, the AWPS handled a child rape case very efficiently,” she said.

Staff shortage

But AWPS personnel complain that there is a need to fill vacancies in the wing. “As of now, we have a strength of 500 personnel. We need at least 130 more personnel to perform even better,” said a police officer.

Women inspectors add that they need technical training and a dedicated cyber team for the wing to handle online harassment and child pornography cases.

“We have to approach the cyber crime unit of the Central Crime Branch every single time, and this causes a delay in cracking the cases. It will be best if we are technically equipped and have a cyber unit of our own,” they said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7k01di/article30602827.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THAMMAPATROL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/new-wing-to-protect-women-children-benefits-both-victims-and-police/article30602828.ece
364,2020/01/20,School Education Department readies for exams,"Ahead of the exam season, which begins in March, the School Education department is considering adding more operators and counsellors to the toll free helpline 14417 to help students, parents and teachers deal with any queries they might have.

It has been a year of several changes in both the syllabus and exams for students of the State board stream.

“While we will be creating awareness about the helpline among students, parents and teachers, we are planning to add more people to field calls during the exam season this year. The helpline gets the maximum calls when the public exams are being conducted,” said S. Kannappan, Director of School Education.

This year, classes V, VIII, X, XI and XII will be taking up public exams. Ahead of the exam season, the officials in-charge of the helpline said that they had been taking queries from private candidates about registrations.

“From when it was set up in March 2018 to December 2019, the helpline has received over 2.56 lakh calls. While there are counsellors who handle the calls we get from students related to stress and anxiety, teachers, who are subject experts, will be present a couple of days before each public exam to address queries the students might have in the subject in which they will take up the exam,” said Francis Joseph, who heads the 14417 Education Information Centre.

With students of classes V and VIII taking up the public exam for the first time this year, a counsellor with the helpline said that they had been getting calls from students about the portions they are going to be tested in. “Our aim is to ensure they do not feel the pressure,” she added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/school-education-department-readies-for-exams/article30602678.ece
365,2020/01/20,Tackling illegal trekking remains a challenge,"Illegal trekking in reserve forests remains a challenge for the Forest Department despite efforts to curb it. Often, illegal trekking comes to light only during tragedies like the one in Coimbatore on Sunday, when a woman was trampled to death by a wild elephant.

The Forest Department permits trekking only in a few places of the forest division, that too under the supervision of its staff.

“In Coimbatore, trekking through forests is allowed only in a places like the Vellingiri hills and the Melmudi Ranganathar temple, with certain restrictions. Other hill shrines like the Maruthamalai temple are connected by good roads, through which vehicles are permitted. Tragedies happen when people ignore warnings, get out of vehicles and trespass into forests,” said Coimbatore District Forest Officer D. Venkatesh.

The Department does not allow private adventure trip operators to conduct treks anywhere in Coimbatore. It conducts jungle trails as part of an eco-tourism initiative in a few places, in the presence of its staff. In the Nilgiris, crackdowns on illegal treks into reserve forests have been limited to crucial wildlife habitats in the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and parts of the Nilgiris forest division.

D. Guruswamy, District Forest Officer, Nilgiris division, told The Hindu that though no cases were registered for trespassing into reserve forests in 2019, the Department had closed two “trekking routes” used by private resorts and private safari operators. “For all intents and purposes, treks are not allowed at all in the Nilgiris forest division, except at a few designated areas,” he said.

At Vellingiri hills in Coimbatore, pilgrims are screened at the check post near the Poondi temple before being allowed to trek the seven hills. Visitors are allowed only in groups on special days, that too only through designated routes.

“In Glenmorgan and Sholur in the Nilgiris, we have warned resort owners who organise illegal treks and safaris,” said Mr. Guruswamy.

A forest range officer acknowledged that there have been isolated incidents of illegal trekking in Coimbatore. Manpower constraint is among the challenges in curbing this. In Coimbatore, the frontline staff of the Department are limited to 136 anti-poaching watchers and a ten-member Rapid Response Team.

Recently, Additional Principal Conservator of Forests Debasis Jana, (Chief Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore Circle), said that the Department was working with 65% of the sanctioned strength of forest staff in the Nilgiris, Gudalur and Coimbatore forest divisions.

Policing every square kilometer of reserve forest in the Nilgiris was next to impossible, with forest officials focusing on preventing entry into especially dangerous areas, and also building lines of communication between local communities to share information about illegal trekkers entering forests with the department.

G. Janardhanan, president of the Ooty Public Awareness Association, said that in recent years, youngsters had begun entering forested areas to take photographs and selfies.

“Many areas, such as the Catherine Waterfalls in Kotagiri and Kalhatty falls near Udhagamandalam, have been notified as being off-limits to the public, but people still venture into these areas with impunity,” said Mr. Janardhanan.

K. Kalidasan of Coimbatore-based Osai, an environmental NGO, said trekking in forest for any purpose, including animal census or research, should be done with the assistance of forest staff who know the forest area. Environmental activist K. Mohanraj wanted the Department to step up surveillance in forest areas like Palamalai.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/53ls55/article24507159.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH25KURANGANIFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/tackling-illegal-trekking-remains-a-challenge/article30602660.ece
366,2020/01/20,Equity’s weak pulse and commodified medicine,"In 1924, the Madras presidency of British-India rolled out the Subsidised Rural Medical Relief Scheme (SRMRS), which was about providing temporary annual subsidies to doctors choosing to settle down and practise privately in villages specified by local boards. Essentially a manifestation of the English laissez-faire policy, the scheme was then reckoned to be an economical way of expanding health-care access in rural areas. The economic depression of the 1930s brought this scheme to a complete standstill, and an initiative named Honorary Medical Scheme (HMS) received impetus. While initially planned to assist full-time permanent medical officers in government hospitals, honoraries soon started to supplant permanent doctors in an attempt to cut government spending on health. Eventually, any further recruitment into full-time permanent positions (expect in cases of exceptional need) was halted.

It is possible to deduce from what is sourced above, two noticeable and continuing trends that were directly inherited from colonial times. First that the spending on health shall be smooth to come under the knife at the slightest whiff of an economic downturn. Second, that laissez-faire will be the unannounced, yet predominant, approach towards health care, and the majority of doctors (and patients) shall be left to fend for themselves in an unregulated market. The current squabble over the Prime Minister’s recent purported remark about pharmaceutical companies bribing doctors with women escorts trivialises the deep systemic moorings of medical malpractices which lie in these trends.

Advent of the private sector

As early as in 1938, only 23% of doctors were in the public sector with the rest working in the private sector, predominantly in single practices. Post-Independence, perpetual sub-optimal investments in public health allowed the private sector to capitalise, flourish, and increasingly gain the confidence of the masses. The private sector went from having about 1,400 enterprises in 1950 to more than 10 lakh in 2010-11. To doctors, this promised greater professional liberty, lesser restrictions, and higher incomes. After liberalisation, the greater focus shifted to the lucrative tertiary-care sector and led to an onslaught of sophisticated private health care in cities.

The dominance of the market, bespoken by the simple fact that the private sector has over 70% of the health-care workforce and 80% of allopathic doctors, has meant that it is scarcely possible for a health-care provider to function in defiance of its norms. And the pervasiveness of malpractices in this market has come to ensure that few could survive without condoning them. Quite amazingly, players in this market, in much of their malpractices, have also learnt to function as a harmonious family. The family plays its role in safeguarding its members, acquainting them with its norms and interests, and leveraging the power of its patriarchs to defend its interests in society. It is little wonder that the market has also come to dictate the avenues of aggrandisement and yardsticks of professional success for health-care professionals. Business finesse and social adroitness rather than clinical excellence and empathy become the touchstones of calibre in this market.

Another way of describing things is that the larger chunk of Indian health care (and health workforce) could not be brought under a “national system” having some form of overarching state control or involvement — which could avail of essential health care without most people having to rely on a vagarious market, except as a luxury. The National Health Service of the United Kingdom, despite having seen a number of pro-market reforms over the years, remains the single largest health-care provider, employs nearly the entire health-care workforce, and makes essential health care available to all practically free at the point of service.

What this ensures is that the profit-driven private sector, the minor component, caters mainly to the affluent lot as largely a matter of deliberate choice rather than desperate compulsion. The Indian example, much like the United States’s, bespeaks the failure of the idea that a free market will compel players to be more efficient. Rather than increasing efficiency, the players have found it expedient to scrupulously exploit the prevailing cracks in the system and employ devious methods in order to maximise profits.

Two systems

Health-care providers, just like others, are moulded by their social surroundings. When necessary controls are loosened, the connatural vices are let loose; when the habitat is conducive to values, the right traits develop. A system that starts off with health care as an overt tradeable commodity queers the pitch for virtues. Over time, a culture of exploitation and profiteering gets cemented, and the system gets locked in a trajectory that becomes difficult to alter. It is little wonder that in such systems, doctors require hefty incentives to stay motivated. Also, the medical profession attracts more of those with an ambition to earn riches than ones with an aptitude for medical service, thus leading to a generation of doctors who become the apologists of a profiteering system.

On the other hand, a system founded on the concept of equity (which, while remunerating doctors well, is able to separate incomes from patient care decisions by and large) cultivates a totally different culture of patient care. Doctors manufactured under its aegis cherish a spirit of service and hanker less for extravagant incentives. Things such as professional satisfaction and success come to be measured by a different yardstick, and there exists a different kind of motivation towards work, which is then bequeathed to the forthcoming generation.

367,2020/01/20,A net verdict that falls short of expectations,"If one were to merely consider its proclamation of the law, it is difficult to quibble with the ruling of the Supreme Court of India delivered on January 10, on the ongoing communications blockade in the Kashmir Valley. Shorn of its facts, the judgment, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, reads like a majestic charter of liberties. Its interpretation of the fundamental rights governing the freedom of speech, assembly, and movement is well-nigh perfect. The Court has read the limitations on these rights narrowly and has made it clear that any restrictions placed on the Internet, among other things, must meet a test of proportionality.

The reality and scant relief

The judgment certainly drives the basic canon on civil liberties forward. But judicial review, properly understood, entails more than a mere declaration of the law; it involves the application of law to facts. As a recent video report by the online magazine, Quint, shows us, after the resumption of train services between Srinagar and Banihal, on November 17 last year, people from the Kashmir Valley have had to travel no less than 110 km on what has now been dubbed the “Internet Express” to access a few minutes on the web. Performing the most basic tasks, from filing Goods and Services Tax returns and submitting licence applications and scholarship forms to checking examination results, has required many of them to undertake this journey. But even then, given the multitude of people thronging the cyber cafés in Banihal, most have had to shuttle back to their homes disappointed. To them, the Court, in Anuradha Bhasin, offers no meaningful relief.

Opacity in orders

The case itself arose out of the Union government’s decision to dilute Article 370 of the Constitution, through which the State of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) had experienced elements of administrative autonomy. Parallelly, the government imposed a series of restraints on the region. It not only issued orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure inflicting grave restrictions on people’s movement, but it also imposed an indiscriminate shutdown of the Internet by invoking provisions of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 [Suspension Rules]. None of these orders was, however, made public. And many of them, especially the blockade placed on the Internet in the Kashmir Valley, continue unabated, even though more than five months have lapsed since these measures were first imposed.

In its opinion, written by Justice N.V. Ramana, the Supreme Court has unequivocally rejected the suggestions made by the state that it could keep the orders imposing the restrictions secret. The right to freedom of speech and expression, contained in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, the Bench held, implicitly also includes a mandate to a right to information. What is more, invoking Lon L. Fuller’s famous quip — that “there can be no greater legal monstrosity than a secret statute” — the Court concluded that, in a democracy, there exists both a normative and a natural expectation that orders such as these will be made public.

This finding, when viewed in conjunction with the Court’s decision on access to the Internet, offers, in theory, a promising path ahead. The government’s argument that past judgments relating to the infringement of a newspaper’s right to freedom of speech were inapplicable to constraints placed on the use of the Internet were dismissed. No doubt, in doing so, the Court drew a facile distinction between the Internet as a “tool” on the one hand, and the expression of free speech through the means of the Internet on the other. But this, as its other findings shows us, is merely a matter of semantics.

Issue of circumstances

For, in the judges’ belief, the right to freedom of speech and expression includes within its ambit the freedom to disseminate and receive information through any means possible, including through the Internet. Additionally, the Court also recognised that the Internet today is critical to the conduct of commerce. Therefore, any restriction on the web will necessarily impinge on the right under Article 19(1)(g), “to carry on any occupation, trade or business”.

Now, none of this means that no restrictions can ever be placed on the Internet. The real question is this: under what circumstances would a limitation made on accessing the web be constitutionally justifiable? In answering this question, the Court restated the law with special brio. It found, as in “Lord Diplock’s aphorism”, that “you must not use a steam hammer to crack a nut, if a nutcracker would do.” Or, in other words, that any restraint made on a fundamental freedom must be necessary and proportionate to the goal that it seeks to achieve.

This notion of a doctrine of proportionality can be traced back to the administrative law of Prussia at the end of the 19th century. There, when the police invoked a power, which allowed it to restrict liberty as was “necessary for the maintenance of public order”, the Prussian Supreme Administrative Court held that it had to examine whether the measures adopted by the police surpassed in its intensity what was considered necessary for fulfilling the intended objective.

Need for scrutiny

In its present form in India, as held in Anuradha Bhasin, the doctrine demands scrutiny at various levels. First, it requires the state to show the Court that the basic aim that the restriction seeks to achieve is legitimate; second, the state must demonstrate that it has chosen the “least restrictive” measure possible to achieve its purported objective; and third the state must establish that there exists a rational nexus between the limitation imposed and its purported aim. Therefore, the basic nub of the test is to confirm that the government in pursuit of a legitimate aim has treated people’s fundamental rights with the greatest care and attention possible.

This crystallising of the requirements of proportionality will undoubtedly be valuable in future cases. But ultimately the dispute in Anuradha Bhasin concerned Kashmir. And, here, while recognising that an interminable blocking of the Internet will violate the law, the Court still does not hold the shutdown illegal. It is unclear, the judgment said, what orders are still in force. Moreover, there remains, it added, an “apprehension of likelihood raised in relation to the possibility of public order situations”. This being the case, the Court relegated the review back to the realm of the executive, by directing a committee constituted under the Suspension Rules to periodically examine the orders blocking access to the Internet.

Following this judgment, the J&K administration has issued a brief three-page order reviewing its ongoing restrictions. But, this order, which retains the existing ban on mobile data in the Kashmir Valley, while ordering the establishment of Internet kiosks to allow people to access “white-listed” government and banking websites, neither shows us why these are the least restrictive measures available nor demonstrates whether any other alternatives were so much as considered by the government.

No doubt, it is possible that fresh petitions might assail these developments. But the government’s new order only compounds our feeling of perplexity at the judgment. The Latin maxim, Ubi Jus Ibi Remedium — that where there is a right there is a remedy — underpins Article 32 of the Constitution, which guarantees a liberty to move the Supreme Court when a fundamental right is violated. Here, the Court found that a ceaseless shutdown of the web would be unconstitutional, but it still failed to issue any directions quashing the blockade.

A belief in the rule of law stems, at least partly, from a juridical culture that holds the state responsible when it trenches on its constitutional limits. In Anuradha Bhasin, howsoever genuine and sonorous those legal principles it upholds might be, the Court’s ultimate conclusion is gravid with meaning: the law demands respect, but just not in this case; at least not just yet.

Moreover, some of their actions may be akin to subverting democratic processes, as seen in Karnataka and Maharashtra. The latest to join the league seems to be the Kerala Governor, who has taken exception to the unanimous resolution passed by the Kerala Assembly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the subsequent case filed by Kerala in the Supreme Court. He has vitiated the atmosphere by airing his views and attacking the Chief Minister on this count. Dignity and decency are lacking in his conduct and he is beginning to sound more like the representative of the ruling party at the Centre than a person holding an august constitutional office.

Different parties ruling at the Centre — and this includes the Congress — have misused the Office of Governor in the past, especially to further their political interests. Governors have outlived their utility and have turned into a threat to the spirit of federalism.

We are hosting the meeting in a college hall to accommodate more readers this time.

An agitated reader, Naresh Raghava, wrote: “I always trust the genuineness of The Hindu.

For this story too, the decision to close the comments section on the fourth day was deadline-driven, and not due to external pressure.

While the report attributed the findings to IIT-M, it did not say that it was sourced through IIT-M. In journalistic investigations, reporters source a study or a survey through various channels. That does not negate the veracity of the study. The same study was first mentioned by the Commissioner of Municipal Administration, Vijay Kumar IAS, when he read out the Boston Consulting Group report on the development of Amaravati on January 1. Our reporters checked this document before filing the report.

After many rounds of meetings with senior officials in the State government, the reporting team got access to some internal documents, including the PowerPoint presentation by IIT-M. Further, the statements by the Ministers for Municipal Administration and Agriculture clearly indicate the existence of the IIT-M report. The Agriculture Minister K. Kanna Babu said there was a clear communication from an IIT-M professor to the chief engineer of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) on floods. This was reported in The Hindu on January 18.

I would also like to share a YouTube link where the Agriculture Minister mentions that the Structural Engineering division of IIT-M communicated with the CRDA through email: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-srapVZdVjE. The reference to IIT-M can be heard between 59:00 and 59:50.

No refutation

Crucially, no one from IIT-M has written to this newspaper to refute the story or deny their study of Amaravati. We cannot take masked screenshots as conclusive evidence of a denial. An institution with IIT-M’s repute would have challenged the story directly if it had nothing to do with the proposed capital city for Andhra Pradesh. It is possible that there may have been more than one body that was commissioned to study the viability of the new capital city. We now know that some aspects were studied by the Boston Consulting Group and some by IIT-M, and it is for the government of Andhra Pradesh to clarify who studied what aspect. According to our reporting team in Andhra Pradesh, most of these documents will become public once the Assembly session begins. This will put a lid on some of the wild speculations that have been dominating social media over the last week.

373,2020/01/20,A passion for baking led Nitash Lalkaka to set up his eponymous patisserie,"Take a stroll down quiet Hutchins Road and you may find yourself arrested by the aroma of freshly baked goods wafting out into the street. There is no board announcing the existence of Patisserie Nitash, but founder Nitash Lalkaka (42) says everyone in the neighbourhood knows where it is (borne out by the kindly security guard down the road who points out the place).

Located on the ground floor (there are apartments above), the patisserie does not have a retail outlet. Instead, Nitash and his team of three, bake cakes on order from a menu that ranges from black forest cake, pear and chocolate gateaux, rich chocolate ganache, baked New York cheesecake with fruit toppings to the most recent offering — a saffron, pistachio and rose cake. “The most popular is the salted caramel chocolate cake. We have many options but people ultimately come back to chocolate,” he says. Once or twice a week, the patisserie also makes breads such as buckwheat ragi sourdough, honey whole wheat and even gluten-free options.

So how did it all begin for the Kolkata native? “Baking was always my passion. As a child of 12 or 13, I would not play outside even when I had spare time. Instead, I would look up recipes and try out new things. And not simple sponge cakes. The first black forest cake I made was so hard, it could not even be cut. I remember my father saying ‘It is so hard, we need a hammer to break this’,” laughs Nitash. “But as I kept baking, I got better and better and then decided to make it a career.”

While his parents initially thought it was just a hobby, it became apparent that that was not the case. After completing his BCom, Nitash insisted this was the career he wanted. He then studied at the New England Culinary Institute in the US, specialising in baking and confectionery towards the end of the programme. When his parents settled in Bengaluru after retirement, it seemed but natural to set up a place here.

So in 2004, Patisserie Nitash was born. “It was very small; I used to do it from my house. Taking one order at a time and then built it up like that. Even now, it is all through word-of-mouth. I have no way of advertising.” His wife, Navaz, is the one who takes care of social media updates.

He adds that even now people ask him about expanding and opening a retail outlet. “My expertise is in the kitchen. I don’t know how to do it frankly.” Shaking his head, he adds, “It won’t work. The minute you are bogged down by a huge rent to pay, you start cutting corners and trying to reduce costs and the quality of ingredients.”

This means that right now whoever wants to order cakes or breads has to get on the WhatsApp groups. At present, there are 400 people on it and orders come from different parts of the city. The patisserie also takes corporate orders.

While cakes are priced between ₹1,200 and ₹1,800 for 1 kilogram, breads start at ₹120.

374,2020/01/20,Delhi vs Kolkata: The city with the better Mughlai food,"Food feuds — like family vendettas — carry on. An enduring one is the war between food lovers of Delhi and Kolkata. 'Where is the Mughlai — as Muslim food is called — better?' I am often asked. With some regret I must say that it is Kolkata. Delhi has a few old and iconic restaurants that offer everything from biryani and korma to kababs and ishtus, no doubt, but Kolkata has many more eateries where you get the best of dishes. I still dream of the chaap that I ate at Royal, a bustling restaurant in the heart of the city. There are also a host of small and big restaurants which serve the most delicious Kolkata biryani that you can ever imagine.

Last week I was in Kolkata for a food sojourn with my friends. One of the first places they took me to was a new restaurant called Elahi in the Park Circus area (85, Fazlul Haque Sarani). It is quite a nicely done up restaurant with bright lights and comfortable chairs. We — a group of six — occupied our corner, and with the help of the young owner — partner, Asif Iqbal, decided on the order. Soon, our table was groaning with dishes — burrah kabab, galouti with parathas, mutton nihari with kulchey, keema-gurda and saag dal.

I must start with what I enjoyed the most: the nihari and kulcha. I love nihari, and it’s a dish that doesn’t always work out well. The consistency of the gravy is what makes or breaks the nihari. The gravy should be neither too thick, nor too runny. Elahi’s gravy is thinner than the ones you get in Delhi, but it was superb. It was deliciously light, but had soaked in the flavours of the spices without being overwhelmed by any. The meat on the shanks was delightfully tender, and literally fell off the bones. The soft, somewhat spongy kulchas went well with the nihari, and I would have been happy to have called it a day with the nihari-kulcha.

But then the galoutis were very good, too, and I enjoyed wrapping them in a quarter piece of the ultey-tawey ke parathey. The meat had been ground and spiced well, and the end result was this tasty kabab that was soft within and well-browned on the surface. Surprisingly, it wasn’t oily.

I had nothing to do with the dal-saag that someone with a blinding halo had ordered. But I must admit I tried it out and rather liked it. The burrah was a bit of a disappointment. I think the Delhi burrah beats the Kolkata one. The meat in this one was a bit too tender, and it didn’t have the over-grilled, somewhat charred edges that a good burrah demands. The keema-gurda would have been nice but for the fact that it was a bit too salty.

Our dessert — the Shahi Tukda – was a good way to end the meal, though again I must say I prefer the Dilli version, where the bread is crisp. Elahi — which means elaborate or ornate — was a good way to start the Kolkata sojourn. And to keep the Kolkata-Delhi food battle alive.

375,2020/01/20,Mumbai Marathon: 70-year-old stays on course despite injuring himself,"The sheer will and determination of a 70-year-old proved that injuries are just an excuse to withdraw oneself from a marathon.

Rahul Prasad Sharma, who ran into an iron board at the 8-km mark while participating in the senior citizen category, sustained serious injures on his hands and legs. “I could feel a little pain and could also see the blood trickling from the wounds. But, I decided to touch the finish line first and only then go for the treatment,” Mr. Sharma said.

A Jaipur resident, Mr. Sharma completed the 21-km run in one hour and 45 minutes. “My goal was to finish 15 minutes earlier but I somehow exceeded the time. However, I am very happy I completed the half-marathon,” he said.

Mr. Sharma, who came to Mumbai specially for the marathon has been taking part in the sport in various parts of the country since 2015. “I did not wanted to sit idle after retiring from the Rajasthan government in 2011.”

The septuagenarian emphasised on a regular practise regime that athletes should maintain. “No matter what, I practise for over two hours every day. Practise is the key,” he said, adding that post retirement he kept thinking of how to put his time to use instead of sitting idle at home.

“That’s when the thought of running in marathons came to me. I started by taking part in the Jaipur marathon,” Mr. Sharma, whose next stop is the Imphal marathon next month, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qxwdzp/article30603141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20BMRahul-Sharma,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/70-year-old-stays-on-course-despite-injuring-himself/article30603142.ece

Out of action for a year because of a cartilage injury, Ms. Athare said the feeling of returning to field could not be expressed in words. “I was very upset when doctors told me that I would never be able to run a marathon,” she said.

Ms. Athare, who hails from Nashik, clocked one hour and 18 minutes for the 21-km run. “Though this is not my best, I am glad I won. My best is one hour and 15 minutes,” Ms. Athare said.

Her participation in the marathon was a result of strong will power and a commitment to athletics, which got her back on the field. “This is the sixth time I am participating in the Mumbai Marathon. I have won it five times in past,” Ms. Athare, whose overall rank in the half-marathon was 22, said, beaming.

377,2020/01/20,Robot greets participants at Churchgate,"Around 100 people gathered at a cheering zone near Churchgate station as the members of Salaam Bombay Foundation unveiled Armaan, a mascot of the Tata Mumbai Marathon. The robot was created by underprivileged children from the NGO.

According to a member from the NGO, Armaan was the first robot ever be a part of the Mumbai Marathon in any capacity. “A crew of eight students worked closely with an expert team from IndiaFIRST Robotics, a Pune-based robotics education company, to build a bionic arm that was then fitted onto the robot,” the member said.

A lot of participants stopped mid-way to shake hands with the mascot as its arms moved extremely precisely. “The robot uses motion sensors to make sure that the arm moves just the right amount,” the team member said.

Aditi Parikh, vice president, communications, Salaam Bombay Foundation said, “By teaching our students the basics of robotics, we have managed to open a whole new world of exciting opportunities that they wouldn’t have access to otherwise. None of these students have ever worked on a project like this before.”

‘Display of talent’

Ms. Parikh also said the robot was an example of the talents and skills underprivileged children from government schools can display if provided with appropriate opportunities.

Armaan also held a placard which read, ‘Skilling Young India For A Better Future’.

378,2020/01/20,Three generations run together at Mumbai Marathon,"Three generations of a Bengaluru-based family, led by 79-year-old Rajendra Kumar Jain, came together to participate in the full marathon on Sunday.

Mr. Jain was joined by his son Darshan (51) and grandson Tanmay (22) in the 42-km run which started at 5 a.m. from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. Darshan said they were the first family to have three generations completing the full marathon together.

“We run for fitness and wish to promote fitness for all in the family. Only with a fit body and happy mind will we have a healthier society around,” he said.

Darshan said Mr. Jain had participated in the 10K run 10 times earlier, while he himself had run the half-marathon nine times. “But, this was the first time that my father ran a full marathon in six hours,” he said.

Tirtha Pun, who hails from Nepal, said he was initially unsure of competing in the marathon. “In order to check my capabilities, I started running various marathons across the country,” said Mr. Pun, who had also grabbed a gold medal at the Bengaluru Marathon.

The soldier said he did not participate in the marathon to compete with anyone else, but only with himself. “I wanted to check my development as a runner. It was sheer luck that I won,” Mr. Pun said.

He dedicated his win to his coach M. Shekhar, who motivated him to join the armed forces. “My coach always used to encourage me to outrun myself.

389,2020/01/20,Colonial-era Grand Bazaar in need of facelift,"The century-old Grand Bazaar popularly known as ‘Periya Kadai’, situated in the heart of the town, is in shambles for want of proper attention.

The French set up the market as an ‘open space’ with demarcated zones for vegetables, fruits, essential commodities, pulses, fish and meat.

Over the years, growth in the number of illegal structures and hawkers has left very little space for people to move about.

Damaged pavements, wires dangling dangerously above the shops, inadequate toilet facilities and massive encroachment is taking a toll on the facility.

The existing amenities are grossly inadequate to cater to thousands of people who visit the place every day, traders complain.

Nothing much has improved though repeated representations have been made to the authorities concerned, they lament.

Unhygienic environment

There is no proper illumination or water supply in the market. The clearance of garbage is also erratic and most of the shops have been forced to carry out their business in an unhygienic environment, traders charge.

When it was started, the Grand Bazaar, spread over 11,500 sq. m, had around 600 permanent stalls and equal number of vendors. But now the number of vendors has doubled and they have taken over every available space in the facility including the pathways selling everything from books, shoes and bags.

“It is high time the municipal authorities paid attention to the gaping holes on the footpaths between shops in the market. Priority must be given to repair them at the earliest. Large stock of goods is kept everywhere in the market. There is need to devise a plan to de-congest the market,” said S. Nadarajan, a senior citizen. There was a plan in 1985 to modernise the shopping complex with aid from the Centre but the proposal is now gathering dust.

The Grand Bazaar has nearly nine entrances from Jawaharlal Nehru Street, Mahatma Gandhi Road, Bharathi Street and Rangapillai Street.

Most of the entrances are heavily encroached by hawkers and even two-wheelers pass the stretch with great difficulty. Most of the shops have spread their wares outside the shops and lack of adequate safety measures can cause a major fire at any point of time, traders apprehend.

According to G. Sundarraj, secretary of Grand Bazaar Grocery Shops Owners Association, “We are paying user charges of ₹3,600 per year in addition to various fees levied by the Municipality from time to time. The traders also have to renew trade licence once in three years. But the civic body has not improved the infrastructure and it remains in a bad shape.”

Osmosis plant

Upset over the shortcomings, the Round Table 167 came forward to install a reverse osmosis plant, which meets to some extent the drinking water needs of the traders and the people who visit the market daily

A spokesperson of the Grand Bazaar Market Vendors Association pointed out that officials from the Puducherry Municipality and elected representatives frequently visited the market complex promising to take action as soon as possible.

“All our representations have only fallen on deaf ears. The market has a sanitary complex with 12 toilets each for men and women. They cater to over 4,000 odd vendors and shopkeepers in the market and are insufficient. The market has been devoid of maintenance or improvement measures for a long time now,” he said.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/dr08ds/article30602601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20PONDYBAZAAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/colonial-era-grand-bazaar-in-need-of-facelift/article30602603.ece

392,2020/01/20,Visit of Chief Secretary fails to pacify Governor Arif Mohammad Khan,"A visit by Chief Secretary Tom Jose to Raj Bhavan on Monday appeared to have no moderating effect on the politically charged tug-of-war between Governor Arif Mohammad Khan and the State government.

Hours after the ‘conciliatory’ call by Mr. Jose, Mr. Khan told journalists that the State government’s decision to appeal against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Supreme Court (SC) without informing Raj Bhavan was an “unlawful act, not legally correct and no explanation can satisfy me.”

However, he appeared to leave a window open for rapprochement. “The case can be closed if the unlawful action is withdrawn. I am not asking anything. I am just saying that this, in my opinion, is unlawful. My perception in the matter is not a subject of discussion at this stage,” he said, adding he could not discuss his further course of action. “But one thing I can assure you, I will not allow the Constitutional machinery in the State to collapse,” he said.

The Governor declined to hold forth on whether the Constitutional machinery in Kerala had collapsed or not. However, he said the government “should not use constitutional institutions and authority to violate the letter and spirit of the very document which has given you this authority.”

‘CM duty-bound’

Mr. Khan said the Chief Minister was duty-bound to submit to the Governor the category of cases that affect the relations of the State with the Centre, other States or involved the High Court or the Supreme Court.

Article 166 of the Constitution states the Chief Minister should refer such cases to the Governor before passing an order. “It is mandatory, not advisory,” he said.

The Governor took a dig at CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury who on Sunday questioned the need of the post of Governor in a federal set-up. “Mr. Yechury has not faulted me for my actions. He is only seeking the abolishment of the Governor’s office. Hence, there is nobody to oversee that the rules and Constitution are followed. Such an authority only the people can give them. Mr. Yechury is free to seek their mandate,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ihjhv6/article30610305.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvnearby1-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/visit-of-chief-secretary-fails-to-pacify-governor/article30609858.ece
393,2020/01/20,Vaikom museum opens today,"Nine-and-a-half decades after hosting an epic struggle for social equality, the backwater town of Vaikom in Kottayam is finally set to open a museum that chronicles the important events and personalities associated with the Vaikom Sathyagraha

Kadannapally Ramachandran, Minister for Museums, Archaeology and Archives, will inaugurate the facility on Tuesday. Vaikom MLA C.K. Asha will preside. Thomas Chazhikadan, MP, will deliver the keynote address.

The ₹1.8-crore project is being implemented by the State Archives Department with financial assistance from the Gandhi Heritage Sites Mission under the Union government. The project has been implemented through Kerala Museum, the government-appointed nodal agency for all museums in the State.

“The museum has put on display several hundreds of documents relating to the satyagraha, and also hosts a special gallery to narrate Gandhiji’s role in the historic movement,” said J. Reji Kumar, Director, State Archives Department.

The facility also comprises photo and art galleries, besides a research centre and an interactive theatre room to screen documentaries on the subject.

Some of the key documents on display include the entire script of the three-hour conversation between Gandhiji and Idanthuruthil Devan Neelakandan Namboothiri, leader of the caste Hindu camp, interventions of Sree Narayana Guru, Periyar E.V. Ramasamy, among others.

R. Chandran Pillai, Executive Director, Kerala Museum, termed the project as an attempt to reanalyse the movement that paved the way for social renaissance in Kerala, which has been largely forgotten except for occasional references in texts or speeches on history.

“The attempt is to retell the story through archival records, illustrations, texts and interactive panels and kiosks so as to ensure the involvement of visitors,” he said. The project, coming up at a property near the Vaikom boat jetty, was first proposed in 1975 with a stone-laying ceremony attended by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/b2wcbp/article30612524.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21tvktvaikom1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/vaikom-sathyagraha-museum-set-to-open-soon/article30608253.ece
394,2020/01/20,"Kerala to shun NPR, but will cooperate with Census 2021","The Kerala government on Monday decided to inform the Centre that it was hard-pressed to cooperate with the work related to the drawing up and revision of the National Population Register (NPR). However, Kerala would fully cooperate with the Census 2021.

Earlier, Kerala had joined West Bengal in suspending all work on the NPR.

The special Cabinet meet, which convened here, concluded the people were deeply concerned that the NPR, a biometric roster of citizens, was a precursor to the proposed National Register of Indian Citizens (NRIC).

The highly controversial NRIC was purportedly an extension of the NPR. The NRIC envisaged a taluk registrar of citizen registration to oversee the preparation of the list of “Indian citizens” at the sub-district level to exclude people of “doubtful citizenship” from the safety and welfare net of the State.

‘Deep insecurity’

The Cabinet said that any move to implement the NPR against the looming backdrop of the NRIC would cause deep insecurity in Kerala and adversely affect the law and order situation.

The State government was constitutionally bound to allay the fears of the population and uphold public peace. Hence, the State was constrained to inform the Registrar General and Census Commission, Union Ministry of Home Affairs, that it could not cooperate with the preparation of the NPR.

The government said District Collectors had reported that any move to link the Census process with the NPR would trigger public law and order issues.

The Cabinet’s decision is consistent with the political position of the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the NPR were the head and tail of the same coin and patently anti-Muslim.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) had also expressed apprehension that the CAA and the NPR and the NRIC when applied back to back, could relegate lakhs of Muslims, including naturalised refugees and migrants from neighbouring countries, to the status of illegal aliens and deprive them the safety net of the State.

The Cabinet decision came against the backdrop of growing protests against the CAA and the population register.

The State had also appealed the citizenship law in the Supreme Court on the ground that it discriminated against Muslims seeking citizenship status in India and hence ran against the grain of the secular foundation of the Constitution.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/y3bkta/article30606316.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH20KERALAASSEMBLY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/kerala-to-shun-npr-but-will-cooperate-with-census-2021/article30606317.ece

396,2020/01/20,From cubicles to the cricket pitch,"The weekends are supposed to be quiet and calm inside the Technopark campus.

But staccato clapping and loud cheering breaks the serene atmosphere. A cricket match is in progress in the ground on the campus and is being played with all exuberance and energy.

For the past 17 years, the Technopark Super League (TSL) has kept the techies away from cubicles during the weekends at this time of the year. Over the years, the tournament has grown in stature and has become highly competitive.

From a modest 14-team knock-out tournament — when it was first conceived to break the monotony of work and build harmony — it has now become a mega tournament involving 147 teams and takes almost five months to finish.

“Every year, the number of participating teams has seen a steady increase. But this year saw the highest ever participation with 147 teams,” said Pramod of Murugan Cricket Club that conducts the tournament. Almost all major companies like Infosys, TCS, UST Global, Allianz, SunTech and RRD take part in the tournament.

Some IT majors have former State players on their rolls and it is the presence of these cricketers that makes the games competitive.

On turf wicket

The matches are played on turf wicket with tennis ball.

The duration of a match is eight overs. Nearly seven to eight matches are held in a day. This year’s tournament will be held in three phases.

The first phase involves 81 teams who are selected based on their performance in the previous year. Eight teams will qualify for the second phase that will be played among 48 teams.

The final phase or champions round will involve 32 teams based on previous year’s standing and the 16 teams who will qualify from second phase. The champions round will be a league-cum-knock out affair. Allianz White is the defending champion and UST Global the runner-up.

397,2020/01/20,Pinarayi to launch ‘Nammal Namukkayi’,"A unique initiative that aims to make disaster management at the local level more inclusive and citizen-centric will be launched here on Tuesday.

Envisaged by the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA), ‘Nammal Namukkayi’ offers Keralites opportunities to voice their opinion on key aspects of disaster management.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will launch the initiative at the Girideepam Convention Centre.

Comments and suggestions for making the State more resilient to disaster can be posted on pcp.rebuild.kerala.gov.in.

“It’s an attempt to take the disaster management activities to the local level and ensure public participation in the evolution of disaster management plans,” Sekhar L. Kuriakose, member secretary, KSDMA, said.

Key areas

KSDMA has identified five key areas that need immediate attention on which comments can be posted — land management, water management, local community and resilience, forest management, transport, communications, and technology.

Individuals and organisations/groups can register online by providing their mobile number and entering the OTP messaged to the registered number.

Once logged in, they can upload their inputs and suggestions pertaining to any of the themes. Experts on any of the required fields have been requested to upload their biodata as well.

Based on the inputs, a thematic committee will develop papers that will be presented in an international seminar.

A final policy roadmap will be prepared for each of the thematic areas.

For preparing ward-level disaster management plans, special grama sabhas will be convened in February.

As a prelude, training is being provided to 2.4 lakh people, including elected representatives and officers are being trained.

Development seminars will be held at the panchayat level to the programme. ‘Nammal Namukkayi’ will extend from special grama sabhas to a special Assembly session, according to the KSDMA.

398,2020/01/20,Centre’s divisive plans backfire: Sitaram Yechury,"CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has accused the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government of sponsoring violence after having purportedly failed to polarise the country by introducing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

The Centre’s ploy has, however, unified various cross sections to spark protests to a scale that has never been witnessed in the country since Independence.

Addressing a massive public gathering here on Sunday to mark the culmination of the party’s three-day central committee meeting, Mr. Yechury alleged that the CAA was enacted through brute force by violating parliamentary norms in order to attain its prime objective of deepening the Hindu-Muslim divide.

“Much to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s surprise, the country has witnessed huge demonstrations against the law with people of various communities pledging support towards the cause. The Centre has crossed swords with those who refuse to believe that we can become a homogeneous society and strived to preserve the richness of our diversity,” he said.

He also accused the BJP-ruled States including Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam of unleashing violence upon people and looting their properties. While 28 people have been killed in these States, the BJP also deployed the police to torture the agitating students of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia, and Aligarh Muslim University.

The CPI(M) leader said the Supreme Court delivered its verdict, but not justice, in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute. The apex court played into the hands of Hindutva forces by viewing the Ayodhya dispute as one between two faiths and not two groups, Mr. Yechury said.

Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan reiterated that the State would neither implement the CAA nor facilitate enumeration for the National Population Register (NPR) that would become a prelude for the preparation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Firm in stance

“While canards are being spread by various quarters with vested interests, the government has stayed all such activities in the State. We remain firm in our stance. The government stands by its people and the State will remain a secure fort while the country passed by difficult times,” he said.

He also urged the Congress-led Opposition to put aside their differences to join hands with the government to put up a united front against the Centre’s attempts to divide the country on religious lines.

Since the injury in the stomach was of a serious nature, he was rushed to the Government Medical College Hospital in Thanjavur. But Bojiran succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.

Bojiran had accompanied his friend, who had brought his bull for the event.

The launch coincides with a nation-wide polio vaccination drive.

According to official reports, more than 1.50 lakh health personnel and volunteers have been deployed to administer the polio drops at 37,493 booths across the State.

Deputy Chief Minister and Medical and Health Minister Alla Nani and a group of officials were present at the inaugural programme.

The Department of Women and Child Welfare made elaborate arrangements to ensure that all children under the age of five years are administered polio drops across the State. Polio centres were set up in schools, colleges, primary health centres and community health centres.

In Krishna district, 4,07,322 children were administered the polio drops.

402,2020/01/20,‘New class of vehicle’ rules city roads as authorities turn blind eye,"The 31st National Road Safety week being observed across the State aims at ensuring compliance and enforcement of the road safety rules for bringing down the number of road accidents and casualties.

When it comes to compliance many road users violate the rules by not wearing helmets, seat belts and driving within the speed limit even as the law enforcement agencies act at various levels to make them comply with the rules.

However, a new class of vehicle has bypassed all the rules and laws so much that it has become all-pervasive on the city roads without complying with the Motor Vehicle Act while the Police and Transport Departments turned a blind eye.

The ‘motorised rickshaw’ ingeniously fixed with petrol engines of worn-out or seized two-wheelers at private workshops are being largely used for commercial purposes of transporting goods in the city.

Plastic fuel tanks

Right from manufacturing to plying on roads the vehicles violate rules on several counts. According to a ‘rickshaw-puller’ who was using one such vehicle, the engines of 100 CC and above capacity are sourced from worn-out scooters available with mechanics, stolen two-wheelers and even the ones scrapped due to litigation.

Plastic cans are used as fuel tanks for these rickshaws which can travel at a speed of not less than 50 kmph.

The increase in the number of these motorised rickshaws has become a cause of concern for road users because of their unauthorised engines that pose a danger. This comes at a time when the vehicle manufacturers are moving towards the latest Bharat Stage-VI emission standards.

Ironically, fuel stations which have been denying petrol in bottles post-Disha incident in Hyderabad continue to refill the plastic ‘fuel cans’ of these rickshaws.

When contacted, Deputy Transport Commissioner S. Venkateswara Rao said, “Any kind of modification to any vehicle is a violation under the Motor Vehicle Act. Using these modified vehicle parts on rickshaws to transport passengers and goods is another violation.”

Special drive

“We will soon conduct a special drive to identify such motorised rickshaws and seize them,” Mr. Rao said.

Meanwhile, owners of commercial transport vehicles are also worried about the increasing number of the unauthorised rickshaws as they eat into their business and ply without paying any kind of tax. Comparatively, these rickshaws cost a fraction of what a commercial transport three-wheeler or four-wheeler would cost.",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/x6maun/article30603156.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VJCITYPAGE2FUEL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/new-class-of-vehicle-rules-city-roads-as-authorities-turn-blind-eye/article30603157.ece

404,2020/01/20,Let Amaravati continue as capital: TDP leaders,"Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders staged a protest in the city on Sunday, demanding that Amaravati should continue as the State Capital.

The protesters raised slogans against the YSR Congress Party government and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy over the three capitals proposal.

Addressing the protesters, TDP leader Sanapala Panduranga Rao recalled Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s speech accepting Amaravati as the capital during the Assembly sessions that were held in 2014.

Mr. Panduranga Rao condemned the proposal to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital of the State.

‘75% buildings ready’

He claimed that about 75% of the government buildings, including that of the Assembly, Secretariat, DGP’s office, and other government offices at Amaravati were completed during the TDP’s tenure.

“A huge chunk of money has been spent on building the capital at Amaravati. It is strange that the YSRCP government is planning to shift the capital from Amaravati at this juncture. The government must allow to continue the capital at Amaravati,” said Mr. Panduranga Rao.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/jo15j/article30605005.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VZ2TDPLEADERSANAPALAPANDURANGARAODEMANDINGTOCONTINUEAMARAVA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/let-amaravati-continue-as-capital-tdp-leaders/article30605006.ece
405,2020/01/20,Experts throw light on knee replacement techniques in Visakhapatnam,"A symposium on robotic knee replacement conducted at Q1 Hospitals was inaugurated by Dr. NTR University of Health Sciences Vice-Chancellor P. Shyam Prasad on Sunday.

Around 150 orthopaedic surgeons from across the country attended the conference. The symposium was designed for orthopaedic surgeons to update their knowledge and skills with the evolution of technology to enhance the surgical recovery in various orthopaedic procedures through live demonstrations.

Customised planning

T. Ramana Murthy, chairman and chief joint replacement surgeon at Q1 Hospitals explained that the idea behind establishing robotic technology at the hospital was to ensure customised planning, precision and consistent service to arthritis patients seeking joint replacements.

He said that one of the most difficult aspects of joint replacement surgery was placing the individual components of the artificial joint in the best possible alignment so that they would mesh together and work smoothly.

“The robotic arm provides tactile, visual and auditory feedback to help surgeons achieve the desired orientation during the procedures,” he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/38anzp/article30604982.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VZ2SYMPOSIUMONROBOTICKNEEREPLACEMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/experts-throw-light-on-knee-replacement-techniques-in-visakhapatnam/article30604983.ece
406,2020/01/20,Boat service for tourists resumes in Visakhapatnam,"Boating facilities being run by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) in the city, which were suspended after the boat tragedy reported from Devipatnam mandal of East Godavari district in September last year, resumed on Sunday.

At present, four boats are being operated at Rushikonda and a few at the Visakhapatnam Fishing Harbour.

Tourism Minister M. Srinivasa Rao re-launched the services at Rushikonda beach.

Fitness test

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said the boating services were suspended after the boat tragedy in the Godavari River as a precautionary measure.

In all, 77 persons from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on board Royal Vasista were proceeding to Papikondalu and the boat capsized after being caught in a whirlpool on September 15 last year. “The government has granted permissions for the facilities after conducting fitness tests. Strict guidelines pertaining to operation of boating services have been issued and the officials must ensure that the operators are following the norms in letter and spirit,” said the Tourism Minister.

After boat tragedy in East Godavari district, the government had ordered fitness tests for all the boating facilities. Many boat drivers also underwent certification courses.

‘Safety gear must’

“Life jackets and other safety gears are must for the tourists while taking boat rides. The operators must not allow people in inebriated condition to take boat rides,” said Mr. Srinivasa Rao. Later, the Minister, along with Visakhapatnam MP M.V.V. Satyanarayana took a boat ride. Officials of APTDC were present on the occasion.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/mcdpau/article30602785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20VZ3TOURISMBOAT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/boat-service-for-tourists-resumes-in-visakhapatnam/article30602786.ece
407,2020/01/20,Can the city police handle the ‘Executive’ challenge?,"A big challenge awaits the city police should Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s proposal to make Visakhapatnam the Executive capital materialise.

All major offices, including the Chief Minister’s camp office, the Secretariat and the DGP office, will be moved to the city, which means an increase in VVIP movement.

Providing security to MLAs, Ministers and other major officials and the leaders will become a major task and this, according to some senior police officers, will have an impact on regular policing.

Whenever there is VVIP movement, the entire machinery is used for bandobust duty, which includes route mapping, sanitising the route and using road-opening parties, apart from providing security to high-value targets and securing the venues.

Since the DGP’s office will be moved, it goes without saying that the police headquarters will be located here and it will bring in more force, both in terms to manpower and infrastructure. But the question is will it be sufficient and will the depleted local force be able to handle day-to-day policing.

The city has a population of close to 25 lakh, and it is bound to increase by a few lakhs if the proposal materialises.

The present police force stands at a little over 4,000, including personnel drawn from the Armed Reserve battalion and home guards. The police-to-population ratio is around one policeman for every 750 citizens, which is quite low when compared to the national prescribed strength of one policeman for every 560 citizens. As such, there is a shortage of about 1,500 men and officers.

""If the police headquarters is moved here, we will have some manpower, especially the ISW and CSW for VVIP security cover. More dog squads and Bomb Disposal Squads will also be moved in. Whether it will be sufficient remains to be seen,"" said an ACP rank officer. Moving manpower is not the only solution, as the workload will also increase manifold.

Surveillance

Surveillance plays a major role as every nook and corner needs to be checked. Teams have to be deployed to check every lodge, hotel resorts and rented houses.

The city already has some electronic surveillance in place, such as the hotel and lodge monitoring system and CCTV cover.

Under the system, online registration at all hotels and lodges are linked to the real-time monitoring at the City Police Command and Control Centre.

""Every time a person checks into a hotel, he has to furnish details such as Aadhaar or PAN. Photographs and details are checked instantly through the facial recognition system in CCTNS (Crime and Criminal Tracking Network System). And we are now on a drive to link every lodge and hotel, small or big,"" said DCP Ranga Reddy.

There are an estimated 15,000 CCTV cameras in the city and efforts are on to increase the number to 25,000. ""Our goal is to link every camera to the CCC, be it the ones installed by GVMC, police or any other government agency or for that matter the ones installed by banks, private offices and citizens,"" said DCP (Zone-II) Uday Bhaskar

Maoist threat

Though the Maoist threat has now been limited to interior parts of Visakha Agency, a minor blast in some corner of the city can trigger a security emergency, said a senior police officer.

Last year, the police arrested Aathmakuru Anusha (24) and her two sisters Annapoorna (33) and Bhavani (38), who are alleged to be members of Chaitanya Mahila Sangam and Amara Veerula Bandhu Mitrula Committee, front organisations of the CPI(Maoist).

According to the police, they were trying to establish a Maoist sleeper cell right in the heart of the city.

Handling traffic, which is bound to increase due to VVIP movement, is going to be another major issue.

There are issues concerning faulty road engineering, faulty signals, lack of over and underbridges at critical junctions and lack of flyovers, said an ACP-rank officer in the Traffic Department.

The manpower in the traffic department is around 500 and there is a need for about 300 more. If the Executive capital becomes a reality, then it is going to be chaos, if certain things are not addressed immediately, he said.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/j2jte9/article30602489.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/213288293col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/can-the-city-police-handle-the-executive-challenge/article30602490.ece

“During our meeting with the BJP, we were asked to reconsider our stand on CAA but we declined to do so. Shiromani Akali Dal is of the firm stand that Muslims cannot be left out of CAA,” said Mr. Sirsa.

409,2020/01/20,CM launches ‘Guarantee Card’,"The Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday launched “Kejriwal Ka Guarantee Card”, a 10-point shorter version of the election manifesto of the party ahead of the State Assembly polls, scheduled on February 8.

“This is not a manifesto. It is much more than that. This guarantee card and the 10 promises listed in it will touch the lives of all the people of Delhi. A detailed manifesto will be released in the coming 7-10 days,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

The “Guarantee Card” promises to make Delhi “pollution-free” and has fixed an aim to reduce the pollution by three times and also plant two crore trees across the city. It has promised to introduce “mohalla marshals” for women’s safety.

It promises to launch 11,000 new buses and increase Metro train lines to over 500 km.

Existing services

Mr. Kejriwal said existing services and subsidies in these sectors will continue for the next five years. “Opposition parties are spreading rumours that these services will be terminated by March 2020 after the elections. This is a lie. The manifesto will have a detailed set of promises addressing the issues of specific groups like advocates, teachers, students, and workers, etc separately. Those promises also will be implemented effectively in the coming five years as we fulfilled our 70 promises made five years ago,” he added.

The other major points of the card include best education in the whole country, cheap, accessible and better healthcare, clean and beautiful Delhi, and basic infrastructure in unauthorised colonies. It also promises pukka houses for all slum dwellers in the same area, largest and cheap transportation, and piped water in every house.

“Children born in Delhi will get quality education till graduation. We have stopped the arbitrary fee hike in private schools and will continue to facilitate the students with loans for graduation courses. We will build new schools wherever required. We will create a world-class education system for every child here. This, I take as our government’s responsibility,” he said. He said party leaders and workers will be visiting 35 lakh households to give them a list of key promises. The party said the Chief Minister will hold town hall meetings and public interactions, which will focus on the “Guarantee Card” between January 23 and 30.

Why a shorter version?

Ahead of the 2015 Assembly election, AAP had come out with a 70-point manifesto with Delhi Janlokpal Bill, Swaraj Bill, Full Statehood for Delhi, electricity bills to be reduced by half, and CAG audit of power discoms, as the top five promises.

The manifesto was 12-pages long.

“We have released a concise list of promises first as this is something to which people can connect easily and also our candidates can start campaigning with it,” a party leader said.

The manifesto to be released after January 26 will have finer details of the “Guarantee Card” and more new promises but it would not be distributed to every household, said party leaders.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/u7reuo/article30602608.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE19CMCARD,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/cm-launches-guarantee-card/article30602609.ece
410,2020/01/20,"Biography to explore personal, unheard episodes of V.P. Menon’s life","A new book on the life and times of V.P. Menon, the man who brought about a definitive plan for a unified India after independence, will hit the stands by January-end, announced publishing house Simon & Schuster.

Written by historian and Menon’s great-granddaughter Narayani Basu, the book titled V.P. Menon: The unsung architect of modern India will spill little-known facts about the political advisor of the last Viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten.

The book will explore the man behind the public figure through his unconventional personal life and his private conflicts, which “made him channel his energy into public service.”

“Drawing from documents — scattered, unread and unresearched until now — and with unprecedented access to Menon’s papers and his taped off-the-record, explosively frank interviews, this remarkable biography of V.P. Menon not only covers the life and times of a man unjustly consigned to the footnotes of history but also changes our perception of how India, as we know it, came into being,” the publisher said in a statement.

Menon is widely known for his contribution to devise an “alternative, coherent and workable plan for independence” as he and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister of India, ensured the merger of princely states with India.

“She (Basu) takes us through the highs and lows of his career, from his determination to give women the right to vote; to his strategy, at once ruthless and subtle, to get the princely states to accede to India; to his decision to join forces with the Swatantra Party; to his final relegation to relative obscurity,” they said.",books,https://www.thehindu.com/books/ntmb7u/article30606064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vpmenon,https://www.thehindu.com/books/biography-to-explore-personal-unheard-episodes-of-vp-menons-life/article30606065.ece
411,2020/01/20,UN's decarbonisation target for shipping to cost over $1 trillion - study,"At least $1 trillion of investment in new fuel technology is needed to enable the shipping industry to meet U.N. targets for cuts in carbon emissions by 2050, a study published on Monday showed.

The global shipping fleet, which accounts for 2.2% of the world's CO2 emissions, is under pressure to reduce those emissions and other pollution. About 90% of world trade is transported by sea.

U.N. shipping agency, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), aims to reduce the industry's greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050, a target that will require the swift development of zero or low emission fuels and new ship designs using cleaner technology.

In the first study into costs, researchers estimated that the cumulative investment needed between 2030 and 2050 would be between $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion, or an average of $50 billion to $70 billion annually for 20 years.

If the shipping industry was to fully decarbonise by 2050, this would require further investment of some $400 billion over 20 years, bringing the total to $1.4 trillion to $1.9 trillion.

“Our analysis suggests we will see a disruptive and rapid change to align to a new zero carbon system, with fossil fuel aligned assets becoming obsolete or needing significant modification,” said Tristan Smith, reader at University College London's (UCL) Energy Institute, which was involved in the study.

Apart from more than a decade of tough market conditions, the shipping industry is also contending with the exit of many European banks from providing finance, leaving a capital shortfall of tens of billions of dollars annually.

Around 87% of investments needed would be in land-based infrastructure and production facilities for low-carbon fuels, the study said. This includes investments in the production of low-carbon fuels as well as the land-based storage and bunkering infrastructure needed for their supply.

The remaining 13% of investments are related to the ships themselves including the machinery and onboard storage required for a ship to run on low-carbon fuel.

“Sustainable investing is here to stay,” said Michael Parker, chairman of Global Shipping Logistics & Offshore at Citigroup.

The estimates were based on ammonia being the primary zero carbon fuel choice.

The study was carried out by UMAS which includes UCL and the Energy Transitions Commission, a panel of global experts. It was conducted on behalf of the non-profit Getting to Zero Coalition, which includes the Global Maritime Forum and World Economic Forum, which is meeting in Davos this week.",sci-tech,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/8h8rwt/article30605203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/20THSHIPPINGCONTAINERS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/uns-decarbonisation-target-for-shipping-to-cost-over-1-trillion-study/article30605204.ece
412,2020/01/20,Australia’s iconic platypus under threat from climate change: study,"Australia’s devastating drought, and other effects of climate change are pushing the iconic duck-billed platypus, a globally unique mammal, towards extinction, a study published on January 20 warned.

Platypuses were once considered widespread across the eastern Australian mainland and Tasmania, although not a lot is known about their distribution or abundance because of the species’ secretive and nocturnal nature, according to the researchers from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia.

Researchers, who for the first time examined the risks of extinction for this intriguing animal, call for action to minimise the risk of the platypus vanishing due to habitat destruction, dams and weirs.

The study, published in the journal Biological Conservation, examined the potentially devastating combination of threats to platypus populations, including water resource development, land clearing, climate change and increasingly severe periods of drought.

Lead author Gilad Bino, a researcher at the UNSW Centre for Ecosystem Science, said action must be taken now to prevent the platypus from disappearing from our waterways.

“There is an urgent need for a national risk assessment for the platypus to assess its conservation status, evaluate risks and impacts, and prioritise management in order to minimise any risk of extinction,” Bino said.

The platypus is the sole living representative of its family, and genus, though a number of related species appear in the fossil record.

It is one of the five extant species of monotremes, the only mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.

The study estimated that under current climate conditions and due to land clearing and fragmentation by dams, platypus numbers almost halved.

This led to the extinction of local populations across about 40% of the species’ range, reflecting ongoing declines since European colonisation, the researchers said.

Under predicted climate change, the losses forecast were far greater because of increases in extreme drought frequencies and duration, such as the current dry spell.

“These dangers further expose the platypus to even worse local extinctions with no capacity to repopulate areas,” Bino added.

Documented declines and local extinctions of the platypus show a species facing considerable risks, while the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) recently downgraded the platypus’ conservation status to “Near Threatened,” the researchers said.

However, the platypus remains unlisted in most jurisdictions in Australia — except South Australia — where it is endangered.

Study co-author professor Richard Kingsford said it was unfortunate that platypuses lived in areas undergoing extensive human development that threatened their lives and long-term viability.

“These include dams that stop their movements, agriculture which can destroy their burrows, fishing gear and yabby traps which can drown them and invasive foxes which can kill them,” Kingsford said.

Study co-author professor Brendan Wintle at The University of Melbourne said it was important that preventative measures were taken now.

“Even for a presumed ‘safe’ species such as the platypus, mitigating or even stopping threats, such as new dams, is likely to be more effective than waiting for the risk of extinction to increase and possible failure,” Wintle said.

“We should learn from the peril facing the koala to understand what happens when we ignore the warning signs,” he said.

Bino said the research paper added to the increasing body of evidence which showed that the platypus, like many other native Australian species, was on the path of extinction.

“There is urgent need to implement national conservation efforts for this unique mammal and other species by increasing monitoring, tracking trends, mitigating threats, and protecting and improving management of freshwater habitats,” Bino said.",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/dt9cvn/article30607240.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Jan20Platypus,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/australias-iconic-platypus-under-threat-from-climate-change-study/article30607241.ece
413,2020/01/20,Why 2019 was a good year for butterflies in Tamil Nadu,"Hundreds of Painted Ladies were spotted moving swiftly along the Western Ghats. Ramanasaran Hari, a member of the Tamil Nadu Butterfly Society (TNBS), describes it as “a streak of reds, deep oranges and blacks”. Calling it an “unforgettable sight,” Ramanasaran, who recorded the migration of these butterflies, said, “This is significant because they have been spotted here for the first time in many years.” The butterflies present themselves in a kaleidoscope of colours — red, orange and black while they fly and yellow, green and brown when at rest, explains Ramanasaran.

While there are no records of these migrations in India, their travels from North and Central America to Mexico and then again from North Africa to Europe are well documented. The butterflies have been travelling 15,000 km between Africa and Europe for many generations.

They came into Tamil Nadu from Gujarat and Punjab and a WhatsApp group on butterfly migration by Kalesh Sivadasan of Travancore Natural History Society helped enthusiasts track them. “Many of our members saw them in good numbers in Madurai, Chennai and Coimbatore,” says A Pavendhan of TNBS. “We have been documenting butterfly migration for the last 10 years. This is the first time we are seeing the Painted Lady migration.”

Last year has been a good one for butterflies. “In Tamil Nadu, we saw the mass movement of butterfly species such as the Crows and Tigers from the Eastern Ghats to the Western Ghats from September to October. And a reverse migration in April and May. This can be correlated to the good monsoons. The emigrant butterflies like the Albatross and Lime kept their date with migration in October. When there is no disturbance to naturally occurring events, it indicates that the associated environment is good,” explains Pavendhan

A number of integrated bird and butterfly surveys in the Coimbatore Forest Division and Satyamangalam Tiger Reserve put the spotlight on butterflies. For example, the Sinhalese Five Ring butterfly was spotted and recorded for the first time in Coimbatore. Says Pavendhan, “In Satyamangalam forests, we recorded a well established population of the butterfly, which is good news for conservation. The rarely spotted Nilgiris Tit, a species traditionally seen only in the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, was spotted at Satyamangalam in the Eastern Ghats. All these point to an urgent need to map butterflies in the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats.”

Butterfly enthusiasts reiterate how a healthy population of butterflies indicates a healthy eco-system. “Birds and butterflies are significant ecological indicators. We did a number of integrated studies with the forest department. It is noteworthy that, in 2019, Tamil Yeoman was declared as the State butterfly.”

Other rare butterflies that fluttered by Tamil Nadu include the Transparent Pierrot (first photographed record for South India), Common Onyx (first time in the Eastern Ghats) and the Black-spotted Pierrot (previously spotted only at two or three places in Tamil Nadu). Elavarasan M recorded them at Yercaud Foothills in Salem. He says, “I also observed the migration of emigrants for the first time. To watch those colourful waves is an experience to remember.”

R. Gopalakrishnan from Tirupur, who has been recording butterfly migration for five years, describes it as a beautiful sight. “Especially, when you know the background of the phenomenon. Why do they move? Are they taking the right path? How do these tiny little creatures form a group ? It is fascinating.”

Some places in Tamil Nadu also emerged as a butterfly hotspots — for example, Kallar at Mettupalayam in Tamil Nadu that falls on the migration route . “We documented 200 species of butterflies, including the rarely spotted Scarse Shot Silverline, over a period of five years (2014 to 2019),” says Theivaprakasham Hari, who has recently launched a web app, Butterfly Vision, that helps you identify over 300 butterflies of the Western Ghats. The Milkweed butterflies, namely Dark Blue Tiger, Blue Tiger, Common Crow and Double-branded Crow regularly travels through Kallar. “Kallar is located on the first hairpin bend as you begin your climb towards Ooty. The fruit garden there is home to some rare flora and fauna. We have submitted a report to the Coimbatore Forest Division to declare Kallar as a butterfly hotspot. It can be a conservation model,” says Theivaprakasham.

The Silver Forget-me-not has swelled the list of butterflies in the state. Says Pavendhan. “We have 325 species in the State now. The blue beauty was spotted at the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve.”",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/7z4qcg/article30606124.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cbmpButterflies,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/2019-was-a-good-year-for-butterflies-in-tamil-nadu/article30606125.ece
414,2020/01/20,Why the breeding of spot-billed pelicans at Vellalore Lake is good news,"“Look at this.” Chetan Joshi holds out his phone to show a video of pelican chicks feeding from the parent’s gullet. G Parameswaran is also showing photos on his Macbook and waxing eloquent over the delicate colours in the breeding plumage.

The excitement is palpable as the members of the Perur Lake Forum talk about their documentation of spot-billed pelicans breeding for two years consecutively at Vellalore Lake.

These pelicans are present throughout the year in the Greater Coimbatore area but usually migrate for breeding. In January 2018 — on January 27 to be precise, says Parameswaran — the group learnt that a cluster of birds had hatched chicks. They began to record all the data they could get and resolved to get what they had missed in the next season.

Fortunately, the pelicans reassembled in the same spot and they were able to get a range of photographs, videos and screen grabs of pair bonding, nest building, copulation — “Unfortunately we couldn’t see the egg laying. That was inferred when we saw the pair sitting in the nest” — hatching, young chicks, feeding and more.

More about the pelicans Local migrant species like these pelicans require large undisturbed wetlands and prey availability to raise their young. The only known currently active site in Tamil Nadu is the Koonthankulam Bird Sanctuary near Tirunelveli.

These birds take nearly four years to attain breeding status and their breeding season in South India lasts for six months from November to April

The birds are generally white but, during breeding season, the feathers on the throat and sides turn pink and a yellow patch appears on the chest

As they hatch the chicks and begin feeding, black spots start appearing. Slowly they go back to the basic plumage

Both male and female birds take turns to incubate the eggs and share the task of feeding.

Survival instincts (Clockwise from far left) A chick reaches right into the the parent’s gullet to retrieve its food; The yellow patch on the chest is part of the breeding plumage; During the nest-building phase | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

In one photo, two chicks have stuck their heads into the parent’s gullet to feed. In another, the adult bird is delicately dropping some pre-digested food into the nest for the chick to feed on. “As the chicks grow, the nest has to be strengthened. When the adult bird brings material to refurbish the nest, the youngsters sometimes mistake it for food and grab at it. The ensuing tug of war is quite comical,” laughs Parameswaran.

Why is this event significant? Simply put, it is a sign that our wetlands are, ecologically speaking, still in decent shape. As Sai Vivek points out, the lake was dry for over 15 years and was cleaned up just two years ago. He makes a special mention of cleaning of water channels while Sharang Satish points out that the Miyawaki forests in the vicinity also helped.

Perur Lake Forum PLF was formed in 2014 to collect and collate data in a scientific manner about birds seen in Coimbatore’s wetlands. “The composition and status of water birds of Perur Lake in Tamil Nadu, India” by G Parameswaran and R Shivashankar was published in the Journal of Threatened Taxa in the October 2018 issue

The current members are G Parameswaran, R Sivashankar, Vridhi R, Sai Vivek, Dilip Joshi, Gajamohanraj, Chetankumar Joshi, Sharang Satish, Prakash G, Richard MM, Sneha Richard and Sandeep Richard

The group has been monitoring birds at in Perur Lake monthly for more than five years, conducting the Anuvavi Bird count for two years and also monitoring the Krishnampathy and Kolarampathy wetlands for one year.

The talk moves to threats from poaching and fishing. “Sometimes we find the young birds in the water,” says Chetan Joshi. “So we asked one of the men in the lake. He said that it had fallen from the nest.” Vellalore lake has also been let out for fishing, points out Prakash G, and sometimes the fishermen use catapults to bring the birds down. Gajamohanraj mimics the fisherman: “I’ve paid ₹50,000 for fishing rights and you expect me to keep quiet when these birds eat up all my fish.”

There is even threat from siblings and parents. “Stronger siblings will push the weaker one out of the nest,” says Prakash and Parameswaran refers to cannibalism of the weaker chicks.

All of them are cautiously optimistic about the future. While they hope to publish a scientific paper on the data they have collected, they cannot stress enough the need to conserve our wetlands. “But it has to be done scientifically,” emphasises Parameswaran. “Human intervention and overexploitation of resources can lead to deterioration.”

Vivek rues the scooping out of lake beds to deepen the water bodies and Sharang mentions how untreated sewage continues to be let into the water.

All agree that wetlands have different functions with water storage and fishing being only two. “Once you disturb the ecological balance,” says Parameswaran, “all other functions will deteriorate.”
