0,2020/01/02,Kerala’s winning strategy,"Two years ago, a top coach felt a bit embarrassed when she revealed that almost the entire Indian women’s volleyball team for the Jakarta Asian Games hailed from Kerala.

Did it mean that the other States were not doing anything for the sport? “That sort of thinking could turn out to be a problem for us,” she said.

On Thursday, the Kerala women showed why they were so good. They brushed aside Railways in straight sets to retain the senior National title in Bhubaneswar.

The Kerala girls probably even noticed a certain fear in their opponents’ eyes in the final. For they had beaten Railways in straight sets in the Federation Cup in Amritsar in October.

“We had broken a major psychological barrier when we beat 10-time champion Railways in a tough final in the senior Nationals in Chennai last year. It was easier today,” Sadanandan, the chief coach of the Kerala women’s team, told The Hindu from Bhubaneswar on Thursday. “And our easy victory in the last Federation Cup gave us a lot of confidence.”

Sadanandan, who has now guided Kerala women to a hat-trick of triumphs (two Nationals, one Federation Cup), felt that his team’s solid defence virtually broke Railways.

“We knew that if we play a proper defence, it would frustrate them. So, we were very good at the net, blocked well and also put up an extraordinary defence in the last line,” he said.

“We knew that if they are unable to score when they desperately wanted to win, they would go down. That strategy worked.”

He said K.P. Anusree, M. Sruthi and setter K.S. Jini served very well and that disrupted the Railways’ reception. “In the attack, S. Soorya did extremely well along with our universal K.P. Anusree.”

Incidentally, Kerala had seven players who were in the Asian Games team.

“Half the Railways team came from Kerala. And 10 players from this team are from the KSEB and two are from Kerala Police and they train at LNCPE, Thiruvananthapuram,” said Sadanandan.

He said the many clubs and academies in the State’s villages and towns worked very hard at the grassroots level. “And we have the maximum number of tournaments in all age-groups. No other State has this many tournaments. And since the KSEB and Police offer jobs, more youngsters are keen to take up the sport.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/keralas-winning-strategy/article30462639.ece
1,2020/01/02,TN claims men’s title after six years,"Tamil Nadu bagged the men’s crown in the senior National volleyball championships with a 25-18, 25-21, 21-25, 25-23 victory over Railways in the final here on Thursday. This was Tamil Nadu’s ninth title overall in the men’s event and the first after six years. Kerala defeated Railways 25-18, 25-14, 25-13 and retained the women’s title.

Head coach G. Dhinakaran praised the seniors for putting up a wonderful show. “G.R. Vaishnav, Ukkrapandian and Naveen Raja Jacob were really effective while the juniors did what was expected of them,” he said.

Dhinakaran said the team’s first objective in the final was to stop the Railways’ central blocker Ashwal and it was done successfully.

“Our attacker Ashwin and central blocker Manoj did really well,” he said.

The results:

Men’s final: TN bt Railways 25-18, 25-21, 21-25, 25-23; Third place play-off: Kerala bt Karnataka 25-21, 26-24, 25-19.

3,2020/01/02,Vinesh Phogat says 2020 will be special,"Star Indian grappler Vinesh Phogat has said 2019 was a year filled with all kinds of emotions wherein she learned a lot and believes that 2020 — wherein she will be making her second Olympics appearance — will be special.

“2019 was a year filled with emotions some bitter, some sweet! Started off the year with a lot of anger, frustration and fear inside of me. I had a new full-time coach, a whole new practice regimen, and most importantly a completely new weight category!” Vinesh tweeted on Wednesday.

At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil, Vinesh reached the quarter-finals and lost to Sun Yanan of China owing to a knee injury.

Vinesh, who was stretchered off the mat midway during her quarter-final bout in Rio, changed her weight category twice since 2016, and in March 2019, she decided to move up to the 53-kg category with an eye on avoiding injuries.

“Now that I think of it, this new weight category made the biggest difference and finally helped me achieve something that I had pursued for a long time, a World Championship medal! Chasing that medal brought in huge changes,” she said.

“I changed the way I trained, the way I ate, and how I recovered!!! I explored new countries, wandered round new cities and had a tonne of fabulous new experiences. Looking back, 2019 turned out pretty great!”

“2020 comes with a lot of promise with the fact that I am competing at my second Olympic Games taking it to a whole new level! Thank you 2019 for all the wonderful and not so wonderful moments that taught me so much! Wishing all of you a very happy new year!!!”

“2020 is gonna be special,” she added.

The 25-year-old underlined her potential with a bronze medal in the World Wrestling Championships after she registered an emphatic 4-1 victory over Greece’s Maria Prevolaraki in Russia. That made her the first Indian wrestler to qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

She also became the first Indian woman wrestler to make the cut through Worlds, a feat which only strengthens her stakes at the Tokyo Olympics. With Sakshi Malik struggling, Vinesh will be India’s best hope for glory in Tokyo.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/da70j1/article30458708.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VINESH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/vinesh-phogat-says-2020-will-be-special/article30458709.ece

10,2020/01/02,Google AI model beats humans in detecting breast cancer,"In a ray of hope for those who have to go for breast cancer screening and even for healthy women who get false alarms during digital mammography, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Google model has left radiologists behind in spotting breast cancer by just scanning the X-ray results.

Reading mammograms is a difficult task, even for experts, and can often result in both false positives and false negatives.

In turn, these inaccuracies can lead to delays in detection and treatment, unnecessary stress for patients and a higher workload for radiologists who are already in short supply, Google said in a blog post on Wednesday.

Google’s AI model spotted breast cancer in de-identified screening mammograms (where identifiable information has been removed) with greater accuracy, fewer false positives and fewer false negatives than experts.

“This sets the stage for future applications where the model could potentially support radiologists performing breast cancer screenings,” said Shravya Shetty, Technical Lead, Google Health.

Digital mammography or X-ray imaging of the breast, is the most common method to screen for breast cancer, with over 42 million exams performed each year in the US and the UK combined.

“But despite the wide usage of digital mammography, spotting and diagnosing breast cancer early remains a challenge,” said Daniel Tse, Product Manager, Google Health.

Together with colleagues at DeepMind, Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre, Northwestern University and Royal Surrey County Hospital, Google set out to see if AI could support radiologists to spot the signs of breast cancer more accurately.

The findings, published in the journal Nature, showed that AI could improve the detection of breast cancer.

Google AI model was trained and tuned on a representative data set comprised of de-identified mammograms from more than 76,000 women in the UK and more than 15,000 women in the US, to see if it could learn to spot signs of breast cancer in the scans.

The model was then evaluated on a separate de-identified data set of more than 25,000 women in the UK and over 3,000 women in the US.

“In this evaluation, our system produced a 5.7% reduction of false positives in the US, and a 1.2% reduction in the UK. It produced a 9.4% reduction in false negatives in the US, and a 2.7% reduction in the UK,” informed Google.

The researchers then trained the AI model only on the data from the women in the UK and then evaluated it on the data set from women in the US.

In this separate experiment, there was a 3.5% reduction in false positives and an 8.1% reduction in false negatives, “showing the model’s potential to generalize to new clinical settings while still performing at a higher level than experts”.

Notably, when making its decisions, the model received less information than human experts did.

The human experts (in line with routine practice) had access to patient histories and prior mammograms, while the model only processed the most recent anonymized mammogram with no extra information.

Despite working from these X-ray images alone, the model surpassed individual experts in accurately identifying breast cancer.

This work, said Google, is the latest strand of its research looking into detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, not just within the scope of radiology, but also pathology.

“We’re looking forward to working with our partners in the coming years to translate our machine learning research into tools that benefit clinicians and patients,” said the tech giant.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/article18718769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5TH-PINKRIBOON,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/google-ai-model-beats-humans-in-detecting-breast-cancer/article30459896.ece

12,2020/01/02,Austria’s unlikely coalition to unveil government programme,"Austria’s conservatives and their Green partners were set to present the government programme of their unprecedented coalition, a plan with right-wing leader Sebastian Kurz’s clear imprimatur that could set a European precedent.

The two parties announced late on Wednesday that they had agreed to govern together after key election gains in September following a corruption scandal that broke apart 33-year-old Mr. Kurz’s ruling coalition with the far right.

Mr. Kurz — who has styled himself as a tough anti-immigration fighter — said his People’s Party (OeVP) and the Greens had “succeeded in uniting the best of both worlds” in protracted negotiations aimed at “protecting the climate and borders”.

‘Daring experiment’

“Historic accord fixed” ran the Kurier daily’s main headline on Thursday, while a column in the left-leaning Standard described the coalition as a “daring experiment” and a “political adventure”.

Papers said the pact bore the conservatives’ stamp, with tabloid Oesterreich billing the OeVP as “powerful as never before”.

It is the Greens’ first entry into the Austrian government at a national level — and that in the unlikely marriage of conservatives and ecologists.

Observers say Germany and others may follow suit as parties seek to cater to voters’ increasingly populist sentiments as well as worries about climate change amid student protests following calls by activist Greta Thunberg .

13,2020/01/02,China detains over a dozen activists in year-end crackdown,"Over a dozen Chinese lawyers and activists were detained or went missing in the final days of 2019 in a crackdown on participants of a private democracy gathering, rights groups said on Thursday.

The Chinese government has severely reduced the space for civil liberties since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, rounding up rights lawyers, labour activists and even Marxists students in various sweeps.

The latest crackdown was linked to a December gathering in the east coast city of Xiamen in Fujian province, where participants discussed “democratic transition in China,” said Human Rights Watch researcher Wang Yaqiu.

The period around Christmas and New Year is traditionally when China chooses to sentence prominent dissidents in an effort to minimise international media attention, “so it is not a surprise that they chose this particular time to launch a manhunt of activists,” Ms. Wang said. The meeting involved a small group of people “peacefully discussing politics in a private space,” she added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-detains-over-a-dozen-activists-in-year-end-crackdown/article30463248.ece
14,2020/01/02,Turkish lawmakers authorise sending troops to fight in Libya,"Turkey’s Parliament on Thursday authorised the deployment of troops to Libya to support the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli battle forces loyal to a rival government that is seeking to capture the capital.

Turkish lawmakers voted 325-184 at an emergency session in favour of a one-year mandate allowing the government to dispatch troops amid concerns that Turkish forces could aggravate the conflict in Libya and destabilise the region.

The Tripoli-based government of Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Sarraj has faced an offensive by the rival regime in the east and commander Gen. Khalifa Hifter. The fighting has threatened to plunge Libya into violent chaos rivalling the 2011 conflict that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last month that Mr. Sarraj requested the Turkish deployment, after he and Mr. Sarraj signed a military deal that allows Ankara to dispatch military experts and personnel to Libya. That deal, along with a separate agreement on maritime boundaries between Turkey and Libya, has drawn ire across the region and beyond.

Ankara says the deployment is vital for Turkey to safeguard its interests in Libya and in the eastern Mediterranean, where it finds itself increasingly isolated as Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel have established exclusive economic zones paving the way for oil and gas exploration.

“A Libya whose legal government is under threat can spread instability to Turkey,” ruling party legislator Ismet Yilmaz argued in defence of the motion. “Those who shy away from taking steps on grounds that there is a risk will throw our children into a greater danger.”

The government has not revealed details about the possible Turkish deployment. The motion allows the government to decide on the scope, amount and timing of any mission by Turkish troops.

Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey would send “the necessary number [of troops] whenever there is a need.”

But he also said Turkey would not dispatch its forces if Libya’s rival government halts its offensive.

“If the other side adopts a different stance and says ‘OK, we are withdrawing, we are backing down,’ then why would we go?” Mr. Oktay said.

Turkey’s main opposition party, CHP, had said its lawmakers would vote against the motion because the deployment would embroil Turkey in another conflict and make it a party to the further “shedding of Muslim blood.”

Before the vote, CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu called on the government Thursday to work for the establishment of a United Nations peacekeeping force in Libya.

“Turkey must take the lead for efforts to establish stability in the region and concentrate all diplomatic efforts in that direction,” Mr. Kilicdaroglu tweeted.

A centre-right opposition party also said its legislators would not back the motion.

“We cannot throw our soldiers in the line of fire of a civilian war that has nothing to do with our national security,” said Aytun Ciray, a member of the opposition Good Party, said during the parliamentary debate.

15,2020/01/02,Canadian military assigned Pokemon Go after fans invade bases,"At least three military police officers were ordered to play Pokemon Go in army bases across Canada, after players invaded the facilities in a quest to catch them all.

The interlopers were not foreign agents but fans of the wildly popular Pokemon Go app — launched in 2016 — trying to capture as many of the game’s virtual characters as possible and even wandering into restricted army areas.

A surge in the number of suspects being apprehended in the summer after the game’s release puzzled the army, according to internal documents obtained by Canadian public television channel CBC.

“Please advise the Commissionaires that apparently Fort Frontenac is both a PokeGym and a PokeStop,” Major Jeff Monaghan at Canadian Forces Base Kingston wrote.

“I will be completely honest in that I have not idea what that is,” he said in a message among the nearly 500 pages of military documents obtained by CBC under an access to information request.

At least three military police officers, at different bases across the country, were assigned to wander around army facilities with phones and notebooks in hand to search for virtual Pokemon infrastructure and characters.

“We should almost hire a 12-year-old to help us out with this,” wrote security expert David Levenick at CFB Borden in Ontario, 100 kilometres northwest of Toronto.

At the entrance to the base, one woman was caught playing Pokemon Go while her three children were climbing over tanks.

A man separately arrested at CFB Borden explained he was just collecting points playing Pokemon Go and told officers: “I have to beat my kids.”

Shortly after the release of Pokemon Go, the armed forces even had to issue a public notice warning players not to venture onto military bases.

But some saw a positive side to the influx of Pokemon hunters.

“Maybe some extra people will visit the museum!,” wrote Major Alicia Saucier at CFB Petawawa, Ontario, where the garrison museum was a game hotspot.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dsiu4j/article30462227.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02LTPOKEMONGO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/canadian-military-assigned-pokemon-go-after-fans-invade-bases/article30462228.ece
16,2020/01/02,A milestone for French rail strikes: 29th day of walkouts,"With 29 straight days of walkouts, French rail strikes against government plans to reform France’s retirement system marked a new milestone Thursday, surpassing even the lengths of strikes in the 1980s.

The nationwide walkouts against the government’s pension plans started on December 5.

On Thursday, they surpassed a 1986-1987 rail strike in longevity, a walkout that lasted 28 days at the SNCF national rail company.

The current strikes have crippled train and metro services in Paris and across the country over the Christmas-New Year period and continue to cause severe disruptions.

The SNCF said half of its vaunted high-speed trains weren’t running on Thursday. Only two automated lines were running normally in the Paris Metro, with services spotty or non-existent across the rest of the network.

Unions are gearing up for further walkouts next week, when French schools reopen and negotiations are set to resume with the government.

In a televised New Year address on Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron reaffirmed his commitment to the pension overhaul but urged his government to “find the path of a quick compromise” with unions.

Mr. Macron stayed firm on the principles of the reform, including its most decried measure: raising the eligibility age for full pensions from 62 to 64.

He insisted the new system will be fairer to all French workers and will be financially sustainable. The plan aims to unite dozens of separate pension systems into one and eliminate special deals that let some French transit workers retire in their 50s.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bmu3c0/article30461758.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FRANCESTRIKES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a-milestone-for-french-rail-strikes-29th-day-of-walkouts/article30461759.ece
17,2020/01/02,Lebanon receives Interpol arrest warrant for Carlos Ghosn,"Lebanon received an Interpol arrest warrant on Thursday for fugitive former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, while Turkey launched an investigation into his daring escape from Japan.

Mr. Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a “rigged” justice system in Japan.

The Interpol red notice, which calls on authorities to arrest a wanted person, was received by Lebanon's internal security forces and has yet to be referred to the judiciary, a judicial source told Reuters.

Lebanese government officials could not immediately be reached to say what — if any — action would be taken.

In past cases, where Lebanon has received red notices for Lebanese citizens resident in the country, the suspects have not been detained but their passports have been confiscated and bail has been set, the judicial source said.

Mr. Ghosn, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, was smuggled out of Tokyo by a private security company, a plan that was in the works for three months and involved transit through Turkey, Reuters has reported.

Turkish police on Thursday detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Mr. Ghosn’s passage through the country, a police spokeswoman said.

She said the other detainees were two airport ground staff and one cargo worker and all seven were expected to give statements in court on Thursday.

Flight tracking data suggests Mr. Ghosn used two different planes to fly to Istanbul and then to Lebanon.

Sources close to Mr. Ghosn said he decided to flee Japan after learning that the second of his two trials had been delayed until April 2021 and also because he had not been allowed to speak to his wife as part of strict bail conditions.

Lebanon has no extradition agreement with Japan and Mr. Ghosn enjoys widespread support in the country of his childhood, where he holds extensive investments in banking and real estate.

Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday Japanese authorities allowed Mr. Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, potentially shedding some light on how he managed to escape despite having passports held by Japanese lawyers.

No one was immediately available for comment at the office of Mr. Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, or at the French Embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/u13v29/article26501666.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH12NISSAN-GHOSN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/lebanon-receives-interpol-arrest-warrant-for-carlos-ghosn/article30461579.ece
18,2020/01/02,German zoo blaze was caused by New Year gesture gone wrong: police,"A Chinese lantern, launched by a 60-year-old mother and her two adult daughters in a New Year's Eve celebration, caused the fire at a German zoo in which dozens of animals were killed, including eight great apes, authorities said.

Police in Krefeld, near the Dutch border, said the three women had turned themselves in on learning of the disaster, in which five orangutans, two gorillas and a chimpanzee were killed, alongside bats and birds.

The women had bought five lanterns, banned locally and in most of Germany for over a decade, on the internet, believing that they were allowed on New Year's Eve, Chief Investigator Gerd Hoppmann told a sombre news conference on Thursday.

“I've seen very many human corpses,” Mr. Hoppmann said. “And I was struck by how like humans the bodies of the great apes looked when transformed by the fire.”

The women had inscribed the lanterns, papier mache balloons lifted by the heat of the flame inside, with good wishes for the new year. Four had been found in the vicinity, while the fifth had been consumed in the zoo blaze.

“They launched the lanterns with good wishes and had no idea what could happen,” Mr. Hoppmann said of the women, who could face charges of causing fire by negligence, punishable by up to five years' imprisonment or a fine.

“It was courageous of them to turn themselves in: that deserves respect,” he added, saying he would give no further details about the women, since they had received threats.

The zoo was festooned with candles and photos of the dead apes on Thursday, with locals telling television stations how affected they had been by the deaths of the animals, who included Massa, a 48-year-old male gorilla.

“The pain is unbelievable,” Wolfgang Dressen, director of the zoo, told public broadcaster WDR.

Department store chain Real said on Thursday that it would stop selling the lanterns, which are still permitted in the northern, coastal region of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rg570p/article30460917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GERMANYZOOFIRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/german-zoo-blaze-was-caused-by-new-year-gesture-gone-wrong-police/article30460918.ece
19,2020/01/02,Sri Lanka extends free tourist visa facility until April 30: Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga,"Sri Lanka on January 2 extended the free visa-on-arrival scheme till April 30 for the citizens of 48 countries, including India, Tourism Minister Prasanna Ranatunga said, as the country tries to revive the tourism sector which was hit by the Easter Sunday bombings.

In April, Sri Lanka suspended its plans to grant visa-on-arrival to citizens of 39 countries after the devastating bombings that killed 258 people.

In July, the island nation added more countries, including India and China after it re-launched the free visa on arrival scheme, which was implemented from August 1.

“We have decided to extend this facility due to requests from the stake holders. A Cabinet paper would be submitted for this purpose,” Mr. Ranatunga said.

In the aftermath of the Easter Sunday bomb attacks, the $20 visa fee for South Asian travellers and $35 fee applicable to visitors from the rest of the world were waived off.

Tourism which contributes 5% to the island’s GDP was dealt a severe blow after the ISIS linked local extremist group National Thawheed Jammath (NTJ) carried out suicide bombings which killed over 260 people at three luxury hotels and three churches on April 21.

Sri Lanka’s tourism arrivals had received a boost by early 2019 with over 10% increase in arrivals year on year. The Lonely Planet had by then named Sri Lanka as a top tourist destination in the world.

However, after the Easter Sunday bombings, the industry suffered mass scale cancellations of prior bookings. In May last year the arrivals suffered over a 70% slump.

The tourism industry officials said the arrivals during 2019 were well below the 1.9 million arrivals target.

The first 11 months data for 2019 had showed arrivals had been 1.67 million down by nearly 20%.

The bombings, which targeted three Catholic churches and three posh Colombo hotels, killed over 250 people, including 44 foreigners, and injured over 500, including 37 foreigners. Tourism industry officials said there have been 70% cancellations of prior bookings after the attacks.

The U.S., China, the U.K., India and Australia were among the countries which issued travel warnings on Sri Lanka following the Easter Sunday blasts.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-extends-free-tourist-visa-facility-until-april-30-tourism-minister-prasanna-ranatunga/article30460871.ece
20,2020/01/02,"Flood death toll rises to 26 in Jakarta, tens of thousands evacuated","Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in Indonesia’s capital Jakarta on Thursday after flash floods and landslides killed up to 26 people amid some of the heaviest rain in more than 20 years, with more deluges forecast, authorities said.

The flooding, among the deadliest in years, caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia’s biggest city with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas. Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on December 31 and into the early hours of New Year’s Day.

Social Affairs Ministry data showed 26 people were killed in the flooding, up from the earlier toll of 21.

As of Thursday morning, over 62,000 people were evacuated in Jakarta alone, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said, although later in the day he told news channel Metro TV the number of evacuees were down to around 35,000 people.

Rainfall at an airport in East Jakarta measured at 377 millimetres (15 inches) early on January 1, the highest daily reading during major floods since at least 1996, according to the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG).

Umar Dani, 52, and his family were evacuated overnight from his home in East Jakarta on a rubber boat after water levels rose up to his neck.

“It has not flooded for so long here. We didn't have the chance to bring anything,” he said.

“I have to live on the streets now.”

President Joko Widodo told reporters evacuation and safety measures should be prioritised and called for more coordination between city administrations and the Central government.

On his Twitter page, Mr. Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the flooding. He said some projects have been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems.

‘Extreme weather’ expected

Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said authorities deployed hundreds of pumps to suck water from residential areas across the capital, which had allowed some people to return home.

“They want to return home immediately and start cleaning up their houses as soon as they are able to enter their houses as water recedes,” Mr. Baswedan told reporters during a visit to a densely populated area in east Jakarta affected by the flood.

Residents waddled through murky water to see the Governor while workers pumped water out of the area into a nearby river.

The mitigation agency said on its Twitter page that water levels have come down in a few affected areas, showing pictures of streets covered by mud and littered with debris.

Authorities however warned people to remain vigilant as “extreme weather” is expected to continue until January 7.

Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG), told reporters separately that heavy rainfall may continue until mid-February.

Television footage on Thursday showed rescuers in the nearby city of Tangerang evacuating residents, guiding them across a strong current by holding on to a rope.

Jakarta and its surroundings are home to more than 30 million people. More than 50 people died in one of the capitals deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed.

The government announced last year that it is relocating the capital to East Kalimantan province on Borneo, though the planning ministry pledged that the government will invest $40 billion in modernising Jakarta.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/149c9h/article30460855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDONESIAFLOOD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/flood-death-toll-rises-in-jakarta-tens-of-thousands-evacuated/article30460856.ece
21,2020/01/02,Abu Dhabi Crown Prince visits Pakistan to boost bilateral ties,"Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammad bin Zayed Al Nahyan on January 2 arrived in Islamabad on a day-long visit, amidst criticism of the UAE for siding with Saudi Arabia to put pressure on Pakistan to skip a key conference of Muslim nations in Malaysia.

Prime Minister Imran Khan received the Crown Prince at the Nur Khan Airbase and personally drove him from the airport. It was for the second time that Khan drove his vehicle as he did in January last year when the prince visited.

The visit comes in the wake of the controversy created due to Pakistan skipping the Kuala Lumpur summit to apparently appease Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

Prime Minister Khan had confirmed Pakistan’s participation in the summit hosted by Malaysia, but skipped the event at the eleventh hour due to pressure exerted by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates - key financial backers of the cash-stripped country.

The Summit from December 19-21 was seen by Saudis as an attempt to create a new bloc in the Muslim world that could become an alternative to the dysfunctional Organisation of Islamic Cooperation led by the Gulf Kingdom.

The Foreign Office said that the Prince will have a one-on-one meeting with the Prime Minister. This will be followed by a luncheon hosted by Khan. “The exchange of views between the two leaders will cover bilateral matters and regional and international issues of common interest,” the FO said.

Frequent exchange of high-level visits between Pakistan and the UAE is reflective of the importance that the two countries attach to their fraternal ties, it said. The visit illustrates the strength and substance of the Pakistan-UAE special relationship, based on commonalities of faith, cultural affinities, and a shared resolve to take mutual cooperation to a new level, the FO said.

The UAE is Pakistan’s largest trading partner in the Middle East and a major source of investments. The UAE is also among Pakistan’s prime development partners in education, health and energy sectors. It hosts more than 1.6 million expatriate Pakistani community, which contributes remittances of around $4.5 billion annually to the GDP.

This is the Crown Prince’s second visit to Pakistan since Khan took office in August 2018. He had last visited Pakistan on January 6 last year, just weeks after his country offered $3 billion financial assistance to Pakistan to deal with its balance of payment crisis.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/4ttz1s/article30459983.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001C037R,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/abu-dhabi-crown-prince-visits-pakistan-to-boost-bilateral-ties/article30459984.ece
22,2020/01/02,Nepal SC asks govt to furnish country’s historical map relating to Kalapani border issue,"Nepal’s Supreme Court has sought within 15 days the country’s original map exchanged with India during the signing of the Sugauli Treaty in 1816 after a petition sought the apex court’s intervention to secure the Nepali territory. A single bench of Justice Hari Prasad Phuyal demanded the map from the Nepal government in response to the public interest litigation filed by a senior advocate who appealed the Supreme Court to order the government to start political and diplomatic efforts to protect Nepali territories.

Nepal has raised objections after India released its new political map in November last year following the reorganiation of Jammu and Kashmir. Nepal claimed that Limpiyadhura, Lipulek and Kalapani areas were shown under India’s territory even though they lie within the Nepalese territory. India has said the new map accurately depicts its sovereign territory and it has in no manner revised its boundary with Nepal.

Nepalese territories including Darjeeling were handed to the British East India Company as concessions under the Sugauli treaty which was signed in 1816 on the conclusion of the Anglo-Nepalese War.

Under the treaty, the Nepalese-controlled territory that was ceded included all areas that the king of Nepal had won in earlier wars such as the kingdom of Sikkim in the east and Kumaon and Garhwal in the west.

Although the Supreme court order was issued on Monday, the text of the order was issued only on Wednesday.

The Supreme Court bench asked the government to furnish a written response along with a copy of Sugauli Treaty-era map of Nepal within 15 days.

The apex court has also asked the authorities to furnish other official maps either exchanged with various countries or with the international organisations including the United Nations while applying for obtaining their membership.

The government has also been directed to submit the original map exchanged while signing a Boundary Treaty with the Indian government in 1960, the map published by the East-India Company on February 1, 1827, and a separate map published by the British Government in 1847.

The court has also asked the government to submit details of efforts made, if any, for amending the map of Nepal.

The bench stated that the hearings on the PIL will be conducted in tandem with another similar petition filed by another advocate.

Meanwhile, the Kathmandu Post reported that Nepal has proposed foreign secretary-level talks with India in mid-January on the boundary issue.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9n6cug/article30459044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02India-map,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/nepal-sc-asks-govt-to-furnish-countrys-historical-map-relating-to-kalapani-border-issue/article30459045.ece
23,2020/01/02,Taiwan's military chief among eight dead in helicopter crash,"Taiwan’s top military official was among eight people killed on Thursday, after a helicopter carrying them to visit soldiers crashed in a mountainous area near the capital Taipei, the Defence Ministry said.

The main portion of the helicopter lay in a northern forest wreathed in mist, its blades shattered, as dozens of rescuers combed the wreck for survivors, pictures released by emergency authorities showed.

Five survive

The reasons for the crash, in the wake of a forced landing, were unknown, the military said in a statement, adding that the chief of general staff, Air Force General Shen Yi-ming, had died, while five of the 13 aboard survived.

Gen. Shen, who took up his post in July, was Taiwan’s highest-ranking general to die in the line of duty, President Tsai Ing-wen said, adding that she had asked the Defence Minister to launch an investigation.

“We must find out the reason for the incident,” she told reporters in the northeastern county of Yilan, where the helicopter had been heading after setting out from Taipei.

“Most importantly, (we) must ensure the stability of our military and national defence.”

The Defence Ministry said it had dispatched a rescue team following the Black Hawk helicopter’s crash in New Taipei City, after aviation authorities lost contact with the craft at 8:07 a.m.

“Eight of our colleagues were killed,” a military spokesman told a news conference broadcast live on television.

Elections on Jan. 11

The incident, which comes a week before democratic Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on January 11, disrupted campaign events.

Ms. Tsai, who is seeking re-election, cancelled all campaign activities until Saturday, while opposition presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party called off campaigns until Friday.

“Kuomintang urges related authorities to probe the incident as soon as possible and make a thorough check on the same type of aircraft to prevent the tragedy from happening again,” the party said in a statement.

The helicopter involved in Thursday’s incident was one of 60 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters the United States sold to Taiwan in 2010, the official Central News Agency said.

Although the Unites States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is the island’s strongest international backer and main arms supplier.

The de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan expressed its condolences, saying it stood ready to assist in the aftermath of the tragedy, but without detailing what such help might entail.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/p0l6hs/article30458479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02TAIWANMILITARYOFFICIAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/taiwans-military-chief-among-eight-dead-in-helicopter-crash/article30458169.ece
24,2020/01/02,"At 67,385, India records highest number of babies born globally on New Year’s Day: UNICEF","Nearly 4,00,000 babies were born around the world on New Year’s Day with India recording the highest number of these births worldwide at 67,385, the UN children’s agency said.

An estimated 3,92,078 babies were born around the world on New Year’s Day, according to UNICEF. Of this, an estimated 67,385 babies were born in India, the most globally. China comes in second with 46,299 births.

The beginning of a new year and a new decade is an opportunity to reflect on our hopes and aspirations not only for our future, but the future of those who will come after us, UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said.

Fiji in the Pacific most likely delivered 2020’s first baby, while the U.S., the last of the New Year’s Day. Globally, over half of these births were estimated to have taken place in eight countries — India (67,385), China (46,299), Nigeria (26,039), Pakistan (16,787), Indonesia (13,020), United States of America (10,452), Democratic Republic of Congo (10,247) and Ethiopia (8,493).

Each January, UNICEF celebrates babies born on New Year’s Day, an auspicious day for child birth around the world, it said. However, for millions of newborns around the world, the day of their birth is far less auspicious.

In 2018, 2.5 million newborns died in just their first month of life; about a third of them on the first day of life. Among those children, most died from preventable causes such as premature birth, complications during delivery, and infections like sepsis. In addition, more than 2.5 million babies are born dead each year.

UNICEF said over the past three decades, the world has seen remarkable progress in child survival, cutting the number of children worldwide who die before their fifth birthday by more than half. But there has been slower progress for newborns. Babies dying in the first month accounted for 47% of all deaths among children under five in 2018, up from 40%in 1990.

UNICEF’s Every Child Alive campaign calls for immediate investment in health workers with the right training, who are equipped with the right medicines to ensure every mother and newborn is cared for by a safe pair of hands to prevent and treat complications during pregnancy, delivery and birth.

Too many mothers and newborns are not being cared for by a trained and equipped midwife or nurse, and the results are devastating, said Fore. We can ensure that millions of babies survive their first day and live into this decade and beyond if every one of them is born into a safe pair of hands.

India is projected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country around 2027. According to UN estimates, India is expected to add nearly 273 million people between 2019 and 2050, while the population of Nigeria is projected to grow by 200 million. Together, these two countries could account for 23% of the global population increase to 2050.

China, with 1.43 billion people in 2019, and India, with 1.37 billion, have long been the two most populous countries of the world, comprising 19% and 18%, respectively, of the global total in 2019. Through the end of the century, India is estimated to remain the world’s most populous country with nearly 1.5 billion inhabitants, followed by China with just under 1.1 billion, Nigeria with 733 million, the US with 434 million, and Pakistan with 403 million inhabitants.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/l1i8s5/article30458843.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NEWBORN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/at-67385-india-records-highest-number-of-babies-born-globally-on-new-years-day-unicef/article30457574.ece
25,2020/01/02,"23 dead, thousands caught in flooding in Jakarta","Severe flooding in Indonesia’s capital as residents celebrated the new year has killed at least 23 people, displaced tens of thousands and forced an airport to close, the country’s disaster management agency said on Thursday.

Monsoon rains and rising rivers submerged at least 169 neighbourhoods and caused landslides in the Bogor and Depok districts on Jakarta’s outskirts, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said.

Video and photos released by the agency showed cars floating in muddy waters while soldiers and rescuers in rubber boats helped children and elders forced onto the roofs of flooded homes.

The floods inundated thousands of homes and buildings in poor and wealthy districts alike, have forced authorities to cut off electricity and water and paralysed transport networks, Wibowo said.

More than 31,000 people were in temporary shelters after floodwaters reached up to 8 feet in places, Wibowo said.

As much as 37 cm of rainfall was recorded in Jakarta and West Java’s hilly areas on New Year’s Eve, causing the Ciliwung and Cisadane rivers to overflow, Jakarta Gov. Anies Baswedan told reporters after conducting an aerial survey over the flooded city.

He said 120,000 rescuers were helping people evacuate and installing mobile water pumps as more downpours were forecast. He vowed his city administration would complete flood-mitigation projects on the two rivers.

Director General of Civil Aviation Polana Pramesti said the floods submerged the runway at Jakarta’s Halim Perdanakusumah domestic airport, forcing it to close and stranding some 19,000 passengers.

Flooding was possible until April, when the rainy season ends. Flooding also highlights Indonesia’s infrastructure problems as it tries to attract foreign investment.

Jakarta is home to 10 million people and 30 million live in its greater metropolitan area. It is prone to earthquakes and flooding and is rapidly sinking due to uncontrolled extraction of groundwater. Congestion is also estimated to cost the economy USD6.5 billion a year.

26,2020/01/02,"Indian Army chief’s remark of ‘pre-emptively strike’ right ‘irresponsible’, says Pakistan","Pakistan on Wednesday rejected India’s new Army chief’s statement that New Delhi reserves the right to “pre-emptively strike” across the Line of Control (LoC), terming the remarks as “irresponsible”.

In an exclusive interview to PTI barely hours after taking charge of the 1.3-million strong force, Army Chief Gen Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday said India reserves the right to “pre-emptively strike” at sources of terror. He asserted that a “new normal” in the country’s response mechanism to acts of cross-border terrorism has already been “emphatically” displayed.

“If Pakistan does not stop its policy of state-sponsored terrorism, we reserve the right to pre-emptively strike at the sources of terror threat and this intent has adequately been demonstrated in our response during surgical strikes and Balakot operation,” the Army Chief said in New Delhi, in a stern warning to Islamabad.

Reacting to Gen Naravane’s remarks, the Pakistan Foreign Office in a statement said, “We reject the new Indian Army Chief’s irresponsible statement regarding ‘pre-emptive strikes’ across the LoC inside Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).”

There should be no doubt about Pakistan’s resolve and readiness to thwart any aggressive Indian move, inside its territory or PoK, the statement said.

“No one should forget Pakistan’s befitting response to India’s Balakot misadventure,” it added.

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district on February 14.

India launched a counter-terror operation against a JeM training camp in Balakot on February 26. The next day, the Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured its pilot, who was handed over to India on March 1.

“Despite India’s provocations, Pakistan would continue contributing to all efforts of promoting peace, security and stability in the region and beyond,” the statement said.

Ties between the two neighbours further worsened after India on August 5 revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 and bifurcated it into two union territories. Reacting sharply to India’s decision, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled India’s ambassador in Islamabad.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8b6o1e/article30322648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANOJMUKUNDNARAVANE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/indian-army-chiefs-remark-of-pre-emptively-strike-right-irresponsible-says-pakistan/article30456796.ece
27,2020/01/02,Study finds Google system could improve breast cancer detection,"A Google artificial intelligence system proved as good as expert radiologists at detecting which women had breast cancer based on screening mammograms and showed promise at reducing errors, researchers in the United States and Britain reported.

The study, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, is the latest to show that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the accuracy of screening for breast cancer, which affects one in eight women globally.

Radiologists miss about 20% of breast cancers in mammograms, the American Cancer Society says, and half of all women who get the screenings over a 10-year period have a false positive result.

The findings of the study, developed with Alphabet's DeepMind AI unit which merged with Google Health in September, represent a major advance in the potential for the early detection of breast cancer, Mozziyar Etemadi, one of its co-authors from Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said.

The team, which included researchers at Imperial College London and Britain's National Health Service, trained the system to identify breast cancers on tens of thousands of mammograms.

They then compared its predictions to the actual results from a set of 25,856 mammograms in the United Kingdom and 3,097 from the United States.

The study showed the AI system could identify cancers with a similar degree of accuracy to expert radiologists, while reducing the number of false positive results by 5.7% in the U.S.-based group and by 1.2% in the British-based group.

It also cut the number of false negatives, where tests are wrongly classified as normal, by 9.4% in the U.S. group, and by 2.7% in the British group.

These differences reflect the ways in which mammograms are read. In the United States, only one radiologist reads the results and the tests are done every one to two years. In Britain, the tests are done every three years, and each is read by two radiologists. When they disagree, a third is consulted.

'SUBTLE CUES'

In a separate test, the group pitted the AI system against six radiologists and found it outperformed them at accurately predicting breast cancers.

Connie Lehman, chief of the breast imaging department at Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital, said the results are in line with findings from several groups using AI to improve cancer detection in mammograms, including her own work.

The notion of using computers to improve cancer diagnostics is decades old, and computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are commonplace in mammography clinics, yet CAD programs have not improved performance in clinical practice.

The issue, Ms. Lehman said, is that current CAD programs were trained to identify things human radiologists can see, whereas with AI, computers learn to spot cancers based on the actual results of thousands of mammograms.

This has the potential to “exceed human capacity to identify subtle cues that the human eye and brain aren't able to perceive,” Ms. Lehman added.

Although computers have not been “super helpful” so far, ”what we've shown at least in tens of thousands of mammograms is the tool can actually make a very well-informed decision,” Etemadi said.

The study has some limitations. Most of the tests were done using the same type of imaging equipment, and the U.S. group contained a lot of patients with confirmed breast cancers.

More studies will be needed to show that when used by radiologists, the tool improves patient care, and it will require regulatory approval, which could take several years.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/r8vvz0/article30456021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BREASTCANCERMENOPAUSEHORMONES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/study-finds-google-system-could-improve-breast-cancer-detection/article30456022.ece
28,2020/01/02,Pompeo postpones Ukraine trip after attack on U.S. embassy in Iraq,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday postponed a trip to Ukraine, the country at the heart of impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, after an attack on the American embassy in Iraq, the State Department announced.

Mr. Pompeo had been due to travel at week's end to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus.

But on Tuesday, a mob of pro-Iran demonstrators stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad over American airstrikes that killed two dozen paramilitary fighters.

Mr. Pompeo's travel was pushed back “due to the need for the secretary to be in Washington, DC to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East,” State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus announced.

“Secretary Pompeo's trip will be rescheduled in the near future and he looks forward to the visit at that time,” she added.

The trip would have made Mr. Pompeo the most senior U.S. official to visit Kiev since a scandal erupted in 2019 over a controversial phone call in which Mr. Trump allegedly tried to pressure his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden.

Mr. Pompeo, a staunch Trump defender, was set to meet with Zelensky and other top Ukrainian officials, Ortagus said Monday when the trip was first announced.

But the following day, the embassy in Baghdad was besieged. Demonstrators finally left on Wednesday.

No U.S. personnel were injured in the attack and U.S. officials said they had no plans to evacuate.

29,2020/01/02,Australia orders mass evacuation of fire-ravaged towns before heatwave,"Thousands of tourists have been given less than 48 hours to evacuate fire-ravaged coastal communities as Australia braces for a heatwave Saturday expected to fan deadly bushfires.

Catastrophic blazes ripped through swathes of the continent's south-east on New Year's Eve, killing at least eight people and stranding holidaymakers as seaside towns were ringed by flames.

The New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service on Thursday morning declared a “tourist leave zone” stretching about 200 kilometres (124 miles) from the popular holiday spot of Bateman's Bay along the usually picturesque south-east coast to neighbouring Victoria state, where people are also being urged to evacuate fire-threatened areas.

Visitors are being warned to leave before Saturday, which is forecast to bring gusting winds and temperatures soaring above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit).

That weather will create dangerous fire conditions that officials say will be as bad -- if not worse -- than Tuesday, Australia's deadliest day of fires in a months-long bushfire crisis.

Many tourists and residents spent two nights isolated with no electricity or telecommunications, and dwindling food supplies, before authorities on Thursday deemed some roads out of the region temporarily safe to use.

NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance told public broadcaster ABC it would be the “largest evacuation of people out of the region ever”, with thousands preparing to leave ahead of another “terrible” day of fires.

NSW Rural Fire Service deputy commissioner Rob Rogers said firefighters were unable to extinguish or even control the raging blazes.

“The message is we've got so much fire in that area, we have no capacity to contain these fires,” he told ABC.

“We just need to make sure that people are not in front of them.”

But with food and fuel supplies reportedly running short in many centres, there were concerns some would remain trapped.

Authorities still have not been able to reach some rural communities, such as the town of Genoa in Victoria.

There are also mounting fears for five people still missing after the most recent blazes while the number of homes confirmed destroyed has topped 400, with that number expected to rise as firefighters reach devastated communities still isolated by flames.

Navy ships and military aircraft have been deployed alongside emergency crews to provide humanitarian relief and assess the damage.

This season's blazes have killed at least 18 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and scorched about 5.5 million hectares (13.5 million acres) — an area bigger than Denmark or the Netherlands.

The unprecedented crisis has sparked street protests calling on the government to immediately act on climate change, which scientists say is creating a longer and more intense bushfire season.

30,2020/01/02,Emerging from the shadows: the U.S. Chief Justice who will preside over Trump's trial,"U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts will be a central figure in the ongoing drama of the Donald Trump presidency in coming months. He is due to preside over a Senate impeachment trial, while the Supreme Court he leads will rule on a titanic clash over the president's attempts to keep his financial records secret.

The expected impeachment trial will focus on accusations that Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, who aspires to defeat Mr. Trump in a November election. The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved two articles of impeachment on Dec. 18, paving the way for the trial in the Senate, led by Mr. Trump's fellow Republicans.

The normally reserved and mild-mannered Mr. Roberts, 64, will have the largely symbolic role of presiding officer, with senators casting the crucial votes.

In his end-of-year message on Tuesday, Mr. Roberts hinted at a past disagreement with Mr. Trump, saying an independent judiciary was a “key source of national unity and stability,” and called on his judicial colleagues to promote public confidence and trust by reflecting on their duty to judge without fear or favor.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized federal courts and judges who have blocked his policies, while some Democratic lawmakers have suggested that the Supreme Court's conservative majority is motivated mainly by politics instead of interpreting the law.

In his message Mr. Roberts also cautioned against disinformation amplified by the internet and social media - an accusation that Mr. Trump has faced when he uses his Twitter account to retweet unfounded rumor.

It is in the marble-lined corridors of the Supreme Court across the street from the Capitol Building, hidden from the TV cameras, where Mr. Roberts wields real power. Known for his cautious approach to major cases, he holds one of just nine votes that will decide by the end of June whether Mr. Trump's financial records can be disclosed to Democratic-led congressional committees and a New York prosecutor.

The court's rulings in those cases on the power of Congress and local prosecutors to investigate a sitting president will set precedents that may affect not just Mr. Trump but also future presidents.

The impeachment trial will be an unusual and potentially uncomfortable period for the low-key Roberts, who prefers to fly under the radar even while he has navigated the conservative-majority court in a rightward direction over the last decade and a half.

“My sense is that the chief doesn't want to make himself the story,” said Sarah Binder, a scholar at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution.

Mr. Roberts declined to comment. During a rare public appearance in New York in September, Mr. Roberts appeared concerned about the hyperpartisan politics of Washington under Mr. Trump.

“When you live in a polarized political environment, people tend to see everything in those terms. That's not how we at the court function,” he said.

Those who know Mr. Roberts, including former law clerks, say that he would take his role seriously. As a history buff, he is likely reading up on the previous impeachment trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, they said.

WASHINGTON INSIDER

Mr. Roberts, a conservative appointed by Republican President George W. Bush, has a reputation in Washington as a traditional conservative and a strong defender of the Supreme Court as an independent branch of government.

In a frictionless rise to prominence, he served in the administration of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Bush appointed him to the federal appeals court in Washington in 2003 before tapping him for the chief justice post two years later.

Mr. Roberts is often viewed as an incrementalist in his judicial philosophy, conscious of the fact that the Supreme Court risks its legitimacy if its 5-4 conservative majority is characterized as being too aggressive in moving the law to the right.

He has nonetheless voted consistently with his conservative colleagues on such issues as gay rights, abortion, religious liberty and gun rights. But in 2012, he broke ranks and cast the deciding vote to uphold the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Democratic President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.

Earlier this year, he again sided with the court's liberals as the court ruled 5-4 against the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

Mr. Roberts clashed with Mr. Trump more directly in November 2018 when he took the unusual step of issuing a statement defending the federal judiciary after Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized judges who had ruled against his administration.

The cases concerning Mr. Trump's financial records, with rulings due by the end of June, puts Mr. Roberts and Mr. Trump on another collision course.

Legal experts have said Mr. Trump, who unlike previous presidents has refused to release his tax returns, is making broad assertions of presidential power that could place new limits on the ability of Congress to enforce subpoenas seeking information about the president.

If it is a close call, Mr. Roberts could cast the deciding vote.

In the Senate trial set to take place in January, Mr. Roberts' role as presiding officer is limited mainly to keeping the process on track. Mr. Roberts could, however, be asked to rule on whether certain witnesses should be called.

If a majority of senators disagree with a ruling he makes, they can vote to overturn his decision.

In the Clinton impeachment trial in 1999, Chief Justice William Rehnquist had “relatively little to do,” said Neil Richards, who was present as one of Rehnquist's law clerks and is now a professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis.

“I think Chief Justice Roberts is likely to approach his role... the way he has approached his judicial career to date: Doing his best to be impartial, doing his best to preserve the dignity of his judicial office,” Mr. Richards added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hairlg/article30455923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/USA-TRUMPROBERTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/emerging-from-the-shadows-the-us-chief-justice-who-will-preside-over-trumps-trial/article30455924.ece

32,2020/01/02,"Don’t expect war with Iran, says Trump","U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he does not foresee war with Tehran, after pro-Iranian demonstrators stormed the U.S. embassy in Iraq.

“I don’t see that happening,” Mr. Trump said at his holiday retreat in Florida when a reporter asked about the possibility of war with the Islamic republic.

“I like peace,” the President said before heading in to New Year’s celebrations.

U.S. officials said there were no plans to evacuate the mission, and no U.S. personnel were reported injured. Ambassador Matthew Tueller, who had been on holiday, was on his way back to the embassy.

The U.S. reinforcements “got in there very quickly,” Mr. Trump said.

“I think it’s been handled very well.”

Earlier, Mr. Trump blamed Iran for the embassy attack. “Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter.

33,2020/01/02,T.S. Eliot letters to muse to be unveiled after 60 years,"After more than 60 years spent sealed up in a library storage facility, about 1,000 letters written by poet T.S. Eliot to confidante Emily Hale will be unveiled this week, and scholars hope they will reveal the extent of a relationship that’s been speculated about for decades.

Many consider Hale to not only be his close friend, but also his muse, and they hope their correspondence will offer insight into the more intimate details about Eliot’s life and work. Students, researchers and scholars can read the letters at Princeton University Library starting Thursday.

""I think it’s perhaps the literary event of the decade,” says Anthony Cuda, an Eliot scholar and director of the T.S. Eliot International Summer School. “I don’t know of anything more awaited or significant. It’s momentous to have these letters coming out.”

Lifelong friends, Hale and Eliot exchanged letters for about 25 years beginning in 1930. The two met in 1912 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but did not rekindle their friendship until 1927. Eliot was already living in England and Hale taught drama at U.S. universities, including Scripps College in California.

In 1956, Hale donated the letters under an agreement they wouldn’t be opened until 50 years after either her or Eliot’s death, whichever came second. Eliot died in 1965. Hale died four years later.

Biographers say Eliot ordered Hale’s letters to him to be burned.

Their relationship “must have been incredibly important and their correspondence must have been remarkably intimate for him to be so concerned about the publication,” Cuda says.

T.S. Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888 and gained notoriety as a poet early in life. He was only 26 when “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” became his first professionally published poem.

Eliot’s 1939 book of whimsical poetry, “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats,” was adapted into “Cats,” the award-winning musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The play opened in London first in 1981 and then on Broadway the next year. It was then turned into a feature film starring an ensemble cast that includes Judi Dench and James Corden just released in December.

The first poem in the “Quartets” series, called “Burnt Norton,” piques the interest of enthusiasts of the poet, says Eliot scholar Frances Dickey, because of lines that suggest missed opportunities and what might have been with his muse. The poem is named after a home in England that Eliot visited with Hale in 1934.

""His relationship with her seems to be deep and meaningful and it’s a door he chose not to open,” she said.

The letters could also reveal details about Eliot’s conversion to Anglicanism, something he deeply cherished, Dickey says.

Dickey, who served as one of the editors on “The Complete Prose of T.S. Eliot"", said the poet was deeply ashamed of his marriage to his first wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, whom he was with for more than 15 years. Dickey said the letters could reveal just how close he and Hale were and if the two ever considered marriage.

""Was this an epistolary romance they would carry across the Atlantic?” Dickey said. “What role did she play in his emotional life?”

Eliot’s letters to Hale began after that first marriage ended. Whatever else she was, Hale was a link to the life Eliot had left behind in the United States as a young man, Dickey said.

""He was really thinking more about the United States and his childhood during the period where he was in correspondence with Hale,” says Dickey. “I have a feeling that having a relationship with an American woman helped him to uncover his past in a way.”

The unsealed boxes, which also contain photographs, clippings and other ephemera, were actually opened at the library’s special collections area called Firestone Library in October for cataloging and digitizing. Daniel Linke, interim head of special collections at the library, was part of the team working on the 14 boxes. He said there was very minimal, if any, reading.

""It will be the special collections equivalent of a stampede at a rock concert,” Linke said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pa0w8/article30455571.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TSELIOTLETTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ts-eliot-letters-to-muse-to-be-unveiled-after-60-years/article30455572.ece
34,2020/01/02,Kim promises to unveil a ‘new strategic weapon’,"Expressing deep frustration over stalled nuclear talks, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un warned of unspecified “shocking” action and that his country will soon reveal a new “strategic weapon” to the world as its bolsters its nuclear deterrent in face of “gangster-like” U.S. pressure.

Mr. Kim also said North Korea was no longer obligated to maintain a self-imposed suspension on the testing of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, which President Donald Trump has touted as a major diplomatic accomplishment. But Mr. Kim gave no clear indication that a resumption of such tests was impending and appeared to leave the door open for eventual negotiations.

Diplomatic stalemate

Mr. Kim has used the diplomatic stalemate to expand his military capabilities by intensifying tests of shorter-range weapons. His arsenal is now estimated to include 40-50 nuclear bombs and various delivery systems, including solid-fuel missiles designed to beat missile-defense systems and developmental ICBMs potentially capable of reaching the U.S. mainland.

Mr. Kim has also strengthened his negotiating position, moving the diplomacy closer to an arms reduction negotiation between nuclear states rather than talks that would culminate in a unilateral surrender of the weapons he sees as his strongest guarantee of survival.

Strategic weapons usually refer to nuclear-capable delivery systems such as ICBMs, but North Korea otherwise has been vague about what new arms it would display. It announced in December that it performed two “crucial” tests at its long-range rocket launch site that would further strengthen its nuclear deterrent.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the U.S. was deeply disappointed by North Korea’s threat to resume nuclear missile tests but wants peace rather than confrontation with Pyongyang.

“If Chairman Kim has reneged on the commitments he made to President Trump it’s deeply disappointing,” Mr. Pompeo said after North Korean leader declared an end to moratoriums on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests.

“We have lived up to our commitments. We continue to hold out hope that he will live up to his,” the top U.S. diplomat said.

“President Trump has taken an approach where we have tried to create a diplomatic pathway. We hope that the North Koreans will reconsider, that they will continue down that pathway.... We want peace not confrontation.” Mr. Kim’s comments were made at a meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee.

35,2020/01/02,U.N. secretary-general ‘deeply concerned’ North Korea said it could resume weapons tests,"U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is “deeply concerned” that North Korea has indicated it could resume nuclear and missile tests, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday.

“The Secretary-General very much hopes that the tests will not resume, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions. Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security and must be preserved,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said this week that there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing and that a “new strategic weapon” would be introduced in the near future.

“Diplomatic engagement is the only pathway to sustainable peace,” Ms. Dujarric also said.

U.S. President Donald Trump — who in 2018 became the first American leader to meet with a North Korean leader — said after Mr. Kim’s remarks that the leader had signed a de-nuclearisation contract and Mr. Trump thought Mr. Kim was a “man of his word.”

Mr. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the moratorium, in place since 2017, as a sign that his policy of engagement with North Korea was working.

Mr. Kim has complained the United States had continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopted cutting-edge weapons and imposed sanctions while making “gangster-like demands.”

Last month, Pyongyang warned Washington of a possible ”Christmas gift” after Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country’s nuclear arsenal.

North Korea experts said that Mr. Kim’s remarks — made during an hours-long plenum speech — were likely directed at his party, military, and government officials in North Korea, preparing the country for another period of economic hardship as it prepares for a long stalemate with the United States.

“The main points, almost certainly, were not headlines about weapons development or a possible resumption of testing,” said Robert Carlin, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

“It means preparing the economy and the people for a long-term confrontation with the U.S.,” he said, adding that the message was “no longer working for relief of sanctions but girding to live under them.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gvzvo8/article30455380.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NORTHKOREA-MISSILES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-secretary-general-deeply-concerned-north-korea-said-it-could-resume-weapons-tests/article30455381.ece
36,2020/01/02,U.S. experiences multiple shootings on New Years’,"Two people were found dead and a police officer was wounded at a housing complex in Omaha, while two men were shot and killed when a gunman opened fire at a Florida club authorities said. Seven people were also shot at bar in West Virginia on New Year's Day.

Omaha shooting

The Omaha New Year’s Eve shooting happened after officers were called to a complex known as Evans Tower shortly after 10 p.m., Omaha police Deputy Chief Scott Gray said. Two officers encountered an armed man in the hallway on the fifth floor, Gray said.

It was not immediately clear what prompted the ensuing exchange of gunfire. Police said the armed man was killed and one officer was shot in the leg. Police then found a dead woman inside an apartment, police spokesman Joe Nickerson said Wednesday.

The wounded officer was hospitalized in serious condition but expected to survive.

Mr. Nickerson said the apartment complex is for low-income residents and is operated by the Omaha Housing Authority.

Florida club firing

Two men were shot and killed when a gunman opened fire at a celebration at a Florida club, authorities said.

Media reports say as many as 250 revelers scrambled for safety after shots were fired.

Orange County Sheriff’s officials were hunting down a suspect who bolted from the scene after the 4 a.m. shooting at an after-hours club in a shopping plaza north of Orlando.

Bar shooting

News reports say at least five people were injured, some seriously, after being shot inside a bar.

Interim Police Chief Ray Cornwell of the Huntington Police Department told local news stations that the shooting happened at the Kulture Hookah Bar in Huntingdon.

According to WOWK-TV, more than a dozen shell casings were found outside the bar and in a parking lot across the street.

37,2020/01/02,Militiamen withdraw from U.S. Embassy but Iraq tensions linger,"Iran-backed militiamen withdrew from the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Wednesday after two days of clashes with American security forces, but U.S.-Iran tensions remain high and could spill over into further violence.

The withdrawal followed calls from the government and senior militia leaders. It ended a two-day crisis marked by the breach of the largest and one of the most heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic missions in the world. The attack prompted the Pentagon to send hundreds of additional troops to the Middle East.

In an orchestrated assault, hundreds of militiamen and their supporters broke into the embassy compound, destroying a reception area, smashing windows and spraying graffiti on walls to protest U.S. airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia over the weekend that killed 25 fighters.

The U.S. blamed the militia for a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base in the northern city of Kirkuk last week that killed a U.S. contractor.

The protesters set up a tent camp overnight and on Wednesday set fire to the reception area and hurled stones at U.S. Marines guarding the compound, who responded with tear gas. There were no injuries on either side and no American staff were evacuated from the compound.

The Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella group of state-allied militias - many backed by Iran - called on its supporters to withdraw in response to an appeal by the Iraqi government, saying “your message has been received.”

By late afternoon the tents had been taken down and the protesters relocated to the opposite side of the Tigris River, outside the so-called Green Zone housing government offices and foreign embassies. U.S. Apache helicopters circled overhead.

“After achieving the intended aim, we pulled out from this place triumphantly,” said Fadhil al-Gezzi, a militia supporter. “We rubbed America’s nose in the dirt.”

Kataeb Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militia targeted by the U.S. airstrikes, initially refused to leave but later bowed to demands to disperse. The militia is separate from the Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon, though both are backed by Iran.

""We don’t care about these planes that are flying over the heads of the picketers. Neither do we care about the news that America will bring Marines,” said Mohammed Mohy, a spokesman for Kataeb Hezbollah. “On the contrary, this shows a psychological defeat and a big mental breakdown that the American administration is suffering from,” he said, before withdrawing from the area.

The violence came as Iran and its allies across the region have faced unprecedented mass protests in recent months and heavy U.S. sanctions have cratered Iran’s economy.

Iraq has been gripped by anti-government protests since October fuelled by anger at widespread corruption and economic mismanagement, as well as Iran’s heavy influence over the country’s affairs. Those protesters were not involved in the embassy attack.

President Donald Trump blamed Iran for the attack on the embassy and the Pentagon dispatched an infantry battalion of about 750 soldiers to the Middle East. A U.S. official familiar with the decision said they would go to Kuwait.

Iran denied involvement in the attack on the embassy. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was quoted by media as saying that “if the Islamic Republic makes a decision to confront any country, it will do it directly.”

Iran later summoned the Swiss charge d’affaires, who represents American interests in Tehran, to protest what it said was war-mongering by U.S. officials.

Public consular operations at the embassy were suspended and future appointments cancelled, it said in a statement.

Tensions have steadily risen since Trump withdrew the U.S. from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and embarked on a campaign of maximum pressure through economic sanctions. Iran has responded by abandoning some of its commitments under the deal.

U.S. officials have blamed Iran for the sabotage of oil tankers in the Persian Gulf and a drone attack on Saudi oil facilities in September that caused a spike in world oil prices. But the Trump administration has not responded with direct military action, apparently fearing a wider conflict.

The U.S. has sent more than 14,000 additional troops to the Gulf region since May in response to concerns about Iranian aggression. At the time of the attack, the U.S. had about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mainly to train Iraqi forces and help them combat Islamic State extremists.

The U.S. and Iran have vied for influence over Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. Iran has close ties to Iraq’s Shiite majority and major political factions, and its influence has steadily grown since then.

Iran helped to mobilize tens of thousands of mostly Shiite militiamen to battle the Islamic State group when it stormed across northern and western Iraq in 2014 as the armed forces collapsed. The U.S. and Iran both provided vital aid to Iraqi forces, who eventually declared victory over the extremists in December 2017.

The political influence of the Popular Mobilization Forces has risen in recent years, and their allies dominate the parliament and the government. That has made them the target of the anti-government protesters, who have attacked Iranian diplomatic missions and the local headquarters of parties affiliated with the militias across southern Iraq.

They have also set up a sprawling protest camp in central Baghdad, and for weeks have been trying to enter the Green Zone. Iraqi security forces have beaten them back with tear gas and live ammunition, killing hundreds.

The militiamen and their supporters, however, were able to quickly enter the Green Zone and mass in front of the embassy, with little if any resistance from authorities.

Iraq’s government vehemently condemned the airstrikes on the militia, saying it violated national sovereignty. But Iran and its allies might have also seen the attack as a way of diverting attention from the anti-government protests.

""Iran has been trying to provoke the U.S. into helping it solve its Iraq problem,” said the Crisis Group, an international think tank. “The Trump administration, by responding to the attacks in Kirkuk and elsewhere with airstrikes, has obliged.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5r9mz2/article30454576.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IRAQUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/militiamen-withdraw-from-us-embassy-but-iraq-tensions-linger/article30454577.ece
38,2020/01/02,"Benjamin Netanyahu seeks immunity, buying time until after vote","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday he would seek immunity from corruption charges, likely delaying any trial until after March elections, when he hopes to have a majority coalition that will shield him from prosecution.

Mr. Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust. After failing to assemble a governing majority following back-to-back elections last year, he will get a third shot at remaining in office in March.

Wednesday’s announcement essentially turns the upcoming election into a referendum on whether Mr. Netanyahu should be granted immunity and remain in office, or step down and stand trial. A recent poll indicated that a majority of Israelis oppose giving him immunity.

In a nationally televised address, Mr. Netanyahu repeated his assertion that he is the victim of an unfair conspiracy, lashing out at prosecutors, the media and his political enemies. Claiming credit for a series of economic and security achievements on his watch, he said he would seek to invoke the law that would protect him from prosecution as long as he remains in office.

""In order to continue to lead Israel to great achievements, I intend to approach the speaker of the Knesset in accordance with chapter 4C of the law, in order to fulfill my right, my duty and my mission to continue to serve you for the future of Israel,” he said.

Normally, a request for immunity would need to be approved by the Parliament’s House Committee and then submitted to a full vote. But the House Committee doesn’t exist because a government was never formed after September’s election. Court proceedings cannot begin until the question of immunity is settled.

The Opposition Blue and White party said it will seek to form the House Committee before the March election to take up the question of immunity. But it remains unclear whether it will be able to move forward. Parliament Speaker Yuli Edelstein, a member of Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud Party, said he would hold talks on the matter next week.

The Blue and White leader, former military chief Benny Gantz, said it was a “sad day.”

""I never imagined that we would see the day that the prime minister of Israel would avoid standing before the law and the justice system,” he said. “Today it’s clear what we’re fighting for. Netanyahu knows he’s guilty.”

Mr. Netanyahu said he was not evading justice and still plans to go to court to fight the “fabricated accusations.”

""The law is meant to ensure that elected officials can serve the people according to the will of the people,” he said.

Should Mr. Netanyahu succeed in assembling a 61-seat majority in favor of immunity, he would avoid prosecution.

But that still appears unlikely after the March vote, with most polls predicting another split decision that would leave Likud and Blue and White deadlocked, with neither able to secure a parliamentary majority.

The uncertainty means it could be many months before a new government is formed, leaving the question of immunity on hold with Mr. Netanyahu remaining in office.

The indictment, on charges of trading political and regulatory favors for positive press coverage and accepting lavish gifts from wealthy supporters, marked the culmination of three long-running investigations.

Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed the allegations as an “attempted coup” and has vowed to battle them from the Prime Minister’s office.

Mr. Netanyahu is desperate to remain in office while he fights the charges. The powerful position would allow him to rally public opposition to what he says is an unfair witch hunt. He can also use the office to grant political favors to allies who agree to vote in favor of immunity.

The question of immunity is just one of the hurdles Mr. Netanyahu faces.

While Israeli law does not require a sitting Prime Minister to resign after being charged with a crime, it is vague about whether an indicted politician could be tapped to form a new government after new elections.

On Tuesday, Israel’s Supreme Court began discussions on the matter. If the court decides Mr. Netanyahu is ineligible, it could potentially bring his three-decade political career to an abrupt end after the March election.

The court gave no indication on when it would issue a ruling on the politically sensitive case. Disqualifying Mr. Netanyahu would deeply divide the nation and precipitate a legal crisis over separations of power.

The Prime Minister has long accused judicial and law enforcement officials of trying to drive him from office and repeated his claim on Wednesday night that only the voters can choose who will lead the country.

An opinion poll conducted this week by the iPanel and Midgam research firms found that 51% of respondents oppose granting Mr. Netanyahu immunity, with 33% in favor. The poll questioned 507 people and had a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.

Mr. Netanyahu has been in power for more than a decade and is Israel’s longest-serving leader. His refusal to make concessions to the Palestinians and his tough stance toward Iran have made him a hero of the political right, which regularly wins more than half the vote.

But after April elections, Avigdor Lieberman, the secular right-wing leader of the Yisrael Beitenu party, refused to join Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition. Lieberman has since emerged as a kingmaker, demanding a national unity government with Likud and Blue and White.

The three parties held several rounds of talks after September’s vote, but were unable to reach an agreement on a power-sharing deal.

Mr. Netanyahu’s legal problems were at the heart of the deadlock. Blue and White refuses to sit in a government led by an indicted Prime Minister.

The crisis has had little if any impact on daily life, as Mr. Netanyahu has continued to lead a caretaker government that provides public services. But the Trump administration has delayed the release of its long-anticipated Mideast peace plan until the political uncertainty is resolved.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/7ejjij/article30454207.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISRAELPOLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/benjamin-netanyahu-seeks-immunity-buying-time-until-after-vote/article30454208.ece
39,2020/01/02,A round-the-year guide to engaging with nature,"Blessed with rich and varied habitats, Delhi-NCR is very rewarding when it comes to both flora and fauna. The city caters to the needs of beautiful creatures in possibly every season. In summer, the resident birds breed in their preferred habitats; the monsoon attracts several birds and insects, and the winter is well known for migratory birds. Delhi's rich biodiversity is mainly due to the different kinds of habitats it celebrates, such as scrublands and deciduous forests in the Aravllis and the Ridge; wetlands like Okhla Bird Sanctuary, and small grasslands, sometimes found adjacent to wetlands and scrublands. Each habitat is home to both generalist species as well as habitat-specialists. No wonder then that Delhi is an avifauna marvel and the second most bird-rich capital city in the world, after Nairobi in Kenya.

See the Kulu Tree flowering

Once imagined to have been a part of the Delhi Ridge, the magnificent Kulu has almost disappeared from the city, but the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurugram has a few blooming specimens. The tree stands out with its white chipping trunk, its branches spreading upward like that of a dancer's arms mid-pose. It displays khaki-coloured flower clusters, deep red-brown on the outside and green on the inside. The tree is also known to have medicinal uses. Locally, it is also called 'Kateela' or 'Kateera'. Aravalli Biodiversity Park, once an extensively mined and exploited region, has now grown into a small forest, with flora native to the Aravalli Range. It is no less than a marvel.

Experience a Murmuration of Rosy Starlings

Lodhi Garden, with its historical monuments and old trees is where large flocks of migratory Rosy Starlings head in March-April. They are celebrated for their incredible aerial display known as a murmuration, where they fly together in large groups and change direction at the same time, avoiding a collision with one another. It's a sight so incredible it makes you fall in love with birds. If you like garden-hopping, drive to Nehru Park to see the Flame of the Forest, called Dhak or Palash, locally. It's a survivor, withstanding heat, frost, drought, and poor soil conditions. The bright orange flowers yield an orange dye, once used as a Holi colour. You'll also find a large tree near the entrance of Teen Murti Bhawan.

Spot the Cinnamon Bittern

The onset of wet weather in the city is greeted by the arrival of an elusive bird called the Cinnamon Bittern, at the wetlands here. The bittern is fairly big and is cinnamon-coloured bird. Okhla Bird Sanctuary in Noida is perhaps one of the richest wetland-reed habitats in Delhi NCR. In July- August, you may often see these beautiful birds shying away in reeds or flying from one patch to another.

Enter a reforested zone

The Yamuna Biodiversity Park, in Wazirabad, is located on the Yamuna riverfront and has been developed by the DDA and scientists of the University of Delhi into a haven for birds. Several migratory ducks (from Europe and other parts of Asia) like the Common Pochard come in winter to the wetlands. A diving or dabbling duck, fish, molluscs and aquatic plants are its primary source food.

Visit a wetland

Sultanpur National Park in Sultanpur village, Gurugram, was first declared a Bird Sanctuary in 1972 when Peter Jackson, a prominent British ornithologist approached the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, for the need to protect the place for its Avifauna brilliance. Later in 1983, it was upgraded to a National Park. Before concretisation and the construction of drainage, the area was naturally waterlogged. Though this is now artificially maintained, it still attracts thousands of migratory birds like the Brown Goose, the Common Teal, the Northern Shoveler that flock together and spend this winter in the rich habitat.

40,2020/01/02,Thiruvananthapuram’s eco-friendly choices for a green tomorrow,"New Year's is a time for resolutions. But going beyond the personal, perhaps, it’s also a decade to turn over a new leaf with collective pledges for the benefit of the very planet we inhabit. As another decade dawns, MetroPlus takes a look at some green initiatives that have been providing the city and its residents a breather from growing pollution levels and others set in motion this year.

Bag the habit

Carrying your own bag when you go shopping has become a habit for most residents. Although the City Corporation announced a ban on plastic bags in 2017 and decided to launch paper and cloth bags as the alternative, the project materialised only this year. Currently cloth bag manufacturing units are functioning at Muttada, Vallakkadavu, Valiyavila, Pongummoodu, Kunnanpara, and Nettayam. Nearly 150 Kudumbasree workers have been trained. Meanwhile, if you are looking for trendy cloth and jute bags, there are plenty of options.

The last straw

Move over plastic straws and single-use plastic disposables. Several restaurants, juice outlets and hotels in the city have switched over to disposable and eco-friendly alternatives in line with the green protocol envisaged by the government, which tries to reduce plastics and trash. Plastic straws have been replaced by paper straws. In place of plastic spoons and plates, there are wooden spoons, areca leaf plates and containers. And glass bottles instead of plastic ones. Banana leaves, earthen plates and bowls and steel glasses have become ubiquitous in many hotels. Since none of these products are manufactured locally, there has been a rise in the number of vendors who bring them from outside the state.

Clean capital

The City Corporation opened a dry waste segregated collection hub at Sasthamangalam in June followed by another one near University College. Seven boxes have been kept in which people can deposit plastic, broken glass, clothes, metal, paper, footwear/bags and miscellaneous objects. In addition to this, dry waste is collected at the civic body’s 45 material recovery facilities and resource recovery centres in its 25 circles as per a calendar. While plastic is collected at these centres on all days, there are fixed days to hand over old sandals/bags, broken glass, e-waste, rubber and tyre, medicine strips, old clothes, coconut husk, shell and timber. The Corporation has also launched an app, Smart Trivandrum, which has details about waste management, recycling facilities, periodical clean-ups and the like. Citizens can also report littering on the app.

Water world

We often forget that the capital city is built on the banks of the river Karamana that runs through its villages and towns before emptying into the Arabian sea. Moreover, with ponds, backwaters, rivers, lakes and a long coastline, the city is rich in water resources. Perhaps that is also the reason why most of us have been careless with this precious bounty. Countless ponds have been filled, canals and rivers turned into sewage dumps and the sea filled with plastic. However, at present, efforts are made on a war footing to preserve, protect and revive these water bodies. Thanks to a number of organisations and the support of the government and the Corporation, the water resources in the district are getting a new life with ponds being revived and rivers, lakes and oceans being rid of plastic, sewage and other pollutants. It is a huge challenge and its success is crucial to the city’s survival into another century.

Walking the talk

Started in 2012 by Anita Sharma in memory of her mother, Dr Thankam, a botanist, Tree Walk has introduced its participants to the tree wealth in the city and made them aware of why we need to preserve this green cover. Along with other enthusiasts, the architect of Tree Walk extended their work to schools and colleges. By documenting the flora in the city, Anita ensured that the habitat was not ignored by those changing the face of the city.

House of bamboo

The city-based Centre of Science and Technology for Rural Development (Costford) with 13 branches in Kerala believes in the Gandhian principle that materials used for constructing a house must be available within a radius of five miles. Costford, of which master architect Laurie Baker was one of the founders, is promoting the use of indigneous materials such as treated bamboo, mud, stone and recycled materials to fight global warming, prevent destruction of the environment and reduce the carbon footprint. Recently, Costford unveiled a bamboo structure at Vilappilsala that is part of the Laurie Baker Centre for Habitat Studies.

Aye e-auto

Neem is deemed an efficient oxygen purifier. It’s a fitting nomenclature that Neyyattinkara-based public sector venture Kerala Automobiles Limited (KAL) chose to call its ‘green autos’ Kerala Neem G – the first electric autorickshaws to hit city roads. Fifteen battery-powered three-wheelers is to make “savaari” this week as part of Smart City project, says Karamana Hari, chairman of KAL. The e-autos has a battery capacity for about 100 km per full charging, bringing the “mileage” to 50 paise per kilometre. Apart from enabling provisions for handy charging at homes, the government is looking at a proposal to set up charging stations at auto stands.

Protocol in effect

Green protocol is about reducing waste generation and the City Corporation has been strictly implementing it at major events in the city, which include festivals conducted at places of worship and functions and fetes organised by the authorities. Government offices and the District Collectorate have also joined the bandwagon. From this year onwards, the civic body is renting out steel plates, tumblers and other utensils for receptions, meetings and gatherings. Green Army, a team of volunteers, is a key group that implements the green protocol and creates awareness about decentralised waste management that was launched as part of the Corporation’s ‘My City, Beautiful City’ campaign.

Urban jungle

Right in the middle of the city is this micro forest. The Miyawaki forest on five cents at Kanakakkunnu has 426 saplings of 120 species. The unique afforestation concept popularised by Japanese botanist Akira Miyawaki is an initiative of the Department of Tourism implemented with the help of many private and public players led by Invia Multimedia. Two more forests are coming up at EMS Academy at Vilappilsala and Government LPS Chenkottukonam.

41,2020/01/02,Sugar output drops by close to a third,"The country’s sugar production has fallen sharply by 30.22% to 7.79 million tonne (MT) in the first three months of current marketing year ending September, but ex-mill prices have remained stable so far, helping mills clear cane payment to farmers on time, ISMA said.

However, sugar exports are happening at a good pace, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), quoting market data, said, adding mills have so far contracted for shipment of over 2.5 MT of sugar under the government’s MAEQ (Maximum Admissible Export Quantity Quota).

Ex-mill sugar prices have remained steady in the range of ₹3,250-3,350 per quintal in north India and at ₹3,100-3,250 per quintal in south India, ISMA added.

“Since the Centre has not increased the fair and remunerative price (FRP) for 2019-20 as also State governments like Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Punjab have not hiked the state advised price (SAP), ex-mill prices remain stable and mills are in a better position to be able to pay cane prices to the farmers on time,” ISMA said.

Releasing the latest production data, it said the country’s total sugar production has dropped to 7.79 MT till December 2019 from 11.17 million tonne in the same period of the 2018-19 marketing year (October-September).

In its first estimate, ISMA had pegged sugar production lower at 26 MT this year from 33.16 MT in 2018-19.

Sugar production in Maharashtra — the country’s largest sugar producing State — dropped to 1.65 MT till December 2019 against 4.45 MT in the same period last year, the data showed.

Sugar recovery

The average sugar recovery in Maharashtra has declined to 10% from 10.5% achieved in the year-ago period due to loss of sucrose content in the flood-affected sugarcane crop.

About 137 sugar mills were in operation till December 2019 against 189 mills in the same period last year.

Production in U.P. rises

Production in Uttar Pradesh, the country’s second largest producing State, rose to 3.31 MT so far compared to 3.10 MT a year ago.

On exports, ISMA said the government is in the process of reviewing actual exports made by mills against MAEQ during October—December 2019 quarter, and has already announced in the policy to reallocate unexported quota to the sugar mills that have exported and are willing to take additional quota beyond their MAEQ.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/sugar-output-drops-by-close-to-a-third/article30463576.ece
42,2020/01/02,India’s Arabica output at all-time low,"India’s Arabica production has hit an all-time low this coffee-picking season, which commenced a fortnight ago.

Coffee Board chairman M.S. Boje Gowda said this year’s Arabica yield would fall more than 50% after the torrential rains, floods and landslides during August-September last year washed away a sizeable chunk of plantations and destroyed coffee plants in Chikkamagaluru, Hassan, Kodagu and Wayanad districts.

“Plantations were hit by heavy rains, floods and landslides. The entire top soil got washed away. Farmers didn’t have funds to maintain their gardens or buy manure. [So], the crop is poor and the quantity too low this season,’’ he said.

Most Arabica farmers are reporting a production decline of 50%, while the exact size of the output for this year will be known by end of January. Five years ago, India’s Arabica production was 1.5 lakh tonnes. It fell to 80,000 tonnes last year, he said. H.T. Pramod, former president, Karnataka Planters’ Association and a Chikkamagaluru farmer, said, “This is the worst Arabica crop we have seen. The berry quantity per plant is too low. We used to get at least 300 kg of parchment coffee per acre. We are getting only some 100 kg this season.’’",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/otoib9/article30463552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THBUCOFFEE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/indias-arabica-output-at-all-time-low/article30463553.ece
43,2020/01/02,Promoters of NDTV move HC in SEBI case,"NDTV’s promoters Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy have moved the Bombay High Court, challenging a show-cause notice issued to them by the SEBI in 2018 for alleged violation of insider trading regulations.

The court, while stating that it will pass orders on January 6, said the Roys could “face the notice” and attend hearings before SEBI. The petition sought that the court set aside the notice and direct SEBI to allow the Roys to inspect all the documents, records and internal files and notings on which the regulator had relied before issuing the same.

The capital market regulator issued the notice on August 31, 2018, accusing the Roys of trading shares of NDTV while in possession of “unpublished price sensitive information”. The notice accused them of violation of the “Prohibition of Insider Trading Regulations“.

The petition said the notice was “arbitrary, unreasonable and issued in gross abuse of power”. SEBI offered no evidence or documentation to substantiate the allegations, the Roys said in the plea.

It came up for hearing before a division bench of justices SC Dharmadhikari and RI Chagla on Thursday.

After hearing the brief arguments, the bench said the petitioners could face the notice and attend hearings before SEBI.

“Face the notice. If as you say there is no material, then it (notice) will fall on the ground,” the court said.The judges said they would pass appropriate orders on the petition on January 6.

The notice pertains to a proposed reorganisation and restructuring of NDTV into news-related businesses and investments in “beyond news businesses” in 2008. “The proposal was eventually not implemented,” the petition said.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/promoters-ofndtv-move-hc-in-sebi-case/article30463530.ece

Notwithstanding the improvement in operating conditions during December, companies were cautious regarding the annual outlook of 2020, and this could have an impact on job creation and investment in the year, the survey said.

The IHS Markit India Manufacturing PMI rose from 51.2 in November to 52.7 in December, registering the ‘joint-strongest’ improvement in 10 months.

“Factories benefited from a rebound in demand and responded by scaling up production to the greatest extent since May. There were also renewed increases in input purchasing and employment during December,” said Pollyanna de Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.

ONGC signed contracts for the seven blocks at an event where Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and other Ministry officials were also present.

“These seven blocks are adding exploration acreage of 18,510 sq. km spread over three sedimentary basins of India and have a resource potential of approximately 33 billion barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas,” he said.

The latest licensing round for allowing companies to explore for oil and natural gas was held on revamped terms but saw only ONGC and Oil India Ltd. participating. ONGC put in bids for all seven blocks on offer, while Oil India put in an offer for one block at the close of bidding on October 31, 2019.

ONGC was the sole bidder for five blocks in Madhya Pradesh and one in West Bengal and it was locked in competition with Oil India for one block in Rajasthan.

ONGC walked away with all the seven blocks on superior bids. According to the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), seven on-land blocks were on offer in the fourth round of Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) with an area of about 18,510 sq km.

“With the culmination of Bid Round IV today (Thursday), we have awarded 94 blocks under the exploration policy in a very short time span of two and a half years. These 94 blocks cover an exploratory area of approximately 1,36,800 sq. km over 16 Indian sedimentary basins,” Mr. Pradhan said.

“Investors in the 94 blocks have committed 29,270 line km of 2D seismic survey and 43,272 sq. km of 3D seismic survey [and] 369 numbers of exploratory wells. This will generate investment... of $2.35 billion (about ₹16,450 crore) over the next 3/4 years in the exploratory activities alone.”",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i0bu77/article30463204.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THBUOIL,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ongc-wins-all-7-oil-gas-blocks/article30463205.ece

Air pollution, women’s safety and economic slowdown were the next biggest concerns that consumers reported.

Consumers from Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bangalore, Chennai and small towns such as Patiala, Udaipur, Haridwar, Shimla, Durg, Dimapur, Darjeeling, Gandhinagar, Raigarh, Navsari, Guntur, Mysore, Vellore and Belgaum were interviewed for the study.

Respondents in metros said health of elders (47%), spending more time with families (47%) and improving mental well-being (45%) were critical. Going forward, these priorities will shift towards career and business growth (43%), increasing savings for future (42%) and focusing more on children’s education (40%), as per the study.

At the same, in smaller towns, the study found, consumers prioritised career and business growth (46%) followed by improving mental well-being (44%) and spending more time with family (44%).

In near future, the consumers from smaller towns want to focus more on children’s education (43%), savings for the future (42%) and they want to pick up a new skill (42%), found the Titan study.

In a LinkedIn post, Mr. Maheshwari spoke about the need to re-shape the education ecosystem, re-train talent for tomorrow, and the need for re-imagining our own transformation.

A large majority of those who work have CXO aspirations. In just two years, each of us would require different skill sets to be in the running to be a CXO, and more so if one was already in the C-suite, he wrote.

“I meet CXOs across geographies and industry verticals each week. The consistent topic that stands out in all conversations is their aspiration to acquire more digital skills. The conversation then is about how this movement can be amplified 360 degree in their organisations, and how they can lead this within their own leadership teams. Increasing tech intensity among leaders and the workforce is now an imperative,” his post read.

Technological disruption, demographic changes and the evolving nature of work were making new demands of the workforce, he said. “The task is clear. We must narrow the skills gap now. Skill development is super critical for India’s growth curve to scale sustainably and inclusively.”

Emphasising the importance of reshaping the education for the future, Mr. Maheshwari wrote, “We must start early. Students in early-year classrooms now are different from the preceding generation. Their world is a finely integrated blend of digital and physical. They don’t learn how to use technology. Rather they use technology to learn.”

“Digital literacy today is a gateway to employability. But that’s clearly not enough. Our current workplace demands digital-fluency, and in some cases, even digital-mastery.

“We are here to improve efficiency in logistics in this market. Both drivers and our customers are benefiting by less down time and faster delivery of goods,” he said.

He said during research phase in the Indian market, the company found that most of the time the drivers were underutilised and not doing good business. “We are trying to address that,” Mr. Tsang said.

He said users now-a-days require faster and a more on-demand approach on every service, just like instant food delivery by Swiggy/Zomato, and personal transport like Uber/Ola.

Mr. Tsang said since most of the company’s users (clients) were SME owners, small factories or distributors, the whole focus is to provide more convenience and cost saving to solve their logistic problems.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/lalamove-chalks-out-plans-to-expand-in-india/article30462549.ece
54,2020/01/02,"HAL, Wipro enter into pact to develop aerospace components","The public sector aerospace and defence firm HAL and Wipro 3D, the metal additive manufacturing (AM) business of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, have signed a pact to design, develop, prove out, manufacture and repair aerospace components using metal additive technology.

As a per a media release from HAL, the initiative would focus on development, prove out and production of aerospace applications, including MRO, using metal additive manufacturing. Prove-outs and certification of components developed using metal 3D printing was a key element of this co-operation, it said.

Shekhar Shrivastava, CEO, Bangalore Complex, HAL, said, “This collaboration between HAL and Wipro 3D will create a unique synergy of capabilities that can accelerate the adoption of metal additive manufacturing in aerospace in India. Qualification of parts for aerospace is challenging as it would require prove out and extensive testing followed by certification by regulatory authorities which may also include flight testing.”

Globally, the aerospace industry has been one of the foremost adopters of metal 3D printing due to the benefits of faster design iterations, weight and geometry optimisation, performance improvement and flexible manufacturing.

“The MoU will provide significant manufacturing and MRO flexibility and freedom to existing, upcoming, and legacy aerospace programmes,”' said Ajay Parikh, Vice President and Business Head, Wipro 3D.

55,2020/01/02,Ghosn carried spare French passport while out on bail in Japan,"Japanese authorities allowed ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday, shedding some light on how he managed a dramatic escape to Lebanon.

Prosecutors on Thursday raided the Tokyo residence of the former Nissan Motor Co Ltd chairman, NHK also reported.

Mr. Ghosn, one of the world's best-known executives, has become Japan's most famous fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a “rigged” justice system.

The businessman, who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship, was smuggled out of Tokyo by a private security company days ago, the culmination of a plan that was crafted over three months, Reuters has reported.

Mr. Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East. He enjoyed an outpouring of support from Lebanon after his arrest.

Japanese authorities have not officially commented on Mr. Ghosn's disappearance. Government offices are shut this week for the New Year holiday.

Officials in Lebanon said Mr. Ghosn entered legally on a French passport. But one of Mr. Ghosn's Japanese lawyers has said the lawyers were still in possession of all three of his passports, under the terms of his bail.

However, Mr. Ghosn had been issued a spare French passport, NHK said, citing unidentified sources, and carried it in the months before his departure.

NHK, citing the sources, said he had been “obliged” to carry the passport with him since May, without elaborating on the reason. Foreigners in Japan are required to carry government-issued identification cards or passports at all times.

NHK said his lawyers applied to have the terms of his bail changed so that he could carry a passport in a locked case.

The key to the locked case in which the spare passport was kept was held by his lawyers, NHK said.

No one was immediately available for comment at the office of his lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, the French embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/x07xg5/article30440605.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THCARLOSGHOSN,https://www.thehindu.com/business/ghosn-carried-spare-french-passport-while-out-on-bail-in-japan/article30458490.ece
56,2020/01/02,"NCLAT decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry a recipe for disaster, Tatas tell Supreme Court","The multi-billion salt-to-software conglomerate, Tata Sons Private Limited, on Thursday appealed to the Supreme Court saying the December 18 decision of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to re-instate Cyrus Mistry as its Chairman is a blow to corporate democracy and rights of the Board of Directors.

The 180-page appeal said the tribunal crossed its jurisdiction by terming the appointment of incumbent N. Chandrasekaran as illegal while restoring Mr. Mistry as Chairman.

Mr. Mistry’s tenure as Chairman and Director of Tata Sons had expired in March 2017. The NCLAT decision to restore him to his “original position” for the “rest of his tenure” is contrary to company law, a recipe for disaster and sets a dangerous precedent in law.

Besides, Mr. Mistry had never sought his reinstatement. The NCLAT had gone beyond its jurisdiction, the appeal by Tata Sons, filed through Karanjawala & Co, said.

‘Against public interest’

To restore Mr. Mistry for his remaining term, without noticing that the term had come to an end is a recipe for disaster, for the reason that it would create unnecessary confusion in the working of companies and lead to more conflict, the appeal said.

The companies are large corporations having many subsidiaries and the Tata Group employs half a million people and contributes substantially to the economy of the country. Any shadow over the management of any of these companies puts public interest in jeopardy, the appeal said.

A majority of the Board of Directors at the Tata Sons voted for Mr. Mistry’s replacement as Chairman on October 24, 2016 after losing confidence in him. He was again removed as the Director of Tata Sons on February 6, 2017 following the procedure that applies to corporate appointments. “Instead of bringing to bear an approach that would be consistent with corporate democracy and the right of the shareholders to exercise their votes in the manner they consider appropriate, the NCLAT took upon itself to go into various issues alien to such consideration… NCLAT imported principles from the realm of public law and eschewed relevant principles that apply to corporate democracy, which are based upon the right of the shareholder to cast a vote. No reasons were given on how the process of replacement and removal was wrong and illegal,” the appeal argued.

The NCLAT’s conclusions are based on an error that the Tata Sons continued to be a public company. The areas of the tribunal’s enquiries were clearly beyond its realm.

Besides, the appeal said the NCLAT imposed an “unwarranted and unsolicited consultative process” upon the Tata Group by requiring it to consult minority stakeholder Shapoorji Pallonji Group before appointing anyone as Executive Chairman. Mr. Mistry is a scion of the Shapoorji Pallonji Group.

“The judgment has re-written the Articles of Tata Sons, where the majority shareholders are subject to the minority, capsizing the fundamental rule of corporate democracy,” the appeal said.

Further, it challenged the restraint imposed by NCLAT on Ratan N. Tata and the nominee of the ‘Tata Trusts’ “from taking any decision in advance which requires majority decision of the Board of Directors or in the Annual General Meeting”. It said such a direction was “wholly nebulous and seeks to stifle the exercise of rights of the shareholders and board members, resulting in their disenfranchisement which cripples corporate democracy”.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/kg03rq/article30458144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TATAANDMISTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/business/tata-sons-moves-supreme-court-against-nclat-order-on-cyrus-mistry/article30458194.ece
57,2020/01/02,Asom Gana Parishad workers question leaders on CAA,"Members of the Asom Gana Parishad, a ruling regional ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Assam, on Thursday questioned their leaders for supporting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Party workers virtually laid siege to the AGP headquarters in Guwahati and pointed out that their leaders’ decision to be on the same page as the BJP on CAA has made them ‘lose face’ in the State.

They were critical of three Ministers — Atul Bora, Keshab Mahanta and Phani Bhushan Choudhury — for backing the CAA. Mr. Bora is also the AGP president.

The trio also came under attack for criticising former Chief Minister and AGP founder-president Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, who has taken an anti-CAA stand. “The party leadership has betrayed the people of Assam by supporting an Act that threatens their existence,” the former CM had said a few days ago.

Maoists blamed

Assam BJP president Ranjeet K. Dass blamed the violent start to the anti-CAA stir in the State on Maoists and the Popular Front of India (PFI), while informing newspersons about the programmes undertaken by the party to remove ‘misconceptions’ about the citizenship law.

“The torching of the house of BJP legislator Binod Hazarika at Chabua (Tinsukia district) and government buildings was done by the Maoists through the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti,” he said, adding that the authorities have been tracking active members of PFI trying to start communal riots.

Yechury visit

The State unit of the CPI(M) said party general secretary Sitaram Yechury would be addressing an anti-CAA rally in Guwahati on Friday morning.

“The CPI(M) and other Left-democratic parties have been alongside the students and common people who have come together irrespective of race, language and religion to oppose CAA for saving secularism and democracy in India from fascist forces,” the party’s State secretary Deben Bhattacharya said.

Meanwhile, the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad has announced a series of anti-CAA programmes beginning January 4. Opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s expected visit for the inauguration of the third Khelo India Youth Games in Guwahati on January 10, the organisation said it would observe January 11 as black day across Assam.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/asom-gana-parishad-workers-question-leaders-on-caa/article30463779.ece

61,2020/01/02,"Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s 'Hum Dekhenge': We will not determine if poem hurt sentiments, says IIT-Kanpur panel head","An investigating committee formed by the IIT-Kanpur is not going to probe whether the recital of Hum Dekhenge, a poem by Pakistani revolutionary Faiz Ahmad Faiz, at a campus protest last month had hurt sentiments or not.

“One of the complaints was regarding the poem, that it hurt sentiments,” the IIT’s Deputy Director, Manindra Agrawal, told The Hindu. He said multiple complaints had been received from two groups of students and faculty, those who supported the protest and those against it.

“Of course, we are not going to determine whether sentiments were hurt or not,” he clarified when asked what exactly the panel was investigating. Instead, the six-member panel would investigate if there was any “deliberate mischief”, he said.

Dr. Agrawal’s comments come in the wake of widespread outrage spurred by reports that the panel would determine if the poem was “anti-Hindu,” “anti-national” or had “hurt Hindu sentiments.”

The poem

The poem at the heart of the controversy was written in 1979 as a form of protest against Pakistani military dictator Zia-ul-Haq. These are the lines that have caused heartburn: “Jab arz-e-Khuda ke kaabe se, sab buut uthwaaye jaayenge...Bus naam rahega Allah ka...” On a video of the December 17 protest held in solidarity with students of Jamia Millia Islamia, the English subtitles read: “When from Allah’s place, all idols will be removed... only Allah’s name will remain...” Other translations render those lines as, “From the abode of God when icons of falsehood will be taken out...only the name will survive...”

“Some students felt that the words of the poem were objectionable. They saw it as being linked to the history of Muslim invaders who came to India and destroyed Hindu temples,” said Dr. Agrawal. “But there is another aspect to this. Faiz did not mean this literally. He was alluding to something else.”

Commentators have pointed to the allegorical nature of the poem, through which the Communist Faiz spoke out against a dictator using conservative Islam as a tool of repression. The poem became a popular protest anthem following its 1986 rendition by Pakistani ghazal singer Iqbal Bano.

“Each perspective has some truth to it. Someone who has no background in literature, who has not studied Faiz in depth, may not understand the allusions when he encounters those words, may take them at face value. All parties need to be respectful of both viewpoints,” explained Dr. Agrawal.

Report in ten days

There were also complaints that the protest was illegal and that posts on social media caused fear and a sense of intimidation among students from both sides of the divide. “Clearly, there was provocation which made people agitated. Was it deliberately provoked? Was it planned to cause disharmony? That is one of the things we will be looking at,” he said. “If we find evidence of deliberate mischief, there will be further action.”

As an initial step, the panel is talking to all groups concerned and has pushed them to take down social media posts on the issue. It will submit a report in the next ten days.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uif7xx/article30463710.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03MANINDRAAGRAWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/faiz-ahmad-faizs-hum-dekhenge-we-will-not-determine-if-poem-hurt-sentiments-says-iit-kanpur-panel-head/article30463711.ece
62,2020/01/02,Mehbooba’s daughter claims she was ‘detained’,"Iltija Mufti, daughter of the former chief minister and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti, on Thursday alleged that she had been detained in her Srinagar residence and barred from visiting the graveyard where her grandfather Mufti Mohammad Sayeed is buried. The police, however, said she had not followed the protocol laid down for Special Security Group (SSG) protectees.

“I informed the SSG around 11.30 a.m. about my intention to visit the graveyard of my grandfather in south Kahsmir’s Bijbehara,” said Ms. Mufti. “I was told I cannot as the director SSG had passed such orders. I was thereafter detained and not allowed to step out of my home. I offered to drive in a private vehicle, which was also declined,” Ms. Mufti, who has been a vocal face for the detained PDP leader since the revocation of J&K’s special status and who also runs her mother’s Twitter handle, told The Hindu.

Ms. Mufti, who has been in the Valley for more than a week now, said she had not been provided with any formal order regarding her detention or on the restrictions. “I will move the court in case of any formal orders. So far, I am told that I am supposed to inform the SSG beforehand about the place where I plan to visit and seek permission from the district magistrate first. This only reflects that nothing is normal in Kashmir as is being claimed,” the detained PDP leader’s younger daughter asserted.

Sources said Ms. Mufti had met her incarcerated mother during her latest stay in the Valley. “The authorities could have easily moved my mother to her house and kept her there,” she said. “However, the prolonged detention of the entire political leadership in Kashmir is aimed at breaking them emotionally,” Ms. Mufti asserted.

She alleged that the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) was directly handling the detentions of the political leaders and their releases. “There are a few officers here who are working on creation of the third front. Many local officers have their own axe to grind and are high on new-found power,” she added.

Ms. Mufti said she feared the family may not be allowed to visit the grave of Sayeed, whose fourth death anniversary falls on January 7, to pay their respect.

SSG Director Muneer Khan said Ms. Mufti was an SSG protectee and did not follow the protocol. “It’s a lie she was detained,” asserted Mr. Khan. “At very short notice [she] suggested she was visiting Bijbehara. It requires permission from the local authorities too. So we decided to stop her here,” said the police official, who also serves as the Additional Director General of Police (ADGP), Law and Order.

Meanwhile, Divisional Commissioner, Kashmir, Baseer Ahmad Khan said the fixed-line broadband service in 80 health institutions in the Valley had been completely restored on Thursday.

“SMS services on mobile services other than BSNL shall also be restored till Thursday evening,” said Mr. Khan.

The J&K administration, however, missed its own timetable on the restoration of SMS service on postpaid connections. The services were to be restored on December 31. However, many cellular companies claimed formal orders were issued very late and the companies were given short notice to uplink the system. As of Thursday, only BSNL’s postpaid subscribers were able to send and receive text messages.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oavgm8/article30463660.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3TH-SCUTTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mehboobas-daughter-claims-she-was-detained/article30463662.ece

“Soniaji is very sensitive of these infant deaths. She has directed the State government and Chief Minister [Ashok Gehlot] that there should not be a single infant death in the future because of medical negligence or lack of facilities,” Mr. Pande told The Hindu.

With over 100 deaths reported from the Kota hospital in the last few weeks, the issue has become political with the BJP targeting the Congress chief and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra for their silence.

From Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked if the two didn’t feel the grief of the mothers who lost their children.

Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati too had said Ms. Vadra could come to Uttar Pradesh but didn’t travel to Kota.

“The BJP is trying to distract the attention of the people from burning issues like the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. As I said we don’t justify a single death but the numbers are far lower than during the BJP government,” Mr. Pande countered.

We are trying to persuade the government to see our side,” Saji Narayanan, national president of the BMS, told The Hindu. “An acute form of capitalism has achieved the status of religion and there is no compassion or consideration for the workers in this approach,” he said, calling for a change.

The BMS has demanded that the Modi government must stop “privatisation, corporatisation, strategic sale and disinvestment of public sector enterprises”. A charter of demands released by the BMS said its concerns included the “proposed corporatisation of Railways, Defence and Postal and privatisation of State transport sector and electricity boards”. The organisation wants an end to the Foreign Direct Investment and has called for the removal of provisions of the Industrial Relations Code and “other codes that discriminate against the workers in favour of industries”. “The code on Wages-2019 should be implemented as soon as possible and payment of minimum wages across the country be ensured,” the charter said. The BMS has also demanded the abolition of contract labour and “fixed term employment”.

Mr. Narayanan said it had become the reflex response of economists to call for labour reforms whenever growth or development is discussed. “This essentially means further curtailment of labour rights. Permanent jobs are shrinking and more are being destroyed every day. What we need is wage-driven growth. When work and wages are protected, there will be more demand and growth.

“The CDS also directed that a proposal to create an air defence command be prepared by June 30, 2020. He also set out priorities for execution of synergy by June 30 and December 31, 2020,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement.

The areas identified for jointness and synergy include creation of common logistics support pools in stations where two or more services have their presence.

Gen. Rawat directed various branch heads to come up with recommendations for inter-service synergy and jointness in a time bound manner. Emphasising collegiate system of functioning, he directed that all three services and the Coast Guard must be consulted and their views obtained in a time-bound manner. “Decisions will, however, be taken to ensure optimisation of resources. Efforts will be made to cut out infructuous ceremonial activities, which are manpower intensive,” it said.

Broad mandate

The broad mandate of the CDS includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services, communications, repairs and maintenance of the three services “within three years of the first CDS assuming office”.

The air defence command and common logistics support pools are steps towards creating theatre commands in future, which is also in the mandate of the CDS. However, there is no consensus among the services on theatre commands and the Indian Air Force (IAF) has been especially opposed to the move. On this issue, Gen. Rawat stated after assuming charge on Thursday that “we are copying western methods and what others have done” and “we have to find a system which suits India.”

“Earlier also the tableau of the West Bengal government was rejected. Instead of indulging in politics, the officials of the State government should look at what’s going wrong and correct it,” Mr. Ghosh said.

This is not the first time that the State’s tableau is being excluded from the Republic Day Parade. In 2018, Bengal’s proposal for a tableau on ‘Unity and Harmony’ was rejected. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had described the rejection of the State’s tableau to the Republic Day Parade in 2018 as an insult to people of the State. There has been no reaction from her on the current development so far.

Flagship theme

For the Republic Day celebrations of 2020, the West Bengal government had proposed to decorate its tableau based on three flagship welfare programmes — the Kanyashree Scheme (a conditional cash transfer scheme for girl students), Sobujshree (a sapling to every newborn), and Jal Dharo Jal Bharo (on water conservation).

A statement from the Centre did not explain the reason why the tableau from West Bengal was not included. The statement merely added, “was not taken forward for further consideration by the Expert Committee after deliberations in the second meeting”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q0m8hq/article30458312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02REPUBLICDAYCELEBRATION-POWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bengals-tableau-fails-to-make-it-to-republic-day-parade/article30462499.ece

They said the raids were being conducted against an accused named in the case and his relative and a prominent Pune-based industrialist.

About 30 premises were raided by tax department sleuths in coordination with local police in the two cities, they said.

The searches against the two, they said, are a result of certain disclosures made by Rajiv Saxena, an accused arrested in the VVIP choppers scam.

70,2020/01/02,Science Congress takes ‘extra care’ to weed out pseudo science,"On the eve of the 107th Indian Science Congress (ISC), set to commence in Bengaluru, organisers said they had taken “special care” to ensure that ‘pseudo-scientific’ articles or talks did not creep in.

In last year’s ISC at Lovely University, Jalandhar, G. Nageswara Rao, at the time vice-chancellor of Andhra University, asserted that the Kauravas of the Mahabharata had been born of ‘stem-cell’ technology and test-tube baby science and that Rama and Ravana had fought with ‘guided missiles.’

While pseudo-scientific remarks at the congress aren’t unprecedented — in 2015, at the event in Mumbai, there was an entire session dedicated to ‘aircraft from the Vedic age’ — Mr. Rao’s remarks stood out as it was the first time a senior scientist from a well-regarded University had made such comments.

“We’ve had a stricter screening process this time,” Anoop Kumar Jain, General Secretary (Scientific Activities), Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), told The Hindu. “Only those who’ve sent their entire papers will have a chance to speak, irrespective of the seniority of the speaker,” said Dr. Jain.

As part of the standard process, the ISCA constitutes sectional committees — there are 14 this year — to evaluate the scientific merit of papers submitted by its members. The solicitations for papers, which span a range from agricultural sciences to archaeology, are sent to all prominent colleges, universities and research institutes.

The Kolkata-based ISCA has been the organiser of the congress since 1914, and is funded by the Union Department of Science and Technology.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is slated to inaugurate the congress, which is scheduled to take place between January 3-7, at the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) in Bengaluru on Friday.

The theme for the congress this year is ‘science and technology: rural development’ and to emphasise it, the function — which draws school students, college science students and young scholars in droves — will include a Farmer’s Science Congress, providing a platform for innovative farmers. The farmer’s congress will also discuss agrarian distress and strategies to mitigate and navigate the impact of climate change on agriculture, among other pressing issues.

“The rural-urban divide is only widening and the congress will deliberate on the role of science to bridge this gap,” K.S. Rangappa, general president of the ISCA, said in a statement.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/toqxqr/article30461543.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-ISC-FB-isc2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/science-congress-takes-extra-care-to-weed-out-pseudo-science/article30461435.ece

72,2020/01/02,Architects question land use change in Central Vista revamp,"Several architects have raised concerns over the government’s proposed change of land-use of plots in the heart of Lutyens’ Delhi to make way for a new Parliament House, residences and office buildings, flagging the potential reduction in land for general public use as well as the lack of a scientific study to justify the amendment of the Master Plan for Delhi-2021 (MPD).

As a part of the Centre’s ambitious redevelopment of the three-kilometre-long Central Vista, Parliament and Central Secretariat, the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) on December 21, 2019 issued a notification inviting suggestions and objections to its proposed land-use change of several plots in the Master Plan. A 9.5-acre-plot opposite the existing Parliament House, currently earmarked for recreational use, was proposed to be changed to “Parliament House”, and a 15-acre plot near South Block to “residential”. Comments were invited for a period of 30 days.

Campaign started

Earlier this week, a group of architects and citizens’ collective, Let India Breathe, started a campaign to encourage people to send in their objections to the DDA, Let India Breathe founder Yash Marwah said on Thursday. As on Thursday evening, over 115 people, architects, planners, designers and citizens, had used the platform to send in the objections, which says “there is a loss of at least 80 acres of land currently earmarked...directly or indirectly for the general public through recreational, public, semi-public, parking, bus terminal land use...”.

Madhav Raman, one of the architects objecting to the land-use change, said the Central Public Works Department, which is carrying out the redevelopment project, was proposing drastic changes to the Central Vista, but had not made public a spatial audit justifying the same.

Not specified

Mr. Raman added that the DDA was proposing to amend the zonal development plan of the area without specifying how it would compensate for the loss of land for public use. Citing Clause 5 of Chapter 10 of the MPD, which says a special development plan for the conservation of heritage complexes has to be drafted by local bodies and land-owning agencies, Mr. Raman said that no such plan had been formulated for the Lutyens’ Bungalow Zone, so “how can you change the land use?”

Meanwhile, the Indian Institute of Architects (IIA) would also be sending in its comments to the DDA on the proposed change, IIA northern chapter chairperson Shamit Manchanda said.

“Master plans are made with a lot of inputs, so just changing it without conducting any scientific study is the basic issue. An environment impact assessment is also needed. What was the reason behind earmarking the area for recreational use, what is the reason to change it?” he asked.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ryj4y/article30453519.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01PARLIAMENT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/architects-question-land-use-change-in-central-vista-revamp/article30461393.ece

Modi appeared for his regular 28-day “call-over” appearance from London’s Wandsworth prison at Westminster Magistrates’ Court. His extradition trial is scheduled for May 11 and is expected to last over five days.

Deputy Chief Magistrate Tan Ikram, who was the judge on Thursday, asked if there were any other issues to be discussed. Modi, wearing a black, light grey and white sweat shirt and a grey bottom, said no.

The 48-year-old had moved yet another bail application last November with an “unprecedented” house arrest guarantee, akin to those imposed on terrorist suspects, while also citing mental health issues from being behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March.

But the bail plea was turned down by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot over continued fears of witness intimidation and failure to surrender before the court for his extradition trial in May 2020.

“The past is a prediction of what might happen in the future,” Judge Arbuthnot had said at the time.

The U.K.’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents the Indian government in the extradition proceedings, said there is no further prospect of an appeal for bail in a higher court as the U.K. High Court had already turned down Modi’s plea earlier this year.

“You only get to go once and can’t keep appealing over and over”, a CPS spokesperson had said.

Meanwhile, Modi must appear for “call-over” hearings at Westminster Magistrates’ Court until the case management hearings for his extradition trial kick in over the coming weeks.

75,2020/01/02,Passport dept seeks MEA nod to prosecute Medha Patkar,"Mumbai Regional Passport Office has sought the external affairs ministry’s nod to prosecute Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) activist Medha Patkar for not disclosing criminal cases against her in her passport application.

Sources in the passport office said the department had written a letter to the MEA, seeking it go-ahead to file a criminal case against Patkar for concealing the details about many pending cases against her at the time of filing the passport application in 2017.

The officials said her passport has automatically been impounded after she surrendered it on December 9, in response to a notice issued to her seeking explanation. However, by surrendering the passport she cannot absolve herself from prosecution, they added.

After receiving the permission, the RPO will file a criminal case against her as per the Passport Act. The maximum punishment under the Act is two-year rigorous imprisonment or Rs 5000 fine or both.

A complaint was filed against the activist in June 2019 by a journalist, alleging that Patkar had obtained her passport by concealing and suppressing material facts from the RPO Mumbai.

The complainant had provided the details of nine criminal cases with documentary evidence, pending against her in various districts of Madhya Pradesh.

Patkar in her passport application of March 30, 2017 claimed that no criminal cases are pending against her and in the column on pending criminal cases, if any, she declared “none“.

The RPO Mumbai also sought details of pending cases from the Director General of Police, Madhya Pradesh, who confirmed that charge sheet has been filed against her in five cases.

In the show cause notice to Patkar issued on October 18 last year, the RPO Mumbai had asked as to why her passport should not be impounded for failing to disclose information regarding pendency of criminal cases against her.

Out of the nine criminal cases registered against her, three are in Barwani, one in Alirajpur and five in Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh.

The notice had said: “While obtaining passport bearing no...dated March 30, 2017 you have not disclosed the fact regarding pendency of above cases and obtained passport by suppression of material information“.

“In view of the same, it is proposed to impound your passport bearing no...and any other passport if issued subsequently under section 10(3)(e) of the Passports Act 1967. You are requested to state why action should not be taken under section 12(1) of the Passports Act 1967,” the notice issued by the passport office on October 18 said.

The passport officials had sought her explanation within 10 days.

The National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) President V.K. Saxena, who is currently Chairman of Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC), also wrote to the RPO, alleging that the NBA activist “deliberately didn’t disclose” two other criminal cases lodged by him against her.

In the November 22 letter, he said the two criminal cases against her were lodged by him in 2001 and 2006 and are pending in New Delhi’s Saket Court.

But she not only did not mention the nine cases from Madhya Pradesh, but these two cases as well, he wrote in the letter to the passport officer. “In case she has not disclosed about these two criminal cases pending against her you may initiate action as per law,” he said.

Saxena in a statement said that Patkar, who was in 2011 severely censured by a three-judge Bench of the Supreme Court for filing a false affidavit and pleading in the court in a case related to people affected by the Narmada project in Madhya Pradesh, has been found guilty of suppressing vital information in her passport application.

“Now she conceals her cases of criminality in her passport application. This shows her true character”, he said.

76,2020/01/02,"We briefed nations on CAA, says govt.","The Union government pursued a rigorous “two-pronged” strategy on conveying its explanation on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) controversy in India, the Ministry of External Affairs said on Thursday, stressing that the Act merely speeds up citizenship applications for communities mentioned in it and is not seeking to change the Indian Constitution.

Responding to reports that said foreign diplomats in India were unhappy with the lack of communication from the government on the issues that have set off protests in various parts of the country the MEA said the reports were “factually incorrect.”

“We did reach out to countries across regions, and wrote to all our missions and posts asking them to share our perspectives with host governments [on CAA and NRC],” MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar told presspersons, adding that this was done in addition to meeting with diplomats based in Delhi.

The government’s brief mentioned that the CAA was an internal process, which did not seek to strip any community members of Indian citizenship. Nor did the CAA alter the basic structure of the Constitution, Mr. Kumar said.

“We asked [embassies] to convey that the Act provides expedited consideration for Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities already in India, from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. It doesn’t affect existing avenues already available to other communities,” he added.

Call with Hasina

Mr. Kumar declined to comment on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi had discussed the issue with Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina when he greeted her on New Year’s day.

A press release said that the two leaders had discussed how to further strengthen India-Bangladesh ties. Bangladesh Deputy Foreign Minister Shahriar Alam, who cancelled his visit to Delhi in December ostensibly over the passage of the CAA at the time, is expected to attend the Ministry’s annual Raisina Dialogue from January 14 to 16. Ten foreign ministers are attending the Dialogue, which will be addressed by Australian PM Scott Morrison.

The Ministry spokesperson said India had expressed strong concern to the Malaysian Charge d’affaires about what he called Malaysian PM Mahathir Muhammad’s “ill-advised and avoidable” comments on the CAA, and the government has spoken to other members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

Gurbaz Singh from Surrey was ascending the peak with friends on Tuesday marking his 90th mountain climb when he lost his footing on the ice and fell from a section of the mountain known as ‘The Pearly Gates’ to the ‘Devil’s Kitchen’ area below, the CNN-affiliate KATU channel reported.

Mr. Singh survived the dangerous fall, escaping only with a broken leg.

A team of search-and-rescue coordinators hiked up to the injured climber, who was stranded at an elevation of about 10,500 feet. Due to the location and elevation, the rescue operation took several hours.

Mount Hood is the highest summit in Oregon and the most visited snow-covered peak in the nation, according to the U.S. Forest Service. More than 10,000 people make the climb each year, according to officials.

“He thought he was going to stop somewhere, and he was trying to arrest the fall with his axe, but it just didn’t happen because he was rolling so fast that he couldn’t do it,” Mr. Singh’s father Rishamdeep Singh told KATU.

The teen, who underwent a surgery in a hospital in Portland, credits his training and wearing a helmet as reasons why his injuries weren’t more severe.

“We looked at my helmet afterwards and it was just destroyed. I’m so lucky”, he told CTV News.

Rescuers located Mr. Singh and managed to splint his leg. They then began the slow descent down the mountain, four hours after his initial fall.

His father said once Mr. Singh is fully healed, both of them plan to go back to Mount Hood and conquer the climb together.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ku44h6/article30460084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MOUNTHOODjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indian-origin-teen-climber-from-canada-survives-fall-from-us-peak/article30459824.ece

Addressing thousands of students and seers of various Mutts on the premises of the Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuru, Mr. Modi said instead of carrying out agitations against Pakistan which was “oppressing” its minorities, the anti-CAA protesters were opposing the Union government for implementing the CAA and NRC to safeguard the interests of the minorities in Pakistan and other nations.

He said that if the Congress wanted to carry out rallies “let them do these in support of the victims of atrocities of Pakistan” and not against the Union government. He alleged that Pakistan had destroyed the lives of lakhs of its minorities. He dared the Congress to carry out protests against Pakistan. “It is time to expose the atrocities carried out by Pakistan on its minorities at the international level,” he said.

He said people fled from Pakistan to India to save their lives and the lives of their daughters. He told the protesters to raise their voice against Pakistan, which is carrying out “religious atrocities” against its minorities.

Strongly defending CAA, the Prime Minister asked what was wrong in giving shelter to the minorities including Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains of Pakistan who were being subjected to atrocities because of their religion.

With no other alternative, oppressed minorities there were forced to come to India seeking shelter and the Congress was not ready to say that what Pakistan was doing was not correct, he said.

“Out of these, 22 proposals, comprising 16 states/UTs and 6 ministries/departments, have finally been short-listed for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2020 after a series of five meetings,” a statement by the ministry said.

The West Bengal government’s proposal was rejected after an Expert Committee examined it in two rounds of meeting, it said.

“The tableau proposal of the West Bengal government was not taken forward for further consideration by the Expert Committee after deliberations in the second meeting.

“It is pertinent to mention here that the tableau of the Government of West Bengal was short-listed for participation in the Republic Day Parade 2019 as an outcome of the same process,” it added.

There is a well-established system for selection of tableau for participation in the Republic Day Parade. The Ministry of Defence invites proposals from all states, union territories, central ministries and departments.

The proposals are then evaluated in a series of meetings of the Expert Committee comprising eminent persons in the fields of art, culture, painting, sculpture, music, architecture, choreography, etc.

The Committee examines the proposals on the basis of theme, concept, design and its visual impact before making its recommendations, the statement said.

Due to time constraints, only a limited number of tableau can be short-listed for participation in the parade. “The selection process in vogue, leads to participation of the best tableau in the parade,” the statement added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/22-tableau-proposals-out-of-56-short-listed-for-republic-day/article30458313.ece

The premier business schools, which currently do not offer reservation in teaching positions, have been asked by the Ministry to provide quota in faculty positions for SC, ST, OBC and EWS candidates.

According to officials, the B-schools have made the request saying they adopt a fair recruitment process and give equal opportunities to all, including disadvantaged sections of society.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has described as unheard of a Rajya Sabha member filing a petition with the Chairman seeking to initiate breach of privileges and contempt proceedings against a Chief Minister.

Amid the New Year celebrations, protests against the amended citizenship law continued in various parts of Delhi such as Shaheen Bagh, Jamia Millia Islamia and the India Gate where agitators sang legendary poet Faiz Ahamed Faiz’s Hum Dekhenge and pledged to “defend the Constitution”.

This year, besides the 5,000 policemen of the district police force, 1500 Home Guards and 12-15 SRPF companies were deployed on the occasion, taking the total force manning the crowds up to 10,000 personnel.

Four pilots from the Indian Air Force will leave for Russia this month to receive training as astronauts of Gaganyaan, the first Indian crewed flight to space. They were shortlisted after a series of fitness and endurance tests, ISRO Chairman K. Sivan announced at a press meet on Wednesday.

An IIT-K student sang the poem Hum Dekhenge by Faiz, an eminent poet, against which a complaint was filed by Vashimant Sharma, a temporary faculty member, and about 16 others including faculty members and students.

The written complaint filed by them with the IIT Director states that the poem had some wordings that could hurt the sentiments of Hindus, Agarwal said.

“A committee of six members was established, headed by me, to investigate the matter. Some students have been questioned, while the others will be questioned after they return to the institution after the holidays,” the Deputy Director said.

Kishan Reddy on Wednesday asserted that it is the “moral responsibility” of India to give shelter and citizenship to Hindus and other minority communities of Pakistan, which has been persecuting them persistently.

“It’s our moral responsibility to give citizenship to the minorities (from the three neighbouring Muslim countries). If they don’t come to India, where will they go? To Italy?” he asked.

“Italy will not accept Hindus or Sikhs as they are poor people,” he said.

Stating that owing to persistent persecution of Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and Jains in Pakistan, the population of the minorities there has come down drastically from its earlier 30%-level, the minister said it’s the moral responsibility of India to give shelter and citizenship to non-Muslims from the three neighbouring country.

The minister also claimed that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi knows no difference between the the CAA and GST and that is why he says the recent changes in the citizenship law would lead to an increase in the tax.

The “immature statement” of Rahul Gandhi shows he “cannot distinguish between CAA and GST” as he says the GST will further increase due to CAA.

“I want to tell Rahul Gandhi that if he does not know the difference (between CAA and GST), he should take tuition from a better tutor in the matter,” said the minister.

“It seems he doesn’t have any idea about NPR and NRC either,” he said.

The minister also accused the opposition of playing “cheap politics”, saying that it is instigating people to protest against the recent changes in the citizenship law by misleading them.

The properties are located in Tirunelveli, Tamil Nadu.

The CBI had earlier registered a case against Nakoda Limited, its chairman and managing director Babulal Gumanmal Jain, his son and joint managing director Devender Jain and others.

According to the agency, the company took fund based and non-fund based financial assistance from a consortium of 13 banks led by Canara Bank and defaulted on loan repayments.

The ED found that the Jains had conspired with a trader named Puneet Rungta and a chartered accountant, Jagdish Somani, to carry out fake sale and purchase of fancy fabrics with the companies floated by them.

Based on the fake purchase invoices, Nakoda opened 1,212 of letters of credit with the banks amounting to ₹4,207 crore. Investigation revealed that 202 of the letters of credit worth ₹827.98 crore devolved due to non-payment by the company.

It is alleged that the funds were laundered through circular transactions with various firms and then used for repayment of various loans, including term loans, interest, banking charges and as working capital for meeting day-to-day expenses towards running the company’s plant and factory.

It went on to say: “The story incorrectly quotes government officials that ‘respondents to NPR exercise will get time to provide papers’ and ‘families would need to dig out old documents and ensure that such documents are readily available for verification & enumerators would see those documents’.” It added: “The story ignores Government’s stated position that no individual will be required to submit any document to any authority or enumerator visiting his/her household for NPR survey. Information provided by the individual would be accepted and recorded accordingly.”

Our Special Correspondent responds:

The report that is sought to be denied is based on points given in the NPR manual.

The manual clearly mentions that the existing database would be updated by verifying the details of all respondents through house-to-house enumeration.

The Hindu had reported this earlier on December 26. (NPR: House to house enumeration planned)

The relevant points in the NPR Training Manual that indicate that the details collected by the enumerators will be verified are:

1.6 The Government has decided to update the NPR database along with Houselisting and Housing Census phase of Census of India 2021 during April– September 2020.

1.7 Updating the existing NPR database by verifying the details of all residents by conducting a house to house enumeration by the enumerator (designated Government official) and modifying/correcting the demographic data items.

1.8 Collecting Aadhaar number from each resident voluntarily.

1.9 Collecting mobile number, Election Photo Identity Cards (EPIC) or Voter ID Card number, Indian Passport number and Driving License number, if available with the residents.

1.10 Inclusion of all new resident(s)/new household(s) found in the local area (HLB) during the field work.

96,2020/01/02,‘Jagan stoking regional passions’,"Making light of the government’s assertion that the three capitals were aimed at ensuring equitable development, Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Council Yanamala Ramakrishnudu on Thursday questioned the government as to why it stopped work on the Polavaram Left Main Canal if it really had concern for the north coastal Andhra region.

Addressing the media here on Thursday, Mr. Ramakrishnudu alleged that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was stoking regional passions and creating a rift between people under the garb of three capitals.

Growth rate

The government was diverting the attention of the people from its failures, he said. The growth rate was high during the TDP rule, and the State had attracted huge investments.

“The growth rate has fallen to 4% now under the YSRCP dispensation. Development has come to a grinding halt,” he said.

‘Brand image hit’

The TDP government had chosen Amaravati as the Capital after making extensive study. Amaravati was not an issue just relating to the farmers but linked to finances and State’s development. The TDP government had strived hard to create wealth for five years. Wealth was required for the development of the State. The brand image would suffer badly with the government’s decision,” he said, adding, “It appears that Mr. Reddy is trying to help other States.”

In fact, there was no demand to shift the Capital to Visakhapatnam. Soon after the government’s announcement, people were worried about encroachments, he said.

‘Era of betrayal’

“Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy has set his eyes on Visakhapatnam. The government is making tall claims on welfare schemes. But the fact remains that ration cards of 22 lakh families have been withdrawn. This is not ‘Navasakam’ (new era) but ‘nayavanchana sakam’ (an era of betrayal),” he observed.

TDP official spokesperson P. Anuradha said that Deputy Chief Minister (Tribal Welfare) P. Pushpa Sreevani should understand that the administration did not mean doing a TikTok.

Ms. Sreevani was never available to the people, she alleged.

“It is not correct on her part to criticise Bhuvaneswari, wife of TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu.

The symbol in white paint was seen on the trunk of a tree near the Radiology Department located in a remote area on the campus with hardly any movement of the general public.

After it was noticed, people started thronging the spot and taking photographs, which later went viral on the social media platforms.

Even as the mediapersons made a beeline for capturing the image on the tree, SVIMS authorities initially remained tight-lipped, but later said that it would be probed.

It was not known if it was the handiwork of a staff member, or the attendants of patients.

SVIMS Medical Superintendent Ram gave a written complaint to the hospital’s Security Officer, Ilango Reddy, seeking investigation into the episode.

Rev. Arasu said that members of his faith had always lived in harmony with the Hindus and had great regard for the TTD institutions.

“We Christians don’t use symbols such as a cross. We spread our ideology only through messages, wall writings, or pamphlets. Ten years ago, some miscreants had painted the ‘cross’ symbol at Balaji Nagar in Tirumala and blamed Christians for it,” he made it clear.

The minimum parking fare will be ₹20 per four-wheeler for the first 30 minutes and ₹55 up to the first two hours, and later ₹10 per hour will be charged up to seven hours and ₹165 for 24 hours, according to Airport director G. Madhusudhana Rao.

For two-wheelers, the minimum charge is ₹10 and for buses and trucks it is ₹20, while it is ₹30 for commercial vehicles. At present, fare for the first five minutes is free and later ₹35 is levied for two hours for cars, according to officials.

Automated parking

Mr. Rao along with other airport officials inaugurated the new automated parking management system on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters later, Mr. Rao said that following the Airports Authority of India’s guidelines, the new vehicle parking policy has been framed as per the standard operating procedure.

He said a single contractor has been appointed for lane management and parking management and the free time concept has been lifted.

To reduce the burden on pickup and drop vehicles, a lower time slab of 0 to 30 minutes has been created under which minimum fare is charged, according to him.

Owners of the vehicles not complying with the pickup and drop lane discipline would be fined ₹500 and traffic marshals would be deployed to ensure lane management, he said.

As per the new policy, only government vehicles are exempted from paying the parking fee, while vehicles hired by the government have to pay the fee.

The aggrieved farmers and the public said they had no other option but to die as the government took their lands and proposed to shift the capital city to Visakhapatnam in the name of Executive capital leaving thousands of land givers in the lurch.

The protesters demanded that the capital should be retained at Amaravati and warned of intensifying the agitation if the government went ahead with its idea of developing Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool as Legislative, Executive and Judicial capitals respectively.

The government appeared to be under the impression that it (having three capitals) was tantamount to decentralisation of development. In fact, it was only decentralisation of administration that would in no way facilitate balanced development of all the regions, the APS activists asserted.

102,2020/01/02,People are in favour of three capitals: Ambati,"The war of words over the idea of three capitals is raging.

On Thursday, YSRCP MLA Ambati Rambabu defend Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s move, and claimed that people of all the three regions in the State were happy with it.

Addressing the media at the central party office here, Mr. Rambabu said that three capitals did not mean construction of three cities. “What it means is establishing the centres of administration,” he added.

“Development across the State is possible only through decentralisation,” he asserted.

“Those who get elected are supposed to govern. They are not expected to carry out any mercantile activity. The TDP government had taken away 2,000 acres of assigned land illegally,” he observed.

Snipe at Naidu

Former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and his benamis hugely benefited by purchasing 4,000 acres in the Capital region, he alleged. “All the wrongdoings of Mr. Naidu will be exposed,” Mr. Rambabu said.

“We will also take care of the farmers who gave land for the Capital city.

Jagan Mohan Reddy recently, has written a letter to party national president N. Chandrababu Naidu alleging that he is being meted out a raw deal in the party.

The development comes after Mr. Naidu appointed K. Ravindra Babu alias Nani as in-charge of the Assembly segment a day after Mr. Giridhar met the Chief Minister.

In the letter written on Thursday, Mr. Giridhar said he did not resign from the party and that he met Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy only to seek the release of ₹25 crore for the development of the constituency and clearance of pending bills of UGD works.

He further alleged that the party was giving importance only to a certain community and people like him were not being treated with equality.

104,2020/01/02,Jagan unhappy with ACB’s performance,"Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday expressed displeasure over the “lacklustre performance” of the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), and gave the department officials three months time to get their act together.

Mr. Reddy reviewed the department’s performance, and said it was not up to his expectations.

He said “swiftness” and “commitment” should be the corner stones of the department.

Referring to the anti-corruption helpline ‘14400’, Mr. Reddy said it was launched with an intention to help the people report about corruption at various levels. The result of this facility should be clearly visible, he said.

Mr. Reddy said the idea was to rid the State of corruption at all levels, be it at Mandal Revenue Offices, registration offices, or town planning departments of the civic bodies.

He wanted effective implementation of laws in such a way that people should think twice before taking bribe.

More staff promised

Demanding results in three months, the Chief Minister said, if needed, the officials and staff should work without taking leave, and offered to provide more staff and facilities to achieve the target.

105,2020/01/02,Pale shadow of a glorious past,"Machilipatnam, which was a cosmopolitan town before Independence, is still waiting to register any development post-Independence.

The commencement of the construction of the deep seaport has been delayed for over a decade, while the expansion unit of Bharat Electronics Limited was shifted outside Machilipatnam in 2016.

In recent years, the Gilakaladindi harbour has also been closed down owing to technical reasons, depriving hundreds of coastal communities of a livelihood.

Waning population

According to the British India Census (1871-72), the population of Masulipatnam was 35,056 in the Madras Presidency while it was 9,336 in Vijayawada. At least 30,000 people died in the 1864 cyclone that hit this coast.

However, the population of the town has not increased in the past decade. A former Krishna District Magistrate observed: ""Machilipatnam was the only district headquarters in the country to have witnessed a decrease in the decadal growth of population — from 1,79,353 in 2001 to 1,69,892 in 2011 — a trend that is a bane for any town.""

Lack of employment opportunities, economic activity, and the absence of fishing and maritime trade operations on the Machilipatnam coast are suspected to be the key factors that triggered the migration of locals in search of better opportunities. Of late, the port town has become a favoured destination for retired people.

Missing deadlines

In the first half of the past decade, the town witnessed protests over the controversial land acquisition, while the latter half was the alleged ""betrayal"" by the State government in not reviving it into a ‘maritime trade post’ as promised.

Over a decade has gone by since the foundation stone for the construction of a deep seaport was laid. The port project, that was projected as a‘growth engine’, is yet to take off.

""The shifting of the expansion unit of Bharat Electronics Limited from Machilipatnam to Nimmakuru in 2016 and closure of the harbour at Gilakaladindi have dealt a major blow to the development of the port town,"" a realtor told The Hindu.

Toll on economy

The closure of the Gilakaladindi harbour, which could anchor 100 boats, has derprived hundreds of locals of employment, apart from having an adverse impact on economic activity. On the administration front, the district officials have mostly abandoned the district headquarters after head offices of the government departments were shifted to Vijayawada and Amaravati.

A Retired Special Deputy Collector and amateur historian Mohammad Silar said: ""The cosmopolitan features of this town are only in the pages of history. The present state of affairs is a result of the policies of successive governments.""

Mr. Silar adds: ""The textile and handloom industries were the prime attractions for the foreign trade companies in Machilipatnam. Such industries with huge employment opportunities have largely disappeared.""

A government employee serving here said: ""Machilipatnam was the prime destination for the Europeans for sea-borne trade. The British even ran a train between Machilipatnam and Vasco in Goa and such transportation facility shows how the port town was considered as strategic for trade and defence"".",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/5y1tvp/article30460783.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/220898418col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pale-shadow-of-a-glorious-past/article30460784.ece
106,2020/01/02,A.P. govt. should re-think Ramana Dikshitulu’s appointment: BJP’s Bhanuprakash Reddy,"TIRUMALA BJP State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy on Thursday demanded the State government to order an inquiry into the alleged violations committed by Tirumala Tiirupati Devathanams (TTD) Honorary Chief Priest Ramana Dikshitulu in the recent times inside the hill temple and initiate departmental action against his misdeeds.

Speaking to the media, Mr. Reddy said it was unfortunate that Mr. Dikshitulu after gaining his re-entry into the hill temple has turned into a nucleus for disputes.

Controversies abound

“Mr. Dikshitulu had vehemently appealed to the devout not to make any deposits into the temple hundi and also leveled baseless allegations of carrying out excavations inside the temple kitchen and theft of the pink diamond. Isn’t it highly deplorable on the part of the State government to re-appoint such a person as an Agama Advisor and Honorary Chief Priest?” Mr. Reddy questioned.

Compounding the situation Mr. Dikshitulu had recently picked up a wrangle inside the sanctum sanctorum when other priests tried to resist his manoeuvres which were reportedly against the religious norms, Mr. Reddy alleged.

Needs to introspect

He added that it is high time Mr. Dikshitulu goes in for a kind of introspection for all his actions, and demanded the government to re-think over his appointment issue.

Going hammer and tongs, Mr. Reddy pointed out that Mr. Dikshitulu belongs to one of the four archaka families rendering services at the hill temple. “If the same demand for appointment as Agama Advisor and honorary priesthood comes from other three families, is the government ready to heed to their requests?” he queried.

Demands inquiry

Mr. Reddy also minced no words when he launched a tirade against the TTD authorities and held them responsible for the non-availability of New Year Diaries and calendars. The compulsions on the part of the management for the delay in the printing of diaries and calendars and the reported reduction in the printing order should be made public he demanded. “An inquiry should also be ordered into the circumstances that led to the delay as it relates to the vast sentiments of the devout,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/oc2rzc/article29892195.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJPG4-RAMANA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/govt-should-rethink-ramana-diskhitulus-appointment-bjp-state-spokesperson/article30460647.ece

110,2020/01/02,"RINL posts turnover of ₹12,700 crore in nine months","Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, has achieved a turnover of ₹12,700 crore during April-December 2019 despite a turbulent market.

Addressing the employees on the New Year, RINL Chairman-cum-Managing Director P.K. Rath said the exports recorded a growth of 119% and the sale of value-added steel had also seen a growth of 79%. The inventory level was brought down to below four lakh tonne by December-end, he said.

The CMD said that the steel industry was showing signs of improvement in the country with the introduction of several new initiatives by the government in boosting spending on infrastructure, construction and automobile sectors. Mr. Rath said that many steel companies in the world were under severe stress in 2019 and the rise in raw material prices like coking coal and iron ore severely impacted the entire steel industry’s bottom-line. RINL was no exception to this development, he said.

“The RINL leadership has taken several new initiatives to face the challenges and even with lower production, achieved improvement in techno-economic parameters such as improvement of blast furnace productivity and usage of pulverised chemical injection in all blast furnaces,” Mr. Rath said. He stressed on improving PCI to around 150 kg/tonne hot metal in Q4 to reduce the cost of production and improve blast furnace productivity.

Mr. Rath stated that on the raw material securitisation, RINL had started participating in e-auctions, tender route, procuring of slimes to supplement iron ore fines in sinter plant. Actions were also initiated for tie-up with Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC), he added.

RINL has a history of converting challenges into opportunities, the CMD said, and called upon the employees to exhibit utmost discipline and work collectively, supplemented with an emotional attachment to propel the company on a continuous growth path.

112,2020/01/02,Impressive crowds at Tirumala for New Year,"The hill temple of Lord Venkateswara here witnessed an impressive turnout in the pilgrim crowd on the New Year Day on Wednesday.

For the first time in the recent years, the day was observed without any fanfare bringing in a kind of comfort to the devotees who were allowed for the darshan of the presiding deity soon after the completion of the mandatory pre-dawn rituals, all of which were performed in “Ekantham”.

The main doors of the temple were opened at 2 a.m. (as is normally observed during the month-long Dhanurmasam) and over 14,000 pilgrims could finish their darshan even before the promulgation of VIP darshan that commenced at 6.30 a.m.

The TTD too was little liberal in granting VIP darshan tickets with there being no distinguished VIPs falling under the protocol category. The relatively low turnout in the VIPs proved a blessing in disguise for the ordinary pilgrims as about 64,992 devotees could have the darshan of the deity by 6 p.m. The waiting time for the darshan, which initially stretched beyond 18 hours, came down to 12 hours, according to the reports reaching by evening.

Festive spirit

Meanwhile, the festive spirit was all pervasive as the town milled with pilgrim activity since the previous night. Scores of devotees preferred to stay back in the sprawling space available in front of the main temple complex to witness the ceremonial opening of the temple doors.

Thousands of devotees were also seen doing ‘Maha Pradakshinam’ around the Mada Streets encircling the sacred shrine all through the day.

The attached properties include house sites, fish tanks and poultry farms worth ₹35.70 crore, cash deposits in various bank accounts held in the name of Kumar Pappu Singh and the borrowers with IDBI Bank to the tune of ₹15.73 crore.

As per the investigation initiated under PMLA, 2002 on the basis of an FIR registered under Sections 120B, 420, 468 read with 471 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 13(2) read with 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 by Central Bureau of Investigation, Anti Corruption Branch, Visakhapatnam, Pappu Singh and others fraudulently availed Kisan Credit Card (KCC) loans from IDBI Bank for fish farming.

The investigation also revealed that Pappu Singh had fraudulently availed KCC loans in the names of 87 borrowers who were his family members, employees and persons known to him. He had allegedly obtained the loans by giving his properties as collateral security and had allegedly misappropriated the loans sanctioned to the borrowers.

The loan amounts sanctioned to the borrowers were illegally diverted from the bank accounts of the borrowers to the savings account of Pappu Singh and into the bank accounts of his firms/companies, the ED has claimed.

Searches were conducted at the residential and business premises of the accused on July 16, 2019, and several incriminating documents were allegedly recovered.

114,2020/01/02,"Willpower trumps experience, asserts Transport Minister","Transport Minister Perni Venkataramaiah on Wednesday said that Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy, by merging the loss-making A.P. State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) with the government, has demonstrated that willpower trumps experience.

Addressing a function organised at the Pandit Nehru Bus Station by the APSRTC employees to ‘thank’ the Chief Minister for conceding their long-pending demand of merging the corporation with the government, Mr. Venkataramaiah said that while former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was a seasoned politician with over 40 years of experience, he had rejected the workers’ demand for a merger calling it ‘unfeasible’.

“However, Mr. Jagan proved Naidu wrong within 200 days of coming to power. Despite several hurdles, the Chief Minister went ahead with a steely resolve to fulfil the promise he had made to the workers,” Mr. Venkataramaiah said.

The Transport Minister said that under TDP rule, the APSRTC workers lived under constant fear of the loss-making organisation shutting down operations. But Mr. Jagan put such apprehensions to rest by announcing his decision to merge it with the government and approving the proposal in the first Cabinet meeting, he said.

“Employees need not harbour any fears as Mr. Jagan is determined to sort out all their issues. They will be paid all the pending payments under the Credit Cooperative Society, pension scheme and other schemes very soon,” Mr. Venkataramaiah assured.

The Minister said that APSRTC employees can repose faith in the Chief Minister for their well-being just like the people in the State trust APSRTC for its safety and integrity. He said a retired RTC worker receiving a monthly pension of less than ₹10,000 and with no other source of income, would be given a ration card and other benefits that are extended to the poor.

‘Historic decision’

Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivasa Rao said that the merger was a historic decision taken by the YSRCP government in the State. The Public Transport Department Managing Director M.T. Krishna Babu called the merger a first-of-its-kind in the country.

Vijayawada Central MLA Malladi Vishnu said that instead of helping the corporation to come out of its financial crisis, the Chandrababu Naidu government had compounded its woes by using APSRTC buses for tours to Polavaram project, shifting people for government programmes and other purposes and not paying any money to the Corporation authorities.

The officers, who included Yetapaka OSD Amit Bardar, Chintur DSP Shaik Khadar Basha, and CI Yuva Kumar, celebrated the New Year with the members of the tribe in the hamlet, a Maoist hotbed located on the border of Sukuma district in Chhattisgarh.

The officers took along with them bananas, sweets, cakes, clothes and chocolates to the hamlet.

A tribal woman cut the cake and distributed it among those present.

“We usually see the police with weapons during patrolling. Today, we have seen the officers in all smiles. It is a festival for us. They have offered us new clothes,” said a tribal woman, Maremma.

Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi is all praise for the Chintur and Rampachodavaram police for frequently visiting the tribal hamlets, particularly the inaccessible and border areas, as part of Community Policing.

“The frequent visit of the officers to the tribal hamlets will pave the way for development. The officers should visit the houses of the tribal people, interact with them, make a note of their problems and try to solve them,” Mr. Asmi said.

Goodies for children

Mr. Bardar and Mr. Khadar Basha offered chocolates, sweets and cakes to the tribal children. They also gave medicines to the needy women.

“I thank Mr. Yuva Kumar, SI Suresh Babu and other personnel for spending the entire day with the tribal people. In all, 60 Gotti Koya families live in the hamlet. Tribal people of Prega and Lachhigudem hamlets too joined the celebrations,” Mr. Bardar said.

The year 2020 will be equally promising like 2019 to the farmers, said Andhra Pradesh Agriculture Mission vice-chairman M.V.S. Nagi Reddy.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Mr. Nagi Reddy said the State government would launch Rythu Bharosa as a Sankranti gift. The scheme was supposed to be launched from next year, but keeping in view of the farmers’ welfare, the schedule was advanced. The tenant farmers would also be benefited under the scheme. Nowhere in the country, were tenant farmers extended such benefits, he said.

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy allocated ₹3,000 crore towards price stabilisation fund. The government took initiatives like free crop insurance and cattle insurance, and the input subsidy was increased by 15%. Interest-free loans, remunerative prices to pulses and millets farmers, power supply to aqua farmers at a rate of ₹1.50 per unit were some of the other measures.

The government was paying an exgratia of ₹5 lakh to the kin of farmers who committed suicide during the previous government rule. TDP president N.

Mr. Naidu had earlier given a call to boycott the New Year celebrations, and asked partymen to support the agitation being spearheaded by the Amaravathi Parirakshana Samithi.

Mr. Naidu, along with his wife Bhuvaneswari and brother-in-law N. Ramakrishna, addressed the farmers who had been agitating for the last 13 days at Yerrabalem, Krishnayapalem and Thullur.

Continuing his tirade against the YSRCP government, Mr. Naidu said that it was unfortunate that the farmers had to come onto the streets even on the New Year day.

Vision document

Claiming that he had developed Hyderabad and launched the ‘Vision 2020’ document, Mr. Naidu said his vision of developing a city, Cyberabad, 25 years ago had paid rich dividends as Hyderabad continued to be the economic powerhouse for Telangana.

Mr. Naidu also said that it was due to his efforts that Bill Gates had visited Hyderabad and set up the Microsoft centre in that city.

“After bifurcation, people had voted the TDP to power. Since then, I have been striving to develop the State,” he added.

Dig at Jagan

“When our government was sworn in on June 8, 2014, there was no office. I decided to develop a Capital city, which would be one of the best cities in the world. When I gave a call, the landowners had parted with their land. The farmers had voluntarily given 33,000 acres. In Gannavaram too, the farmers parted with 650 acres.

Jagan Mohan Reddy is casting aspersions on me saying that all this has been done for the sake of one community,” said Mr. Naidu.

At Yerrabalem, there were 1,500 Brahmins, 1,400 Yadavas, 600 Gowdas, 1,400 Padmasalis, and just 100 Kammas, he said.

“Mr. Reddy is mooting three Capitals. Is South Africa a model for our State? This government has constituted five committees in the last seven months, and all these committees are aiming at maligning me,” he alleged.

Ms. Bhuvaneswari, who also spoke, said that Mr. Naidu had always strived to develop Amaravati.

“He used to think about Amaravati even when he was sleeping or eating. He dreams of Amaravati as a people’s city. You (the people) have always been important to him. I have always been accorded secondary importance,” she said.

At Durga temple

Later, Mr. Naidu and Ms. Bhuvaneswari offered prayers at the Kanaka Durga temple in Vijayawada.

Later in a tweet, Mr. Naidu said, “The New Year should bring happiness to all sections of society and ensure their safety in all aspects – money, life and respect. The New Year should show a solution to all their problems. Any celebration is meaningful only if everyone is happy. But the farmers in Amaravati are not happy.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/942rb8/article30454265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VJPG4-NAIDU2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/naidu-expresses-solidarity-with-agitating-farmers-in-capital-area/article30454266.ece
118,2020/01/02,Legal literacy chariot to travel around Dharwad district,"The Department of Justice, in association with the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA), has launched a legal literacy chariot with the objective to educating people on new laws and deliver legal services at the doorstep of petitioners.

Principal District and Sessions Judge Eshappa Bhute, who flagged off the chariot on Thursday, said that the Judiciary, to meet the aspirations of the Constitution of India, has been holding various legal programmes to eliminate injustice from society and deliver quality, speedy justice to the weaker sections, backward communities, the poor, and women and children. Free legal service is provided to them, he said.

To educate people on legal services, legal service units have been set up at prisons, the tahsildar’s office, and child protection units, and a panel of advocates has been appointed to provide legal help. A series of legal education programmes will be held across all schools to inform them about child rights, he added.

He said legal experts would travel in the chariot, and petitioners of civil dispute and family dispute, among others, can approach the legal team and get free assistance. For eligible beneficiaries, free legal aid will be given in court, the judge said.

Zilla Panchayat CEO B.C. Sateesh said village accountants have been given the task of informing people about the legal chariot. Superintendent of Police Varthika Katiyar said the beat police too would be part of the legal team and they would respond immediately to problems related to protection of the public and ensuring peace and harmony in villages. DLSA member-secretary and civil judge R.S. Chinnannavar, and others were present.

119,2020/01/02,KSOU to approach UGC seeking ‘exclusive’ rights on ODL courses,"Even as Karnataka State Open University (KSOU) is claiming exclusive rights for offering courses under Open and Distance Learning (ODL) mode as the State’s only open university, it is planning to approach the University Grants Commission (UGC) seeking the reining in of conventional universities offering correspondence courses additionally, beyond their territorial jurisdiction.

Already, KSOU has raised the issue with the Department of Higher Education and sought exclusive rights for offering ODL programmes, considering the purpose of its establishment. The issue had figured prominently at the recent meeting of the Karnataka State Higher Education Council in Bengaluru, chaired by Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Higher Education, IT and BT C.N. Ashwath Narayan.

KSOU Vice-Chancellor Vidyashankar S. raised the topic at the meeting after conventional universities, including the University of Mysore (UoM), introduced courses under ODL mode. The issue was debated at length by the V-Cs and other participants. A final decision on the matter is awaited.

Prof. Vidyashankar accused the other universities of breaching their territorial jurisdictions for offering ODL courses beyond their territory with mutual NoCs availed for running the correspondence courses.

“We have sought exclusive rights for ODL courses. It is also acceptable if the universities stick to their jurisdiction instead of offering courses throughout the State. UGC has been clear in its guideline on territorial jurisdictions and all of us should comply with it,” he argued.

If the conventional universities don’t stick to their territories, KSOU may be forced to seek UGC intervention. “We have no other choice but to approach the UGC for upholding our sole rights,” said Prof. Vidyashankar. A decision on approaching the UGC will be taken after placing the issue at the Board of Management meeting, he added. The Vice-Chancellor also claimed that the “no objection” letters that the universities had been mutually availing for running ODL courses were not right as per the principles. “This is in contravention of the existing rules. This matter will also be raised with the UGC,” he said.

Claiming that only open universities were allowed to offer ODL courses in Maharashtra following an apparent notification by the government there, Prof. Vidyashankar said such an amendment to the Acts should be enforced in Karnataka too for ensuring the rights of KSOU.

He, however, claimed that there was no threat whatsoever from universities offering distance education courses since KSOU has vast expertise in running such courses.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/uc2xyc/article30464048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGMYSKSOU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ksou-to-approach-ugc-seeking-exclusive-rights-on-odl-courses/article30464049.ece
120,2020/01/02,Rift comes to the fore,"The Mayor, Pushpalatha Jagannath, and the MCC Commissioner, Gurudutt Hegde, got embroiled in a war of words at the fag end of a meeting to discuss Swacch Survekshan 2020 which had dissolved in chaos.

The room was bereft of council members who had left the venue over non-release of mayoral grants. Though the media was present in full strength, an exasperated Mayor lashed out at the Commissioner for being ‘rigid’ on the issue following which he got up from his chair and walked towards his chamber.

The Mayor took objection to it and was heard saying that such an attitude was not correct. The Commissioner shot back, saying “speak to me with respect”'. The situation threatened to snowball into an ugly spat but Mr. Hegde said he would rather discuss the issue with her in the chamber and not in the open hall, and the Mayor agreed.

Later, the Mayor told media persons the Corporation works on a no-profit no-loss basis and the councillors are seeking funds for public works and not for their personal use. They are facing public wrath and obviously they have let off steam by boycotting today’s meeting.

The Mayor said she was empowered to sanction ₹1 crore per ward and it is public money for public works that can be released. “'But the Commissioner keeps citing paucity of funds.”

“The Corporation is never flush with funds and yet it should be managed but how can the Commissioner be so rigid about it’’, she questioned.

In reply to a question the Mayor said she is unable to comprehend the reason for the difference of opinion between the Commissioner and the councillors. Every councillor is keen about the city and all of them have worked for its cleanliness in the past. Perhaps the Commissioner and the councillors are on different wave lengths and there is lack of coordination, the Mayor added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/rift-comes-to-the-fore/article30463828.ece
121,2020/01/02,11.5 lakh people visited 2019 Dasara exhibition,"As many as 11.5 lakh people visited the 90-day-long Dasara exhibition in Mysuru.

Karnataka Exhibition Authority (KEA) chief executive officer B.R. Girish told The Hindu on Thursday that the annual exhibition, which concluded on December 29, drew roughly 50,000 more visitors in 2019. “We had about 11 lakh visitors during the previous Dasara exhibition, which was even extended by two days,” he said.

The Bengaluru-based bidder Fun World Resorts India Pvt. Ltd. had been awarded the contract for the 2019 exhibition for ₹8.25 crore, covering entry ticket, parking fee, amusement park, stalls and food court.

However, the curtain was drawn on the exhibition rather abruptly this time, with it ending at a time when the inflow of visitors had increased. Between 15,000 and 20,000 people visited the premises every day for the last eight to 10 days, KEA sources said.

The holiday season brought a large number of visitors to Mysuru. Several tourists, who wished to visit the exhibition after its conclusion on December 29, were left disappointed.

KEA sources said the bidder initially wrote to them on December 17 and asked for permission to extend the exhibition. The KEA forwarded the letter to the government, but the bidder wrote again on December 23 stating that the government permission was taking too long and hence the exhibition may be concluded on the scheduled date.

This time around, the exhibition was not affected much by rains. Even on the days it rained, there were between 3,000 to 5,000 visitors. “Though it rained for 15 to 20 days, it did not affect the visitors much. We had taken enough precautions for draining rainwater to prevent waterlogging at the exhibition, particularly in the amusement area,” a KEA official said.

Meanwhile, Mr. Girish said the governing body of the KEA would soon take a decision on the Besige Mela, or summer fair, which is held for about 45 days every year during April and May.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/1x2npu/article30463792.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02MYSDASARA2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/115-lakh-people-visited-2019-dasara-exhibition/article30463793.ece
122,2020/01/02,Swachh Survekshan: Councillors threaten non-cooperation,"An appraisal meeting regarding Swachh Survekshan 2020 which will commence from January 4 dissolved in chaos as the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) councillors boycotted the proceedings over non-release of Mayoral grants of ₹50 lakh per ward, here on Thursday.

The Mayoral grant was announced during the Budget last year but was yet to be released owing to paucity of funds. But the councillors used it as a bargaining tool to extract a promise from the Mayor Pushpalatha Jagannath, and the MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde failing which they threatened “not to cooperate’’ for the forthcoming SS 2020 exercise.

Defiant

Though the MCC Commissioner Gurudutt Hegde appealed to the councillors to focus on the objective of the meeting to secure higher rankings in the clean city rankings, the councillors were defiant and walked out in a huff.

The meeting itself began on a heated note with the former mayor Ayub Khan questioning the officials as to why the MCC was ‘’competing’’ in the survey and flayed them for making cleanliness a monthly exercise rather than ensuring that the city was kept clean 24x7 all 365 days of the year. He averred that the door to door collection of waste was not being implemented in at least 50 per cent of the 65 wards of the MCC.

This was supported by a few other members including Shivakumar of the BJP and SBM Manju of the Janata Dal (Secular) who said that their demand for mechanised tippers and autos had not been complied with by the authorities. A large time of the meeting was spent on discussing issues which should ideally be raised in the Council but the members attending the proceedings sidestepped the main issue and focussed on non-release of mayoral grants.

The Commissioner said this was not the forum to discuss the issue and wanted the members to concentrate on the subject at hand. But this provoked some of the councillors who said that they will not budge from their stance.

Mr. Hegde said the MCC was strapped of funds and was finding it difficult to pay the salaries of pourakarmikas who are keeping the city clean and at this juncture he could not make allocation of ₹35 crore. At this point Mr. Manju said then the Mayor should at least announce Rs.25 lakh as grant per ward but it evoked no response and the councillors attending the meeting walked out, leaving the Mayor and officials red-faced.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/y6tclh/article30463785.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02MYSMCC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/swachh-survekshan-councillors-threaten-non-cooperation/article30463786.ece
123,2020/01/02,SJCE to encourage start-ups,"Even as Sri Jayachamarajendra College of Engineering (SJCE), Mysuru was inching towards realising 100 per cent placements of its undergraduate students this year, it has now come forward to ignite creative ideas among its students, encouraging start-ups and innovations.

The college was establishing a centre for incubating innovations and start-ups on its campus. The New Age Incubation Centre (NAIC) will soon be taking shape with students getting space in the facility for bringing about innovations.

Disclosing this here on Thursday, SJCE Principal T.N. Nagabhushan said the government has identified SJCE for establishing the centre and financial assistance would be extended to the students who have “start-up dreams”. Up to a sum of ₹3 lakh can be extended for turning ideas into reality, he said. The land for establishing the centre had been identified and the work on the centre will start soon.

Despite economic recession, more than half of SJCE undergraduate students had got placements with attractive salaries. Many have been placed in top-notch companies with an average annual salary package of ₹10 lakh. A total of 19 students from the core engineering branches, mainly computer science engineering, had been hired this year with an annual package of ₹29 lakh.

Out of 800-plus BE students passing out this year, as many as 674 had been placed with over 144 companies taking part in campus placements. The minimum package offered was between ₹6 lakh and ₹7 lakh per annum.

“The remaining BE students are also expected to be placed in the second phase of the placements which will commence this month. At least 40 companies are expected to attend,” said the SJCE principal.

The college had received a grant of ₹7 crore under TEQIP-III and the funds will be used for upgrading the labs and equipment besides empowering the faculty members and students in the emerging areas with “outcome-based education”. The World Bank-funded project had sanctioned ₹17.5 crore to SJCE under TEQIP-II.

He said Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will get a boost with the college buying a super-computer from C-DAC, Pune. The future lies in AI and machine learning and the college will equip its students in the emerging area.

126,2020/01/02,"Irked over dues, Karnataka private hospitals threaten to stop cashless facility from Feb. 1","With dues to the tune of ₹1,200 crore pending for treatment of patients under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) and Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS), private hospitals across the country have threatened to stop cashless facility under the scheme from February 1.

If implemented, it will impact nearly 36 lakh Central government employees, including their dependants, and pensioners under CGHS and over 52 lakh ex-servicemen and dependants covered under ECHS in over 1,000 empanelled hospitals and nursing homes in 71 cities. Of these, over 1.23 lakh beneficiaries are from Bengaluru.

“We have given the Centre a deadline of two weeks and are hoping for a response. Our dues have accumulated since 2014 and if not cleared at the earliest, we will be constrained to suspend cashless services to beneficiaries,” Alexander Thomas, president of Association of Healthcare Providers of India (AHPI), told The Hindu.

A letter flagging pendency of bills was sent to the Union Ministry of Finance in July 2019 but not much has moved since then, prompting the hospitals to take a call on stopping cashless services.

A majority of the empanelled hospitals are in Delhi, Pune, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Hospital representatives claimed that the pendency has worsened ever since the launch of Ayushman Bharat or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana healthcare scheme.

Giridhar Gyani, APHI Chief Executive Officer, said the healthcare industry is on the brink of financial unsustainability due to pendency of dues. “Agreements that hospitals have signed with these agencies are not being honoured. This has pushed many hospitals to the brink of unsustainability. Some are unable to pay even salary to their staff and there are cases where staff are being laid off,” he said.

The problem is compounded owing to the fact that even CGHS reimbursement rates for procedures have not been revised since 2014, whereas hospital have to pay nominal increment to staff and match inflation-related expenses, he said.

Payment of interest

“We have demanded the government not only clear dues in bulk at the earliest but also henceforth pay an interest of 1% per month on the amount pending if it is not reimbursed within a stipulated period after submission of bills. Such a condition exists in the agreements signed for Ayushman Bharat,” said Dr. Thomas.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/oap9yb/article30463221.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGHOSPITAL1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/private-hospitals-threaten-to-stop-cashless-service-from-feb-1/article30463222.ece

For instance, 96,255 railway tickets are being booked a year by semi-urban and rural customers through Payworld platform alone. The number has been on the rise and is increasing constantly to reach 60,000 tickets per month.

In addition, over 200 Aadhaar-Enabled Payment transactions take place every day in rural pockets, as per data.

Money remittance services are also on the rise with Payworld alone facilitating an average of 9,000 transactions every day with an average ticket size of ₹2,650.

128,2020/01/02,Danta Bhagya develops ‘toothache’,"Six years after it was launched, the State government’s ambitious ‘Danta Bhagya’ scheme has developed a “toothache”. While eleven of the 18 high-tech dental laboratories set up in district hospitals are not being put to use due to non-availability of dental lab technicians, awareness about the scheme has taken a backseat due to lack of funds for Information, Education and Communication (ICE) activities.

The scheme, launched to provide free dentures to senior citizens from BPL category with complete tooth loss, has barely reached 19,407 people since December 7, 2014, when it was launched.

According to the Health Department’s estimate, 16% of the State’s population (25.92 lakh) in the State are toothless and require dentures. The department has tied up with 45 private dental colleges to implement the scheme.

Although laboratories have been set up in 18 district hospitals, only five labs have permanent technicians and two others have outsourced manpower rendering the other laboratories useless. Due to this, officials in charge of oral health in the department had started conducting camps to screen and provide dentures to the needy. However, there was no adequate fund allocation for conducting the camps.

Lack of funds

Sources in the department revealed that a mere ₹10,000 was made available under National Health Mission to conduct each camp, while the requirement was more than ₹30,000. “We shifted to camp mode from April this year and conducted 114 camps so far. We are doing this with assistance from NGOs and organisations such as Lions’ Club and Rotary Club and local MLAs. People who come to the camps have to be provided food and transport, as it requires them to stay in the camp the whole day,” sources said.

Although the department has 31 sanctioned posts of dental lab technicians and 20 are working, 15 have been deputed in medical colleges run by the Medical Education Department. “The government should recruit more technicians or should send back the 15 from the Medical Education department to the Health Department,” sources pointed out.

Ganesh Panchmal Shenoy, former chairperson of the committee that drafted the State’s Oral Health Policy, said it was unfortunate that the government had not recruited lab technicians. “One good thing is that they have a dedicated Deputy Director for Oral Health from the last two years,” he said.

Although an annual allocation of ₹2 crore was made initially for the scheme, the fund was not utilised in the first two years and was diverted for other purposes. Subsequently, a mere ₹50 lakh was set aside annually for distribution of dentures. “We not only need more funds but also guidelines that will enable us to utilise them for IEC and camps,” a senior official said.

Admitting that the scheme needs to be revived, State Health Director Patil Om Prakash R. said the department will seek adequate allocation for ‘Danta Bhagya’ in the coming budget.

“We are also trying to bring back the lab technicians who are on deputation in the medical colleges. As there cannot be separate IEC activities for each scheme, we will create awareness through our common IEC programme,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/7q0dh2/article30463199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGDANTABHAGYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/danta-bhagya-develops-toothache/article30463200.ece
129,2020/01/02,HC notice to Railways on plea challenging ‘superfast surcharge’ on Malgudi Express,"The High Court of Karnataka on Thursday ordered issue of notice to the Indian Railways on a PIL petition, which has questioned the collection of “superfast surcharge” for Malgudi Express plying between Mysuru and Yelahanka in Bengaluru though the train is not operated with the average specified speed.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order on the petition filed by Mohammed Dastagir, a resident of Mysuru city. Pointing out that the average speed of the train should be 55 km/hour or more for designating the train as “superfast” express on broad guage line, the petitioner claimed that the train was not moving in the average specified speed even going by the official travel time declared in the railway timetable.

It was stated in the petition that the Railway’s timetable had fixed 3 hours and 35 minutes as the travel time from Mysuru to Yelahanka, and 3 hours and 15 minutes from Yelahanka to Mysuru to cover the distance of 155.8 km between the two points. However, the petitioner said that the travel time in the timetable discloses that the train is actually travelling at an average speed of only 43.81 km/per hour from Mysuru to Yelahanka and 48.31 km/hour from Yelahanka to Mysuru, and not the average speed of 55 km/hour to be qualified as “superfast” express.

Pointing out that a “superfast surcharge” in the range of ₹15 to ₹75 was being levied depending upon on class of travel in the Malgudi Express, which had been designated as “superfast express” with effect from August 15, 2018, the petitioner alleged that levy of “superfast surcharge” was illegal.

Contending that arrival of the train at both end points were delayed, as per the information available on the Railways website, in the range of 10 minutes to 59 minutes during September-November, 2019, the petitioner claimed that this delay had further reduced the average speed of the train, much below than the required 55 km/hour.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/w2ywch/article30463172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BGHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-notice-to-railways-on-plea-challenging-superfast-surcharge-on-malgudi-express/article30463173.ece
130,2020/01/02,"SDPI urges Centre to stop NPR, NRC processes","The Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) has urged the Union government to immediately stop the processes pertaining to the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizenship (NRC).

Addressing presspersons here on Thursday, State president of SDPI Iliyas Mohammad Thumbi strongly condemned the police firing in Mangaluru and alleged that it was the police who were responsible for the death of two persons.

He said that the police atrocities against protesters had increased only in BJP-ruled States and demanded an independent inquiry by a High Court judge into the Mangaluru firing incident in which two persons lost their lives.

He said that there were several loose ends in the police story about the incidents leading to the firing and only a thorough inquiry would bring out the truth and ensure justice to the families of the persons killed.

Taking exception to the State government’s decision on withholding the compensation announced earlier to the families of the deceased, Mr. Iliyas termed it an inhumane act and added it was an insult to the State too.

He said that the SDPI, along with like-minded parties and organisations, will continue its agitation against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the NRC and would not relent unless the Union government withdrew the Act.

Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Centre, Mr. Iliyas alleged that the CAA, the NRC, and the NPR were conspiracies to impose the Hindutva agenda on the country.

To a query, he said that it was not just the SDPI, but also members of different organisations and people from different walks of life who were opposing the Centre’s move.

Pointing out that there were contradictions in what Mr. Modi had told about CAA and NRC, and what Home Minister Amit Shah claimed, he asked whom should the people believe.

“Meanwhile, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath speaks about revenge against protesters, which is a very dangerous trend,” he said.

To a another query, he said that the Centre’s move had put the unity and diversity of the country in danger and it was highly condemnable that efforts were being made to undermine the Constitution of the country.

He clarified that the protests against the CAA, the NRC, and the NPR would continue till its logical end.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sdpi-urges-centre-to-stop-npr-nrc-processes/article30462313.ece

While students led by the office-bearers of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) took out a procession in support of the CAA, several women led by the office-bearers of the Udaan Welfare Association staged a protest before the Mini-Vidhana Soudha.

The students supporting the CAA carried a huge tricolour over their heads and congregated at Brindavan Circle near the statue of freedom fighter Sangolli Rayanna and raised slogans in support of CAA.

They also held placards with slogans supporting the CAA and emphasised the need to protect the country and the role of students in doing so.

Addressing the students, ABVP office-bearers said that CAA was required in the interest of the country.

132,2020/01/02,Three-day krishi mela from tomorrow,"The College of Agricultural Sciences, affiliated to the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad, will hold a three-day krishi mela from Saturday [January 4] with the theme ‘conservation of water and good health’.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, S.B. Kalaghatagi, dean of the college, said that this year owing to public demand the event will be held for three days. Previously, it was held for two days.

Stating that mechanisation of agriculture is the primary focus of the event, he said that since the farmers are facing an acute labour problem, machines are being introduced for the various stages of cultivation.

“We will showcase several simple agriculture machines during the mela which can be used to save time and money,” he said.

A demonstration of specially-designed drones, to identify crops not growing properly, will be held.

Dr. Kalaghatagi said that various seminars on lemons, grapes, and pomegranates will also be held since these are largely grown in the district.

A seminar on soil testing will also be held to educate farmers on the importance of testing soil for better yield.

Dr. Kalaghatagi said that since Vijayapura largely has dry-land based farming, farmers will be taught on cultivating crops that are suitable to this region.

Stating that goat and dairy farming have become good alternative source of income for farmers, he said that different varieties of goats and cows will be displayed during the event.

A flower show will also be held and different varieties of flowers will be showcased.

Considering the demand of dog lovers, this time the mela will also have a dog show where different breeds of canines would be displayed.

“Since we are holding the event on a bigger scale this time, we have also increased the stalls, where farmers and agencies can display their products, to 135,” he said.

He urged farmers to make use of the event for increasing their output and the earning.

133,2020/01/02,These birds are a feast for the eyes,"The backwaters of the Almatti dam on the Ghataprabha are teeming with migratory birds coming from Siberia.

These beautiful birds cover nearly 5,000 km to reach the backwaters during the migration season between November and February.

“During this season, they come for better habitation, hatching, and raising chicks. When the chicks learn to fly, they return home and come back the next year,” said Devaraj, District Forest Officer of Bagalkot.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said that around 50 varieties of birds, numbering over 15,000, visit the backwaters.

“In the last decade, the number of migratory birds has significantly increased. The primary reason for the migration is that the birds live in countries, such as Siberia, where the temperature falls below zero during the winter. Therefore, they travel to warmer areas, which are conducive to laying and hatching eggs,” Mr. Devaraj said.

He said that since the Almatii backwaters cover around a 100-km area, it creates vast shallow ponds which are good for the birds to move and pick up food.

The birds include flamingoes, spoonbills, pintail ducks, river terns, seagulls, bar-headed geese, among others.

These birds are seen largely in Mallapur, Chikka Sangam, and Herkal villages in the district.

Mr. Devaraj said that the farmers are made aware on protecting these birds and the legal action they would face if they kill the birds or steal their eggs.

“We have also deployed staff to prevent the poaching of these birds. We hope that if these birds do not face any harm, then more of them will keep coming here. It will also become a place for ornithologists and bird lovers in general,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/c94h8b/article30462451.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BG-FLAMINGOES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fowl-weather-at-almatti-backwaters/article30461906.ece

The office-bearers of Hassan district unit of Karnataka State Government Pharmacists Association, in a press conference, said this was the first phase of the protest. It would be intensified in the coming days. “We will be working with black ribbons on till January 12. We have planed a protest march from Freedom Park to the office of Commissioner of Health Department in Bengaluru on January 20,” said M. Eligar, vice-president.

He said the pharmacists had been working under tremendous pressure with no sufficient staff. “Among the 161 posts sanctioned for Hassan district, only 60 have been filled up. Going by the patients’ strength at Hassan Institute of Medical Sciences in Hassan, there should have been more than 20 pharmacists, but at present only one is working.”

The government had been forcing D group employees to do the job of pharmacists, which was wrong. “The government procures medicines worth crores of rupees, but there are no sufficient staff to handle medicines.

After inaugurating a national conference on Vedas here, Mr. Khan, while interacting with reporters, said citizenship was an issue that fell within the ambit of the Central government and hence the State had no role in it. Hence the resolution was inconsequential.

Mr. Khan said the resolution was passed as per the recommendations of the Indian History Congress held in Kannur recently. This had a criminal ingredient.

But Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the resolution was in order and the Assembly reserved the right to pass such a resolution. The Assembly had passed similar resolutions earlier too, he said.

The Governor’s opinion is set to draw flak of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) that had unanimously passed the resolution moved by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the Assembly.

Cong. opposition

Senior Congress leaders in the State have come out strongly against the Governor. Former Chief Minister Oommen Chandy urged the Chief Minister to rein in the Governor if he was crossing the limits. The Governor should examine whether he had the right to snub a resolution unanimously adopted by the Assembly. He would get respect only if he maintained decorum conforming his post.

K. Muraleedharan, MP, who led a long march at Kuttiyadi , said that the Governor should resign. If the Governor did not step down he would not be allowed to move freely on the roads in the State.

151,2020/01/02,Cusat students may get back answer scripts,"The Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat) is considering a proposal to return evaluated answer scripts to students.

The initiative forms part of the efforts to step up transparency and efficiency in the conduct of university examinations.

To reduce doubts

It is expected that the move will reduce anxieties and doubts in the minds of students about the valuation process. The university now provides photocopies of answer scripts to those who apply for them after collecting a fee.

Senior university administrators point out that they often receive complaints from students alleging that they are denied marks by the evaluators. Now such cases are resolved based on the merit of the complaint.

Opposed earlier

The idea had been met with resistance from a section of the faculty when it was pitched earlier. “But now we are considering it seriously, especially after the directive from Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, who is the Chancellor of all State universities, to improve efficiency of the examination and valuation process,’’ say university administrators.

The examination wing hopes that the move will also help resolve the difficulties in storing thousands of answer scripts. It will also result in a dip in the number of applications for revaluation.

The officials express the hope that the move would help in reducing the frequency of supplementary examinations. These supplementary exams are mostly held based on complaints related to the evaluation process.

Free of cost

152,2020/01/02,KFD reported in Wayanad,"A case of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD), also known as monkey fever, a viral disease transmitted to humans through a species of ticks usually found on monkeys, has been reported from the Begur area under the Appapara Family Health Centre in Thirunelly grama panchayat in Wayanad district.

The patient, a 28-year-old woman, is undergoing treatment at the Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode, and is reportedly out of critical condition. The patient had been admitted to the District Hospital, Mananthavady, on December 26 with symptoms of KFD and she was referred to the MCH on 28 December. The samples collected from the patient were sent to the Manipal Centre for Virus Research and it had been confirmed as a case of KFD, District Medical Officer R. Renuka said.

Surveillance had been stepped up in the hotspot areas identified by the Health Department on the fringes of forests in the district, Dr. Renuka said.

Meanwhile, Wayanad Collector Adeela Abdulla has convened a meeting of senior officials of the Health, Forest and Animal husbandry Departments on Friday to assess the situation.

Preventive measures

“Directions have been given to the Health, Forest and Animal Husbandry Departments to intensify preventive measures, including a vaccination drive, to combat KFD,” Ms. Abdulla told The Hindu.

The frontline forest staff and high-risk population living on the forest fringes had been advised to use personal protection measures, including gloves and gumboots, and repellent lotions before they entered the forest, she said.

Forest personnel have been asked to collect details of unnatural deaths of monkeys in areas where the outbreak of the disease had been reported earlier.

The Health Department had been continuing a vaccination drive that was launched in January 2019 and had stocked 1,000 doses of KFD vaccine for the purpose, sources said.

The first case of the disease in the district was reported in 2013 and another confirmed case was reported in 2014. The virus wreaked havoc in the district in 2015 when 102 cases were reported and 11 persons died of the disease. Nine cases were reported in 2016. Though two suspected cases were reported in 2017, not a single case was reported in 2018. But seven cases, including two deaths, were reported in 2019.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kfd-reported-in-wayanad/article30463876.ece

He was inaugurating the Navathi celebrations of the enthronement of the late Geevarghese II as Catholicos of the East, in Kottayam on Thursday. As spiritual head of this ancient indigenous church of India, he believed in the participation of the Christian community for social development.

“The Catholicos was also a leader who worked for the empowerment of Dalits and the unification of Travancore and Kochi,” the Governor added.

On the occasion, he congratulated the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church for its endeavour to extend housing, educational and marriage aids to financially backward families.

154,2020/01/02,No CAA in States ruled by Cong.: Venugopal,"Seven States in the country where the Congress is in power or is part of the ruling dispensation will not implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary K.C. Venugopal has said.

Mr. Venugopal was speaking after flagging off the first-ever long march being taken out by MPs in the State in protest against CAA and for the protection of the Constitution at Guruvayur on Thursday.

The march led by T.N. Prathapan, MP, was attended by Ramya Haridas, MP, Anil Akkara, MLA, and senior Congress leaders, including O. Abdurahiman Kutty, Joseph Challissery, A.P. Anil Kumar, Padmaja Venugopal, V. Balram, Therambil Ramakrishnan, Suranad Rajasekharan, P.A. Madhavan and Jose Vellur.

The long march concluded at Thriprayar.

Responding to the remarks made by Union Minister Ravisankar Prasad that the anti-CAA resolution passed by the State Assembly was unconstitutional, the AICC general secretary said the Minister need not teach the Kerala leaders what was Indian Constitution.

Image tarnished

“The CAA targets a religion. The CAA has tarnished the secular image of India in front of the world. The Centre is trying to link citizenship with religion. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act breaches equality for justice.”

Mr. Venugopal alleged that Home Minister Amit Shah had become an expert in telling lies. The Union government was misusing all positions such as that of the Governor and the Army Chief. The protest was not a fight to dethrone the government, but to protect the country.

The struggle was initiated by students beyond caste and religious boundaries.

Dividing country

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi is dividing the country on communal lines to get a few votes. We will continue the fight till the government withdrew the Act,” he said.

155,2020/01/02,Alappuzha to get more family health centres,"The second phase of Mission Aardram is making good progress in the district. As part of the second phase, 40 Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are being transformed into Family Health Centres (FHCs). Of these, four FHCs at Purakkad, Veeyapuram, Panavally and Perumbalam are ready for inauguration.

From 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

Aardram is a Statewide scheme aimed at creating people-friendly health delivery systems. Officials said the conversion of PHCs to FHCs would mean that all the institutions would work from 9 a.m. till 6 p.m., delivering outpatient services.

Besides, the FHCs would have improved facilities, including consultation rooms, waiting room for patients, drinking water facility, modern laboratory, chairs, toilet for differently abled, sign boards, breastfeeding room and so on. A pre check-up room for examining blood pressure, diabetes and body mass index would be arranged. As part of upgradation, additional staff, including doctors and nurses, would be provided in FHCs.

In the first phase of the programme, 14 PHCs were upgraded into FHCs in the district. Once the second phase was completed, the number of FHCs in the district would rise to 54.

The 36 centres being upgraded in the second phase are Cherthala South, Vayalar, Pallithode, Vallikunnam, Nooranad, Chettikulangara, Thakazhi, Cheriyanad, Karthikappally, Karuvatta, Pallana, Aryad, Thottapally, Punnapra South, Ambalapuzha North, Mararikulam North, Vallathode, Thuravoor South, Kadakkarappally, Thazhakkara, Thamarakulam, Bharanikavu, Krishnapuram, Devikulangara, Pathiyoor, Kavalam, Ramankary, Kuppapuram, Venmony, Eramallikkara, Puliyoor, Mulakuzha, Kadampoor, Chingoli, Arattupuzha, and Ezhupunna.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/alappuzha-to-get-more-family-health-centres/article30463835.ece
156,2020/01/02,Spirited Kerala consumes legal liquor worth ₹523 crore,"Kerala bid a spirited goodbye to 2019 by imbibing nearly ₹523 crore of legal liquor.

Citizens in Thiruvananthapuram followed by their compatriots in Kochi bought more legal liquor than residents in other urban localities during the Christmas-New Year season of heady indulgence.

Officials said the sale of legal liquor increased by 16% in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, according to initial estimates of the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the State-owned liquor wholesale and retail monopoly.

Social acceptance

An excise official attributed the increase in sale to gaining social acceptance for alcohol in family and other get-togethers and functions such as marriages and birthday parties.

Outlets near beach and hill resorts had also registered a marked increase in liquor sales, pointing to the rise in tourist arrivals. The sale of liquor had peaked in clubs and bar hotels that organised New Year eve parties. Many managements kept the bar open till midnight.

The amount of alcohol sold through licensed bar hotels and beer and wine parlours and toddy outlets remained unquantified for now.

Illicit brew

Excise officials conceded that bootleg liquor, homemade fortified wine, hooch and moonshine also appropriated a sizeable segment of the vast market for cheap and hard spirits.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of legal liquor has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on branded alcohol products and an arguably disproportionate number of dry days.

The Left Democratic Front government had raised the legal drinking age from 21 to 23 years in 2017 in an alleged attempt to blunt the Congress-led Opposition's criticism that it had adopted a permissive liquor policy to pander to the interests of bar hoteliers and distillers.

However, officials said the move appeared to have merely driven underage drinking underground.

Officials said that majority of consumers preferred popular brands of cheap Indian made brandy and rum. Premium counters retailing costlier brands and foreign-made foreign liquor also registered high sales.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/qhx06/article30467715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03tv-BEVCOcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-drinks-legal-liquor-worth-523-crore/article30462622.ece
157,2020/01/02,BDJS will contest in Kuttanad bypoll,"The Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS), a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), will contest in the forthcoming Kuttanad Assembly byelection, BDJS president Thushar Vellappally has said.

He was speaking to reporters at Cherthala on Thursday.

“A BDJS member will contest as NDA candidate in the Kuttanad bypoll. A decision regarding party's candidate will be taken at a later stage,” he said.

Mr. Thushar said the BDJS State council had decided to seek an explanation from the party's general secretary Subash Vasu for engaging in anti-party activities. The BDJS president alleged that Mr. Vasu had cheated the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam and BDJS.

“He was involved in several financial frauds. After illegal financial activities involving him came to light, he is levelling baseless allegations. He has been given 15 days to give an explanation. If found unsatisfactory, the party will take action against him,” Mr. Thushar said.

He said that Mr. Vasu was no longer eligible to remain as the chairman of the Spices Board of India.

Last week, the SNDP Yogam dissolved its Mavelikara union. The SNDP Yogam general council took the decision after the Crime Branch launched a probe against Mr. Vasu, who is the president of SNDP Yogam Mavelikara union, and secretary B. Suresh Babu, among others, based on a complaint alleging that they had been involved in a financial fraud under the banner of a microfinance scheme.

Mr. Vasu has recently come out against SNDP Yogam general secretary Vellappally Natesan and both are at loggerheads.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bdjs-will-contest-in-kuttanad-bypoll/article30462341.ece
158,2020/01/02,Parties should keep off religion: Archbishop,"Hailing the Nair Service Society (NSS) stand on the issue of women’s entry into the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, Archbishop of Changanassery diocese Mar Joseph Perumthottam Metropolitan has urged political parties not to meddle in the internal affairs of any religion.

Inaugurating the 143rd Mannam Jayanthi celebrations at Perunna in Changanassery on Thursday, the metropolitan said that all matters relating to faith and religion should not be measured using the scale of logic. “When political parties do not permit the intervention of religion in politics, they too should not interfere in the internal affairs of religions. Even if a change is required, it should evolve from within and not from outside. When the Sabarimala issue hurt religions sentiments, the political parties instantly witnessed the result of the `right stance' adopted by the NSS,’’ he said.

According to him, the NSS has always stood as a counter-force to the communal forces in Kerala and played a remarkable role in protecting the values of secularism. “When several parts of our country witnessed communal polarisation and some forces tried to take political gain out of it, the Hindu community in the State, especially the NSS, stood up to the challenge and warded off the danger,” he said.

He lauded the role played by the NSS in ensuring reservation for the economically weaker sections among forward castes. He vowed to stand by the NSS to fight off attempts to curb the freedom of private managements in the education sector.

Regarding Mannath Padmanabhan, the Archbishop said the role played by Mannam for his own community and the public at large, and his achievements made him one of the front line leaders in the history of renaissance. “The lamp lighted by Mannam for the renaissance of Kerala is still alive, as the NSS leadership never deviated from the path shown by him,” he added.

NSS president P.N. Narendranathan Nair presided over. Writer C. Radhakrishnan and former Vice Chancellor of Kerala University of Health Science M.K.C. Nair delivered commemoration speech on Mannam. NSS general secretary G. Sukumaran Nair welcomed the gathering and treasurer M. Sasikumar proposed a vote of thanks.

159,2020/01/02,A case of missed opportunity for BJP,"The strategical lapse of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) State leadership in prompting its lone member O. Rajagopal to register a strong dissent against a resolution passed by the Assembly against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) has rendered a major jolt to a campaign launched at the behest of its national leadership in defence of the Act.

Had Mr. Rajagopal sought a division on the resolution, the Speaker would have been forced to call for a poll and he could have voted against the resolution. And that one vote of Mr. Rajagopal could have presented as a strong demonstration of the BJP’s protest against the resolution jointly moved by the government and the Opposition.

In the absence of a specific strategy, Mr. Rajagopal chose to remain silent when the House put the resolution to vote and it was passed unanimously. The failure in ironing out a strategy has worked out to the chagrin of the BJP State leadership and once again left the party that was trying to build up a resistance to the strong backlash against the Act on the back foot.

Those akin to the legislature procedures deem it as a classic case of missed opportunity for the BJP. Since a slew of petitions are pending against the Act in the apex court, Mr. Rajagopal could have raised a point of order challenging the tenability of the resolution on an issue pending before the court. This would have offered him a breathing space to present the party’s stance on the Act and also defend the Centre for legislating it in Parliament.

Significantly, the lapse has been exposed at a time when the national leadership is sweating it out to reiterate the Central stance on the issue, especially in Kerala where the government and the Opposition have teamed up to put the BJP in the dock on the issue. The slip in seeking the division may get passed off as a naive act, but has rendered a major jolt to the party machinery that had been building up a campaign.

The stance of Mr. Rajagopal against the Central decision to do away with the quota for Anglo Indian community too has sparked off a discussion as it contravenes the stated position of the national leadership on the issue. This is also being cited as a pointer to the lack of cohesion in the State unit that had been remaining headless since P.S. Sreedharan Pillai was made the Governor of Mizoram.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/a-case-of-missed-opportunity-for-bjp/article30461755.ece
160,2020/01/02,Congress in a spot over Rahul’s letter,"The Congress found itself in a spot on Thursday after its Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi “endorsed” the Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS), the flagship programme of the Left Democratic Front (LDF) government to harness the wealth and expertise of non-resident Keralites (NoRKs) for the development of the State.

The Congress unit in Kerala had boycotted the convention terming it a splurge and spectacle of no consequence to the people.

However, Mr. Gandhi’s letter came as an unexpected propaganda windfall for Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He immediately tweeted the message on his social media account to the discomfiture of the Congress leaders.

In a letter on December 12, 2019, Mr. Gandhi had said the “LKS is a great platform to connect with the diaspora and recognise their contribution.”

‘Misrepresented’

Congress general secretary K.C. Venugopal and Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala came out against Mr. Vijayan, saying he was trying to whip up a controversy as the Wayanad MP’s letter was only a gesture of courtesy. Mr. Gandhi had sent the letter on December 12 while the Congress-led Opposition United Democratic Front decided to keep away from the LKS on December 20, Mr. Chennithala said.

161,2020/01/02,"Frame law on expats’ welfare, Centre told","Blaming the Union government for not initiating steps for the welfare of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) working in various countries, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said Kerala will exert pressure for a legislation to ensure the welfare of expatriates.

“There is no national policy or legislation regarding the welfare of NRI’s in spite of the challenges and exploitation that expatriates face abroad. The Centre is interested only in their remittances and is leaving their welfare to the States,’’ the Chief Minister said while presenting the approach paper at the second Loka Kerala Sabha (LKS) here on Thursday.

There was no proper mechanism for providing information to those going abroad for employment and to intervene in case of exigencies. The Centre’s insensitiveness towards the problems faced by expatriates was quite unfortunate, he said. Even the Centre was not releasing the official figures of expats available with the Bureau of Immigration (BOI).

It was unfortunate that the Centre did not even equip Indian embassies to efficiently interfere and end exploitation. The State government was trying to extend help through the Pravasi Legal Cell.

Pointing out that the country was yet to have a national policy to ensure rehabilitation of returnees, Mr. Vijayan said the State had taken steps in this regard by strengthening the activities of NoRKA and Pravasi Welfare Board. A consortium jointly with expatriates, and the State and Central governments should be formed. The LKS should appeal to the Centre for legislation to ensure the welfare of NRIs.

The LKS should also initiate steps to uphold our language and culture. Short-term courses for expats in cultural institutions such as Kalamandalam could be mooted, the Chief Minister said.

Pointing out that migration of Keralites had come down from 7 lakh to 5.25 lakh in three years, Mr. Vijayan said the State was trying to ensure safety of migrants and was in constant touch with the respective State governments.

Listing out the steps taken to make the State investor-friendly, the Chief Minister said expats had invested recently in major infra projects. “The government expects not only financial investments, but also investment in skill and knowledge,” he said.

Speaker P. Sreeramakrishnan, who presided over the function, said LKS was an exemplary model for strengthening democratic process. There should be a collective platform to uphold our culture, language and tradition.

After inaugurating the national conference on Vedas here, Mr. Khan, while interacting with reporters, said that the resolution was unconstitutional. Citizenship was an issue that figured in the ambit of the Centre and hence the State had no role in it. The resolution was insignificant, he said.

Mr. Khan also said that the resolution was passed as per the proposal of the Indian History Congress held at Kannur recently. This had a “criminal ingredient”, he said.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said that the resolution was in order and the Assembly reserved the right to pass such a resolution.

163,2020/01/02,Children’s ‘climate circle’ raises a point,"Thousands of students from schools and colleges in the district formed a ‘climate circle’ around the Thekkinkadu Maidan here on Friday, with a pledge to protect nature.

The initiative was organised by the Students for Climate Resilience with the theme ‘Change the economy ... not the climate’. They formed the circle along the 3-km inner ring of Swaraj Round.

Climate activist Ridhima Pandey addressed the gathering. “Why should we children suffer for your actions,” she seemed to raise a question to society.

“You people lived all these years by exploiting nature. We are suffering for your irresponsible actions. We children are ready to fight as we have to secure our future. Nobody else is bothered about it,” she said.

The 12-year-old from Haridwar was among the 16 children along with Greta Thunberg, who filed a complaint at the UN Climate Action Summit against the apathy of governments towards tackling climate crisis. She said the government was working just on on paper. Nothing on the ground.

Her slogan

“I want to save the future of all the children and all people of future generations,” is her famous slogan. “People think about protection of nature only when they face natural calamities. All are busy with blame game. The government should formulate politics to tackle climate change,” she said.

“The situation has become so critical that people had to walk with masks in Delhi. Children and elderly people are the most affected. If we remain silent, the condition will happen anywhere in the country. We fear that if things go like this, we may have to carry oxygen cylinders in our bags,” Ms. Pandey said.

The entire world is going through extreme climatic conditions. Schools had to close whenever there is heatwave, extreme humidity, rain or drought.

Addressing a public meeting after the event, environmental activist Sagar Dhara said every country should declare a climate emergency urgently. “If countries fail to reduce green gas emissions, it will be difficult to control the situation.

In a rare gesture, 1,000-odd students of the school wrote on the school compound wall their names and the most significant things they know about their country. They made their imprints within the

letters that read “India Ente Rajyamaanu” (India is my country).

First, they outlined the initial words of the national pledge in large letters in Malayalam. Then, each student wrote their name, and that of the country’s major rivers, mountains, birds, animals and memorials

using different colour pens. They used Malayalam, English, Hindi, Arabic, Urdu and Sanskrit languages.

The students also wrote the names of major freedom fighters, writers and reformers. They also took a pledge to uphold the country’s secular legacy.

The school’s Social Science Club had taught the children the importance of protecting the earth and being vigilant against landslips through a unique project of making mud and paper houses and placing

167,2020/01/02,K-RERA will ensure transparency: CM,"The Kerala Real Estate Regulatory Authority (K-RERA) will help build trust in the real estate sector and infuse it with transparency and efficiency, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.

The activities of a few individuals have served to malign this important sector to the extent that it has been equated to a ‘mafia,’ the Chief Minister said, formally inaugurating K-RERA at a function here.

With its emphasis on protecting the interests of consumers (buyers, allottees), K-RERA focusses on the prevention of malpractices in the real estate sector, he said.

Duping of buyers

Instances of buyers being duped by a section in the real estate sector had prompted the Parliament to pass the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act in 2016 making it mandatory for all States to form RERAs. K-RERA is designed to prevent such malpractices in Kerala.

Realtors who function in a lawful manner will not find themselves inconvenienced by RERA, Mr. Vijayan said.

The real estate sector is integral to the development of land. Negative financial trends in real estate affects the economic sector as a whole.

If policies are favourable, the sector can grow. So it is important to have policies and approaches that do not weaken it.

While the sector has witnessed spectacular growth in the past few decades, the absence of an effective regulatory mechanism was the main reason for the problems associated with real estate sector.

“This is not a sector which should be equated to a ‘mafia’,” the Chief Minister said.

From Oct. 2019

Technically, K-RERA came into being in October last year with P.H. Kurian as chairman and Preetha P. Menon as member. The Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, makes it compulsory for builders to register projects with the State-level RERA.

Real estate agents also need to get themselves with the authority. RERA registration is applicable to projects where the land to be developed is 500 square metres or more and the number of apartments is eight or more inclusive of all phases.

169,2020/01/02,Women in Cinema Collective hails report by Hema Commission,"The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC) has lauded the submission of the report by the Hema Commission, appointed by the State government to study the problems faced by women in Malayalam cinema industry, calling it an “incredible New Year gift”.

The government had constituted the Commission in July 2017, in response to the WCC’s request.

The WCC expressed hope that the government will pro-actively act on the basis of the recommendations of the commission leading the way to form a strong legal framework for the film industry, which has so far been functioning as an unorganised sector without proper compliance to the gender justice and labour laws of the land.

A milestone

“The formation of WCC was an organic reaction to the horrific experience our colleague had to go through in February 2017. The constitution of the commission was a direct response to our requests to the government and was a very important acknowledgement of the issues we face in our workspace. This is the first time that a commission of study has been appointed for such purpose in the Indian film industry and is truly a milestone in the history of Indian cinema workspace,” said a statement by the WCC.

The three-member commission recommended the setting up of a tribunal with a district judge as its head to settle issues within the film industry.

Casting couch

The report flags major issues faced by women in the industry, including the practice of casting couch, a euphemism for demanding sexual favours in return for work opportunities.

“We, the community of women in Kerala, especially the women of Malayalam cinema sincerely commend and thank the government of Kerala and the Hema Commission for this step towards the betterment of our workspace. We hope that the implementation of the recommendations of this report will provide women with more opportunities, the courage to step into the field as well as bring our society closer to the dream of gender equality. This victory is the voice of the voiceless. We hold it very close to our heart as an incredible New Year gift,” said the WCC.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wcc-hails-report-by-hema-commission/article30454716.ece
170,2020/01/02,Learning to walk again,"It is the time of the year when resolutions are made for exercise every day. And the tragedy of the times is that humans, who had evolved millions of years ago to an efficient bipedal body, now needs tips for walking, says orthopaedic surgeon R. Venugopal.

The human body is called the most efficient because its locomotive system, the rhythmic movement of the body, revitalises each and every cell of the body, said Dr. Venugopal.

However, now that this efficient body is resting most of the time, with the food intake going up, people now need walking plans and a mobile app to rediscover walking, he said. “The sad part is that natural walking has given way to artificial walking. The Internet is full of tips for walking,” he added.

How to walk

Holding head with a straight forward vision, chin parallel to the ground, a straight back — not arched, swinging arms freely with a slight bend in the elbows, shoulders moving naturally and the feet moving from heel to toe — this is how a walk is described.

People are more interested in knowing how many calories should be burnt, what is the daily calorie requirement, how much extra calories adds extra fat and so on. Recent studies have also shown that one adds 200 calories a day when eating out, said Dr. Venugopal.

Walking is the answer to a number of non-communicable diseases or lifestyle diseases of modern times. Walking keeps the heart in shape, balances the extra sugar in the body, improves the lung power, enhances vitamin D and so on. It is also said to be the best stress reliever, a major aspect in lifestyle diseases. Alzheimer’s disease, liver disorders and many other metabolic dysfunctions in the body point to a lack of exercise that should come naturally to the body.

People need to ensure good bone health too, said Dr. Venugopal. A calcium-rich diet, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercises are good for bones, he added.

The many merits

Walking is easy and gentle on joints, builds and strengthens muscles, helps maintain bone mass, reduces osteoporosis, slows the development of arthritis, and increases joints’ flexibility and a range of movements, he added.

Regular walking helps people keep their mobility and prevent a fall, especially in the elderly. It gives the body a good posture, reduces back pain and provides spinal stability.

Physiotherapists, who help people rediscover their ability of body locomotion, come across many issues, especially knee pain, for overweight and obese people. Aqua walking, inside a pool, can reduce the stress on joints, according to physiotherapist Prince J. Francis.

On treadmill

One has to slowly increase the speed and distance of walking to get the best results, he said. Besides, it is always better to walk on natural surfaces than on treadmill, said Mr. Francis. The natural gait cycle or the walking pattern is lost on the treadmill, he said. It is also not recommended for people with back and knee pain, he added.

171,2020/01/02,Kerala for steps to curb alien plants’ growth in NBR,"The Forest and Wildlife Department is planning to adopt steps to arrest the rampant growth of invasive plants, especially Senna spectabilis, in the forest areas of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (NBR), including the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary.

“The spread of invasive plants, especially Senna spectabilis, is posing a major threat to the forest areas of the reserve, owing to its quick growth and coppicing character,” said B.N. Anjan Kumar, Chief Conservator of Forest, Wildlife, Palakkad.

The tree species was found in nearly 10 sq km area of the 344.44 sq km sanctuary around five years ago.

Now, it had invaded to more than 50 sq km of the sanctuary,” he said.

A recent study of the Ferns Nature Conservation Society recorded the presence of the plant in 78.91 sq km area of the sanctuary.

The plant has started to invade the adjacent Bandipur and Nagarhole tiger reserves in Karnataka and the Mudumalai tiger reserve in Tamil Nadu, P.A. Vinayan, president of the society, said.

Earlier, the plant species was planted as avenue trees in Wayanad.

Mass flowering

Due to mass flowering and drying of bamboo species in Wayanad, lots of open spaces were created which had been occupied by Senna spectabilis.

“An adult tree grows up to 15 to 20 metres in a short period of time and every year distributes thousands of seeds after gregarious flowering. The thick foliage arrests the growth of other indigenous tree and grass species and causes food shortage for the wildlife population, especially herbivores. Moreover, wildlife will not feed on the leaf of the treeas it is not palatable for them,” Mr.Anjan Kumar said.

Chemical measures

“The vayal ecosystem (marshy land) of the forest area now has this plant in large numbers.

The allelochemicals produced by this plant adversely affect the germination and growth of the native species,” T.K. Hrideek, scientist, Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI), who conducted a study on invasive plants, said.

“The KFRI has developed some physical and chemical measures to tackle the threat of the plant. Though we have been following the physical method to tackle the issue for the past five years, it is yet to have any desired effect.

Hence, we are planning to adopt an integrated method combining physical as well as chemical measures to address the issue,” Mr. Anjan Kumar said.

Tiger reserves

With the adjacent tiger reserves also under threat, managers of these reserves had agreed to follow similar steps to address the issue. The issue would be discussed at interstate meetings, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ugkstc/article30454664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/tv02waysns,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-for-steps-to-curb-alien-plants-growth-in-nbr/article30454665.ece
172,2020/01/02,Bhangra meets Bollywood in 'Bhangra Paa Le',"Ten years ago, when Jon M. Chu’s Step Up 3D hit theatres, Sunny Kaushal joined its audiences thrice. “Once [I watched it] with my friends,” says the 30-year-old, his voice still struck with awe, “and twice I went alone to just get the experience. It globally changed the language of dance and how you could incorporate technology into dancing.” His Bhangra Paa Le (BPL) co-star, Rukshar Dhillon, similarly reveres Shaad Ali’s 2005 comedy Bunty Aur Babli for its dance numbers (Vaibhavi Merchant won an award for choreographing Kajra Re). Both have been dancing for as long as they can remember, mimicking dance routines and choreographing entire sets with their siblings. And for both, films played a huge part in their love for grooving. Over telephonic conversations, it’s clear the young actors hope to create a similar legacy with BPL, a musical drama by debuting director Sneha Taurani, which also featuring Shriya Pilgaonkar.

Cultural call

Centred on an all-India bhangra competition and an apotheotic dance battle that takes place in London, the film follows a young dancer Jaggi (Kaushal) and his rivalry with Simi (Dhillon). Simi is refreshingly, an unapologetically competitive and focused woman, and what drew Dhillon to the spunky character was her relationship with her mother. “[It is] the kind of mother-daughter relationship where you don’t have to say much,” says Dhillon, “She understands your dreams and goals, and I think they become her dreams and goals too.”

Rukshar Dhillon

For Dhillon, Simi’s relationship seemed like a reflection of her mother’s unwavering support as she made the unexpected turn towards acting after pursuing a degree in fashion design. The 26-year-old actor got her break in commercials before she debuted in the Kannada action thriller Run Antony (2016) and a number of Telugu films. Her co-star Kaushal’s start in the industry, however, was behind the camera as an assistant director on the Prateik Babbar and Kalki Koechlin-starrer My Friend Pinto (2011), and Ali Abbas Zafar’s Gunday (2014). After debuting on the screen with the 2016 comedy road film Sunshine Music Tours and Travels, and following it with the sports drama Gold (2018), Kaushal gravitated to BPL because he was surrounded by Punjabi music and bhangra growing up. “It was an opportunity to do something for my culture,” he says.

Evolving form

Associated closely with celebrating the spring harvest, the folk dance now has travelled along with Indian diaspora across Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. To highlight one of its contemporary forms, Dhillon explains that the choreographies for the film offer a fusion of the folk dance with hip-hop – in contrast to the sections of the film that unfold in the 1940s.

While BPL borrows its title from the 1995 hit number from the reincarnation drama Karan Arjun, and the film’s release commemorates 25 years of Karan Arjun, the homage does not spill over beyond the eponymous title track. But BPL weaves together the past and the present much like the ’95 blockbuster. Kaushal explains while the film revolves around the Punjabi folk dance, it is also about the coming of age of Jaggi. The actor plays Jaggi’s grandfather, Kaptaan, whose legacy is the dance form. “[Jaggi] is learning what his grandfather’s story really is – between [Jaggi’s] interpretation and [the truth],” says Kaushal. On stepping into the two distinct characters, he shares, “I just had to get in touch with my arrogant guy to play Jaggi! He walks like he owns the place, and his chest is always [puffed] out. But Kaptaan is soft-spoken and has a little bit of a hunch.”

Geared up for the release, Kaushal already has a slate of films lined up for the new year – from Hurdang starring Vijay Varma and Nushrat Bharucha to Shiddat with Diana Penty, Radhika Madan and Mohit Raina and Kabir Khan’s Amazon Prime show The Forgotten Army. Dhillon can’t wait to share what’s on her plate, but that will have to wait for another time.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ur2kqc/article30452709.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sunny-Kaushal-15th-October-201912654,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bhangra-meets-bollywood-in-bhangra-paa-le/article30461482.ece
173,2020/01/02,Naina Sareen on her journey from FTII to 'Hotel Mumbai',"Transition from an acting student to getting established as an actor is often a long route, but for Naina Sareen it was rather destined. “It's overwhelming when people recognise you and give you love. Past months were really very exciting because we won at MAMI, my two films released and people loved us at the Dharamshala film festival,” she says. Born in Jharkhand, Naina was trained in acting from Film and Television Institute of India before appearing in films including “Hotel Mumbai” and “Warrior Queen of Jhansi”. “I haven't arrived yet. I have to do a lot of work and way to go,” she chuckles.

Excerpts:

How did acting happen?

Acting happened during FTII only. When I was young, I knew that I wanted to perform but I didn't know what I will perform – acting, dance or theatre. I liked the attention when I performed. I was very interested in hip-hop dancing and I am trained in Bharatanatyam also as dance is something that comes very naturally to me. Acting gives me a lot of freedom in terms of realising who I am really. For many, acting is internal to external as they first find the character within themselves and then externalise it but for me it is very much external to internal. It starts with once I start looking as the character and then I internalise it.

How did you become a part of “Hotel Mumbai”?

I was still studying in FTII. My senior Trishan was the casting director and I came to Mumbai to give audition for the first time. I bagged the role of a receptionist. I was overwhelmed by doing a part in an ensemble where actors like Dev Patel, Anupam Kher and my seniors were sharing screen space. Though it was the first time, I was not alienated. I made good friends there. It was extremely organised.

In “Warrior Queen of Jhansi”, you played a warrior. How did you prepare for the role?

I had to go through physical training which started much earlier from the actual shoot of the film. Someone can imagine me as a warrior was a big thing but I accepted the challenge. We were trained in sword fighting, archery and horse riding. It happened when I finished my acting course in 2017 and I moved to Mumbai so I had time to undergo that training. We shot in different locations including Jaipur, parts of Rajasthan and in Morocco.

Your role in Prateek Vats directed “Eee Baa Loo” is a complete departure from the earlier two films...

I have never seen the kind of Delhi which is shown in “Eee Baa Loo” despite living in Delhi for three years while studying English literature at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya College. It was a different Delhi in Kamla Nagar. On real locations, we don't have the luxury to get ready in the vanity van all the time. We used to sleep in the same attire which we used to shoot in. I am playing the character of the nurse from a slum. It was not a planned shoot and followed a documentary approach. The director was not always in front of you and in these locations we had to improvise a lot.

Do you wish to become a quintessential heroine or you want to remain an actor in the future?

I don't mind becoming a ‘heroine’ absolutely because a heroine also acts and we are also here to do acting. It is how you look on the screen which separates you. I think a good makeup and good clothes can make anyone look good. Put nice clothes on me and do my hair, I will also look like a heroine. I know how heroines are perceived but everyone here is talented.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dq4rcs/article30461433.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/LRMEXPORT33750313399541820190820231801995,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/smooth-transition/article30461434.ece
174,2020/01/02,Mohammed Rafi: The voice of humanism,"As I opened my wallet to pay for the 30-minute pleasant drive in Doha (Qatar), the Pakistani taxi driver refused to take the fare from me since. In his words, I was his respected guest! It took a while to understand that the honour was bestowed as I had lovingly referred to Mohammed Rafi as God’s Own Voice. Holding my hand, he said, “I can’t accept money from a brother, who like me, has found salvation in Rafi Sahab’s singing”. Affirming the sub-continent could be better if people learnt from humanism expounded in Rafi Sahab’s songs, the driver left after a hug and a prayer for greater kinship between Indians and Pakistanis!

It is such moments that make our lives memorable and though floored, I was not shocked by this recent happening as Rafi Sahab’s voice has been a long-standing passport to happy interactions with his fans. Ranging from stiff-lipped Englishmen to Egyptian calligraphers, people are willing to go miles for a rare song or anecdote of the maestro. In many cases, the foreign nationals don’t even understand the lyrics, yet are devout followers of Rafi Sahab’s incredible singing and one can certainly relate to such happenings as one has seen a friend shed tears every time he rewinds to his favourite “O Duniya Ke Rakhwale” from “Baiju Bawra”.

At a time when the world around us needs a big dose of tolerance and human values, many melodies rendered by Rafi spring to mind whose maxims teach us humanism is a trait of the heart. As faith dwindles in human virtues and institutions, there are numerous Rafi songs to guide, inspire and restore our belief in equality, goodness, and harmony.

Fervent plea

Long back, Rafi’s “Dekho Dil Na Kisi Ka Toote” (“Pyar Ka Rishta”) was a clarion call upholding friendship above blood relations just as he also made a fervent plea for uprightness with “Bhala Karne Wale, Bhalaayee Kiyeja, Buraayi Ke Badle, Duaayein Diye Jaa” (“Sansar”). Like a spiritual guru, Rafi Sahab elaborated not just the essence of every religion but also propounded goodness as the ultimate aim of every human being.

Life is an ephemeral bubble and Rafi Sahab drums sense about its mortality with his poignant appeal “Mat Bhool Arey Insaan, Teri Neki-Badee, Naheen Usse Chhupi” (“Mastana”). Time and time again, Rafi tugs the heart with nuggets like “Bhalayee Kar Bhala Hoga, Buraayee Kar Bura Hoga” (“Khul Ja Simsim”), “Daulat Ke Jhoothe Nashe Mein Ho Choor, Gareebon Ki Duniya Se Rahte Ho Door, Aji Ek Din Aisa Aayega, Jab Maati Mein Sab Mil Jayega” (“Oonchi Haveli”); songs that warn elitists to be humble and caring to their brethren.

Since Rafi pours his soul into every word, the message overwhelms the human psyche and that is why gems like “O Mati Ke Putle, Itna Na Kar Tu Gumaan, Pal Bhar Ka Tu Mehmaan” (“Sheroo”), “Aaj Gham Kal Khushi, Hai Yahee Zindagi, Sunle Pyaare, Aadmi Wo Jo Himmat Na Haare” (“Jawaab”) and “Waqt Se Din Aur Raat, Waqt Se Kal Aur Aaj, Waqt Ki Har Shae Ghulam, Waqt Har Shae Pe Raaj” (“Waqt”) find universal resonance.

Such is the magnificence of the outpouring and so sublime is the emotional intonation of every word that the essence and the purity of every line of the above-mentioned songs by lyricists Kaif Irani, Khumaar Barabankvi and Sahir Ludhianvi comes alive like an epic picture! Of course, the music and lyrics are outstanding but it is the extraordinary rendition by Rafi that moulds these songs into incomparable expressions of earnest prayer as well as eternal maxims of pearly wisdom.

Such is the maestro’s command over the lyric metre and expression that whenever he expostulates a divine law, it almost seems you are listening to a wandering Sufi saint. That is why the human heart, mind, and soul can imbibe what he sings, including some severe chidings like “Matlab Ke Liye Duniya Ne Paise Ko Banaya Khuda” (“Mohabbat Ki Koyee Dava Naheen”), “Do Din Ki Zindagi Hai Is Par Na Phool Pyaare, Rah Jayenge Yaheen Par Duniya Ke Thaath Saare” (“Gimbo Ki Beti”) and “Diwana Aadmi Ko Banati Hain Rotiyaan, Khud Naachti Hain Sabko Nachaati Hain Rotiyaan” (“Kali Topi Lal Rumaal”).",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oyzn56/article30461324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03DFR,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/mohammed-rafi-voice-of-humanism/article30461325.ece
175,2020/01/02,Chiranjeevi and Rajasekhar have war of words at MAA event; Telugu film industry split into camps,"Several Telugu movie stars find themselves in the middle of split loyalties in the industry, due to a rift between actors K Chiranjeevi and V Rajasekhar.

At an event organised to launch the 2020 diary of Movie Artists Association (MAA) today morning, Rajasekhar interrupted the proceedings to take the stage and speak about his ongoing tussle with Naresh, the current president of the MAA, as well as blame the association for losing out on films and personal losses incurred by him.

Chiranjeevi was notably upset, as he had earlier said that issues between members of the MAA should be figured out internally, without taking them public or talking to the media. The event was also attended by other big names such as Mohan Babu, Krishnam Raju, etc.

During Rajasekhar’s speech, Chiranjeevi, Jayasudha and Mohan Babu tried to stop him, but to no avail. After the actor left the stage in a moment of tension, Chiranjeevi then openly condemned him and said that strong disciplinary action should be taken against Rajasekhar by the association for his actions. He added that Rajasekhar’s words were not respected and issues concerned with MAA should be discussed within four walls.

176,2020/01/02,Walking in the steps of Kalyanikuttty Amma,"​Vinod Mankara is among a handful of filmmakers who have been trying to document and promote Mohiniyattam through his works. His documentary Nithya Kalayani Oru Mohiniyatta Padham and Lasyam are quintessential of his interest in the lyrical dance form. Nithya Kalayani Oru Mohiniyatta Padham fetched him two national awards and one State award in addition to an award from Kerala Kalamandalam.

His latest documentary, Mohinyattathinte Amma, on the legendary Guru Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma is perhaps the first on a pioneer researcher and practitioner of Mohiniyattam. Produced by Smitha Rajan, renowned dancer and grand-daughter of Kalyanikutty Amma, as her tribute to her grandmother, the script and direction of the 50-minute film is by Vinod himself.

In addition to documenting Kalyanikutty Amma’s contributions in shaping and enlarging the repertoire of Mohiniyatttam as a practitioner, teacher and poet, the film highlights her compositions and choreography. By throwing light on her compositions, the filmmaker introduces them to a new generation of dancers for whom the documentary provides enough grist for research.

The film is of historical significance as the dance form was hampered by teething troubles since its introduction in Kalamandalam in 1932 by Mahakavi Vallathol, the founder of Kalamandalam. Kalyanikutty Amma belonged to the second batch: 1937 to 1940, after the first batch had to be wound up in 1935. Even as she had the privilege of being trained under Nattuvan Appattu Krishna Panicker, Mohiniyattam was yet to evolve into a well-structured form in Kalamandalam. It was Kalyanikutty Amma’s unquenchable passion for dance and, later, a conversation with Vallathol on his death-bed that compelled her to embark on a challenging journey for moulding the dance form.

The documentary begins with this conversation that serves as a prelude to what is going to unfold. Vallathol says, “Kalyani, I could uplift Kathakali to a satisfactory level but couldn’t do much about Mohiniyattam. I am entrusting Mohiniyattam to you and I am confident that you can do it”.

Depiction of Kallu’s (Kallu was Kalyanikutty Amma’s monicker) childhood, especially her physically demanding exploits that were on a par with the boys, has been well-portrayed.

Her deep interest in literature finds elucidation in the film. Vinod covers almost all her poems through stills, most of which were published in Mathrubhumi. They include ‘Atmarodanam’, ‘Atmabali’, ‘Dagdahrudayam’, ‘Poovadiyilvachu’ and also Vanamala, a collection of her poetic works with a preface by poet-litterateur O N V Kurup.

Even her marriage with Kathakali legend Krishnan Nair, braving the resistance from her own family, her agony and solitude post-marriage, find expression through her poem, ‘Parithrupta’. Perhaps, the only omission is Thryambakam, a collection of three dance dramas that she scripted later in her life. She was given the title of Kavayitry (poetess) by Vallathol himself for her poem felicitating him on his shashtipoorthy (60th birthday).

Her days in Kalamandalam are vividly narrated by her daughter Sreedevi. Kalyanikutty Amma’s Kathakali classes under Pattikkamthodi Ravunny Menon, as suggested by Vallathol, comes as a surprise. She essayed commendably Lalitha in Kirmiravadham and Kunthi in Bakavadham. Her multi-faceted talents arer revealed when the film talks about her training in Manipuri dance and music and also on the mridangam and in Kalarippayattu and yoga in Kalamandalam. Sreedevi also gives vignettes of her mother’s services as a consummate teacher in various institutions.

Shots of Smitha’s interaction with her grandmother highlight how her the latter’s dream was focussed only on Mohiniyattam and serves as a prologue to her future progress.

Apart from Kalyanikutty Amma’s daughters, Sreedevi Rajan and Kala Vijayan, who were trained by her, Mohiniyattam exponents Nirmala Panicker, Bharathi Shivaji and Kanak Rele appear on different occasions to talk about their guru. Vinod was able to throw some light on Kalyanikutty Amma’s compositions through their conversation. Nirmala’s mention of the composition ‘Enthoru mohana chandrika bhoovithil’ is followed by a scintillating delineation of the same by Smitha, shot at the picturesque temple at Badami in Karnataka. Kala explains how her mother’s foray into new compositions encompassed the navarasas. She cites ‘Varika varika sakhi’ as an example.

While Bharathi, who also had learnt from Kalayanikutty Amma, avers that her own style was anchored on her teaching, Kanak Rele, who had filmed Kalyanikutty Amma’s performance during 1972-73, describes her as a doyenne of Mohiniyattam.

Smitha Rajan | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

A major portion of the film is devoted towards depicting Smitha’s expedition to revisit the places her grandmother had gone to during her innumerable sorties for collecting information about the roots of the dance form. The visuals, along with the narration, bring to us the scenic beauty of Kanyakumari, Suchindram, Padmanabhapuram et al. Lost in the world of the temple dancers of yore, Smitha performs the composition ‘Muzhumathi pongi thalirukal minni’. At the Sree Rama Temple, Chokkur, Smitha is moved while touching the stone inscriptions that bear references to temple dancers there. “This stone inscription of AD 932, which my grandmother tried to locate in vain in 1980, I could visit in 2019,” she points out. And, as a tribute to that, she presents a Sree Rama Saptham there.

Kala’s explanation, enhanced with demonstration, shows how her mother enriched the adavus by adopting a few from Thruvathirakkali and improvising on them. In this connection, Nirmala recalls her guru’s classification of the adavus into various groups such as ‘Thaganam’, ‘Jaganam’ and so on and how the introduction of Saptham expanded the repertoire of Mohiniyattam. That the credit for including Mohiniyattam in the competitions of the State Youth Festival since 1970 goes to Kalayanikutty Amma finds mention in the documentary.

The style of the coiffure, nagabandham and kakapaksham, about which much controversy had erupted in the past, is logically explained by Kalyanikutty Amma. Her advice to dancers to dump controversies regarding the origin of Mohiniyattam and work for the betterment of the dance form appears meaningful.

Vinod has included snippets of Kalyanikutty Amma’s roles in films like Rarichan Enna Pouran, Asuravith and Gandharva Kshetram and also touches upon her role in the play Chavitty Kuzhacha Mannu.

Kala’s grouse that due honour commensurate with her mother’s contributions was not accorded to her is thought-provoking even as she recalls how a police team that was supposed to give a gun salute for her funeral came after the cremation.

The scion of one of Malayalam’s most well-known production banners, Udaya Pictures, his journey as an actor has had its shares of highs and lows. In fact, at one point, he took a brief hiatus from movies. However, his second innings saw him emerge as an actor of substance.

Right now, Kunchacko Boban is keeping his fingers crossed for his upcoming release, Anjaam Paathiraa, which, he says, is a psychological thriller.

In this interview with Friday Review, the actor opens up about his career as an actor, new films and about the joys of fatherhood.

Excerpts...

What excited you about Midhun Manuel Thomas’ Anjaam Paathiraa?

When Midhun met me to narrate the script, I thought it would be a light-hearted entertainer like his earlier movies. But this one turned out to be an exciting thriller. I am playing Anwar Hussain, a criminal psychologist who is part of an investigation team that is in pursuit of a serial killer.

About your ongoing projects...

My last two releases, Allu Ramendran and Virus, and also the forthcoming Anjaam Paathiraa and Pada, have me in serious roles. The untitled Jis Joy movie, however, is a feel-good story. Then there are projects with directors Martin Prakkat, Johnpaul George and Shaheed Kader.

After so many years in the profession, what maintains your passion for acting?

Unlike other jobs, acting is never monotonous. You get to play characters of varying shades, work in different situations and interact with a wide range of people. I believe the break in my career was crucial for me as it changed my attitude towards cinema.

Looking back, do you agree that you have never really deviated from your comfort zone?

Yes, that is true to a certain extent. But I am planning to step out of that space. I am all set to try out new genres. When I have such a devoted following, it is high time I returned the love by giving my career all I have.

You have had your ups and downs in films. But do people have a perception that you have had it easy in movies?

While I agree that I had an easy start, I had to put in a lot of hard work to sustain my career. Many factors are necessary to maintain a certain stature, right from talent to commitment to persistence and luck. I am used to facing both the good and the bad with a smile. But behind that smile, there is also struggle and sacrifice.

What are your memories about your launch as a young hero in Fazil’s Aniyathipravu and the euphoria that followed?

I feel lucky to have been part of a movie that became such a huge hit. However, the credit should go to the director. In fact, I was initially reluctant to do the role. I always wanted to be a normal guy and, honestly, success never went to my head.

You continue to be seen as a heartthrob...

Of course, it’s nice to hear that, although there are many from the younger crop of actors who are more suited for that tag (laughs). On a professional level, such an image has become an obstacle in trying out new characters. I find it odd that even when I am called on stage for an award for my role as a villain, my description is still focused on ‘a romantic hero’.

Has your experience helped you face harsh reviews, criticism and failure?

I have always believed that criticism helps you realise what you lack. I have faced failure and that has made me stronger. In an industry where numbers count, obviously there will be pressure on you when there are setbacks. I search for new openings and ideas then. I make it a point never to sit and brood. I break away from the routine, go for long drives or spend more time with my family.

How do you rate yourself as an actor?

From comments that were limited to my looks or appearance, the discussions have now moved on towards the detailing of my characters. For example, last year, my characters in Allu Ramendran and Virus were totally different. From the so-called ‘star aura’, the focus has shifted to nuances of such roles. I feel there has been some refining that has happened to me as an actor. I believe that such learning and polishing of skills are part of a never-ending process.

You are now a father. Has life changed after the birth of the little one?

178,2020/01/02,2019 ended on a positive note for Kannada cinema with 'Avane Srimannarayana',"I must confess I’m not good at predicting the fate of a film at the box-office. After watching a preview of ‘Janumadha Jodi’ (1996) with B.C. Gowrishanker who was checking copies before they’re sent to theatres I was skeptical about the film appealing to Shivanna’s fans because his character was sans machismo, especially after the phenomenal success of ‘Om’. By the way, I had told Gowri that ‘Om’ would be a blockbuster, but that does not help my record overall. Gowri agreed to an extent. I was apparently echoing the sentiments of those close to the Raj Kumar family which produced the film. There’s an interesting anecdote. Apparently everyone privy to a preview advised the first family to sell the film to distributors. Parvathamma Rajkumar one night decided to watch the film at Prasad Studios and told a shocked coterie that the film would be a huge hit and she would distribute the film herself. She also said the Malayalam actress Chippy will be the highlight along with the music, and her son Shivraj Kumar just happened to be in the film. The film made with a budget of around 60 lakh rupees collected more than ten times. An entire book can be written about Parvathamma’s shrewd business sense.

If ‘Baahubali’ showed that South Indian cinema can churn out pan Indian blockbusters, ‘KGF’ kicked the door open for Kannada cinema which was looked down upon not entirely for unjustified reasons. I think it’s the burgeoning budgets that inadvertently forces filmmakers to try and break language barriers. Yash has confessed that ‘KGF’ was not planned as a pan-Indian film. I must mention though that Yash has always nursed ambitions about taking Kannada cinema to the next level, and he’s achieved it. He was never looking at the local superstars as competition and basically the confidence comes from not feeling inferior to anyone anywhere. The films that have appealed all over are love in the time of strife (Roja), interracial alliances (Bombay and Ek Duuje Ke Liye) or a fable with no particular geographical specificity (Baahubali). ‘KGF’ did not tick any of these boxes. Released at the fag end of 2018, I predicted box-office doom as soon as I watched it. Definitely not a fan of the director Prashant Neel’s previous film ‘Ugramm’, I was not impressed with the trailer and the film confirmed my worst fears. There was nothing humane in any of the characters, including the hero’s mother. Yash is the hero purely because he tames the shrew and survives in the end. He also mouths embarrassingly puerile lines like, “If you are bad, I’m your dad.” Fans roared when he claimed he’d killed 23 people and was still counting.

I thought the film was definitely not the right representative of the so-called resurgence of Kannada cinema. Nobody really knows what brings in audiences in throngs for a particular film and that’s what makes cinema fascinating and alluring. It’s not just one aspect like the songs in ‘Mungaru Male’ and ‘Janumada Jodi’ or the hunger for prosperity at any cost in ‘KGF’, with the protagonist’s mother egging him on. Anyway, I was wrong again. ‘KGF’ scorched the box-office and it’s not just because of the publicity blitzkrieg which can only make people curious and serve as an invitation. The sequel is one of the most awaited films this year.

The much awaited ‘Avane Srimannarayana’ was released last week after being in the making for three long years and a budget that spiraled. I watched the first show and again predicted the worse. I was squirming in my seat more from bouts of ennui than any sort of discomfort. The scenes shift from interesting to totally unnecessary often. The comedy vacillates from effortless to puerile and characters that don’t contribute to the proceedings jump into this long journey about a bounty hunt. It’s a bit like time travel. On one side there are jeeps, microphones, cameras and telephones and on the other you have a world caught in a time warp. There’s a kingdom with no electricity, characters who badly need to visit the barber riding horses and warring step-brothers waiting to usurp the throne. Caught in the crossfire is a drama troupe who can’t leave without performing their last act. A promising premise quickly peters out and is reduced to a plot that plods aimlessly. There’s self-indulgence aplenty, a la ‘Ulidavaru Kandanthe’. Rakshit told me he should have let someone else edit ‘UK’ but repeats the mistake here too. The director Sachin is the editor too, but everyone knows Rakshit holds the scissors. Now the length of a film is daunting only when the proceedings make you keep checking the time. You often do that in ‘ASN’. Rakshit’s performance reminds you of Sudeep who again does not have a flair for comedy. It’s the smart on-liners that save the day. What could have been an edge of the seat adventure like ‘Raiders Of The Lost Arc’ is reduced to a sort of spoof .

The apparent effort to merge genres is not very effective. Well, again keeping my record of wrong box-office predictions unblemished, ‘ASN’ is raking it in. I thought it would tank on Monday but the crowds are swelling. The holidays have helped and friends managing multiplexes are surprised at the increasing footfall because they had agreed with my apprehensions. 17 minutes are being chopped off to make it relatively crisper. I’m glad I’m wrong because I know Rakshit is passionate about the craft though I prefer him as a director than as an actor and definitely liked ‘UK’ more. Sometimes you have to appreciate the effort too and the film is technically first rate be it the cinematography, CG or the terrific background score. I hear the Telugu distributor has asked for 21 minutes to be edited which should make it racy. It’s heartening that the year has ended on positive note for Kannada cinema. Gladly people are chanting ‘Srimannarayana’ instead of ‘Govinda Govinda’.

179,2020/01/02,An actor is only as good as the writing: Akshaye Khanna,"One of the finest performances of 2019 came from Akshaye Khanna in “Section 375”. A nuanced court room drama, the Ajay Bahl film could not create too much buzz at the box office but Akshaye’s performance as the defence lawyer impressed critics.

Always a reliable actor, Akshaye hasn’t been challenged enough in the last few years. He will soon be seen in “Sab Kushal Mangal” where again he is playing an “author-backed” role. Meanwhile, after his father Vinod Khanna’s demise, the rumours of Akshaye jumping into the political arena keep surfacing.

Edited excerpts from a conversation:

You received widespread acclaim for your portrayal of a criminal lawyer in “Section 375”. What kind of a grind did you go through to deliver such a measured performance?

I will be very honest. Mine was never really a grind. I must tell you that as an actor I have been very fortunate most of the times. I have been extremely lucky to have excellent writing backing me.

Now, if you look at the other actors in “Section 375”, the writing backed them to a certain extent. But, for me, the writing backed me very strongly throughout. I had such beautiful lines to deliver. I had such beautiful moments to portray. So, it was really an author-backed role in so many ways.

And I feel the same for “Sab Kushal Mangal”. I feel that an actor is only as good as the writing. To be constantly backed by such good writing over a long period of time is not common. So often I get credited with things that I necessarily shouldn’t get credited for. A huge part of my performances has to do with great writing.

How do you look at your late father’s political legacy?

Frankly, I have absolutely no interest in politics or in public life for that matter. Because of the nature of my profession I am a public person but I don’t consider that to be public life. A public life is when you are accountable to your constituency, voters, ideology, and your party. You are answerable because you take a salary from people who pay taxes. You are being paid to do a job. That’s public life. I have never had an attraction for public life, especially politics because it doesn’t suit me.

It’s like spicy food. Some people cannot intake spicy food as their system can’t consume it. Similarly, my system doesn’t like public life or politics.

The quintessential prerequisite for political life is to be a people’s person. And I am not a people’s person. And I don’t consider it to be a legacy that I have to carry. One should never look at it like that. We are all here for a few decades on this planet and then we will go. So I don’t look at it that way at all.

What convinced you to take up “Sab Kushal Mangal”?

It’s the script that I really liked. As an actor it is something that I have never done before. As soon as I got the brief, I knew that it will give me a lot of scope to perform. And it would give me a certain angle of characterisation which has not written for me before. So I saw a great opportunity in terms of the character as well as the script and the story.

Tell us about your character in the film.

You see, Baba Bhandari is a combination of many opposites. He is a big shot in the world of politics and crime but he is also a very emotional kind of a character which is an unusual combination.

He is violent and yet very kind. So there are many contradictions to it which made it very interesting for me to play and also very entertaining from the audience point of view.

You are working with two newcomers in the film. Do you see any risk in working with newbies?

Well, it’s not a question of risk the way I see it. Here, it was the requirement of the script. It required two new faces. So as an actor one doesn’t look at it as a risk or reward. It’s more about what the script demands.

How do you generally choose for your roles? Tell us about your acting method.

It’s only the writing. There is nothing else except the fact that I need be sure whether I would be able to work with the director.

I like to spend a lot of time with the director before I agree to do a movie. It is an important part of the preparation for me. But in terms of what I am going to actually do I don’t usually know until I land up on the sets. While I usually have a basic understanding of maybe how I am going to do it, I don’t know what I am really going to do till I am actually doing it. Most of the times I like to leave it to very last minute as I don’t like to come with my own baggage.

I feel travelling light is good as an actor. There is so much that one absorbs when one is on sets with the rest of the cast and the crew. So, I like to be in the moment there as opposed to coming in with a lot of preparation.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/8c6ovo/article30459636.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Akshaye-Khanna,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/an-actor-is-only-as-good-as-the-writing-akshaye-khanna/article30459638.ece
180,2020/01/02,'Binge Shorts': Where short films meet web-series,"The year 2020 kickstarts with a new idea from a Chennai production house that seems passionate about cinema. They’ve titled their offering Binge Shorts.

This initiative is the brainchild of Mongoose Studios’ Vikas Anand Sridharan, a filmmaking student from New York Film Academy, Los Angeles. An effort that combines short films and the web series format, binge shorts revolves around three vital aspects: it will have the same character set in the same universe, features no dialogues and will last only five minutes.

“It will take you on a trip,” promises Vikas, “While a short film is a one-off thing, binge shorts will make you connect with the characters.” His first effort, titled Nightmares, features theatre actor Pooja in the lead and is based on a single character being haunted by eight different ghosts in the same location. “We shot it entirely inside my house,” he reveals, “We bought colour bulbs for lights, and most of the film has minimal lighting. We showed one house as six locations, because of the differential lighting and artwork.”

The team, consisting of Shivram PK, Manu Kathiresan, Abhijith Ramaswami and Charanyaa Murali, is gearing up for another binge short on the thriller genre soon. Vikas himself is keeping other stories ready for subsequent projects as well, and is looking to expand to ‘thriller shorts’ and ‘romantic shorts’ in the near future. “This style has a huge potential for growth. A basic short film is one that you watch and move on. A web series is an awesome platform, but it is long and you need to dedicate time for it. But with a binge short, you can finish an entire one just during your commute time from work to home.”

Binge shorts are aimed at the short attention span of people towards video content. “They can watch the entire series within 20-30 minutes,” he says.

The team is expecting the binge shorts universe to expand in the years to come. “With enough viewership, we can rope in bigger actors and stars into it,” he says, “With each episode spanning less than five minutes, the possibilities of bringing in brands and companies are high.”

But their biggest achievement will be if it attracts newer, younger talents who are looking for that big break in the film circuit. “Once it becomes a sustainable platform, we hope to bring in new directors, writers, and cinematographer to create their own content. This will help upcoming and struggling artistes and technicians to showcase their talent,” he concludes.

181,2020/01/02,Midhun Manuel Thomas’ 'Anjaam Pathiraa' is a whodunnit,"Genre-wise, it looks like director Midhun Manuel Thomas is marking a departure with his upcoming flick, Anjaam Pathiraa. His filmography so far boasts feel-good entertainers and rom-coms. But the filmmaker says he’s, in fact, diving into his “favourite genre.”

Starring Kunchacko Boban as a psychologist with a keen interest in criminology, Anjaam Pathiraa, set to hit the marquee on January 10, is “an out-and-out investigative thriller” set in an urban backdrop. “The thriller genre is close to my heart, whether in movies or books. In fact, my initial attempt when I started off as a filmmaker was a satirical thriller, though what eventually worked out was Ohm Shanthi Oshaana (a rom-com he co-scripted with its director Jude Anthany Joseph),” says Midhun over phone from Kochi.

But the Nivin Pauly-starrer’s warm reception prompted Midhun to stick to a success mantra, with him subsequently coming out with the popular Aadu series, Ann Maria Kalippilaanu, Almara and Argentina Fans Kaattoorkadavu.

In the whodunnit Anjaam Pathira, Kunchacko’s character, Anwar Hussain, gets entangled in a case involving a serial killer that the police finds hard to crack. Anwar is roped in for his know-how in criminology, says Midhun, not wanting to divulge more about the plot. The taut trailer of the film too gives a sneak-peak into what Anwar is into and how the murder mystery leaves the cops scratching their heads, while keeping any more giveaways under wraps. “You’ll get to know the significance of the title when you watch the film,” he says with a chuckle.

Midhun, who has scripted the film, says he developed the story some time after the release of Argentina Fans Kaattoorkadavu, adding that he’s someone who can commence the process of scripting only when “the full story is in my mind.”

He was adamant during the film’s developmental stage itself to retain “the purity” of the genre and Midhun has steered clear of “any deviations or distractions” this time. “So, there are no songs or dance. I have even tried not to explore the protagonist’s personal life to keep the mood and the tempo consistent throughout,” he says.

Others in the cast are Sreenath Bhasi, Indrans, Remya Nambeeshan, Sharafudheen, Jinu Joseph, Unnimaya Prasad among others. Teaming up with Kunchacko for the first time, Midhun says he could not zero in on any one better for the character. “Anwar is someone who puts on no airs and shows no ostentation. He’s in the game purely for the thrill of it. He’s a common man and I wanted to cast someone who reflected a matching body language. I did not want the character or the artiste to take the attention away from the spirit of the story,” explains Midhun.

‘Cause this is thriller Midhun says he loves to gobble up thrillers and lists writers in the genre such as Michael Conolly, David Baldacci, Michael Crichton, Dan Brown and John Grisham as some of his all-time favourites.

He points out that one highlight is the technical work to generate the “look and feel” of the movie. “It’s going to be atmospheric and half the impact is effected from behind the camera,” says Midhun, tipping the hat to cinematographer Shyju Khalid, editor Saiju Sreedharan and composer Sushin Shyam for bringing the mood of the movie alive. Anjaam Pathiraa is shot predominantly in Kochi and Kumily in Idukki.

182,2020/01/02,Pakistan PM Imran Khan was asked by Dev Anand to act in Bollywood film,"An old video of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, that has been making rounds on social media, shows him being interviewed live on an Indian TV show during which he admits that he was asked to work in a Bollywood film by the late Indian actor Dev Anand.

“You won’t believe it but I was once I asked by a brilliant Indian actor who we all look up to, to act in one of his upcoming film. In fact, he even turned up in England to request me, but I was puzzled,” The Express Tribune reported on Thursday citing Khan as saying in the video.

The premier was then asked details about who asked him and why he rejected, to which Khan said: “I won’t name him because it’ll be embarrassing.”

But upon being pressured by the host to reveal the actor’s name, Khan confirmed it was Dev Anand.

“For me it’s strange, to think that just because I’m a cricketer, doesn’t mean I can be an actor as well. It doesn’t make sense to me. (Indian-origin director) Ismail Merchant also once asked me to act in a film, but again I was puzzled because I can’t act. I couldn’t even act in a school play, let alone a film,” Khan was quoted as saying.

184,2020/01/02,‘Ghost Stories’ review: This Netflix anthology has more subtext than spooks,"If there’s a common thread uniting the four films in the latest Netflix omnibus, Ghost Stories, it’d be the omnipresent character of the matriarch/patriarch. It kicks off with the tale of a vulnerable, ailing, old lady (Surekha Sikri) in constant search of her son, ostensibly hiding in plain sight at home, in the first segment directed by Zoya Akhtar.

Ghost Stories (Netflix) Director(s): Zoya Akhtar, Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Karan Johar

Starring: Janhvi Kapoor, Surekha Sikri, Vijay Varma, Sobhita Dhulipala, Sagar Arya, Sukant Goel, Gulshan Devaiah, Avinash Tiwary, Mrunal Thakur

Runtime: 144 minutes

Akhtar’s is an old fashioned, predictable ghost story; you can see the eventual twist right at the beginning, even as you enter the lady’s world along with the young proxy nurse (Janhvi Kapoor), who is there to take care of her while the one in charge is away for a few days. Akhtar doesn’t serve horror neat, but with an emotional tug. The yawning age gap notwithstanding, the common theme of both the protagonists’ lives is desertion — one abandoned as a child by her parents, other by her child at an age when she needs him the most.

Akhtar deploys dread to underline a social issue — the horrors of old age, specially in the unsympathetic, isolating urban spaces. Those admirable old Mumbai bungalows that may look terribly beautiful from the outside but are home to putrid smells of the desperate loneliness of their residents. Akhtar’s horror also comes laced with a strong life lesson: never wait for anyone or anything. All of this, unfortunately, takes away from the essential fear factor as we have come to experience it. The overall feeling might be dissatisfying but the actors manage to hold things well. Janhvi Kapoor and Surekha Sikri with their quick silver expressions in the fleeting moments, captured up close and personal, are both quite a treat to watch.

Fear gets diluted entirely in the last segment by Karan Johar where the matriarch — granny — is the polar opposite of the one in Akhtar’s short. Forget being lonesome, she just refuses to let go of her family even after she is dead and gone. The segment has all that is crucial to a Johar film — beautiful people, fancy clothes, luxurious mansions — but it is not quite about “loving your family”, as the tagline of his film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham goes. It is, in fact, about how suffocating and clingy families can be, how strangulating is the tight grip of relationships on individuals. Johar may have done well in cocking a snook at his own signature formula and template of filmmaking but as a horror film it doesn’t rise above the very basic and adolescent. An eccentric set of folks, creaking doors, whispers, people who suddenly pop up from behind — I doubt if even children will get scared with this one.

It is Anurag Kashyap who goes deeper into the psyche of the mother figure. And most disturbingly at that. The widely held idea about motherhood being the most significant emotion for a woman gets a total reboot, as does the notion of a child being the repository of “innocence”. Motherhood is about extreme post-partum blues, stuff that nightmares are made of and the child is plain evil. Kashyap builds up the tension extremely well with the macabre and the creepy, the grisly and the gruesome imagery and as he plays around with human frailties, insecurities, fears and anxieties. But then goes on to minimise the impact with a needless broad explicatory stroke. For the sake of genuine horror he should have let things remain entirely ambiguous.

It’s Dibakar Banerjee’s film that moves from the matriarch figure to that of the patriarch as he trains his camera on and questions the figures of authority and through it captures the existential dread and the many ruptures at the heart of the contemporary dystopia we are stuck in. There are endless ways and specific contexts in which you can read the story about a stranger reaching Pachaasghara aka Small Town and finding it bereft of residents save two children. The father of one, from the Big Town of Sau Ghara, has eaten that of the other and, having tasted blood once, won’t stop any more.

It’s about the “us” versus “them” divide, the distrust of humans for humans, the violence and violation heaped on one man by another. You can survive if you are unthinking scarecrows or zombies who can’t see clearly and who have to remain quiet because speaking out is the most dangerous crime that you can commit. Or you are blood-sucking monsters who can show no mercy on anyone and are busy enlisting everyone into your brute force. There is no third option in this self-combusting metaphorical wasteland.

The political subtext gets more acute, direct and subversive with a passing interaction at the end. The councillor of Sau Ghara invokes his town’s past, how it used to be “Parasmani ki khaan (a mine of riches)”. “Ab wo din wapas aayenge (Now those days will come back),” he asserts. “Make America Great Again” and “Achche Din”, immediately came rushing to my mind.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/801u47/article30458086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GHOSTSTORIESTHNAK,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/ghost-stories-review-this-netflix-anthology-has-more-subtext-than-spooks/article30458087.ece

188,2020/01/02,Anti-CAA kolam protest: Activist Gayatri Khandhadai counters Chennai Police Commissioner’s remarks on Pakistan link,"A day after Chennai Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan said that the police would probe the Pakistani links of advocate Gayatri Khandhadai, who participated in the anti-CAA kolam protest, she explained that in 2016 she had only filed a report for ‘Bytes for All’ [a Pakistan based advocacy group] highlighting the discrimination faced by religious minorities in nine Asian countries.

“In this report, I have also written about the discrimination faced by Hindus in Pakistan and Bangladesh. It would have been nice if the police had read the report completely and then addressed the press conference,” she told journalists in Madurai on Thursday.

“By revealing my Facebook profile during the press conference, Chennai City Police have compromised my privacy and security. Chennai City Police Commissioner is responsible for my safety and security,” she said. Ms. Khandhadai denied that she had deleted any content from her Facebook account.

The Commissioner had also said that the police detained anti-CAA protesters only after an elderly person opposed the protesters from drawing kolams in front of his house.

However, Ms. Gayathri contended, “We did not go to that house or meet that person. We did not draw kolams in front of houses that opposed us.”

Henri Tiphagne, founder and executive director of People’s Watch, charged that the police are targeting human rights defenders including Ms. Khandhadai and Arappor Iyakkam and condemned it. “A complaint regarding this has been submitted to the National Human Rights Commission and we will take steps to ensure that the issue was taken by the Bar Council of India,” he said.

Senior advocates T. Lajapathi Roy and M. Ajmal Khan also condemned the police for detaining advocates who went to provide legal aid to the protesters. They stressed that the Bar Council of India must consider the incident suo motu and take necessary action.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president K.S. Alagiri demanded that the police investigation against Ms. Khandhadai’s alleged Pakistan connection be dropped immediately. Mr. Alagiri said she was not associated with any organisation in Pakistan but had only undertaken research for a Pakistan based research organisation. “In the 80-page report filed by her about minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and Indonesia, there is nothing that is supporting Pakistan. If he finds such a thing in the report, the Police Commissioner must furnish proof,” Mr. Alagiri said.

Mr. Alagiri said the action against Ms. Khandhadai was vindictive on the part of the government and requested the Commissioner to not toe such a line of the rulers.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1m1i31/article30463672.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA03MDUGAYATRI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/anti-caa-kolam-protest-activist-gayatri-khandhadai-counters-chennai-police-commissioners-remarks-on-pakistan-link/article30463674.ece
189,2020/01/02,Tamil Nadu rural local body polls: AIADMK suffers a setback,"The ruling AIADMK suffered a setback in the rural local body polls held in 27 districts with the DMK racing ahead in panchayat unions and district panchayat wards as per results/trends available around 11.30 p.m. on Thursday.

Crowdsourced trends were available only for 350-odd of the 515 district panchayat member posts and 2,900-odd of the 5,090 panchayat union ward posts, while the State Election Commission declared the results for much fewer posts. The complete tally of results is expected to be available only by Friday evening.

The DMK had won in 727 of 1,632 seats the results of which were declared for the post of panchayat union ward members as of 11.30 p.m. The AIADMK was lagging by nearly 170 seats, as its candidates had won only in 556 seats.

The AIADMK’s defeat at the hands of its arch rival DMK, that too in the rural areas, considered the ruling party’s main vote bank from the time the party was founded nearly five decades ago, came as a shock to the establishment with Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami taking stock of and deliberating with senior leaders in the evening.

The victory, even if not so huge, is likely to be a huge boost for the DMK ahead of next year’s Assembly elections, as the party has remained out of power for the last two terms.

At the time of going to print, the DMK’s gains in panchayat unions came largely from Tiruchi with 109 seats, Thanjavur (72), Pudukottai (48) and Dindigul (47). The largest tally for the AIADMK was from Thoothukudi with 43 seats, Thanjavur (40) and Theni (38).

The DMK’s allies, the Congress and the CPI, won 39 and 24 seats respectively in panchayat unions. The AIADMK’s allies, the DMDK and the BJP, won in 33 and 24 seats, respectively.

There are a total of 5,090 seats for the post of panchayat union ward members across the 27 districts where polls were held.

The DMK also won 15 seats for the post of district panchayat ward members, while the AIADMK won 6. The BJP, the CPI and the CPI (M) won one seat each out of the total tally of 24 for which results were announced. There are a total of 515 seats in this category. Except a few districts, the two parties were neck and neck with the counting continuing well past midnight.

DMK president M.K. Stalin complained that the results were deliberately being delayed.

State Election Commissioner, R. Palaniswamy explained that the counting process was lengthy, as there was a need to have a transparent counting process. “It is not a wanton delay,” Mr. Palaniswamy said.

In Panchayat Unions, Tiruchirapalli turned out to be one of the biggest game changers for the DMK, with the party leading over its rival the AIADMK by nearly 73 seats at the time of going to print. Ironically for the ruling party, in districts where it was leading over the DMK, its largest seat difference was a margin of 17 in Thoothukudi where it won 43 seats to DMK’s 26.

Likewise, the DMK won 32 seats in Krishnagiri, 31 in Tiruvannamalai, 36 in Tiruvarur, 33 in Madurai and 32 in Virudhunagar and 29 in Ramanathapuram in the Panchayat Unions. The AIADMK won 33 seats in Cuddalore, 31 in Karur, 36 in Tiruchirapalli, 32 in Dindigul, 33 in Madurai and 29 in Pudukottai.

Trends indicated that the two parties were neck and neck in leads as well for the posts of district panchayat presidents and panchayat union ward members. The leads ranged between 960 and 1,135 for the DMK alliance for the posts of panchayat union ward members while for the AIADMK combine it ranged from 814 to 935.

190,2020/01/02,Stalin threatens to observe a fast at the State Election Commission premises,"Alleging that the ruling party had joined hands with officials and the police to conspire against the victory of the DMK in rural local body elections, party president M.K. Stalin on January 2 rushed to the State Election Commission (SEC) and demanded action against what he said were deliberate attempts to stall the declaration of results in wards where candidates of the DMK alliance had won.

“The State Election Commissioner spoke to officials and promised action. If our demands are not met, we will decide whether to observe a fast inside the Election Commission office or to organise a protest across the State,” Mr. Stalin told reporters after meeting the SEC.

He alleged that officials had either stopped the counting of votes or refused to declare victories in places where DMK candidates were ahead of their rivals or had already won. “Even in Chief Minster Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s [Assembly] constituency the results were held back. His brother-in-law is sitting inside the counting centre and directing officials according to his whim,” he charged.

Mr. Stalin said in Kolathur in Edappadi, the DMK candidate had won with 800 votes, but the result had not been declared though the victory of AIADMK candidates [elsewhere] had already been announced.

Similarly, in Konganathapuram, Sangakiri and Edappadi, the results were not declared because the DMK had won the seats, he said. In Vathalakundu union in Dindigul district and Minjur union in Tiruvallur district, the DMK candidates had won, but the results were not declared, he added.

“In Bodi union in Theni district of Deputy Chief Minister O. Pannneerselvam, the DMK was ahead of the AIADMK. But officials have left without counting the votes,” he alleged.

191,2020/01/02,"TASMAC New Year sales see no spike, local body polls restrict sales","The Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited, popularly known as Tasmac, sold liquor worth ₹150 crore on New Year’s eve. A day before that, on December 30, when polling was held in some rural local bodies, the State-run liquor market clocked sales of ₹92 crore.

In 2018, the State-run liquor market saw its sales numbers touch ₹130 crore on December 31. On December 30, the sales figure had stood at ₹113 crore.

A source in Tasmac said that sales on two days – December 30 and 31 -- were somewhat flat, compared to last year. “The reason is, it was a dry day in many parts of Tamil Nadu due to the local body polls. Shops in areas which went to polls opened late in the evening only.”

A look at the cumulative data for December 30 and December 31 shows that the revenue this year was ₹242 crore against ₹243 crore in 2018. A year before that, in 2017 the revenue had been ₹230.52 crore.

The cash cow of the Tamil Nadu government, on an average, sells liquor worth ₹70-75 crore on weekdays and during weekends the collection goes up to ₹90 crore. During key festive seasons which include Deepavali and New Year, the sales figures generally cross the ₹100 crore mark.

Currently, the State has 5,152 liquor retail vending shops and 1,872 bars.

194,2020/01/02,Counting begins for Tamil Nadu rural local body polls,"The process of counting of votes polled in the two-phased rural local bodies held on December 27 and 30 in Tamil Nadu began on Thursday morning.

Tight security has been deployed at the 315 counting centres across the state.

The elections for the rural local bodies were held in two phases in 27 districts, barring the nine newly carved ones in line with the apex court’s order.

The ballot papers in four different colours were used in the poll instead of the electronic voting machines (EVM).

Before counting the votes the ballot papers were being segregated based on their colours.

According to the Tamil Nadu State Election Commission (TNSEC) the first phase saw polling of 76.19 per cent, and the second phase saw 77.73 per cent.

Over 2.31 lakh contested the polls for 91,975 posts. The posts include: Gram Panchayat Ward member, Gram Panchayat President, Panchayat Union ward member and District Panchayat Union Ward member posts.

Chaos in Tiruvannamalai

Counting of votes for the village panchayat wards and panchayat presidents posts began at Danish Mission HSS, Tiruvannamalai.

Election officials staged a protest by walking off the strong room as breakfast had not been provided for them.

Likewise, chaos reigned at the entrance of Shanmuga Industries Government HSS, where police allegedly denied entry to the official agents of candidates and election officials. There were arguments and counter arguments between police and agents. Reinforcements were summoned to help deal with the situation and the counting process started little later.

195,2020/01/02,Political wrangling over an index and a ranking,"Tamil Nadu is not new to the politics of attrition. Now, even the subject of the State getting the top slot in a nation-wide study on good governance has not been spared from the political discourse.

While the ruling AIADMK was quick to take credit for the distinction that the State had achieved in the Good Governance Index (GGI), the Opposition DMK questioned the credentials of the study and suspected that it was a “favour” the BJP-led Union government had done for its ally for having been “subservient” to it.

It all started with the Central government making an announcement in New Delhi on December 25 — observed as Good Governance Day— that Tamil Nadu had bagged the top spot in the composite ranking for the GGI. Apart from getting an overall score of 5.62, the State led the pack in two out of nine sectors – public infrastructure & utilities and judiciary & public security.

Politically, the announcement was viewed in two different ways in the State. For the AIADMK, the timing of the announcement could not have been better, as it came exactly two days before the first phase of polling in the rural local bodies, which saw elections after a gap of eight years. Though the development may not carry much meaning for many sections of voters in village panchayats or panchayat unions, it had come in handy for the ruling party as something to flaunt.

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami called it a “moment of pride”.

The DMK was left wondering how the Central government had chosen Tamil Nadu as the leading State in the GGI, when its performance was “not that impressive”. Referring to incidents like the Pollachi serial sexual assault case and the killing of protesters during the anti-Sterlite agitation, DMK president M.K. Stalin expressed puzzlement over the State getting the top rank in the field of judiciary & public security.

Scope for improvement

Going beyond the political discourse, experts in governance point out that no State other than Tamil Nadu had secured the first rank in two or more sectors. T.N. may have got the 14th rank in the area of commerce and industries because the indicator of “ease of doing business” was given a disproportionate share in the overall marking system while its strength in terms of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises was largely ignored.

At the same, experts point out that Tamil Nadu has scope for improvement. It must do more in the field of process-based indicators if it wants to sustain its present status. Also, the State should take a cue from the best practices of Israel, Australia and the Scandinavian countries in the areas of water management, energy conservation and renewable energy.

Besides, while making efforts to refine its ability to function on “auto pilot” mode, the State bureaucracy should provide enough space for experiments to be carried out at the lower and middle levels.

Only through a combination of measures will Tamil Nadu be able to maintain the “numero uno” position.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/political-wrangling-over-an-index-and-a-ranking/article30456710.ece

A police team picked up Mr. Kannan from a lodge where he was staying.

Mr. Kannan did not put up any resistance, sources said.

M. Amalraj, IGP, Central Zone, said Mr. Kannan would be handed over to the Tirunelveli police, who would formally arrest him.

At the public meeting, organised in Muslim-dominated Melapalayam by the Social Democratic Party of India, Mr. Kannan made certain remarks which were seen as an incitement to Muslims to “finish off” Mr. Shah, whom he dubbed “the brain behind the Prime Minister”.

BJP Tirunelveli district president A. Dhayasankar had on Monday submitted a complaint to the Tirunelveli City Police Commissioner, Deepak M. Damor, seeking action against Mr. Kannan.

Subsequently, the Melapalayam police registered a case against Mr. Kannan on Monday night, under Sections 504, 505 and 505 (2) of the Indian Penal Code, which deal with the provoking of breach of public peace and the inciting of hatred.

On Tuesday, some BJP workers staged a dharna in front of Mr. Kannan’s house in Tirunelveli town. At the time, Mr. Kannan complained of chest pain and was rushed to a hospital in an ambulance. Subsequently, the private hospital management “referred” him to a Madurai-based hospital for “further treatment”. However, Mr. Kannan could not be located thereafter, until his arrest in Perambalur.

Police sources said the Sections invoked against him in the case registered by the Melapalayam police may be altered, and a few more Sections of the IPC could be invoked against him.

He would reach the customers’ door step by two wheeler on the same day with the parcels.

Effective and efficient delivery of parcels at door step of customer was one of the biggest challenges faced by the Department of Posts. The increased volume of parcels required a change in the manner parcels were traditionally delivered.

This necessiated a need to separate parcel delivery from regular delivery in those areas where number of parcels delivered are high. To address this issue, the Department of Posts launched a concept of delivering parcels through NDCs.

The NDC was inaugurated by Superintendent of Post Offices, Vellore Division, P. Komal Kumar, amidst the hosts of postal department officials and general public.

The circle offices are allowed to engage justified number of postmen as per the local conditions to ensure 100% effective delivery attempt of parcels.

He was addressing a press meet to detail the department’s performance in 2019. “They asked for permission and it was denied. They drew eight kolams already in public places and in front of people’s houses. However, they wrote No–CAA slogan near a kolam, the resident had already drawn. The houseowner objected to this,” said the Commissioner.

He claimed that they created a scene in front of the house and when the police intervened, they raised slogans. “It was only after this we detained them,” he added. He also said that the police will investigate about anti-CAA protester Gayathri Khandhadai’s Pakistan connection. “On her social media account, it has been mentioned that she is a researcher with Pakistan-based Bytes for All organisation.

200,2020/01/02,Toll plazas to come under green cover,"To ensure shade along the highways, members of the Institute of Road and Transport Technology Alumni Association (IRTTAA) joined hands with the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to plant saplings across 46 toll plazas in the State.

Inaugurating one such programme at Pallikonda Toll Plaza in Vellore district on Wednesday, L. Sridhar, programme co-ordinator, termed the planting of 15 different species as a humble beignning. It has been decided that the species will be procured from local sources across the State.

Reclaiming forest cover

“Initially, we plan to plant around 200 saplings each near the toll plazas across the State, for which NHAI and toll plaza managers are extending co-operation. The scheme of things will be extended to other areas too, depending on the support and co-ordination from the local population,” Mr. Sridhar said.

The current bunch of volunteers are engaged in planting tree saplings at four toll plazas at Krishnagiri, Vaniyambadi, Pallikonda and Chennasamudhiram in Walajahpet.

He credited the president of the association, G. Sampathkumar, for being the driving force behind the programme, that aims to reclaim the forest cover lost in the past few decades. This initiative would go a long way in eliminating the water crisis in the next couple of decades, he said.

Volunteers supporting the cause said that these tree saplings would bring in more rains in the next few years, which is sure to help our farmers and other residents.

Some of the saplings chosen for the programme include, ‘vagai’, ‘pungai’, ‘vembu’, ‘gulmohar’. The maintenance of the tress would be undertaken by the members of the IRTTAA. This association has established its global presence with more than 15,000 members, extending help in contacting the toll plazas and other agencies for taking stock of the requirements, and mobilisation of volunteers for completing their tasks.

Bamboo tree guards

“IRTTAA has initiated another concept in the form of tree guards they planted. Deferring from the age old tradition of covering the saplings with ‘plastic mesh’, they have conceptualised ‘Bamboo tree guards’ to protect the tree saplings. This would help ensure composting of the guard in case it falls or is removed after the growth of the trees,” says C. Liffon, one of the volunteers.

Volunteers from IRTT group, P. Vashistakumar, S. Deepa, D. Sivakumar, K.R. Prashanth and S. Balaji, members from Bharani Fans Club, Vellore, were present at the inaugural session.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1mx5s9/article30454580.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01THVELLORETREEPLANTINGINTIATIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/toll-plazas-to-come-under-green-cover/article30454581.ece
201,2020/01/02,‘Provide meters to levy commercial tariff for unsegregated facilities’,"The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) has written to the Chairman and Managing Director of Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) stating that the utility should provide separate meter/sub meter before charging commercial tariff for unsegregated common facilities like gymnasium, community hall and amphitheatre availed by the multi-tenement residential complexes.

It also asked the state utility to avoid coercive steps like bringing the entire usage under LTV (commercial) tariff or penalising under Section 135 of Indian Electricity Act for energy theft.

The move comes after a complaint by the Coimbatore Consumer Cause and other frequent complaints in this regard. On August 11, 2017 the TNERC approved a proposal by Tangedco to restrict supply under domestic tariff to common lighting, water supply and lifts in multi-tenements/residential complexes.

Other facilities such as gymnasium, community hall, amphitheatres etc shall be classified under the appropriate commercial category, viz LTV or HT III, depending on the voltage of supply, as per the approved proposal. “The TNERC had very clearly instructed that Tangedco should make metering/sub metering arrangements and the revised billing, i.e. commercial tariff to the specified common service, comes into force only after that,” K. Kathirmathiyon, secretary, Coimbatore Consumer Cause said.

However, he alleged, due to deliberate omission in communicating the requirement of metering/sub metering, field officers of Tangedco collected commercial tariff for all the units consumed, including domestic under commercial tariff.

Further, the tariff was collected right from 11/08/2017 retrospectively from a large number of apartments, Mr. Kathirmathiyon added.

In a few cases in Chennai, the officials booked consumers for energy theft for non-conversion to commercial tariff, he said.

In its letter, the TNERC noted that though segregation of electrical wiring for the said common usages lay with the consumer, the onus partially lay with the Tangedco with regard to metering.

Even though the time limit for electrical segregation was not prescribed in the tariff order, Tangedco could not take advantage of it, while consumers also needed to be given adequate time for segregation of usage, it added. Further, the regulator directed that “only if additional service connection is required by the owners/tenants, it shall be given and if only a meter (sub meter) is required to effect the additional service connection, service line charges shall not be collected from consumers.”

Mr. Kathirmathiyon said the apartments/multi tenement residential complexes who have paid the tariff with retrospective effect can demand the refund of the excess charges collected from them with interest as per Regulation 12(2) of Supply Code at the rate applicable for security deposit.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/provide-meters-to-levy-commercial-tariff-for-unsegregated-facilities/article30454489.ece
202,2020/01/02,Manual workers’ daughter secures fourth rank in TN PSC exam,"Her sheer determination to join the government administrative services coupled with sincere efforts for preparation of Group I examination helped K. Mahalakshmi, 25, daughter of fireworks employees, come out with flying colours in the competitive examination conducted by the Tamil Nadu Public Services Commission.

A studious girl since her childhood, Ms. Mahalakshmi has managed to clear the top competitive examination of the State not only in her very second attempt, but has also secured the fourth rank.

But for her resolve and unparalleled support from family members, Ms. Mahalakshmi too would have ended up as a labourer. Her father, S. Karuppasamy (70), and mother, K. Rajeswari (65), make paper cones and tubes meant for flowerpots and aerial crackers at their home in Tiruthangal.

The family’s economic condition did not give her elder brother the luxury of continuing his studies after 10th.

He works in a TASMAC liquor shop. But securing school first rank in 10th and 12th public examination gave her parents a ray of hope. Thus, they secured an educational loan and made her an engineering graduate in Biotechnology.

“My dream was always to get into government service, that too in administrative cadre. And ever since I got my degree in 2015, I have been preparing for it,” she said.

“A tutor, Ponvalli, at a centre giving coaching for competitive examinations in Satchiyapuram, offered me a seat for free. She took special care for my preparation,” said Ms. Mahalakshmi.

She also took classes at the coaching centre that helped her to financially support herself. During leisure time, she helped her parents in making cones and tubes.

Extra effort

Group studies, reading leading newspapers and periodic revision of subjects helped her prepare for the examination.

“I came very close to getting into the Group I services in January 2019, but lost it in the interview. But, this time I made extra efforts and that paid off,” she said.

She vouches that the school textbooks of Tamil Nadu Textbook Corporation are the best study materials for Group I examination. “I focussed on textbooks for classes 9 to 12 and also kept a tab on previous year question papers,” she said.

Her mantra for job aspirants is self-belief. “It is not that just city-bred students can clear Group I examination. Neither does it require very great effort,” she said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/s5o19b/article30454477.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02MAHALAKSHMIJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/manual-workers-daughter-emerges-victorious/article30454478.ece
203,2020/01/02,Tamil Nadu poised for a bumper harvest this Samba season,"Tamil Nadu is poised for a bumper harvest of foodgrains during the ongoing Samba cultivation season.

The reasons for the optimistic outlook are many. Among them are the higher coverage this time around when compared to the previous year, moderate rainfall during the northeast monsoon of 2019, extremely comfortable storage at reservoirs and a relatively pest attack-free cultivation season.

A senior official in the Agriculture Department said his department was hopeful of the foodgrain production touching at least 110 lakh tonnes.

It remains to be seen whether this year’s production could exceed the State’s performance in 2014-15, when it registered a record production figure of 127.95 lakh tonnes. At the time, paddy’s share was 79.49 lakh tonnes; millets – 40.79 lakh tonnes; and pulses – 7.67 lakh tonnes. Though there are still three months to go before the end of the current financial year, which is also the measuring period for agricultural production, this year’s coverage may eventually be lower than what was recorded during 2014-15. At the time, the total coverage of foodgrains was around 36 lakh hectares. This year’s figure is, as of now, 31.77 lakh hectares.

One of the key features of the current year is the situation of plenty when it comes to water. Thanks to bountiful rainfall in the catchments of the Cauvery and other major rivers during the southwest monsoon and moderate rainfall in the subsequent northeast monsoon, farmers did not have to struggle for water. Of course, there have been reports of water not reaching tail-end areas of the river systems.

The bottom line

Notwithstanding these reports, the bottom line is that there will not be a shortage of drinking water during the summer in many parts of the State. On Wednesday, the Mettur dam’s storage stood at 91.6 thousand million cubic feet (tmc ft), against a capacity of 93.47 tmc ft. Likewise, Bhavanisagar, which is next to Mettur in terms of capacity, remains virtually at full reservoir level. Its storage is hardly 400 million cubic feet short of its capacity of 32.8 tmc ft. The same holds good for the Parambikulam, which has a storage of 12.643 tmc ft against its capacity of 13.408 tmc ft.

A senior official of the Public Works Department said that given the storage at Mettur, the water release, scheduled on June 12 for the kuruvai season will, in all likelihood, happen this year — the first time in the last 9 years. In spite of a better situation overall with regard to water and rainfall, the Agriculture Department has pursued the enrolment of farmers under the crop insurance scheme. As of December 24, around 29.85 lakh hectares and 18.92 lakh farmers had been brought under the insurance cover, compared to 35.37 lakh hectares and 24 lakh farmers during the previous year.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/qk5qrd/article30454446.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th02cropcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tamil-nadu-poised-for-a-bumper-harvest-this-samba-season/article30454447.ece
204,2020/01/02,‘Why should kolams haunt govt.?’,"The BJP government at the Centre is implementing the agenda of the RSS in the country, and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is a step in that direction, according to Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani. He says the new citizenship law goes against the Constitution and the secular fabric of the country. Excerpts:

Will the anti-CAA protests help the BJP consolidate Hindu votes?

When they brought in this Act, they were under this delusion. But now, it has been clearly established that though they want to divide the country on religious lines, the people are not prepared to go along with it. That is why most Hindus have raised the banner of revolt. The students have taken up this issue, as have intellectuals. They are not divided on religious lines. [People are saying] Don't divide us on religious lines, as that would be unconstitutional, anti-constitution and anti-secular. Take women, for instance. They are drawing these kolams (with anti-CAA messages). What does it show? Just because they (BJP) have a brute majority, it doesn’t mean they can pass any law under the sun. Laws should be within the framework of, and in compliance with, the basic structure of the Constitution. Otherwise, they are bound to be opposed.

The DMK appears to have softened its attack on Hindus. The party's leaders are insisting that a majority of its cadre are Hindus. And, MDMK leader Vaiko recently said the anti-Hindu strategy should be reconsidered. Do you agree?

I differ with the very wording of your question. The DMK has never been anti-Hindu. They are not anti-Hindu, but are pro-people. Dravidianism is opposed to the principles of Hinduism, and hence, it has been interpreted as being anti-Hindu. The basic singularity of the Hindu philosophy is inequality. Religion thrives on inequality, the caste system and untouchability. The Dravidian Movement was brought about to eradicate it.

Is the DK opposing the CAA only because it welcomes Hindus and non-Muslims from other countries?

No. We have been very clear from the beginning. We were the first to react against the Act. When they have chosen three countries, why should they discriminate on the basis of religion? When people flee a country, harassed and aggrieved, they should be shown empathy. Where does religious discrimination come from? In the CAA, they have clearly singled out Muslims. Why should they? Muslims are also harassed in Islamic countries.

When you are prepared to give asylum to so many people, it must be only on the basis of human considerations and should not be done with religious bias. So far as citizenship is concerned, Articles 8 and 14 [of the Constitution] don’t rely on religion. The very motive behind the [proposed] National Register of Citizens must be questioned.

Why do you think the BJP government has not acceded to Tamil Nadu MPs’ demand to include Sri Lankan refugees (most of them Hindus) under the purview of the CAA?

They are not only against Muslims, but are also against their own religion. They (Sri Lankan refugees) have the Tamil spirit. That is why they (BJP) don't want to take in Eelam Tamils, which in itself is a gross contradiction. You cannot adopt a different yardstick for them. Sri Lankan Tamil people are more bhakti-minded. The only disqualification is that they were born Tamils.

Minister K. Pandiarajan has said only a small number of people are supporting the anti-CAA protests. The Centre has claimed that some elements have been instigating students to stage protests...

If the majority does not oppose this, why should they be afraid? Why should they register cases against thousands of people? Why would they let kolams become their nightmare? Why do these kolams haunt them? They [protesters] are expressing themselves in the most Constitutional way. It is my right to support them or otherwise. The AIADMK government’s days are numbered. It is with the Centre's help that the State government continues to remain in power.

As for the charge of instigation, who has instigated it? People are rising [up] without any instigation. If at all anybody is to be accused of this, it should be the Centre. The instigation for the people to protest came from the Centre.

The State unit of the BJP recently made some remarks against Periyar. Why do you think Periyar is being targeted now?

Actually, they wanted to see the reaction. Periyar is a symbol of revolt, and even students in north India use Periyar [for their causes]. They (BJP) wanted to sully the image of Periyar. They miserably failed, and that is why they withdrew it (the remarks). What does that show? They are terribly afraid of Periyar. When Periyar was alive, he faced them all — he was attacked with chappals and rotten eggs. But we welcome it (the BJP's tweet targeting Periyar). It will have an effect like an Australian boomerang. Let them do it more. Every act of vandalism against a Periyar statue and other such actions will only contribute to the success of the Periyarist philosophy.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1dwfkh/article30454415.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02DRAVIDARKAZHAGAMPRESIDENTKVEERAMANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/why-should-kolams-haunt-govt/article30454416.ece

206,2020/01/02,Aussie-A coach lavishes praise on Shafali,"Australia women’s A-team coach Leah Poulton has lavished praise on young Indian opener Shafali Verma for her powerful batting, and said the teenager is “one to watch over” in the future.

Playing for India-A women’s team, the 15-year-old smashed a 78-ball 124 in a one-day match against Australia-A last month in Brisbane leaving behind a lasting impression on Poulton.

Full of power

“She’s just an amazing talent, she’s only 15-years-old and she’s got so much power. She just had so much composure at the crease, she didn’t looked fussed at all. She’s definitely going to be one to watch over the next few years,” Poulton told cricket.com.au.

“We’d seen a bit of footage leading in, she’s played a bit of cricket for India. But when you watch footage of a player like that, it probably doesn’t do it justice because she’s actually got a really good presence at the crease,” she added.

Shafali, who made her debut in September, has represented India in nine T20Is amassing 222 runs. The Rohtak-born player hit two back-to-back half-centuries against the West Indies.

In November, she became the youngest Indian cricketer to score a half-century in international cricket when she hit a 49-ball 73 in a T20I against the West Indies.

Not typical Indian

“Even though she’s 15, she’s a tall girl and strong as well. When she walked out to bat, I thought, ‘that can’t be the 15-year-old.’ She’s not your typical Indian opening bat,” Poulton said.

“Over the years they’ve produced these opening bats with these amazing techniques and they’re really crafty, whereas she walked out there and she was just pure power.

“It was really good to watch, I did get into fan mode for a while.”",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/i1i1w9/article30463748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03SHAF,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/aussie-a-coach-lavishes-praise-on-shafali/article30463749.ece
207,2020/01/02,"No Sushil, but trials to go ahead","The Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) will go ahead with trials in the men’s freestyle 74kg category despite a postponement request from the injured Sushil Kumar.

However, the celebrated grappler may get a chance to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics in March.

Hand injury

Sushil, who has been struggling to revive his career, has pulled out of Friday’s trials citing a hand injury and had requested trials in his category to be postponed.

The winners of the trials will be part of the Indian team for the season’s first ranking series tournament in Rome (January 15-18), Asian Championship in New Delhi (February 18-23) and the Asian Olympic Qualifier in Xian, China, from March 27 to 29.

WFI President Brij. Bhushan Sharan Singh said the trials will be held in all categories — five Olympic classes in men’s freestyle and six in Greco-Roman.

“Definitely the trials will not be postponed. We will have wrestlers competing in the 74kg. What can we do if Sushil is injured,” said Sharan.

“We will see the performance of the winner in the 74kg in the ranking series event. Then we will decide what step we need to take,” said Sharan when asked if Sushil will be given a chance to compete at the Asian qualifiers.

India had secured Olympic quotas in three men’s freestyle categories through Ravi Dahiya (57kg), Bajrang (65kg) and Deepak Punia (86kg) while Vinesh Phogat (53kg) was the lone woman grappler to grab a Tokyo Games quota at the World Championships in Nur Sultan.

While Ravi, Deepak and Vinesh have been asked to compete in the trials, competition in their categories will be held only for the Rome and New Delhi events.

“If the WFI feels that we do not have a strong candidate for the Asian qualifier (for Tokyo Games) in March, the federation may ask Sushil to appear in a trial,” said WFI assistant-secretary Vinod Tomar.

Will be back

Sushil has been training vigorously with Russian coach Kamal Malikov. “I will be fit in two weeks’ time. Don’t worry, I will be back. I had sustained this hand injury after the Worlds while training. The WFI knew about it. It’s ok if they are going ahead with the trials,” said Sushil.

The women’s trials will be held in Lucknow on Saturday.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/7t2soa/article30463733.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03SUSHIL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/no-sushil-but-trials-to-go-ahead/article30463734.ece
208,2020/01/02,Kyrgios inspires fund-raisers to help fire victims,"Australia’s tennis chief announced a series of fund raisers for victims of raging bush fires on Thursday after an appeal from bad boy Nick Kyrgios.

Kyrgios, often a controversial figure in the sport, called for an exhibition tournament before the Australian Open Grand Slam, after blazes that have claimed 18 lives and forced mass evacuations.

“C’mon @TennisAustralia surely we can do a pre @AustralianOpen exho to raise funds for those affected by the fires?” tweeted the 24-year-old, who has handed a 16-week suspended ban in September after a series of outbursts.

Tennis Australia CEO Craig Tiley responded by saying fund-raisers would be held during tournaments including the Australian Open and the ATP Cup team event, telling fans to “stay tuned” for details.

“For weeks we’ve been watching the devastation caused by bush fires across Australia and the people affected are constantly in our thoughts,” said Tiley.

“We want to help these communities in a meaningful way and will announce a number of fund raising and support initiatives that will be rolled out across the ATP Cup, Australian Open and our other events over the coming weeks.”

Kyrgios, in Brisbane for the inaugural ATP Cup team competition, said the tennis world now had the chance to do “something special“.

“Tennis Australia, obviously, has been pretty proactive about it,” Kyrgios said Thursday. “I’m sure something will happen. I’m sure all of us will be involved in some way,” he added.

The bush fires are the major talking point ahead of the 24-team ATP Cup, which is being held in Brisbane, Perth and Sydney.

209,2020/01/02,"Vijender Singh: You win sometimes, other times you learn","He hasn’t lost a bout in close to five years and Vijender Singh is determined to keep the record with a world title to boot as he enters the new decade donning multiple hats, including the one of an active politician “with strong opinions’’.

The 34-year-old trailblazing boxer, who delivered India’s first Olympic and men’s World championship medals in boxing back in 2008 and 2009, has logged an enviable 12-0 record in the professional circuit, which he entered in 2015.

“All the talk with my promoters is focused on the world title. In all, I expect to compete in three-four fights this year with the world title being the big one. We are trying to ensure that this marquee fight happens in India,” Vijender said.

Vijender is handled by Hall of Famer Bob Arum’s Top Rank Promotions in the USA and has Infinity Optimal Solution (IOS) Boxing Promotions to handle him in India. He last fought in November 2019, beating Ghana’s former Commonwealth champion Charles Adamu in a lopsided bout.

Trains with Beard

“I will continue to train with Lee Beard and move to Manchester in a next few weeks to begin my training there. While I am here, I train at a gym in Gurugram,” he said.

Beard, who has trained professional stars like Ricky Hatton, has been Vijender’s trainer since 2015. Under his tutelage, the Haryana-lad clinched the WBO Asia Pacific and Oriental super middleweight titles.

The only time Vijender tasted defeat in the last five years was when he decided to take the political plunge ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

He lost the election from South Delhi while contesting on a Congress ticket.

Does he regret the move? “Not one bit. I fully stand by it and I intend to be an active politician. I have strong opinions on issues and I like to be vocal. Being a politician gives you a platform to be the change,” he asserted.

“Kai baar aap seekhte hain, kai baar aap jitate hain (sometimes you learn, other times you win). That’s how I would describe my decision to join politics. It is a wonderful way to stay connected with realities of life. Why should I have regrets just because I lost one election?” he asked.

Vijender said there is nothing wrong if people demand their heroes to voice opinion in public.

Voices matter

“I believe athletes should speak. At one level, we are also representatives and our voices matter. It shouldn’t be that we are saying stuff only when being paid to do so. Views rakhne chahiye, generally (we should present our views).

Speaking about going forward, the strapping six-footer welcomed his second son in May last year and he says he has lost track of time ever since.

The NBA, whose championship games were not televised live in the United States when Stern’s 30-year tenure began, announced his passing.

Stern, who underwent emergency surgery after he was stricken December 12, built the league into a global sporting empire by the time he retired in February 2014, and passed leadership to current commissioner Adam Silver.

“David took over the NBA in 1984 with the league at a crossroads, but over the course of 30 years as commissioner he ushered in the modern global NBA,” Silver said in a statement.

“He launched ground-breaking media and marketing partnerships, digital assets and social responsibility programs that have brought the game to billions of people around the world.

“Without David Stern, the NBA would not be what it is today,” six-time NBA champion Michael Jordan said in a statement.

“He guided the league through turbulent times and grew the league into an international phenomenon, creating opportunities that few could have imagined before.

“RIP Mr David Stern The best commissioner to ever do it,” four-time NBA champion Shaquille O’Neal O’Neal tweeted.

Stern oversaw expansion of the league from 23 to 30 clubs, the debut of active NBA talent in the Olympics and the sport’s expansion to a popular worldwide television phenomenon.

Stern also helped establish the Women’s NBA and a development league for NBA talent, ensuring a next man was ready whenever an injury struck.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tl795t/article30463526.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03DAVID,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/nba-mastermind-stern-passes-away/article30463529.ece

With bushfires raging across New South Wales state, day two of the match on Saturday shapes up as the biggest challenge with temperatures forecast to soar and smoggy conditions expected.

The issue of smoke is a difficult one for officials, who currently rely on a mix of air quality guidelines from the International Cricket Council, State governments and the Australian Institute of Sport.

Inconsistencies

But there are inconsistencies on what is considered “unsafe”, with Cricket Australia and the players’ association currently working to develop better protocols around visibility and air quality.

It follows a Big Bash League match in Canberra being abandoned this month because of toxic bushfire haze. Currently, it is up to the umpires to decide whether conditions are safe, without any formal framework for that decision.

With the first two Tests at Perth and Melbourne ending in heavy defeats inside four days, New Zealand will need all the help it can get.

Coach Gary Stead admitted the Black Caps were “beaten up by Australia again” in their 247-run Melbourne thrashing and they have had to go back to the drawing board.

“We’ve got to find some areas where we can keep chipping away, make improvements and put Australia under pressure for longer,” he said.

“When you are under pressure for the periods Australia have put us under, then you have to question what we’re doing.

“Australia have three bowlers at 145 kph and a spinner (Nathan Lyon) who’s taken over 300 Test wickets so you’re always up against it. You don’t get a reprieve and that’s the hard thing for us.”

Only bright spot

The bright spot from Melbourne was makeshift opener Tom Blundell’s gritty second innings century and he is set to retain the role alongside Tom Latham.

But there is doubt over skipper Kane Williamson, who has had a poor tour.

The New Zealand Herald reported that he missed training on Wednesday with flu-like symptoms, with batsman Henry Nicholls suffering similar problems.

213,2020/01/02,Paul Pogba’s new injury setback,"Paul Pogba will undergo surgery on a recurring ankle injury and is expected to spend another month on the sidelines, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirmed after his side’s 2-0 defeat to Arsenal on Wednesday.

The French World Cup winner made his comeback after nearly three months out in a 2-0 defeat at Watford 10 days ago and also made an appearance off the bench in a 4-1 thrashing of Newcastle four days later.

“We’ve had scans and it’s nothing major, it’s something that has to be sorted and dealt with. He’s been advised to it as soon as,” said Solskjaer.

Pogba has made just six starts in all competitions for United this season and his influence in midfield has been badly missed with United sitting fifth in the Premier League.

His latest setback comes at a bad time for Solskjaer with Scott McTominay also sidelined for two months leaving the Norwegian extremely short on midfield options.

“It’s a big blow that Paul is out now that Scott’s out, he’ll be out for a few months. Paul will be back within a month.” Speculation also surrounds Pogba’s future at Old Trafford after he expressed a desire to leave the club before the start of the season.

And Solskjaer denied suggestions it is Pogba’s own medical team rather than the club’s which has suggested to undergo surgery at this time.

“We look after our players’ health,” added Solskjaer. “It’s been advised that he should do it as soon as possible.”

214,2020/01/02,"Three football fans arrested for racist, homophobic abuse","A Brighton fan was arrested for racially abusing Chelsea players during a Premier League match, and two other soccer fans were arrested in separate incidents during the same game for hurling homophobic abuse at rival supporters.

Brighton chief executive Paul Barber called the abuse “disgusting” and urged supporters to report wrongdoing at the stadium.

“If the prospect of a life ban from watching their clubs play football isn’t a strong enough deterrent, we have to ask the question as to whether the courts should be given the power to hand out more severe punishments?” Barber said in a statement on Thursday.

“Football can only do so much, and we are sick and tired of the game’s reputation being tarnished by these people.

“I find it impossible to comprehend how and why some individuals think it’s acceptable to behave in this way.”

215,2020/01/02,Arsenal guns down a lacklustre Manchester United,"Arsenal rang in the new year by giving boss Mikel Arteta his first victory as lacklustre Manchester United crashed to a 2-0 defeat.

Arteta had watched Arsenal take only one point from his first two matches, with last weekend’s 2-1 defeat against Chelsea especially painful after the Blues scored twice in the final minutes.

But Arsenal had played well for long periods in that London derby and it produced an even more sparkling display to put United to the sword at the Emirates Stadium.

Close range

The Gunners took the lead in the eighth minute when Sead Kolasinac’s cross ran through to Nicolas Pepe at the far post and the Ivory Coast winger beat David De Gea from close-range.

Arsenal, which last won in the league at West Ham on December 9, got a deserved second goal in the 43rd minute when De Gea kept out Alexandre Lacazette’s flick and Sokratis reacted quickest to lash home.

Nine adrift

Arteta’s team is nine points adrift of the top four, but its second win in 16 matches in all competitions offers hope of a brighter future under the former Arsenal midfielder’s management.

“It feels great, incredible. I’m so happy and proud of the players,” Arteta said.

“Physically the level dropped in the second half but the commitment and desire was terrific.

“The performances are getting better so I was desperate for the win and we got it.”

United is fifth, five points behind fourth placed Chelsea, after the latest in a long list of underwhelming performances in a troubled campaign.

“We started decent the first five or six minutes, didn’t capitalise, and then they played really well,” United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said.

“We were too slow in the first half, but that’s credit to them. Some tired heads maybe.”

The results: Arsenal 2 (Pepe 8, Sokratis 43) bt Manchester United 0; Manchester City 2 (Jesus 51, 58) bt Everton 1 (Richarlison 71); Newcastle 0 lost to Leicester 3 (Perez 36, Maddison 39, Choudhury 87); Norwich 1 (Cantwell 4) drew with Crystal Palace 1 (Wickham 85); Southampton 1 (Ings 17) bt Tottenham 0; Watford 2 (Deulofeu 30, Doucoure 49) bt Wolves 1 (Neto 60); West Ham 4 (Noble 17, 35-pen, Haller 25, Anderson 66) bt Bournemouth 0.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/xfc4zu/article30462693.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03ARSENAL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/arsenal-guns-down-a-lacklustre-manchester-united/article30462694.ece

The Sri Lankan team headed straight to the team hotel amid thick security cover.

The members of the Indian team are expected to arrive in batches on Friday for the series opener on Sunday.

“Both the teams have optional training sessions, Sri Lanka followed by India in the evening,” a official of the Assam Cricket Association (ACA) said.

Assam had witnessed widespread protests against the CAA in December, which affected Ranji and U-19 matches at the domestic level because of curfew.

“But situation is absolutely normal now and tourism is back in the state. We are hosting Khelo India Games from January 10 and about seven thousand players will participate,” ACA secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.

“It’s now safe as any other place in the country. The state government is looking after the security arrangement and there’s no issue at all.”

About 27,000 tickets of the 39,500-capacity Barasapra Stadium has already been sold out.

“People were busy with the Christmas and New Year celebrations. We are expecting a last minute ticket rush now,” he said.

The second T20 will be played in Indore on January 7 while Pune will host the final match of the series on January 10.

The short series will mark the Twenty20 World Cup countdown for the two neighbouring countries.

India play eight T20Is, including five in New Zealand, ahead of their T20 World Cup opener against South Africa in Perth on October 24.

Former skipper Angelo Mathews and Dhananjaya de Silva have been recalled to the 16-member Sri Lankan squad. Mathews, last played a T20I against South Africa in August 2018.

217,2020/01/02,Mirabai Chanu eighth in latest Olympic qualification rankings,"On course to seal a berth for the Tokyo Games, former world champion Mirabai Chanu maintained her eighth spot in the Olympic qualifiers ranking list released by the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) on Thursday.

In the race for Olympic qualification, the 25-year-old, who competes in the 49 kg category, has gathered 2966.6406 ranking points till now.

To qualify for Tokyo, a weightlifter must compete in at least one event in each of the three periods of six months (spread over November 2018 to April 2020), at least six events overall and in at least one gold and silver level event.

“The ranking points are based on the number of events a lifter participates in and Mirabai has missed a few competitions, including the World Championship in 2018, due to her back injury,” National coach Vijay Sharma told PTI.

“But being eighth now is not a problem as after the final rankings list is made in April and the best results will be taken into account,” he added.

After recovering from a back injury, which marred her progress in 2018, Chanu has constantly improved her performance in 2019. She lifted 86kg in snatch and a personal best of 113kg in clean and jerk for a total of 199kg at the Asian Championships in April last year to miss the bronze medal by a whisker.

Her best performance came at the World championship in September, when the Manipuri breached the much anticipated 200kg mark by lifting her personal best in all three sections. In snatch, she lifted 87kg, followed by 114kg in clean and jerk for a total of 201kg.

However, Ms. Chanu ended the year on a bittersweet note as she won gold at the Qatar International Cup - an Olympic qualifying silver level event -- but her effort of 194kg was way below her personal best.

The latest qualifying rankings feature three Chinese weightlifters in the top five. Reigning World Champion and world record holder Hou Zhihui (4703.1982) heads the list while Jiang Huihua (4667.8878) and Zhang Rong (3837.8294) occupy the second and fourth spots respectively.

However, only one of the three Chinese lifters will compete at the Olympics as a nation can send no more than one athlete each per weight category.

Ri Song Gum of North Korea is placed third with 4209.4909 points.

The fifth, sixth and seventh spots are occupied by USA’s Delacruz Jourdan Elizabeth (184kg), Indonesia’s Aisah Windy Cantika (190kg) and Segura Ana Iris (188kg) of Colombia. All three of them alongside Ms. Rong (199kg) have personal bests lower than that of Chanu’s (201kg).

In the men’s 67kg category, Youth Olympics gold medallist Jeremy Lalrinnunga is placed 32nd with 2,310.9653 points.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/spt373/article30458738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH21-LIFT-MIRABGMM6SITJ13jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/mirabai-chanu-ranked-eighth-in-latest-olympic-qualification-rankings/article30458735.ece

Speaking to reporters here, he said Mr. Dayakar Rao doesn’t have the stature to criticise Mr. Gandhi and his comparison between IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao and Rahul Gandhi was ridiculous. “We have no objection if the Minister wants to praise KTR and he can do so but he should stay away from criticising Mr. Gandhi,” he said.

Mr. Reddy reminded Mr. Dayakar Rao how critical he was about KCR and KTR when he was in the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). He should remember that minister position was not permanent and he should conduct himself with some dignity while being a Minister.

Mr. Reddy also targeted State Election Commissioner V. Nagi Reddy saying he was toeing the line of the ruling TRS party. How can he announce the municipal schedule without giving clarity on the reservations in the wards and municipalities. “If we go to Court questioning this favouritism to TRS party they criticise us of being afraid of elections,” he said.

220,2020/01/02,Farmers panic amid reports of urea shortage,"Farmers who have transplanted paddy are panicking in the wake of reports of shortage of urea which is essential for the crop right from sowing. Those who are approaching primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) and authorised dealers are getting back home disappointed as they are being told that there is “no stock”.

Contrary to the reports, the agriculture authorities and sources in national agricultural cooperative societies said that there is no shortage of urea or other fertilizer. However, farmers complain that like in kharif, in the current yasangi (rabi) too they are facing the problem for urea with insufficient supply. They also complain that the private dealers who hoarded the fertilizer are demanding at least ₹20 to ₹40 more per each bag which officially costs ₹280.

According to Deputy Director, Agriculture, Mohammed Wajid Hussain, there is absolutely no shortage of urea in the district. As per the schedule, 37,166 metric tones should have come by December 31, and of which 31,000 MTs arrived and was distributed through PACS and authorised dealers. Another 13,000 MTs is kept at Markfed for any time distribution.

225,2020/01/02,Congress-TDP alliance in Madhira,"The Congress party has forged a strategic alliance with the TDP to contest the ensuing civic polls to Madhira Municipality in an effort to retain its hold over the town, regarded as its traditional stronghold.

The stakes are high for the Opposition parties, mainly the Congress, as well as the ruling TRS in the ensuing elections to the Madhira civic body.

The CPI (M) also holds significant sway in Madhira, considered as a key town along the inter-State border with Andhra Pradesh.

The local Congress leadership is making all out efforts to win the civic body, which is part of the Madhira Assembly constituency, presently represented by Congress Legislature Party leader Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka.

The ruling TRS is heavily banking on the ‘development plank’ to emerge victorious in the forthcoming civic polls. The CPI (M) local leadership is keen on contesting the elections alone, sources said.

Even before the release of the municipal election notification, the local leaders of the Congress party and the TDP have launched a joint campaign in Madhira town to drum up support for their alliance.

“We are exploring all options to put up a joint fight against the ruling TRS to win all the three municipalities, including Madhira, Wyra and Sattupalli, of the district at the ensuing hustings,” said District Congress Committee (DCC) president P Durga Prasad.

Academic lessons incorporating the suggestions of spiritual persons like Jeeyar Swamy and former DGPs will be included in the syllabus and taught in the class-rooms from the next academic year itself as a part of efforts to build a value-based society, he announced.

A committee of former DGPs would be constituted for preparing required lessons and spiritual persons like Jeeyar Swamy would also be consulted for their suggestions and guidance. The teachings required for build a good society would be commenced from the next academic year itself. Police also should extend their cooperation to develop Telangana as a model society, he said.

The Chief Minister was speaking on the occasion of releasing the autobiography ‘Journey through Turbulent Times’ penned by former Director General of Police H. J. Dora at Pragathi Bhavan here on Thursday and also felicitated the author and the publishers. The book detailed the critical situations and circumstances faced by the former DGP during his service and written in a way to inspire the police officers. He through his work showed how to achieve success through team work, act strategically at the time of crisis, work efficiently with available resources.

Expressing concern over increasing criminality in society, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said in some places people were behaving like animals and there was an urgent need to put a check to this. It was not wrong to be strict while discharging one’s duty to ensure good behaviour. In a democracy, certain actions would have to be taken recognising the feelings of people and respecting them. Sometimes stringent action would become inevitable for the benefit of society, he said.

Complimenting the Telangana police, Mr. Chandrasekhar Rao said under the leadership of Director General of Police Mahender Reddy, police apart from protecting law and order were also taking action to eliminate social evils like illicit liquor brewing, close down playing card clubs, check illegal transport of rice and participating in Haritha Haram by planting saplings. The police should also become partners in making the State totally literate State.

Mr. Dora said police should never get a feeling of helplessness and utilise the available resources at optimal level. He said host of schemes and projects like Kaleshwaram, revival of tanks, public health, residential schools would become assets to the State.

Efforts should be made to prepare data pertaining to adult illiterates village wise as part of the Palle Pragati programme based on which the government planned to adopt a comprehensive programme on educating this section.

He wanted the people to actively participate in the Palle Pragati which would continue till January 12 and take steps to ensure clean surroundings for promoting health and hygiene besides enhancing the green cover in the villages. Panchayat Raj Department Principal Secretary Vikas Raj who accompanied the Chief Secretary said the Palle Pragati programme was launched with an objective to ensure that residents of the villages had independence in planning development that suited their respective villages and efforts should be accordingly made to identify the basic amenities that would be required so that the government could release funds for their development.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/9e7uhc/article30463026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy03Somesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/responsibility-of-all-stakeholders-to-ensure-quality-works/article30462281.ece
228,2020/01/02,Dynamic modelling to help improve farm output,"Can policy makers ‘see’ the outcomes of their decisions even before implementing them? Researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) are trying to make it happen with the click of a mouse.

A small group of scientists are working to support policy makers in ways not attempted before in Indian agriculture, through an approach called System Dynamics Modelling (SDM). The computer-based models of agricultural value chains built through this approach can simulate scenarios in complex socio-economic systems. An agricultural value chain is simply a set of all entities involved in all the activities and processes from crop production to consumption.

Validated SDM models can, for instance, accurately reveal the impact of unpredictable weather events in crop value chains, or can reveal just how much increasing consumer awareness of crops can affect their price, says agro-economist at ICRISAT Shalander Kumar. SDM was first developed in 1950s but it was not until 1972 that an SDM model involving agriculture was first published.

Complex value chains

“Agricultural value chains are extremely complex and often hard to analyse in entirety. Analysing them with existing methods is limiting as such methods are largely qualitative. For policy makers and businesses, including start-ups, to know the consequences of decisions they are about to take, dynamic models employing quantitative research is required,” Mr. Kumar told The Hindu.

ICAR and ICRISAT have joined hands to model five value chains in India over the next five years. These include the sorghum (jowar)-dairy value chain, finger millet-sorghum value chain, livestock value chain and value chains of potato and spice crops like cumin. Work on SDM models for the sorghum-dairy value chain in association with the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) and Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has been underway for nearly a year, Mr. Kumar informs.

“Despite encouraging policy intentions and a promising consumption scenario, the cropped area and production of sorghum, which is a highly nutritious and drought tolerant crop, continues to fall in India. The key is to determine robust short-term and long-term policy interventions to make production attractive for farmers,” he said.

Sorghum-dairy model

The sorghum-dairy model that Mr. Kumar is working on is expected to reveal policy gaps and appropriate interventions on both supply and demand side for enhancing grain, quality fodder and milk production; sorghum provides both nutritious grain for human consumption and quality fodder for livestock/ dairy animals. The interventions that the model is expected to reveal can increase crop-livestock productivity, profitability and nutrition outcomes. It will also provide strategic insights to efficiently manage potential price fluctuations and market risks, the scientist said.

SDM’s successful use in the dairy value chains of Nicaragua and devising strategies for competitiveness of meat export from Ethiopia motivated scientists to adopt it in India, according to Mr. Kumar. Farmers in both these countries were able to increase earnings, resulting in those models taking the shape of an online tool for policy makers and researchers, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/sqj8yk/article30462218.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03SHALANDERKUMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dynamic-modelling-to-help-improve-farm-output/article30462219.ece

231,2020/01/02,Successful trial run of Bhadradri Teppotsavam,"With Mukkoti Ekadasi festival fast approaching, arrangements for the grand religious fete have reached a feverish pace in Bhadrachalam town.

The trial run of the boat, decorated in the shape of a swan, was conducted in the Godavari in the temple town on Thursday evening as part of preparations to ensure smooth conduct of Teppotsavam (Float festival) to be held on January 5.

A ramp has been readied on the banks of the river near the Karakatta (flood bank) for the ensuing “celestial boat ride.”

The Irrigation Department officials reviewed the arrangements to facilitate smooth sailing of the boat specially brought in from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh for the Teppotsavam.

The mega annual religious fete will feature Uttara Dwara Darshanam at the historic Sri Sitaramachandra Swamy temple on the occasion of Mukkoti Ekadasi festival on January 6.

Meanwhile, hordes of devotees flocked to the temple on Thursday to have a glimpse of the presiding deity of the shrine adorned in “Rama Avataram” as part of the ongoing Sri Vaikunta Ekadasi Prayukta Adyayanotsavalu.

232,2020/01/02,Rich history of Nirmal lies neglected,"The ruins of the once glorious forts in Nirmal district headquarters town are like a teaser to students of history and archaeology as they hide much more of its civilisational history than they reveal. Every crumbling part of these forts, like the arch of the main entrance of the Shamgarh Fort and the stone cross-bar at the main entrance of Battisgarh Fort, takes away with it some aspect related with the conversion of the desolate rocky hills into a place bustling with human activity, 17th century onwards.

There is hardly any ‘scientific’ study on Nirmal town of yore which can given an insight into resource management especially its water systems which, incidentally can still be made functional. All the forts were built on rocky hills on a higher altitude and around water bodies.

The tanks not only irrigated the lands but provided for some kind of natural protection to the fortifications. All the forts had wells dug inside the ramparts which, curiously, never dried up despite being located on high rocky ground.

Cannon foundries

So far, detailed studies have been made on Nirmal’s cannon foundries by historian S. Jaikishan belonging to the Hyderabad-based NGO, Deccan Archaeological and Cultural Research Institute. On history, retired teacher from Nirmal town, Ankam Ramulu has written a book titled Nirmal Charitra (History of Nirmal) besides several newspaper articles mostly by history enthusiasts.

The need for more information about Nirmal’s history and related aspects was highlighted by Rangu Laxmi Narahari, a goldsmith from the temple town of Dharmapuri in Jagtial district who visited the Battisgarh Fort ruins on New Year day. “More knowledge about the fort and the structures inside would have helped us understand the design and the rationale behind such a design,” he observed standing among the rocks inside the main entrance of the fort.

Need protection

Kadari Ravinder, a government teacher, who had also come to the fort the same day echoed the sentiment and wanted in depth studies to be conducted by the government. “We should learn of our history and protect these monuments,” he asserted.

Despite having written the history of Nirmal town based on his personal researches starting 1977-78 which includes interviews with centenarian retired teacher T. Narayana and referring a Parsi document at Hyderabad’s State Library, Mr. Ramulu also says a proper study on the use of resources is the need of the hour. According to him, the town had 13 tanks supplying water, which can become a subject of a study.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/3nmmtr/article30461816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03SHAMGARH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/rich-history-of-nirmal-lies-neglected/article30461817.ece
233,2020/01/02,"Plan to fake a burglary backfires, jewellers arrested","The plan of two gold merchants to cheat the bankers and evade paying the loan amount by staging a fake burglary backfired. They were arrested and 700 grams of gold and 6 kilograms of silver ornaments worth ₹ 11.70 lakhs were seized from their possession.

Kasula Mahesh (35) and his brother Kasula Bhaskar (34) of Jammikunta town were running a jewellery shop in the town and incurred huge debts from various banks for the purchase of ornaments. Incidentally, they also took Mudra loan from a bank. The accused planned to evade the repayment of bank loans and planned a burglary of their shop.

Accordingly, the accused shifted all the gold and silver ornaments and staged a burglary of the shop on December 31 and then lodged a complaint with the Jammikunta police. The police, who visited the spot, got suspicious over the way the burglary took place, including the breaking of alimarah etc. Sensing that the burglary was not done by professionals, the police investigated further and observed the CCTV footage and found the role of the accused brothers.

When the police interrogated them separately, the accused confessed to committing the offence only to avoid repayment of the bank loans and claim insurance amount.

Commissioner of Police V.B. Kamalasan Reddy congratulated the police for detection of the crime within 24 hours and rewarded them at a press conference on Thursday.

237,2020/01/02,"CAA, NRC to affect civic polls","The coming municipal election is likely to see different issues dominating the urban local bodies (ULB) in the east and the west of old undivided Adilabad district.

There are four municipalities in the western parts, Adilabad in Adilabad district, Nirmal, Bhainsa and Khanapur (new) in Nirmal district, which will have elections held, while the eastern side will have elections held for Kagaznagar in Kumram Bheem Asifabad distirct and Bellampally, Mancherial (both old), Luxettipet, Chennur, Kyathanpalli and Naspur (all new) ULBs on January 22.

Advantage BJP and TRS

For the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the campaign will mainly hinge on accusing the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), which was in power in all the old municipalities and garner votes that got polarised due to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) protests by the minorities helped by the TRS and Congress.

“If polarisation does happen, Congress will be the biggest loser as minorities will evidently side with the ruling party while other voters are more likely to go with the BJP,” opined a crestfallen Congress leader in Adilabad. In the western ULBs, the TRS is looking to go to town with its development agenda. “The Kalyana Lakshmi and Shaadi Mubarak schemes will bring us more votes in Adilabad, Nirmal, Bhainsa and Khanapur municipalities, which have more number of slums and a sizeable minority population,” asserted senior TRS leader B. Goverdhan Reddy, a front-runner for the post of chairman of Adilabad municipality. The issue of land grabbing by ruling party leaders could dominate the election in Bellampally and Mancherial municipalities in the eastern belt. The Kalyana Lakshmi or Shaadi Mubarak schemes are comparatively less attractive in these ULBs, according to political observers.

Miners’ swing votes

238,2020/01/02,"New spaces that help artists meet, paint and empower","Vibrant initiative

Galleries hosting artist residency programmes to provide space and accommodation for a stipulated time is not new. Often serving as an exchange platform, these programmes have participation of artists from other states and countries. Such initiatives by an individual are rare and worth applauding. We meet artist K Keerthi at her unique Skills Art Studio in Madhapur, a co-working space-cum-gallery for emerging artists who cannot afford a studio or resources.

“Keerthi is speech impaired and passionate about art,” says P Udaybhaskar Rao, her classmate in MFA at JNAFAU. Housed in a spacious three-bedroom apartment, it is a workplace for young artists to shape their ideas on canvas. The studio shifted from Jubilee Hills to this location in November 2018 and has been a active since February 2019. “Space is a big constraint for most BFA and MFA students. Locating a quiet place to paint is as tough as finding galleries which are forthcoming to display their works,” he says. Keerthi’s father K Radhakrishna (chairman, Nagarjuna Constructions) came forward to help his daughter and converted this apartment into a studio.

Four artists are selected for a term of 20 days and exhibit their works at the end. Udaybhaskar mentions: “One can apply online for the programme; The only criteria is they should be serious about art and not treat it like a hobby. When their term ends, they donate one small work (1X1 size) to the studio,” he says adding the material — canvas, sheets, pencils, acrylic and oil colours (except brush) are provided. There are many advantages of working in such an environment. “The artists interact and learn from each other. The mood is apt for art.” With nature as her inspiration, Keerthi loves vibrant canvases. “I like to paint flowers,” she smiles.

Keerthi has plans to create one such space in Vijayawada also.

Unique art community

Till a few months ago, Ramam Art Ghar (RaAGa) in Mahendra Hills reverberated with visual and performing arts. The ‘ghar’ belongs to Rajeswari Vadapalli, who renovated her parents’ house to make it a creative adda,” shares self-taught artist Usha Nagasri Annamraju. The ghar soon became a hub for music and dance sessions, art interactions and a studio and gallery for young artists. “It was a pleasant getaway as we could have open air sessions sitting under a guava, mango or neem tree. The experience was amazing,” she recollects addingthat it became a co-working space for artists and art lovers to paint.

Things changed when Rajeswari moved to US and the ghar had to be given away for rent. Although there is no physical space now, the members have taken it forward with a unique art community. Their art meets are held every month at a new venue. “Since we enjoyed the 12 art meets held at RaAGa, we decided to continue. Sharing our expertise in art and craft, we hold small competitions to keep the kid in us alive.”

239,2020/01/02,View from above,"“Have you ever stood on top of a hill and experienced the view?” asks artist Sayyad Shaiek. In his new solo show at Rainbow Art Gallery, the artist transforms into a spectator to give us a panoramic view of his works. The watercolour canvases — spread out at the gallery — are filled with changing colours of stunning skyline in different cities. “When a flight takes off, the imagery changes; The objects become small, almost insignificant yet you feel a connect. When you look below, you get a new perspective of the city, ” he says showing us an image with rows of houses and hills in the background. The work draws you in and the houses seem attached to one another.

Sayyad’s strength is his abstract realism. The artist loves to express with fewer figures and colours. The shades of brown, black and a tinge of Persian blue, and crimson red form an important part of his vision. “It is fascinating to see concrete structures from a higher ground; The low angle brings a different outlook,” he says. Sayyad calls himself a wanderer reflecting on things. “I feel as if I am flying. The buildings have no emotions but I enjoy looking at them and soaking in the experience.”

Sayyad’s sketching projects and artist residency programmes took him across the country. His canvases are inspired from travel sojourns to different cities in India and to Bhutan and Kathmandu. His short stay at Darjeeling provided a unique experience. “When you see the city standing on top of a hill, the view is different. The earth seems to be covered with these buildings and they appear closer.” His walking trails to know the city helped in his sketches and still are fresh in his memory. “Walking on a small footpath is exciting,” he says.

The works exude happiness and a bit of sadness in him. “There was a tragedy in the family and I was feeling depressed and wanted some relief so recollected my earlier travel experiences and those places and started painting again.”

The new year is a time to reflect as he came to the city to study art at University of Hyderabad exactly a decade ago. He mentions the changing cityscape is a proof to Hyderabad’s fast growth. “I would often go to Gandipet to sketch and now I feel like I have gone to a new place; the surrounding areas appear different. In the last 10 years, the areas around Hitec City have seen a major transformation.”

240,2020/01/02,Together on a tuneful journey,"“You have made a good beginning. You got first prize in violin, played in saint Tyagaraja’s house and now, you are performing in the French Embassy. I pray to God for your concert’s success and hope you both perform many more,” wrote the loving grandfather V. Lakshminarayana to his grand daughters.

The words and wishes turned out to be prophetic and the two sisters went from strength to strength, not only charting their path as a successful violin duo, but also spreading the beauty of the instrument and Carnatic music around the world. Dr. M. Lalitha and M. Nandini, the fourth generation practitioners of a musical lineage have returned from a successful Europe tour to soak in the annual Margazhi musical atmosphere.

The sisters spoke about their memorable moments and experiences of the tour. “The most memorable moment of this tour was the opportunity to perform in front of the Pope in Vatican. We presented the great Carnatic music tradition for the first time in the Vatican. The fact that the day also coincided with the 150th year celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi made this concert a truly cherished experience,” says Lalitha.

They have performed in many festivals such as World Music Festival, Bratislava, Festival in Turin and Umeå Jazz festival, Sweden. They also performed in Paris, Brussels, Germany, Carpi, Bolona, Zurich, Gnesta and Cremona.

The sold out concerts at the prestigious Parco Della Musica, Rome and Oranjerie Theater, Roermond were “unforgettable experiences”.

Speaking about Cremona, Nandini says, “It was like a pilgrimage since it is the land of violin where the best hand-crafted violin-making families Stradivari, Guarneri, Bergonzi and Amati live. We went to see the violin museum. Right from the crafting of the instrument to its different parts and other related instruments including viola, cello to the violin played by Louis XIV, it’s an amazing display.

“In many of these places people had not heard Carnatic music, so it was a joy to talk about our art and perform for them. Besides many interesting questions, they were also curious to know about playing the violin in a sitting position. We had to explain that to play the gamakas, where each note is ornamented, it is necessary for the violin to be supported by the shoulder and leg.” The sisters not only focused on music but also spoke about the heritage and culture of South India. The most amusing aspect of their visit was when they were invited to a workshop for pregnant women and midwives. “A Frenchman, who had done research on the impact of Carnatic music in enhancing natural delivery wanted us to share our thoughts on the healing effect of our music,” say the sisters.

Recalling their performance earlier at the International Festival of Music, Norway, they say it was an emotional moment when the Indian Ambassador there invited them to lead the Indian contingent carrying the Tricolour during a march-past of musicians.

Their Europe tour highlights an interesting incident mentioned in their grandfather’s letter — their first concert at Alliance Française where they were students. “In 1985, when a medieval singer Jean Billiard came to perform, the director of Alliance Française wanted us to play Carnatic music. We had not played a concert earlier and were also hesitant as our grandfather was in the U.S., but he blessed us and told us to go ahead. So the collaborative journey began from our arangetram kutcheri,” says Lalitha.

The sisters grew up in a musical atmosphere. “Our mother Subhulakshmi Muthuswamy was pregnant when she was learning from Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. May be a reason why we took to music naturally. We were taught music by our mother and grandfather. Woken up at four, we had to practice before school. Our uncle L. Vaidhyanathan would come to teach us too. In the evening again we had to practice till our father came home, which would be anywhere between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. “We were also taken to concerts of great musicians. Our mother would pack some biscuits and chocolates to keep us silent,” laughs Nandini.

Besides the learning at home, they also trained under Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. “His teaching methodology was such that we had no notation, but learnt only by listening. We therefore imbibed and internalised, not just memorised all that was taught to us. Direct interaction with the guru helped us pick up the nuances, which doesn’t happen in the skype classes today.”

Speaking about notation, they say it can form a broad framework, but the asaivu and gamakam cannot be notated. “That is where your training and imagination come into play,” points out Nandini.

Both of them studied at Queen Mary’s College, Chennai. While Lalitha did her M. Phil, Ph.D before going to Pittsburgh on a Fullbright scholarship where she specialised in composition writing for fusion music, Nandini, a triple Masters degree holder, went on a CWIT Fellowship to London, where she studied Ethnomusicology.

241,2020/01/02,Another gateway to the Deccan,"As part of DHF’s lecture series, “City of a Single Stone, the Kakatiya Heritage of Warangal” by Prof. Phillip Wagoner, was held at NGMA recently, co-sponsored by IMAS. DHF also commissioned the book, an addition to its publications on Deccan historical sites. The title needs some clarification: the city was not built from a “single stone” [as was, for example, the monolithic Ellora temple]; rather it was built around a single massive outcrop of rock that rose prominently from the surrounding plains. The sobriquet is a direct translation of the Sanskrit Ekashila Nagara, as is its Telugu name, Orugallu, to which Warangal has reverted.

Wagoner’s 40-year association with India was due to a serendipitous accident that led him to study Telugu at the Andhra University. “I had already studied religion, anthropology, social sciences… and courses on India that were fascinating, exposing me to the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, the epics, Buddhist texts, Indian art... But it was only after that year in Waltair, being immersed in the culture of India, when I became so gung-ho about things Indian, that I knew I was going into this field, though I didn’t know which discipline. I travelled as much as I could: Sanchi, Udaigiri, Ajanta - Ellora, Elephanta …”

He returned for a year’s apprenticeship with stone sculptors in Mamallapuram. “A lot of them spoke Telugu so I was able to communicate with them, about shilpashastra, talamana … I'd start the morning with drawing, then memorized some slokas, went on to some chiselling techniques – it was great fun! I got an insight into very important facets of the subjects I was interested in, though I knew would never become a sculptor!” [Besides a small Ganesha as proof of his efforts, he also took home a scar on his cornea, caused by a stone fragment]. “I travelled quite a bit, visited some Early Western Chalukyan sites, and it was my first time in Hampi, a pivotal visit for me, as I then went on to do so much work on the Vijayanagara Research Project that is an interdisciplinary international one. But when it came to choosing a dissertation topic, I wanted to do something where I would be able to make new discoveries, and found that Kakatiya was little known. I did my dissertation on the temples of Telangana (1986) but it was not until 1999 I went back to hone in on the metropolitan site Warangal, as opposed to the provincial areas I'd covered before.”

His research focusses on the Deccan, studying the interaction between the Islamic cultures and the Indic traditions of local kingdoms that existed primarily between 1200-1600. His lecture was proof of his hard work and dedication, his enthusiasm for his subject evident. His first slide showed a well-preserved torana, an image that is synonymous with Warangal, and now emblem of Telangana. The torana is found not only in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain sites in India but variations exist in Southeast Asia and even Japan. Torana is the etymological root for words such as “door” and the German “tor”, but the Warangal torana – which means “bird perch” – takes the word more literally, with two charming birds roosting on either end! The admirable state of its preservation is ascribed to the absence of religious imagery, which is probably why some other monuments in this region were also spared by Muslim invaders.

Wagoner was struck by the four toranas that were outside the wall of a sacred precinct, enclosing an area strewn with broken fragments such as plinths and brackets: surely the arched gateways suggested a welcome to some significant monument? With images by architectural photographer Surendra Kumar illustrating his detailed narrative, Wagoner pieced together for his audience how the scattered archaeological ruins pointed to the Svayambhusiva Temple that housed the Kakatiya’s deity though, instead of the usual east-facing entrance, it appeared open to all four cardinal points, based on the Sarvatobhadra plan, “auspicious on all sides.”

However, the few remains provided only a sketchy reconstruction of the temple and was not a wholly satisfactory explanation of the site. “We weren’t doing any excavations; only documentation, measurements, drawings, architectural reconstructions”. It was John Henry Rice, a collaborator in the Warangal project, who thought out of the box when he spotted what appeared to him to be elements of mosque architecture. It was fascinating how the team cut and pasted photographs and measured drawings of the disconnected remnants, a jigsaw puzzle that proved there had been an unfinished mosque.

“Interestingly, Ghulam Yazdani who was the Director of the Nizam’s Archaeological Department, excavated the site in 1933, expecting to find a temple, but gave up further inquiry when he found there was not enough information and material to go forward”. Wasn’t it strange that Yazdani didn't suspect a mosque might have existed there, given the strong Islamic influence in the area, particularly as it was so common for mosques to be built on sites of Hindu temples, just as Hindu temples were so often built on Buddhist and Jain ones? “Yes, but I guess Warangal is thought of so much as a Kakatiya site that we forget the strong Islamic influence that followed after the city was annexed by the Delhi Sultanate under Muhammad bin Tughluq.

“Yazdani was an amazing man, very energetic, an exemplary scholar. He is perhaps best known today for his monograph on Bidar, still regarded as one of the best. Yazdani called the Ramappa temple at Palampet ‘the brightest star in the galaxy of medieval Deccani temples’.” Wagoner included slides of this magnificent temple, which is in good condition and has been nominated for the World Heritage Site Programme.

The stunning bracket statues are in an unique style, Mannerist in their charmingly elongated figures, elegantly pared down compared to the more luscious figures in other temples: for example, the well-endowed Hoysala maidens.

The lecture included images of other monuments that few have heard of, leave alone visited, such as the superb the 14th century Khush Mahal, an audience hall built by the Delhi Sultans. Therefore it wasn’t surprising to hear a comment after the lecture: “See, it’s only foreigners who are teaching us about our own heritage. We Indians would be ignorant of our culture if not for their research …”. That is probably due to generous funds available to Western scholars, whose work often results in glossy books with colour illustrations, while paucity limits Indian publications to monochrome [though that is changing]. Wagoner qualifies: “Indian heritage research is not dominated by westerners or foreigners; there are plenty of intellectual contributions by Indian scholars, archaeologists etc.

Indian University people tend to publish more scholarly monographs, whereas the ASI and local or state departments of archaeology tend to bring out official reports on excavations etc., but they have also done tremendous investigative work. My project in Warangal in 1999-2000 was an ASI site and they were most helpful: giving us documents and records, indicating where things had been moved …”

Prof. Wagoner emphasised how important inputs are from fieldwork and from approaching problems from the perspectives of different disciplines. He summed up such collaborative efforts: “I've always thought of myself as a South Asian specialist, or a Deccan one, rather than a practitioner of any specific discipline such as art history, archaeology or whatever, so interdisciplinary activity is indispensable. My work has gone forward most noticeably when I have defined a question that demands a broad range of evidence – archival, archaeological, literary, epigraphic, numismatic – and integrates them all by addressing a single unifying problem” : and the audience certainly benefitted from the result of the Warangal teamwork.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/2jonyq/article30459074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgf12JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/another-gateway-to-the-deccan/article30459075.ece
242,2020/01/02,Artists interpret Butterfly Effect to show how the little things matter,"At the entrance to Shrishti art gallery, a note introduces visitors to American mathematician Edward Norton Lorenz’s concept of ‘Butterfly Effect’ to throw light on how a small event like the flapping of the wings of a butterfly in one part of the world has the potential to trigger a series of events across the globe.

Shrishti art gallery posed the idea of Butterfly Effect to a group of artists and invited their interpretations. The result is this exhibition where the artistic interpretations range from issues of urbanisation and displacement, to nature and society.

Malavika Reddy’s portrayal of flora isn’t picture perfect. In its textures and tones, the paintings evoke a feeling of slow destruction of nature as she focuses on environment bearing the brunt of global warming. The artist suggests that we listen to nature voicing its concern to us through different means, because we have the power to take steps that can make a difference.

Pratul Dash presents fairy tale kind of imagery, with vivid starry skies that we can see when we move away from polluted urban spaces. On a clear starry night with hues of deep blue, a boy stands on a green surface and looks up, sporting a mask. This fantasy-land like depiction draws attention to the conflict between nature and urban landscape.

One of Sujith Sen’s paintings is a partly abstract representation of the urban chaos in Mumbai. Using earthy watercolours and shadows, his visual narrative shows life in Mumbai — the many small houses and territorial boundaries.

Digbijayee Khatua’s frames in sunshine hues, narrate a continuum of stories of rapid urbanisation. The artist moved from Odisha to Delhi and observed minutely the changing landscape. He noticed how people adapted to live within the polluted environs of the city, finding solace in man-made possessions. He uses elements of folk and tribal art such as miniatures and Patta style to narrate his stories, using a mix of watercolour and tea wash on paper.

Nishant Dange, in a frame bathed in sunshine yellow and earthy browns, attempts to show the deep connect a young woman has with nature by juxtaposing the butterfly form on her. He correlates her emotional transition to the transformation of the butterfly.

Dinesh Pimple’s frames are full of shapes, forms and colours. Everyday objects, flowers and leaves, butterflies and insects, are painted on paperboard, cut and put together in different forms, with the idea of giving permanence and sturdiness to what’s considered fragile and perishable.

Prasanta Bandyopadhyay’s blue-toned watercolour depiction of people in an urban scenario seems like a panoramic view and still manages to be individualistic. Inhabitants go about their daily tasks like putting a child to sleep, studying or working late into the night, getting a haircut… With each one nestled in their own space, they work towards their dream, one of which is to build their own home. This universal dream puts pressure on land. The painting is also a representation of urban solitude, of being lonesome in a crowd.

Priti Vadakkath’s paintings in monochromes and fuss-free lines, are inspired by yesteryear studio portraiture to indulge in nostalgic childhood memories. There are occasional splash of colours in the form of gulmohar petals or marbles.

Ravi Chunchula’s ‘Towards an envisioned land’ is like a window of opportunities to show the interlinking of possibilities in an urban scenario where one act feeds off the other.

243,2020/01/02,Former Punjab Minister Bikram Majithia’s close aide gunned down in Amritsar,"A Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader, said to be a close aide of former Minister Bikram Singh Majithia, was killed in Amritsar’s Umarpura village after being shot at by unidentified assailants.

Terming the murder as “politically-motivated”, the SAD has demanded an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Police said the 50-year-old Gurdeep Singh was killed on January 1 after motorcycle-borne assailants shot at him when he was coming out of a local gurdwara after offering prayers. Gurdeep Singh’s wife is a village head (sarpanch) of the Umarpura village.

Station House Officer Tarsem Singh at Majithia told reporters that five persons have been booked in connection with the murder and police teams were conducting raids in search of the assailants, who fled the spot after the incident.

Hitting out at the ruling Congress, Mr. Majithia said the killing of Gurdeep Singh was a “political murder”. “The political assassination of Baba Gurdeep Singh was a direct result of threats being issued to him, warning of dangerous consequences if he did not stop speaking against the minister-gangster nexus. A message has been sent to me that my close political associates will be targeted if I do not stop speaking for justice for former Akali Sarpanch Dalbir Dhilwan, who was also murdered in the same way as Baba Gurdeep Singh,” Mr. Majithia alleged.

“There should be a CBI probe into the incident,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/former-punjab-minister-bikram-majithias-close-aide-gunned-down-in-amritsar/article30463901.ece
244,2020/01/02,"BJP talks of Emergency, but labels protesters anti-national: activist","The BJP boasts about its opposition to the Emergency imposed by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but while in power the party wants to crush dissent and label citizens protesting peacefully as “anti-national,” said Ekta Shekhar, an environment activist from Varanasi.

Ms. Shekhar was released on bail on Thursday after spending 14 days in jail for opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

On December 19, Ms. Shekhar had been detained along with her activist husband Ravi Shekhar and more than 60 others including Banaras Hindu University students and Gandhian and Ambedkarite activists, while marching to protest against the CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). The couple’s incarceration had led to much outrage as they had a 14-month-old breastfed toddler at home, waiting for their return.

‘Protesting a policy’

“They [BJP-RSS] say they ran a movement against the Emergency,” Ms. Shekhar told The Hindu. “Now, when it is their turn, we are being labelled ‘anti-national’ for merely protesting. It is not being mentioned that we are opposing a specific policy or law of a particular political party, but we are being projected as ‘anti-national’,” she added. On Wednesday, a local court in Varanasi had granted bail to the couple, an associate Saniya Anwar and more than 50 others.

Ms. Shekhar asserted that the BJP-led Central and Uttar Pradesh governments were ‘intolerant’ of any form of protest, be it a meeting or a dharna. “It wants to implement CAA and is firm on it. They want to suppress people’s voices,” she added.

Ms. Shekhar, who focusses on climate change in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency, contended that the State government was taking “disproportionate” action against protesters to deter others from joining them or speaking out.

“ If they don’t arrest people or give it such form, then other people won’t stay at home in fear. It is probably the first time in Varanasi, that people have been jailed for 14 days for violating Section 144 during a small demonstration,” she asserted.

As per the FIR lodged at Chetganj police station, on December 19, the protesters violated Section 144 and while they were near Saraigovardhan, allegedly shouted “anti-national slogans.” Police claimed they had tried to reason with the protesters and explained that their march ‘violated law’ and caused inconvenience to the public. “But they became more aggressive and broke out at the police force, shoving and punching, and started chasing those looking on,” the police claimed in the FIR.

The protesters, including Ms. Shekhar, are emphatic that the protest was peaceful and that they actually walked into the police bus without offering resistance after police insisted they would not be allowed to march towards their designated protest venue Beniabagh. The police charged them for rioting, unlawful assembly, disobedience and assault, among other charges but the FIR does not mention any violence.

Recalling the events of December 19, Ms. Shekhar said the protesters initially sat on the ground after police stopped them and subsequently courted arrest peacefully.

“We had no idea we would be arrested,” she said. “Generally, what happens is that for violation of Section 144, they would detain us for a few hours and let us off.”

During her detention, Ms. Shekhar said the police had accused the protesters of choosing a Muslim-populated locality for their march in order to “instigate riots”. “Because of you, there have been riots across the country. So you are main culprits, the police told us,” Ms. Shekhar said.

She also claimed that the police had initially booked them under CrPC 151 but later added serious clauses of the Indian Penal Code against them allegedly after “orders from above.” “The police told us they were under pressure to ensure we don’t get bail,” Ms. Shekhar claimed.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/1ugo6j/article30463756.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3TH-BABY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bjp-talks-of-emergency-but-labels-protesters-anti-national-activist/article30463757.ece

246,2020/01/02,Giant fishing lure from metal waste: ITI students in Odisha’s Berhampur aim for Guinness record,"A giant 6.9 metre-long fishing lure (bait) built from metal waste by students of the Odisha government-managed Berhampur Industrial Training Institute (ITI) is all set to find mention in the Guinness Book of World Records.

Rajat Kumar Panigrahy, Principal of this ITI, on Wednesday applied to the Guinness records authorities for verification and recognition of the record-breaking feat. The current world record for largest fishing lure is in the name of Ethan Sparks of Texas, U.S.A, with the dimensions of 4.74 metres length, 67.97 cm width and a hook measuring 48.77 cm at its bottom.

The fishing lure sculpture created by the young students of the Berhampur ITI is 6.9 metres in length, 91 cm in width, and having a 101.6 cm hook at its bottom. “Metal waste from a demolished hostel building of the institute was used as raw material by students of the welder, painter and fitter trades. They designed it manually without help of computer aided designing,” Mr. Panigrahy said.

More than 100 students took 40 days to construct this huge metal fishing lure from waste in 40 days. It was completed on December 31, 2019 and is part of the “art from waste” museums of the ITI here, which are being developed to make the campus a tourist spot. The outdoor museum on the campus already includes a giant 70-ft.-high guitar that has entered the Asia Book of Records, and a 32-ft.-high giraffe mentioned in the Limca Book of Records.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/k0285n/article30462391.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/P20200102120017,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/giant-fishing-lure-from-metal-waste-iti-students-in-odishas-berhampur-aim-for-guinness-record/article30462392.ece
247,2020/01/02,Gujarat govt. to bring resolution in Assembly in support of CAA,"The BJP government in Gujarat will bring a resolution in the upcoming one-day Assembly session of the State legislature on January 10 to extend its support to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a State Minister said on Thursday.

A one-day session of the Gujarat Assembly has been convened on January 10 to approve a Constitutional amendment recently passed by both the Houses of Parliament to give a 10-year extension to reservations for Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies.

“To extend our support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government’s decision about the CAA, a resolution supporting the new law will be brought during the Assembly session,” Pradipsinh Jadeja, Gujarat’s Minister of State for Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs, said in Gandhinagar on Thursday.

“This law is a historic step towards granting citizenship rights to the minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh,” he added.

The one-day session of the Assembly has been called by the Gujarat government to approve the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Sixth Amendment) Bill, 2019, which was passed by the Parliament a month back, Mr. Jadeja said.

“It is mandatory that at least 50% of the State Assemblies in the country approve this Constitutional amendment. Only then it will be sent for President’s assent. We have, therefore, called this session on January 10 to approve it,” the Minister said.

Since it is the first Assembly session of the new year, Governor Acharya Devvrat would inaugurate the session with his address, followed by a resolution to thank him for the speech, Mr. Jadeja said.

The health economists will analyse the gaps in the infrastructure of the JK Lon hospital to ascertain how much funds will be required for strengthening it.

“The high-level team being despatched by @MoHFW_INDIA incl experts from AIIMS Jodhpur, Health Finance & Regional Director, Health Services Jaipur. It will reach #Kota tomorrow. In my letter too to @ashokgehlot51 ji, I’ve offered all possible assistance to prevent any further deaths (sic),” Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet on Thursday.

Mr. Vardhan has also written to Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, assuring him of all assistance, and urged him to initiate measures to stop the deaths of children at the JK Lon hospital.

“We are ready to provide any technical help or assistance. Let us ensure no child succumbs to preventable causes or due to lack of health system capacity,” Mr. Vardhan has written in his letter to Gehlot.

According to Union health ministry officials, a preliminary probe has suggested that over 70% of important equipment, including infusion pumps, warmers, oxymeters, nebulisers, meant for newborns, were not in a working condition at the JK Lon hospital and there was a paucity of staff in the paediatrics department.

A recent review had also revealed that the mortality rate at the hospital was 20.2% in 2019, as against the 14.3 per cent in the preceding two years, an official said, adding that this meant one in five infants admitted to the hospital last year died from preventable causes.

The ministry was yet to receive a formal report from the state in this matter, the official said.

Besides, a committee constituted by the Rajasthan government has stated that the deaths were taking place due to a lack of oxygen pipelines in the hospital and also because of extreme cold conditions.

It also pointed towards an increased referral of critical cases and stated that the number of beds in the hospital was less than the flow of patients. The situation at the ICUs was also similar, the committee said.

“I informed @ashokgehlot51 ji that Rs ₹91.7 lakhs has already been advanced to JK Loan Hospital during 2019-20 under National Health Mission. Kota District alone has an annual allocation of ₹27.45 Cr for ‘19-20, from the annual budgeted amount of ₹1788.97 Cr for Rajasthan state (sic),” Mr. Vardhan said in another tweet.

249,2020/01/02,"Considering modalities to restore Internet, says Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Murmu","Jammu and Kashmir Lieutenant Governor Girish Chandra Murmu on Thursday said his administration was “actively considering the modalities to restore” Internet service, which has been barred in Kashmir for the last five months.

“Restoration of Internet service will be done in a phased manner,” Mr. Murmu told a joint delegation of about two dozen trade groups from across Kashmir. “Steps like restoration of Internet in hospitals and SMS service have already been taken. The government is aware of the difficulties faced by the trade community as well as the general public due to the Internet ban and is actively considering the modalities to restore the Internet service,” he added.

The delegation also handed over a report of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industries (KCCI), which pegs the loss since August 5 at ₹17,878 crore.

KCCI president Sheikh Ashiq sought immediate restoration of socio-economic order. “We demanded the immediate release of traders, lawyers and civil society members,” said Mr. Ashiq. “This will only act as an enabling force to restore economic equilibrium. Besides, lack of Internet has dented the economy as well as the future of students in Kashmir,” he added.

The members of the delegation highlighted how the lack of Internet connectivity had impacted the timely filing of GST returns, updation of records, licenses and permits, etc.

The Lt. Governor had assured the delegation that he would study the KCCI report, according to the official spokesman. “The government has already assessed the losses suffered by the farmers due to heavy snowfall and untimely rains and will soon initiate the necessary measures in this regard,” said Mr. Murmu.

251,2020/01/02,"Kolkata-Howrah ferry service, a war boon, is booming today","India and Pakistan have never been friends, but the war they fought in 1965 actually ended up benefiting the hundreds of thousands of people who commute daily between Kolkata and Howrah, the two neighbouring settlements separated by the River Hooghly.

Load off bridge

Until 1965, West Bengal and Assam were connected by waterways, and vessels run by the River Steam Navigation Company went up and down the network of rivers via what was then East Pakistan. Once the war broke out in September that year, the boats that happened to be in Pakistani territory — 15 of them — were seized. Of the remaining boats, 23 were stranded in Assam and 24 in Calcutta. The company decided put the boats moored in Calcutta to good use, and in November began a ferry service to Howrah, taking considerable load off the iconic Howrah Bridge.

Subsequently, the State government took over the business and today the ferry service has only grown. Close to 2 lakh people cross the river on diesel-run boats on a weekday and about one lakh on a non-working day. The service is run by the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC) and a cooperative called the Hooghly Nadi Jalapath Paribahan Samanbay Samiti Limited; each entity runs its own vessels.

“There are about 45 boats in all [running between Kolkata and Howrah]. We own 28 of them, and the remaining belong to the cooperative,” an official of the WBTC told The Hindu.

Expanding

“We are already connected to many suburban areas such as Dakshineshwar and expanding to connect more suburban locations. New jetties are being constructed, existing jetties being redone,” the official said.

The ferry service is particularly beneficial to Kolkata because its primary railway station — the red-brick Howrah Station — sits across the river and serves as the terminus for suburban trains used by hundreds of thousands of people to get to their workplaces in Kolkata and to return home.

A boat ride across the river is not only quicker, scenic and pollution-free but also cheap: just ₹6 for a one-way ticket. The service begins at six in the morning and ends at 10 in the night. There are seven ghats — spread across the Kolkata riverfront — from where rides are available to the Howrah Station and prominent locations across the river.

“Our fleet includes four double-decker boats, which people also hire for parties with live music; we will get two more such boats this year,” the official said. “The ferry service makes profits. With the roads getting increasingly clogged, more and more people are taking the boat these days.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nyf38u/article30459998.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG2044,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/kolkata-howrah-ferry-service-a-war-boon-is-booming-today/article30459999.ece
252,2020/01/02,Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot asks Harsh Vardhan to visit Kota hospital,"Amid the politics over the continuing deaths of infants at the government-run J.K. Lon Children’s Hospital in Kota, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday asked Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan to visit it and to get himself apprised of the facts.

The Congress government has come under attack following the deaths, which touched the figure of 100 in December 2019, while three children died on the first two days of the New Year. Bahujan Samaj Party president Mayawati and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath have questioned the silence of senior Congress leaders over the deaths.

Mr. Gehlot said his government was sensitive to the situation in Kota and claimed that some “mischievous elements” were highlighting the issue to divert attention from other important subjects. He asked the Opposition parties not to indulge in politics, while pointing out that infant mortality in the hospital was steadily declining.

“We will try to reduce it further. It is our top priority to keep mothers and children healthy... An expert team of the Centre is welcome to visit and help improve health services. We are ready to consult them and work with their cooperation,” Mr. Gehlot tweeted.

Mr. Gehlot said: “Harsh Vardhan Ji is himself a doctor and if he visits the hospital in Kota, it will also clarify the situation for people, who are giving [their] reactions mischievously, knowingly, unknowingly and also innocently.”

The Centre has decided to send a high-level team comprising experts from AIIMS, Jodhpur, and health economists to the hospital to assess the infrastructural gaps and decide on the measures to be taken to prevent further deaths. The team will carry out an analysis of clinical protocols, service delivery and availability of manpower and equipment at the hospital.

According to the figures released by the hospital administration, the infant mortality has shown a declining trend, with the deaths of the children among those admitted with various diseases reported at 7.62% in 2014, 7.17% in 2015, 6.66% in 2016, 5.96% in 2017, 6.11% in 2018 and 5.61% in 2019.

In absolute numbers, 963 infants died in 2019, against 1,005 in 2018. Against the death of 100 children in December 2019 and 101 in November 2019, 77 infants lost their lives in December 2018 and 76 in November 2018.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/108ntk/article30371961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH22ASHOKGEHLOT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dont-politicise-deaths-of-infants-says-ashok-gehlot/article30459844.ece

254,2020/01/02,Videos show anti-CAA protesters being roughed up in Assam,"Videos posted on social media have shown security personnel roughing up anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protesters who waved black flags at the convoy of Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal in western Assam’s Nalbari district on Wednesday.

Members of the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad had waved black flags and shouted slogans at Mr. Sonowal on his way to the ashram of Vaishnative cult leader Krishnaguru.

A video showed the security personnel chasing away protesters from the highway, another showed a protester being caught and taken away in a police van while a second, identified as Chandan Bezbaruah, was caned.

The police downplayed the incident, saying the security personnel used mild force on a protester who resisted detention. “An agitator who was detained was caned once or twice for pushing after he was detained. The security personnel did not resort to any baton-charge,” Nalbari’s Superintendent of Police Amanjeet Kaur said.

Police officials said Section 144 restricting large gatherings was in place and the protesters had not taken prior permission from the police.

AASU leader Himan Barman on Thursday claimed the member who was caned was undergoing treatment at a hospital in Nalbari.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile, said AASU activists had damaged the property of party workers after an anti-CAA rally in central Assam’s Morigaon district a couple of days ago.

One of the complainants told the police that on December 29, he got a call from a person, who claimed to be from the Paytm team and asked him to update his KYC, police spokesperson Sukhada Narkar said.

256,2020/01/02,Giriraj Singh stokes controversy again; says ‘most of missionary school students eat beef abroad’,"Union Minister and BJP MP from Begusarai in Bihar Giriraj Singh on Thursday stoked fresh controversy with his statement that “most of the missionary school students qualify IIT, become engineers but eat beef in foreign countries”.

The Opposition parties have slammed Mr. Singh for his “uncalled for statement”.

While addressing a gathering in Begusarai on Thursday Mr. Singh said “the students who go to missionary schools, though qualify IIT and become engineers but, when they go abroad most of them start eating beef because they do not know about our ‘sanskar’ and ‘sanskriti’ (traditional values and culture)”.

“I would say a ‘sloka’ (hymn) of Bhagavad Gita must be taught in every school”, added the Union Minister of Animal Husbandry, Dairy and Fisheries.

Mr. Singh has always been hitting headlines with his controversial statements.

On New Year he tweeted in Hindi, “our new year begins with ‘pratipada’ (the first date of a month as per Hindu calendar). We derive our identity from ‘sanatana’, from Lord Shri Ram. ‘Bharatvarshis’ — what relationship do we share with each other? It is Jai Shri Ram, Jai Shri Ram. Best wishes for the administrative new year”.

In September last year, Mr. Singh, in a bid to boost India’s milk production, had said that “Centre using technology superior to IVF will inject cows to produce milk and solve issues related to cows unable to give milk using embryo-transplant, and this would accelerate India’s way to the global milk market”.

However, Mr. Singh latest statement stirred controversy as Opposition party leaders in Bihar slammed him for such “uncalled for statements”.

“Mr Singh is known for giving such controversial statements to remain in news…I urge media people not to give him space for such uncalled for statements and he will stop opening his mouth,” RJD leader and party MLA Bhai Virendra said.

Similarly, senior State Congress leader party Rajya Sabha MP Akhilesh Singh said, “I wonder how such a senior leader like Giriraj Singh says such things?...it is a ridiculous statement”. The RLSP spokesman Anand Madhav too condemned Mr. Singh for such “unnecessary statement”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/33kptj/article29802220.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/26THGIRIRAJSINGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/giriraj-singh-stokes-controversy-again-says-most-of-missionary-school-students-eat-beef-abroad/article30458814.ece
257,2020/01/02,Haryana sisters denied passport over ‘Nepali appearance’; State Home Minister steps in,"Amid a controversy over denial of passports to two sisters Santosh and Heena in Haryana’s Ambala by the regional passport authority here on the grounds of “their appearance,” the duo has been granted the documents and a probe will be initiated to find out who mentioned the noting on the file about the “Nepali appearance” of the applicants, a senior official told The Hindu on Thursday.

Sibash Kabiraj, regional passport chief in Chandigarh, said that passports had been granted to both the girls and the documents will be issued after pre-verification from the police. “I completely disapprove of the language of the comment on the official document, which mentions ‘applicant seems to be Nepali’. An inquiry into the matter will be initiated to find out who wrote the noting and suitable action will be taken,” said Mr. Kabiraj.

Mr. Kabiraj said passports were issued to Indian citizens after confirming their citizenship. “There are some cases where Nepali citizens apply for passport. As per the Supreme Court guidelines, they are not issued passports but issued another travel document, called identity certificate. Such a document is also issued to Tibetans staying in India. In such cases, we seek clarification from local police about whether the applicant is an Indian citizen or not. In this case, the official, instead of writing a comment on ‘their appearance’, should have adopted the due procedure and sought verification about citizenship from the concerned Deputy Commissioner,” said Mr. Kabiraj.

Application processed after State Home Minister intervenes

Mr. Kabiraj added that the applicants’ claim that they were asked to prove their nationality even after submitting the required documents will also be investigated.

The two sisters — Santosh and Heena in Haryana’s Ambala — were earlier denied passport by the regional passport authority, apparently on the grounds of “their appearance.”

However, after the intervention Haryana Home Minister Anil Vij, the processing of the application was started.

Ambala’s Deputy Commissioner Ashok Sharma, meanwhile, said that a few days ago Santosh and Henna, along with their father Bhagat Bahadur, had gone to the passport office in Chandigarh, where they had applied for respective passports. They were, however, denied passports after mentioning on their documents “applicant seems to be Nepali.”

Mr. Sharma said the passport office had summoned both the sisters and now their passports will reach them soon after he took up the issue with the passport authority in Chandigarh.

Santosh, one of the applicants, said that the passport office asked them to prove their nationality even when they presented all the necessary documents. “We were asked to prove our nationality. We then approached Home Minister Anil Vij and it was after his intervention that the processing of our passport application could start,” she said.

Long-time residents

Mr. Bahadur has claimed that the family had been living in India for over 50 years. He told reporters that he was born and brought up in Ambala and his father had come to Ambala from Nepal before his birth.

Mr. Bhagat stated he has four daughters — Meera, Santosh, Heena and Komal. Santosh is a fashion designer and Heena has done B. Pharm. They both want to go abroad and hence applied for passports in June. Meera already possesses an Indian passport, said Mr. Bahadur.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/5z64nc/article30458716.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIANPASSPORT1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-sisters-to-get-passports-after-application-was-rejected-over-their-appearance/article30458717.ece

264,2020/01/02,Green activists promote indoor plants,"A movement to increase the number of indoor plants in every household of the city was started on Wednesday by the Berhampur Sabuja Bahini, an organisation of youth activists.

Their slogan is ‘let us get back mother nature to our homes as family member’. It is the follow up of the successful ‘save trees from metal intrusions’ movement by the BSB, said its president Sibaram Panigrahy.

BSB activists have already saved around 2,000 trees in Berhampur from getting seriously injured by metal intrusions like nails and wires that causes their untimely death.

Berhampur Municipal Corporation had also appreciated their effort and imposed fine on persons and institutions hurting trees. This effort is being replicated in other urban areas.

“With rising pollution, indoor plants can help improve the environment within our homes. Growing small plants within home increases our love towards the environment outside,” said Sankar Narayan Beja, Ganjam district eco-club coordinator.

With various indoor plants that can be easily grown within a house, the BSB activists took out an over 15-km-long cycle rally. Several organisations, including the Marwari Mahila Samity, Anchalika Vikash Parishad and Mahatma Gandhi Helping Hand, extended support and solidarity to the movement.

Mr. Singh said insurgency-related violence has decreased in the State during the last three years and he has apprised the Union Home Ministry of the improved situation. “The law and order has definitely improved. However, we need to wait for a better situation so that the AFSPA can be repealed,” Mr. Singh said.

Official sources said a total of 233 insurgency-linked incidents were reported in 2016, which came down to 167 in 2017 and 127 in 2018.

Time to review

In November 2018, Mr. Singh had said that the time had come to review the AFSPA, but since the State shares border with foreign countries, the security aspect has to be considered.

The Act allows Army personnel to use force, “even to the causing of death”, in order to maintain public order, and also grants them executive powers to enter and search any premises and arrest without any warrant. It was imposed in Manipur in 1980 when the State was a hotbed of insurgency. It was withdrawn from seven Assembly segments in Imphal following intense agitation.

It was unusual, for people have only seen them dance in unison for the past 25 years, mirroring and complementing moods and movements like no other performing duo. Surupa as artistic director and Bijayini as the principal dancer created incredible choreographic works in Odissi. They worked hard to nurture Protima Bedi’s vision Nrityagram, making it one of the most recognised dance institutions in the world. But a year ago, Bijayini decided to step out of this creative zone and embark on a solo journey.

Moving away from the foyer of the auditorium that was teeming with dancers and dance lovers at the Kalavaahini Festival, where she performed to a packed house, she spoke about stepping back from a long collaboration and rediscovering herself.

“The decision wasn’t easy. I had to push myself hard to make it since I was yearning to find the dancer in me on my terms. I wanted to explore the untouched dimensions of my artistry. It was not external validation I was seeking; I needed internal validation.

“I view my decision as both a spiritual and artistic pilgrimage and one has to do the parikrama alone. Nrityagram is home. Its doors will never close for me, I can go back anytime,” she says, her large, expressive eyes conveying the emotion impeccably.

Bijayini had been mulling the move for over 10 years. Every time the thought crossed her mind, the responsibility of the institution that shaped her into the magnificent dancer that she is today would deter her from going ahead. “I owe so much to Gaurima (Protima Bedi) and wondered if I would ever be able to isolate myself from Nrityagram. At the same time, I realised that if I didn’t do it now, it would be too late. I will be 50 in a few years. Dancers’ life on stage is determined by their body, their singular vehicle of communication. At some point, they have to come to terms with ageing and aches. I panicked that someday when my body gives in, I shouldn’t be traumatised by unfulfilled creative desires. So I have set out with passion, hope and dreams for company,” says Bijayini.

After a six-month tour of the U.S., where her performances came in for rave reviews, accompanied by extensive interviews, she is back in India to participate in Chennai’s Margazhi festival. She will be performing solo for the first time at the Music Academy Dance Festival (January 8, 2020), which has often featured the Nrityagram ensemble.

“I am gradually coming to terms with my solo being, practising on the rooftop studio at my house near Nrityagram that I share with my husband.”

Bijayini is also learning to handle every little detail, from availability of the musicians to checking if tickets have arrived and arranging meals to looking into accommodation.

“At the institution I was cocooned in every way. Somebody was taking care of all these tedious jobs while Surupa designed productions into which I had to fit myself in. I am even writing to organisers of festivals to be invited to perform. It is a lot of work, yes, but I am happy I have the energy to deal with it,” says Bijayini, who will be conducting workshops in Odissi in Chennai after spending the New Year with her family in Bhubaneshwar.

As Nrityagram’s director of training and outreach, Bijayini developed an integrated physical conditioning for practitioners of Indian classical dance, particularly Odissi. It blends her knowledge of yoga, kalaripayattu, Western fitness techniques and kinesiology. “I continue to research and work on this aspect since it is important for dancers to prepare and preserve their body. At my workshops and training sessions I insist on looking at dance beyond movement and mime. The strengthening routine should be made part of the training vocabulary,” she points out.

As a soloist, Bijayini feels her perspective of the artform has also changed. She has begun to draw differently from all that she has imbibed as a dancer and teacher. She is relooking at tradition for newer interpretations, exploring ancients texts, revisiting the timeless works of the legendary Guru Kelucharan Mahapatra.

“Of course, Surupa’s pieces will also be part of my repertoire. I have grown artistically with them. All her choreographic works were first mounted on my body. We have shared every moment of the creative process. So the connect and resonance will remain always,” says Bijayini.

After her early training at the Orissa Dance Academy in Bhubaneshwar, when she decided to join Nrityagram in 1993 after being selected in an audition by Protima Bedi, her parents refused to let her go.

“They wondered why should I leave Bhubaneshwar to train in Odissi at a residential school near Bangalore. But I persisted because I was looking at the holistic training and perfect ambience that Nrityagram offered. It was as difficult a move as the one I have made now. Sometimes, in life, one needs to stand and stare, of course at the sky, stars and trees, but also within to bring out one’s best,” she says.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/81jdtx/article30460096.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03frodissi1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/bijayani-satpathy-on-why-she-wants-to-dance-solo/article30460099.ece
269,2020/01/02,Exploring navarasas in Gita Govindam,"“I have always loved the Gita Govindam — the ostensibly Shringara laden work by 12th century poet Jayadeva. But it is not just that — all the Navarasas come into play making it bhakti-oriented, marking the union of atma and jivatma. And that is why I chose to do ‘Padmavati — an Avatar’, where the rich, intense poetry of Jayadeva combines with the magnificence of the deity of Puri, Jagannatha, to convey the story of passion, devotion and purity of intent,” said dancer-choreographer-researcher Bala Devi Chandrashekar.

And this is what stood out in her solo thematic production, presented at the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Kilpauk. Artistic director of Shree Padma Nrityam Academy of Performing Arts, New Jersey, Bala Devi has developed her own dance style and has has been working on multiple projects to showcase the beauty of Bharatanatyam and the way it connects to other art forms in New Jersey. Trained under Jayalakshmi Narayanan (Hyderabad) and Padma Subrahmanyam, she has been given the titles of ‘Nritya Seva Mani’ and ‘Nrityasali’ on the completion of a course on the 108 Karanas by Dr. Padma. She is also a recipient of the Kalaimamani among other awards .

It is interesting to know that somebody would choose a work such as Padmavati for a solo performance, especially when there are several layers of interpretation, rasas and thought processes. Padmavati is a transitional narration of the ultimate bhakti — of moving from the Form to the Formless, from the Jivatma to the Paramatma. And here it is the central character, a devadasi from the Puri temple, also the focus of Jayadeva’s forays into lyricism and poetry.

In ‘Padmavati’, Jayadeva depicts the Krishna-Radha relationship through Saalokhyam - being in His world, Saaroopyam - taking His form, Saameepyam - approaching Him and finally, Saayujyam - becoming one with Him!

The production was done at a rather racy pace with quicksilver expressions and a dancing style that veered between Bharatanrityam and shades of Kuchipudi. An adept dancer, Bala kept the proceedings going with a clear vision about building it up to heightened bhakti and changing roles adroitly. Her footwork showed the influence of Guru Padma, but she also brought in her distinct style.

Beginning with Padmavati and Jayadeva’s marriage (Harikhambodi), the piece had plenty of sollukattus and swaras that made it vibrant. An added cameo was about a flower girl’s bhakti and how Lord Krishna presents her with a ring. When she is called out as a thief, Krishna appears in the King’s dream and tells him about the ring.

Saalokhyam showed the gopis and the rasakreeda. One of the Upanishad vakyas brought out as a rhythm piece in Bageshri (Adi tala) was beautifully rendered. A strong point of the presentation was the rousing music composed by Rajkumar Bharathi. It helped the dancer convey the spirit of the theme. Saaroopyam showcased Radha’s separation from Krishna. The usage of Bilaskhani Thodi was poetic. In Sameepyam, using a verse from the Bhagavatam in Kanada, showed how the Divine ensures a devotee’s bhakti, whether away or near Him. Saayujyam is where the soul merges with the Supreme and Lord is bound by the love of Yashoda, gopis and Radha. Brindavana Saranga was aptly chosen to depict the essence of this segment. Padmavati ended with the festivities and fervour during the world famous Puri rath yatra.

Concept/choreography was by Bala Devi while the entire work was compiled by Kovai Jaanakirama Bhagavathar and N. Neela Bala Sharma. The lyrics were by Dr. S. Umaapathi Shiromani and music by Rajkumar Bharathi were recorded, mixed and mastered by Sai Shravanam.

Special mention must be made of the jathis and mridangam playing of Guru Bharadwaj. On the vocals were Srikanth Gopalakrishnan, Keerthana Vaidyanathan and Deepika Varadarajan. Able accompaniment was also provided by Ganapathi on the tabla and pakhwaj; Bhavani Prasad on the veena, Embar Kannan on the violin, vishnu on the flute, Ballesh on the shehnai (very rarely used in the orchestra for Bharatanatyam), Kishore Kumar on the sitar and chorus by Manoj Krishna and troupe. Voice over was provided by Meera Maran.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/kstkkq/article30459787.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRBALADEVICHANDRASHEKAR1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/exploring-navarasas-in-gita-govindam/article30459788.ece
270,2020/01/02,Meenakshi Srinivasan’s strikes a fine balance,"We grade Indian classical dancers, especially Bharatanatyam dancers, on their dancing skills, maturity and artistic visualisation as well, unlike in the West, where choreography and dancing are considered separate domains. Meenakshi Srinivasan has the style, charm and energy and, most importantly, the craft to present her best. The final result then depends on the balance of ingredients.

The invocation ‘Bhogindra Shaayinam’ (Kuntalavarali, Jhampa, Swati Tirunal) was an inspired visualisation. The dancer commenced with a short musical interlude (Kuntalavarali, khandam) that was followed by benedictory verses from Kulasekhara Alwar’s Mukunda Mala Stotram, after which the song began. Keeping the catchy pallavi as a refrain, the sahitya was rendered in different speeds, while sollu and swara passages alternated. It was a 10-minute treat aurally and visually as music arrangement (K.Hariprasad) and rhythm (V.Vedakrishnan) complimented the dancer’s light-footed grace and maturity in incorporating the nritta without disturbing the sthayi. It brought alive lively visions of the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram. Meenakshi was ably supported by Jayashree Ramanathan (nattuvangam) and Ishwar Ramakrishnan (violin).

The excellent music continued into the rare Thanjavur Quartet padavarnam, ‘Sarasa ninnu’ (Karnataka Kapi, Rupaka), a sringara-bhakti composition. Meenakshi’s approach is non-ostentatious, therefore her jathis were chic, straightforward and crisp. Notably fast and exploring the three levels of standing, half-seated and fully seated steps were the charana jathi and the last charana swara. Her nritta style marries grace and geometry — sharp Natyambharam with arms stretched out and graceful rounded adavus gives her a distinctive lasya style.

As the nayika yearning for Brihadeeswara, she brought in the intensity early on in the varnam. She gave it an immediacy, and made it into a personal conversation with the nayaka. She has a newly developed arsenal and that is her ability to tear up when deeply moved. The devotional mood and the pleading was portrayed in an unbroken thread demonstrating her capacity to hold a thought for so long. But there is a fallout of this intimate conversational mode, it makes the content heavy.

The light-hearted Kshetragna padam ‘Kodi Koose’ (Saurashtram, visualisation by Priyadarsini Govind) and the intense Jayadeva Ashtapadi ‘Priye Charusheele’ (Sumanesa Ranjani, khanda chapu, tuned by Hariprasad) were portrayed with good timing, subtlety and enviable concentration. She concluded with a happy Desh thillana (Adi, Rajkumar Bharati) that included a verse based on Vande Mataram.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/3auyfd/article30459725.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRMEENAKSHISRINIVASANBHARATHANATYAM3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/meenakshi-srinivasans-strikes-a-fine-balance/article30459726.ece
271,2020/01/02,The inimitable Kalakshetra experience,"Watching the production ‘Kumara Sambhavam’ at Kalakshetra’s annual festival in its newly restored theatre, Bharatha Kalakshetra, was like opening the family treasure box and looking at an old piece of jewellery. The design may be outdated and the colour may have faded but the value is immeasurable. The theatre itself is like an oasis, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, with all its greenery. Koothambalam, as it is also referred to, has its aestheticallydesigned entrances guarded by Dwarapalakas and the steps are flanked by the Diggajas and Yali motifs. There are no pillars to obstruct the view of the audience and the low stage affords a full view of the happenings on the stage. “Bharatha Kalakshetra theatre has the features of a traditional theatre but with the sophistication of the modern to give visitors a visual and aural treat,” says Revathi Ramachandran, the director of Kalakshetra.

The four productions showcased at Kalakshetra this December, apart from the two from the Ramayana series, seemed like the very journey of Kalakshetra. ‘Kumara Sambhavam,’ a 1947 production of its founder Rukmini Devi Arundale, had the markings of its times. It was produced and premiered in the year of Indian Independence and staged in New Delhi at the inauguration of the Republic of India in 1950.

‘Kumara Sambhavam’ is the dance narrative of Kalidasa’s epic poem on the coming together of an ascetic Siva and a lovelorn Parvathi to cause the birth of Kumara to get rid of Tarakasura, who had obtained a boon that he could only be killed by the son of Siva. So Manmatha shoots an arrow at Siva, the ascetic in deep meditation to be awakened and desire provoked in him to unite with Parvathi. The production has a vintage feel to it.

Rukmini Devi’s choreography shines with elegance and great dignity be it ‘Kumara Sambhavam,’ ‘Koormavatharam’ or ‘Kannappar Kuravanji’ but each is moulded in a different tempo. ‘Kumara Sambhavam’ moves slowly, giving the audience time to savour the musical qualities composed by Tiger Varadachari. ‘Koormavatharam,’ produced in 1974, a good 27 years after ‘Kumarasambhavam,’ has colour, glamour and plenty of humour.

It is the story of Gods, who want to get the amrita or nectar which is in a pot at the bottom of the ocean, with the help of demons. Vishnu comes in the form of a Koorma or the turtle to steady the mountain Mandara, used as a pestle, has eye-catching costuming, particularly, the hairdos, the likes of which were not seen before, the neat drape and the colours all making this production stand out as one of Rukmini Devi’s finest apart from her Ramayana series.

Brilliantly original and perhaps the most erotic that Rukmini Devi could come close to, in just about four decades, this production must be savoured for its context and the time that it was produced, the beauty it offers in concept, presentation and execution.

‘Kannappar Kuravanji’ takes a completely different route. It has a mountain-forest feel with the costume in various shades of brown and green and has dialogue in rustic dialect.

Choreographed in 1962, Kuratti or Devaratti is dignified and respected as opposed to the image of an unclean, unsophisticated person generally projected. The choreography is particularly brilliant in the entry of Tinnappar, who later becomes Kannappar and in the hunting scene.

Kuravanjis of Kalakshetra was a topic chosen for presentation by Nandini Nagaraj, Nirmala Nagarajan and Jyolsna Menon during Kalasamprekshanam, held recently, where the stalwart Janardhanan, who supervised the productions, shared nuggets of information.

From ‘Panchali Sabatham’ | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

‘Panchali Sabatham’ is a post-Rukmini Devi production of Kalakshetra. Choreographed by Janardhanan and Krishnaveni Lakshmanan to music composed by D. Pasupathi, it reflects the uncertain times prevailing in Kalakshetra after the passing of Rukmini Devi.

The production remains literal. The music is sedate, though musically rich, does not have the variety needed for a full-fledged dance-drama. The group choreographies are outside the story line and repetitive. But some superb acting saves the production. Apart from Haripadman who is a star performer of Kalakshetra with his characteristic vibrancy in every role given to him, it was Girish Madhu, who surprised with his sthayi of the innate cruelty of Duryodhana in very subtle nuanced acting. Jayakrishnan brought in plenty of humour as Mahabali. Indu Nideesh as a coy Parvathi in ‘Kumara Sambhavam’ and as a fiery Draupadi in ‘Panchali Sabatham’ was notable. K.P. Rakesh was calm and precise in his dancing. Sreenath as an angry Arjuna and Rajkamal was vibrant, although he had very little to do as Karna.

The experience was enhanced by the orchestra — Saishankar (vocals), Hariprasad (mridangam), Anilkumar (maddalam), Kiran Pai (veena), Anantha Narayanan and Shashidhar (flute) and Siva Kumar (violin). Glitches were of course there. The translations of the poems projected on the screens on either side of the stage were almost comic in the beginning with complex words, disjointed sentences and some spelling mistakes. These were taken care of in ‘Panchali Sabatham.’ Transliteration may not be needed, but simple explanations are called for.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/6lhhce/article30459620.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRKUMARASAMBHAVAM,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-inimitable-kalakshetra-experience/article30459623.ece
272,2020/01/02,Dancer Karuna Sagari talks about her latest production Chittam Azhagiyar,"“Chittam Azhagiyar is a term from the Tiruvasagam that means beauty of the spirit.” Coimbatore-based Bharatanatyam dancer V Karuna Sagari is explaining the theme of her forthcoming performance on January 3. The tagline is “beauty lies elsewhere” and Karuna adds, “In dance, we lay a lot of emphasis on appearance. Literature has reams of lines extolling women’s beauty and most of it is physical. So the minute I decided on this theme, I had to look beyond physical beauty.”

Since she firmly believes that Subramaniya Bharati’s ‘Pudumai Penn’ is not just an idealistic picture, Karuna began to look for women who have broken the mould over the centuries. Her final selections range from Andal to an unnamed fisherwoman.

While she has used the Nachiyar Thirumozhi earlier, Karuna says that this time she will focus on Andal, the poet. “I have selected four poems that bring out her ability to portray women — of different age groups, mental states and more.”

For motherhood, she chose Bharathi’s ‘Chinanchiru Kiliye’, “an over-performed piece, I know,” she says wryly “but I’d like to present a different take on motherhood.” She wants to talk about the moments of pain and how a mother “creates the right mix of sunshine, water and space for the sapling to grow and waits patiently for the little one to stand firm and take root. Another aspect I want to touch upon is ageing and the art of letting go.”

She is very thrilled to have found an anonymous poem from Sangam literature. “In Sangam writing, there is an equality among the landscapes. They don’t say that organised or urban terrains are better or superior. People of cities have more wealth and, since their lives are more settled, they have time for quarrels, affairs and a lot more,” she laughs, adding, “Just like today. But take neydhal. It’s such a busy landscape. The men go to sea and the women have to clean, process, sell and market the fish. Again just like today.”

Women have been breaking the mould over many centuries, says Karuna Sagari | Photo Credit: Michael Pravin

The poem she has chosen is set in a meeting of the two. “A wealthy merchant from the city is attracted to a fisherwoman. So he asks her friend for an introduction. The girl laughs and asks him, ‘Do you know who she is? She is the daughter of fishermen who go deep into the sea to catch sharks; her father is the headman of a valorous tribe? Do you know what we do? We take the fish, cut them up, lay them out to dry, make sure they are not stolen by birds and animals. Can’t you see the disparity? You’re not of the same world. Tell me how how your wealth and lifestyle will do her any good. You may have wealth but we have the sea. We have very good men in our tribe. You can’t give her what she wants’.” As she talks, Karuna’s hands trace movements in the air and her face reflects the pride and confidence of the fisherwoman’s words.

When justice was reformative Karuna had also wanted to feature the heroine of Sittalai Sattanar’s epic poem Manimekalai, a dancer who becomes a Buddhist nun, but had to drop this segment due to time constraints. “I will use it sometime later.”

Karuna’s focus was on the reformative justice aspect. “It seems appropriate now when we are discussing whether justice should be reformative or retributive,” she shrugs. “In the epic, Manimekalai is clear that the first is more important. First feed them, she says, give them love and care. Then educate them. She turns a prison into a centre for education.”

To Karuna, Manimekalai is an example of how to think in a more reflective manner; “to respond to undercurrents rather than react. Though she renounces the world, Manimekalai is not a single-note character. She speaks about her attraction to the prince who is pursuing her and how she decides to throw lust out of the door. It makes her so human, so relatable.”

With all these pieces, Karuna wanted to stay away from clichés of the perfect woman. “One way is to observe people but not slot them,” she muses. The other trigger for her was the need to talk about plurality, “so important now,” she rolls her eyes expressively. “Everything is being homogenised but we should move away from ‘it should be this way’, whatever that it is.”

The idea for this presentation has been simmering within her; three to four years, she says, when pressed for a time frame. “I named the production four years ago and then put it on the backburner.Then PSG decided to bestow the Yuva Kala Ratna Award on me this year. And they asked for a thematic presentation on women. The time was right to bring this out.”",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/6vel9b/article30459219.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cm25Karunasagari-2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/dancer-karuna-sagari-talks-about-her-latest-production-chittam-azhagiyar/article30459220.ece

277,2020/01/02,Deadline for manufacturers to make pumpsets with revised energy efficiency standards extended,"The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has extended the deadline for pumpset manufacturers to switch over to the revised star-rating system for energy efficiency of their products.

This has come as a relief to the manufacturers in Coimbatore, who supply more than 40 % of the country’s pumpset needs, especially in the agriculture and domestic sectors.

In a communication dated December 31, the BEE said that the date for implementation of the revised energy efficiency standard guidelines is extended to February 1 from January 1. The existing star rating, which is provided on the previous energy consumption standards, will expire from February 1.

Pumpset manufacturers and traders who already produce star label pumpsets should apply to the BEE for approval under the new comsumption standards. The portal for online application will be open till January 31, 2020.

V. Krishnakumar, president of Southern India Engineering Manufacturers’ Association, said the manufacturers needed more time to switch over to the new standards. They make a total of almost 10,000 models of pumpsets, and face a lot of challenges in switching over to a new system as production continues every day and industries have inventory.

From January 1, almost every one was using just the ISI name plate on the pumpsets produced, as they had not got the approvals required from the BEE. Now, with one month’s time, they need to go back to the old name plates with the star rating mentioned.

279,2020/01/02,Pilloor III drinking water project: Govt. to assess social impact of land acquisition,"The work on ground to implement the Pilloor III drinking water project is likely to take another six months as the State government has decided to assess the social impact of land acquisition on the owners.

Sources familiar with the developments said a government constituted committee would hold talks with the 998 owners of the 120 acre that it proposed to acquire to assess what impact the acquisition would have.

The committee would then submit a report to the Government. Meanwhile, the Coimbatore District Collector would also issue the notification for acquiring the identified lands by calling for objections.

After hearing objections from the land owners on various aspects of the acquisition including the quantum of compensation, the Collector would issue the final notification but only after the social impact report was done.

The impact assessment, the issue of notification and call for objections and other attendant procedures would take at least six months, if not more, the sources said and added that only thereafter would the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board could start the work.

The Board is implementing the ₹ 964-crore project to improve the city’s water supply by drawing River Bhavani water at Murugaian Parisal Padithurai, near Mettupalayam. It had identified around 160 acres for the project and of those 120 acre are private land to construct raw water treatment plant, lay pipelines and build water tanks.

280,2020/01/02,"Murder case accused injured in escape bid, claim police","The police have claimed that a 24-year-old man accused of murdering his lover’s daughter in May last year fractured his leg while attempting to escape from the scene of crime where he was taken for evidence collection on Tuesday.

The Saravanampatti police claimed that the accused, Tamil aka Sargunam of Kovilpalayam, injured after he fell from the compound wall of a Government elementary school at Karattumedu while attempting to escape.

The police said that they had taken Sargunam to the school, where the three-year-old daughter of his lover was strangled and poisoned to death on May 26 last year, to revisit the crime. Sargunam, whose right leg was fractured, was admitted to the prisoners’ ward of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital for treatment after the alleged escape bid on Tuesday evening.

Sargunam had surrendered before the Village Administrative Officer, Karattumedu, on Tuesday morning in connection with the murder. He was handed over to the police who later took him to the scene of crime where the alleged escape attempt took place.

According to the police, Sargunam was in a relationship with the deceased girl’s mother Roopini (30) who was living separated from her husband. They allegedly murdered the child on the premises of the elementary school and dumped her body in deserted place on the way to Murugan Temple at Karattumedu on May 26 night. While the body of the girl was found on the next day and Roopini was arrested two days later.

The police said that Sargunam was hiding in Bengaluru where he had been doing odd works.

A senior police officer said that it was a coincidence that the right leg of the accused was broken in the escape bid.

“The right leg of the girl was broken when she was found dead.

281,2020/01/02,Coimbatore couple rope in NGO to collect wedding gifts,"Post-doctoral scientist Akshaya Ravichandran’s wedding to Tejasvi Kambhampati in Coimbatore last month marked the beginning of two journeys for her – one, on the personal front as a wife; and, two as a person commitment to environment conservation.

She began her second journey by inviting guests to contribute to water conservation NGO Kovai Kulangal Padhukaapu Amaipu (organisation to conserve Coimbatore water bodies), instead of gifts for the couple.

“A note on gifts – On this wonderful day we would love to share our happiness with our society. We have invited Kovai Kulangal Padhukaapu Amaipu, (www.kovaikulanga.org) a local NGO dedicated to reviving our water bodies, who will be present at the venue. We humbly request you to join us in donating to the cause instead of gifts,” read the invitation Ms. Ravichandran’s ophthalmologist father B. Ravichandran and mother Sujatha Ravichandran sent out to guests.

“At my daughter's request, I had the invitation printed on eco-friendly paper with seeds embedded. I had told the guests what they had to to with the invitations, wet and plant it so that the embedded seeds take roots,” says the doctor.

The donation received amounted to ₹ 1.25 lakh from 111 guests, says the Amaipu’s R. Manikandan..“The platform the wedding provided for so many guests to know about our work, the enquiries that followed and, above all, the recognition of good work.”

But why the water conservation NGO and not any other? “My daughter, during the course of our almost daily conversation, made it clear that my wife and I chose a local, start-up NGO and not a well-established one. This must be sometime in March-April 2019 and that is when an article on the Amaipu in The Hindu Metro Plus caught my wife's attention,” recalls Mr. Ravichandran.

After learning about the choice of NGO, Ms. Ravichandran, who is at the Texas A&M University, U.S., learnt about organisation, saw its social media profile and thereafter checked with friends in Coimbatore to confirm the choice.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/6x7bw7/article30454444.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB02SAPLING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/couple-rope-in-ngo-to-collect-wedding-gifts/article30454445.ece
282,2020/01/02,Video of former DMK minister’s ‘attempt to touch’ inspector’s feet goes viral,"A video clip in which former DMK minister and Tiruppur strongman M.P. Saminathan was seen attempting to touch the feet of a police inspector has created a flutter.

The three-time MLA and former minister was seen in the video tendering an apology to an inspector who objected to illegal flex boards erected by the DMK near a polling station, in violation of election norms.

However, Mr. Saminathan contended that he was seeking to mock at the inspector gesturing with folded hands and leaning forward as if to touch his feet “as I was not involved in any violation of election norms.”

The incident took place on December 27 after AIADMK cadres alleged that DMK cadres placed flex boards within 200 metres of a polling station in Velampalayam panchayat, in violation of the election norms. Vellakoil inspector visited the place and informed a higher official over phone that placing of the flex boards involved violation.

An advocate, claiming to represent Mr. Saminathan, alleged that the video was edited to show as if the former minister tried to apologise to the police officer.

When contacted, the inspector refused to comment whether Mr Saminathan had sought an apology from him.

“It was a dispute between cadres of two parties, which was settled,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/video-of-former-dmk-ministers-attempt-to-touch-inspectors-feet-goes-viral/article30454342.ece
283,2020/01/02,Hyderabad gets an Azhar boost,"The Master was at work! Former India captain and the current president of Hyderabad Cricket Association, Mohd Azharuddin, donned the role of a ‘mentor’ to the beleaguered Hyderabad team training at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here on the eve of its Ranji match against Kerala on Thursday.

The team couldn’t have asked for a better choice than the 56-year-old Azhar, sporting a track-suit which was symbolic in more than one way, given the kind of fitness he still maintains. He spent more than an hour with the members trying to point out some minor flaws in their technique.

Like when Himalay Agarwal was batting, Azhar gave a few tips to him with regard to his grip and the way the shoulder and toe were pointing when he was ready to face the ball. After the minor adjustment, a more confident Himalay felt he was more relaxed.

Azhar also spent time with wicket-keeper-batsman K. Sumanth and all-rounder T. Ravi Teja with coach N. Arjun Yadav chipping in with inputs.

No blame game

“I don’t want to indulge in any blame-game at this stage of the season. These boys need some moral support and minor technical adjustments. I am here to help them any time. It is always a joy to be with them if it helps the team’s cause,” Azhar said to The Hindu.

His words were plain and simple. “Don’t play maiden overs against any bowler. Once in a while it is okay. You have to dictate the line and length of a bowler according to your strength and this you can do when you train hard, keep improving and show the willingness to keep learning.

“Each one of us has different style of batting. But ultimately what counts is how well you perform on the given day. Just remember not many get a chance to play for Hyderabad. So, ensure that you make most of it,” he added.

“You can’t expect me to be out there in the middle. I can only help the boys and ultimately those picked have to live up to the expectations,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/lxf3d2/article30460954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03azhar,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hyderabad-gets-an-azhar-boost/article30460955.ece
284,2020/01/02,A perform or perish situation,"It will be a contest between two teams whose performances are woefully short of expectations when former champion Hyderabad and Kerala clash in the fourth round of the Ranji Trophy Elite Pool match at the Rajiv Gandhi Stadium here from Friday.

With three points from three games, Kerala is marginally better off than the home side which is yet to open its account on the points table after three straight defeats.

Not the kind of start Hyderabad coach, N. Arjun Yadav, would have looked for. Especially after all the criticism on the selection front.

Biggest concern

The biggest concern is the poor run from seasoned campaigner and opener P. Akshath Reddy and southpaw B. Sandeep. With these two not firing in the top-order, new captain Tanmay Agarwal is left to fend for himself. The bowlers are also not being given any kind of backing by way of challenging scores.

With the exception of Tanmay and wicket-keeper-batsman K. Sumanth and the odd contribution from left-arm spinner Mehdi Hasan, there has been nothing to boast about the batting so far.

The bowling too has been disappointing with pacers Mohd Siraj (10 wickets from three games), Ravi Kiran (seven from two) and Chama Milind (four from three) not posing any major challenge to the opposition.

Clearly, it is perform or perish for some familiar faces at the half-way stage of the season.

Experience

On the other hand, Kerala will look to the experienced batting duo of Robin Uthappa and captain Sachin Baby to come good and affect a turnaround.

Off-spinning all-rounder Jalaj Saxena has been Kerala’s best bowler with 18 wickets. He should be the key once the pace duo of Sandeep Warrier and Basil Thampi provide early breakthroughs on what the Hyderabad coach feels is a dry wicket. The toss then will be crucial.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ldh1h1/article30460942.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/a-perform-or-perish-situation/article30460943.ece
285,2020/01/02,"India, under Kohli, can win all ICC tournaments: Lara","Batting legend Brian Lara believes the Indian cricket team, under Virat Kohli, is capable of winning all ICC tournaments it competes in.

The 50-year-old left-handed batting icon was of the view that every international side sort of targets India in ICC tournaments.

“I think they are definitely capable of winning all tournaments that they play. I think what Virat Kohli and company and the Indian team has to appreciate the fact that everybody sort of target India,” Lara was quoted as saying by ‘India Today’.

“Everybody knows that some point of time one team is going to play that important match against India. If it’s a quarter-final, semi-final and final,” he added.

Under Kohli’s leadership, India has reached greater heights in both Tests and ODIs but has so far failed to win an ICC tournament, fizzling out in crucial games.

The Men in Blue last won an ICC event was in 2013 when Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led side lifted the ICC Champions Trophy in the United Kingdom.

Regarded as one of the finest batsmen that world cricket has ever produced, Lara’s 15-year-old record of 400 not out against England is still the highest individual score in Test cricket.

However, Lara feels Kohli, David Warner and Rohit Sharma have the potential to break his record.

“It would be difficult for Steve Smith to do it batting at No.4 for Australia. He is a great player but he doesn’t dominate. You know a player like David Warner for sure,” Lara said.

“A player like Virat Kohli, who gets in early and gets set. He is a very attacking player. Rohit Sharma on his day. So they have got quite a group of players who can do so,” he added.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/n3ovxx/article30460243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRIANLARA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-under-kohli-can-win-all-icc-tournaments-lara/article30460245.ece
286,2020/01/02,BCCI to set up medical panel and hire social media expert for under-fire NCA,"The National Cricket Academy, which has often been criticised for its handling of players’ injuries, is set to get the help of a BCCI medical panel and a dedicated social media department as part of its overall revamp plan.

The need for a medical panel was discussed at the NCA’s recent meeting which was attended by all the BCCI-officer bearers, including president Sourav Ganguly and NCA cricket head Rahul Dravid.

The development comes after the criticism the NCA drew for the injury management of leading India players, including Wriddhiman Saha and more recently Bhuvneshwar Kumar.

All-rounder Hardik Pandya and premium pacer Jasprit Bumrah added to the NCA’s woes by choosing personal rehabilitation over recovering in Bengaluru.

“The BCCI will consult a London-based clinic, Fortius, for setting up its medical panel,” a top BCCI official told PTI.

Head of fast bowling, a position which has been lying vacant for a long time, will also be filled soon.

That person will be in charge of setting up a fast bowling program at the NCA. The Board will also hire a nutrition head for the Bengaluru-based facility.

As the NCA has mainly been in the news for all the wrong seasons and there is no official communication coming out of it.

A social media manager will come on board to provide regular updates on the happenings inside the facility. The move could also go a long way in repairing NCA’s reputation, the Board official added.

The NCA had failed to detect Bhuvneshwar’s sports hernia and was also at the receiving end of criticism when it came to light that Bumrah and Hardik were taking outside help for their recovery rather relying on the NCA staff.

Going forward, Mr. Ganguly has already made it clear that NCA will be the primary centre for cricketing development programs in the country and all India players will have to go to Bengaulru for rehabilitation.

He also expects the new NCA facility to be ready in 18 months’ time.

The other recruitment, which will be done soon, is the head of data analytics.

The NCA will also be conducting Level 2 and Level 3 coaching courses at its premises with state associations footing the bill for their respectively coaches.

“Coach development consultants” will also be hired on requirement basis.

Utmost caution will be taken while issuing medical updates on the Indian players with vetting of the information done by the team management as well as the NCA.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/gg9fmc/article29824932.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GANGULY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bcci-to-set-up-medical-panel-and-hire-social-media-expert-for-under-fire-nca/article30458310.ece
287,2020/01/02,U-19 World Cup hero Kalra suspended for 1 year from Ranji Trophy for “age-fraud”,"Young left-handed opener Manjot Kalra, who scored a hundred in the final of the last edition of U-19 World Cup, has been suspended by outgoing DDCA Ombudsman for one year from playing Ranji Trophy, for an alleged age-fraud during his U-16 and U-19 days.

However for the same offence, Delhi senior team vice-captain Nitish Rana has been let off for the time being with more documents being sought to prove that he fudged his age at the junior level.

Another U-19 star Shivam Mavi’s case has been referred to the BCCI since he now represents Uttar Pradesh in senior cricket.

The outgoing Ombudsman Justice (Retired) Badr Durrez Ahmed passed an order (a copy of which is with PTI) on his final day, preventing Kalra from playing age-group cricket for two years but more importantly denying him a chance to play Ranji Trophy for this season.

Kalra, whose age as per BCCI records is 20 years 351 days, last week played for Delhi U-23 against Bengal and scored 80. He was in line to replace senior opener Shikhar Dhawan in the Ranji squad but as it now stands, he will not play any further.

When asked a senior DDCA official, he expressed his helplessness.

“I find it surprising that Manjot Kalra has been punished for the same offence that Nitish Rana is also allegedly guilty of. We couldn’t pick Manjot as it was Ombudsman’s order. He passed it at 11:30 pm at night, a day before he relinquished office. Now that’s a bit bizarre,” DDCA general secretary Vinod Tihara told PTI.

In case of Rana, former Ombudsman has asked DDCA to enquire from his school DAV Centenary, Narela and seek specific birth-certificate related documents and place before next hearing.

But question remains when the old Ombudsman is not there, does it mean new appointee Justice Deepak Verma will conduct fresh enquiry?

What everyone is failing to understand is how Kalra can be prevented from playing senior level cricket for age-fraud?

“He has been prevented from playing club matches also. Now his parents will have to appeal for a change of order in front of new Ombudsman. Till then DDCA can’t pick him for Ranji Trophy. We are helpless,” Tihara said.

289,2020/01/02,Cong. office vandalism: FIR registered; Thorat denies discontent within party,"The police have registered an FIR in the vandalism of the Congress office in Pune by alleged supporters of party MLA Sangram Thopate even as Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president and minister Balasaheb Thorat on Wednesday refuted suggestions of discontent within the party.

On Tuesday evening, an irate group of alleged supporters of the three-time MLA from Bhor Assembly constituency ransacked the Congress Bhavan while directing their ire against the party top brass for not giving Mr. Thopate a cabinet berth despite his family being firm Congress loyalists for decades.

Acting on a complaint filed by Congress leader Sachin Adekar, the Shivajinagar police on Tuesday night registered the FIR against unidentified persons for rioting and vandalism under Sections 143, 144 (pertaining to unlawful assembly), 146, 147, 148 (rioting), and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

“I spoke to Mr. Thopate on Tuesday night. The Congress party is one family and he will get his due. He said he had accepted the party high command’s decision… Since we are part of a government which is a three-party coalition, we [the Congress] got less ministerial berths,” said Mr. Thorat, stressing on the need for all party leaders to work in harmony under the circumstances.

On his part, Mr. Thopate condemned the vandalism of the Congress Bhavan and disclaimed any prior knowledge of the incident, clarifying that he was in Mumbai on Tuesday and that he returned to Bhor on Wednesday morning.

“I, too, came to know of this [Congress Bhavan incident] after seeing the news on television channels. I am collecting information as to which part of Pune – urban or rural — did these alleged supporters come from and whether or not they were indeed Congress activists or just a ploy by a mischievous party,” Mr. Thopate said.

The Congress MLA further said he himself had accepted the decision of the party’s senior leadership (of not giving him a cabinet berth) and called upon his partisans to maintain peace and not indulge in any unlawful activity.

While Mr. Thopate may have cast aspersions on whether or not the vandals were his supporters or indeed even Congress workers, Mr. Adekar alleged that between 5:30 p.m. and 5.45 p.m. on Tuesday, several Congress activists from the Bhor-Velhe-Mulshi belt had stormed into the Congress Bhavan premises armed with rods, sticks, and stones.

“The agitators raised slogans in support of Mr. Thopate and against Mr. Thorat. Despite a number of workers who were present in the office, including Pune City Congress general secretary Ramesh Iyer, attempted to reason with the group of Mr. Thopate’s supporters, they were in no mood to listen and went about smashing window panes, damaging doors, destroying office literature, furniture, and the television set. A number of them also indulged in stone-pelting which resulted in injuries to some of our workers,” Mr. Adekar’s complaint said.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/29so38/article30455345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMCONGRESSBHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/cong-office-vandalism-fir-registered-thorat-denies-discontent-within-party/article30455346.ece

296,2020/01/02,"JNUSU unmoved, continues its fight for affordable education","The JNUSU on Wednesday continued its fight for affordable education by saying that there will be no registration with the hiked hostel fee and requested all students of the university not to register themselves for the new semester. The JNUSU said that if students register themselves, they will be accepting the “illegal” hostel fee hike that the administration has brought about and the entire movement against it would not succeed.

The JNU administration has brought out circulars with the revised fee structure ahead of the semester that started on January 1 and also offered students time till January 20 to complete the academic requirements that they could not complete during the last semester along with coursework of the new semester.

The JNUSU in a statement said that it categorically rejects the fee hike imposed in a circular dated December 30.

“The administration is not only making an exponential hike in room rent but also has surreptitiously hiked the medical fees for all regular students to ₹500. The students of Mahanadi-Subhansir hostel are in for even more conceited treatment by means of service and utility charges that have been imposed on them,” the JNUSU said.

The students said that they had communicated to the administration in meetings that all fee hike must be rolled back without any further delay and IHA meeting later can be convened with all constituents to democratically discuss and deliberate the issue. “It is clearly evident that the JNU administration is determined to wilfully disregard the situation and continue a crisis of its own making,” the JNUSU said.

The students’ union said that it has taken legal opinion regarding the situation and according to the High Court verdict, which lambasted the administration to try and run the university like a police camp, it is clear that the administration does not have any legal standing for the circulars it is issuing.

“The JNUSU calls for the students to be rest assured that this administration has no legitimacy or authority to impose its diktats on the university. It threatened us with a lot of circulars when we did not cooperate with the evaluation process and boycotted the examinations. Hence its empty threats and coercion cannot be entertained,” the JNUSU told students.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnusu-unmoved-continues-its-fight-for-affordable-education/article30455016.ece

The contract involves construction of metro viaduct from Sangam Vihar to Saket G block, including four elevated metro stations — Sangam Vihar, Khanpur-Deoli, Ambedkar Nagar and Saket G block.

“The highlight of this section will be a double decker viaduct which will include the metro viaduct as well as an elevated six lane flyover from Sangam Vihar to Ambedkar Nagar. An underpass will also come up at Saket-G. After construction of this stretch, the Mehrauli Badarpur road will be signal free from Sangam Vihar to Saket,” the DMRC said in a statement.

Officials added that the work is expected to be completed in three years time.

The Tughlakabad-Aerocity metro corridor will be a 20-kilometre-long stretch comprising 15 stations. “The corridor will connect the existing Kashmere Gate-Raja Nahar Singh [Violet Line] with the Airport Express Link,” said DMRC officials.

DMRC spokesperson Anuj Dayal said: “A total of three civil contracts have so far been awarded for the Delhi Metro’s Phase IV corridors, including construction of 10 stations on the Janakpuri West - R.K. Ashram Marg corridor. Civil contract for a bridge across the Yamuna and integrated elevated viaduct with PWD flyover at lower deck and metro line at the upper deck have also been awarded.”

The Centre in March last year had approved three out of six proposed corridors under the Phase IV network.

The corridors approved were the Tughlakabad-Aerocity, Janakpuri West - R.K. Ashram Marg and Maujpur to Majlis Park corridors.

298,2020/01/02,Air pollution ‘severe’ on 4 of the last 5 days,"The air quality of the city was in “severe” category on Wednesday and is likely to slightly improve to the higher-end of the “very poor” category by Thursday, according to government-run monitoring agency System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR).

The pollution has been in “severe” category for four out of the last five days, including Wednesday, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data.

On Wednesday, the average level of PM2.5 — deadly respirable particles — was (421.7 ug/m3) more than seven times the safe limit (60ug/m3) as per Indian standards, in Delhi and NCR at 8 p.m., according to the CPCB. But the level is more than 16 times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) set by the WHO.

“Though the meteorological conditions have become favourable for higher dispersion, an additional source of emission in all likelihood has increased emissions on New Year eve from 8 p.m. onwards peaking from midnight to 1 a.m.,” SAFAR said.

“The additional emissions must be most probably due to crackers, but it could be even be vehicular pollution,” said said Vivek Chattopadhyaya, senior programme manager of Clean Air Programme at Centre for Science and Environment, Delhi.

The city’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Wednesday was 437, up from Tuesday’s was 387 (very poor), according to the 4 p.m. bulletin of the CPCB, which is the average of the last 24 hours.

”SAFAR model now suggests that under the influence of approaching western disturbance, increased surface winds and improved ventilation, AQI is forecast to improve to the higher end of the “very poor” category by January 2. Further significant improvement in AQI towards the middle end of “very poor” to “poor” category is expecting by January 3,” SAFAR said.

299,2020/01/02,"Businessman shoots wife, daughter before killing self","A Delhi-based businessman allegedly shot dead his wife and minor daughter before killing himself inside a car that was found on the Yamuna Expressway in Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura district, police said on Wednesday.

His minor son was found critically injured inside the car and has been hospitalised, the police said.

The incident came to light when a patrolling vehicle of the police noticed the static Mathura-registered vehicle at the 105th milestone near Vrindavan cut, Superintendent of Police Ashok Kumar Meena told reporters.

Preliminary probe revealed that the man was disturbed due to family issues and business matters. He was also under monetary debt, which could be the reason behind him taking the extreme step, Mr. Meena said.

A purported note has been recovered from the vehicle and it is under a forensic probe, the officer said.

“The car was locked from inside with the bodies inside. The window glass was broken by the police and the bodies retrieved,” he said.

“The man was in the driver’s seat with a pistol in his right hand, while his wife and children in the back seat. The bodies were taken out when the police noticed the minor son breathing. He was immediately rushed to a hospital for treatment. The others were dead,” the officer said.

Prima facie, it appeared that the man first shot his family members and then ended his own life, according to the SP.

The family, who belonged to Jagnnath Puri in Mathura city, were staying in Delhi and had come here on New Year’s eve, the officer said, adding the bodies had been sent for post-mortem and an investigation was under way.

“The BJP thought that this historic decision would affect their politics, so Delhi BJP leaders went to their national leaders to ask the CBSE to increase its fees. On August 2, 2019, CBSE raised the fee to ₹1,950 for general and ₹1,650 for SC/ST,” he said.

Mr. Sisodia said that the Delhi BJP should explain why CBSE was “forced” to increase the fee.

301,2020/01/02,Ensure rights of jailbirds are not violated during surprise raids: HC,"The Delhi High Court has directed the prison authorities here to ensure that the rights of jail inmates are not violated during surprise searches in jail wards.

A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar directed the Delhi government and prison authorities to “strictly follow the Jail Prison Rules, 2018 and the standard operating procedure” whenever such surprise searches are carried out in the wards of jails, including high security wards.

“It is the duty of the respondents [government and prison authorities] that the rights of the jail inmates are not to be violated much less their human rights,” the Bench said, while disposing of a public interest litigation (PIL) initiated by it.

Letter from inmates

The PIL was initiated on the basis of an October 2017 letter received from some inmates of a high-risk ward of Tihar jail alleging that the Tamil Nadu Special Police, which takes care of the jail’s security, was gross violating human rights in ward number 8 and 9 of Tihar Jail.

Following the court intervention, the Superintendent of the Jail submitted his report in which it was mentioned that a high-level inquiry was conducted by the DIG (Prisons). It was revealed in the report that a surprise search was conducted by the T.N. Special Police officials on the direction of the Deputy Superintendent and under the supervision of Assistant Superintendent Jail, in the high security ward on October 12, 2017.

Three broken tennis racket, some loose wire, and two rusted ‘iron patti’, all prohibited items were recovered from a barrack. During the inspection, the inmates started misbehaving and abused the search team and also manhandled them. Following which alarm was raised and minimum force was used to control the situation. The accused persons, who received minor injuries, were provided medical treatment, the report said.

Taking note of the report, the court opined, “it appears that the use of force was to control the reaction of the jail inmates to seizure of prohibited articles”.

“Looking to the said inquiry, it appears that nothing further is required to be done and no further orders are required to be passed by this court as whenever such types of surprise searches are carried out in jail wards and in case any prohibited tems are found by the police, such types of reactions are expected,” the High Court observed while disposing of the case.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ensure-rights-of-jailbirds-are-not-violated-during-surprise-raids-hc/article30454971.ece
302,2020/01/02,31% decline in drunk driving challans this New Year’s Eve,"A total of 352 challans were issued for driving drunk on New Year’s Eve — a 30.8% dip compared to 2018 and nearly 80% less than 2017, said the police on Wednesday.

In 2018, 509 challans were issued for drunk driving; in 2017, 1,752 challans were issued. This year, violators were mainly youngsters and middle-aged, the police said.

There are several reasons behind the decline, including people being more aware of police strictness, increased police presence, and steeper fine under the amended Motor Vehicle Act, said the police.

“Messages regarding strict action against people driving drunk were shared on social media. Also, people have generally become more aware that they should take taxis and cabs if they are drunk at a party. Another factor is that the fine for drunk driving is now ₹10,000 and the public is aware of this,” said a senior police officer.

The Delhi Police had increased its presence near markets, malls, restaurants, pubs and bars. PCR Vans, Prakhar vans and Raftaar bikes were stationed at vulnerable points. Two doctors were also deployed for conducting medical examination of drivers to see whether they were under the influence of alcohol.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/31-decline-in-drunk-driving-challans-this-new-years-eve/article30454970.ece
303,2020/01/02,Only 36 drunk driving challans issued in Gurugram,"This New Year’s Eve, Gurugram Traffic Police personnel donned the cap of “facilitators” to help drunk revellers reach home safely rather than issue challans.

As per the Gurugram Police, only 36 challans were issued for drunk driving on the intervening night of December 31, 2019 and January 1, 2020. Last year, the police had challaned 130 people for drunk driving.

Greater awareness

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Himanshu Garg told The Hindu that the focus this year was not to issue challans, but to assist people and ensure that those in an inebriated state reach home safely.

“The people were requested to call for a cab or let someone who was not drunk to drive the vehicle. The police also took the services of around 20 cabs for this purpose that dropped off people safely to their homes,” said Mr. Garg.

The reduction in the number of drunk driving cases on New Year’s Eve was also partially attributed to increased awareness among the revellers and the hefty fine of ₹10,000 as per the amended Motor Vehicles Act rules that came into force on September 1.

The rules also provide for the suspension of the driving licence of the defaulter for three months.

Stricter rules

As per the statistics provided by the Gurugram police, 4,047 were challaned for drunk driving in 2019, though the number reduced considerably after the amendment in the motor vehicle rules.

The highest number of drunk driving challans (604) were issued in March, the lowest (274) in May, before the new rules came into effect.

After the new fine rates came into force, only 37 and 23 challans were issued respectively in September and October. However, the number of challans rose to 230 in November and a total of 231 people were challaned in December.

Mr. Garg said that in the initial months after the amendment to the rules, the focus was on awareness generation and that the figures had risen in recent weeks. “Besides, the first few weeks were also lost in updating software of the e-challan machines as per the amendment,” he added.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/only-36-drunk-driving-challans-issued-in-gurugram/article30454968.ece

DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that the accused, Gaurav, was living in Sagarpur and hails from Baraut. He allegedly robbed a salesman of the pharmacy in Dwarka Sector 10 of ₹75,000 and medicines worth ₹3,000. Police have recovered ₹65,000 and medicines from his possession.

According to the police, in the early hours of December 30, they received a call regarding robbery at a pharmacy. When they reached the spot, they were informed that a person with his face covered entered the shop and showed a prescription slip to the salesman. When the salesman was taking out the medicines, the accused closed the shutter of the shop from inside and tied the salesmen’s mouth, hands and legs after which he allegedly robbed the money and medicines.

When the police scanned the CCTV footage, it was found that the accused opened a wrapper to pull out the knife. The wrapper was recovered from the spot which led the police to the place from where it was purchased in Mahavir Enclave. It was then found that the man had used PayTM to make the payment which helped the police to reach his doorstep. He was arrested from his residence.

Police said that Gaurav is a BSc graduate and is previously involved in a double murder case in Vivek Vihar in 2010. He spent eight years in jail and was released on bail in October 2018. Later in 2019, he started working at the pharmacy as salesman before he was shifted to the pharmacy’s franchise in Dwarka Sector 12. “He had borrowed money from someone and had to repay it. As he had worked in the shop for a few months, he knew that the sales there was handsome.

Demanding that both AAP and Congress apologise to the people for “spreading violence”, Mr. Javadekar, who is the BJP election in-charge for Delhi, said that “complete development” of the city would be the main issue for the party in the upcoming Assembly polls.

“AAP MLA Amanatullah Khan, Ishraq Khan, former Congress MLA Asim Khan and Matin Ahmed played an important role in misleading the minority community in Jamia, Seelampur and Jama Masjid areas,” he alleged.

Mr. Javadekar said the leaders had “spread rumours” that after the passage of the Act “azan in masjids would be stopped, loudspeakers from mosques would be removed, and wearing burqa would be banned”. Due to this “false propaganda” violence spread in Delhi, he claimed.

Mr. Javadekar said the BJP would contest the Delhi elections “with the confidence of emerging victorious” because of schemes such as in situ rehabilitation of slums.

‘Diverting attention’

Senior AAP leader and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the BJP was trying to divert people’s attention from real issues by making such allegations.

“AAP completely opposes riots [violence] and we all know which party indulges in it. The masters of riots are accusing others and trying to distract attention of people from real issues... BJP is playing an old tape... Delhi’s elections will be fought on real issues,” he said.

Entry and exit gates of five Delhi Metro stations were closed around 6 p.m. to ease rush of passengers. Normal metro operations resumed after an hour.

Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Taj Hassan said around 70,000 people had gathered at India Gate causing massive traffic jams. There were 600 traffic policemen just in the New Delhi area to regulate traffic movement. “We focused only on regulation and flow of traffic. We had already issued advisories and updated live traffic situation on social media to keep motorists informed,” said Mr. Hassan.

“Traffic should be normal from Thursday onwards... it was because of New Year that so many people came out to celebrate,” said Mr. Hassan.

Unauthorised parking

Jams were seen on several roads leading to and around India Gate. Unauthorised parking and restriction of visitors inside the lawns on Rajpath due to Republic Day preparations, forced visitors to walk on the roads, which further affected traffic movement, said a traffic policeman on duty at C-Hexagon (India Gate).

The DMRC also sent out tweets to alert commuters of closed stations.

“As advised by police authorities, entry and exit at five stations: Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan, Mandi House, Pragati Maidan and Khan Market, have been closed temporarily from 6.05 p.m. onwards till further instructions,” said the DMRC.

Commuters were stuck in traffic jams on roads leading to India Gate, Connaught Place and ITO.

“It took me two hours to reach India Gate from Laxmi Nagar. By the time I reached there with my family, I had lost the desire to celebrate as it was so crowded,” said Pritam Pal Mehra, a resident of Laxmi Nagar.

Ambulances stuck

One of the commuters took to Twitter to inform the Delhi Police about an ambulance stuck in a traffic jam on Barakhamba Road. The police quickly replied that the information had been shared with traffic police personnel in the area.

Another ambulance was stuck on Barapullah flyover towards Sarai Kale Khan.

The Delhi Traffic Police also updated commuters about the situation.

At Jamia Millia Islamia, which has become the epicentre of the protests in Delhi, scores of students and civil society members carrying the Tricolour and banners squatted on one carriageway of the road outside the university.

Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar and her co-star from Raanjhanaa Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub attended a public meeting on the new legislation outside the university and lauded protesters’ efforts in continuing the agitation.

“We have woken up late but now we have woken up. You [students] have woken up the entire country. We are here to thank you,” Ms. Bhaskar said and termed the amended Citizenship Act a “targeted” law.

While Mr. Ayyub raised slogans ‘Hum EK Hain’ and ‘Inquilab Zindabad’, Ms. Bhaskar recited lyricist Varun Grover’s poem against the citizenship law which has the punchline ‘Hum kaagaz nahi dikhayenge (We won’t show documents).’

Following the public meeting, a candlelight march was organised by the alumni association of the university outside gate number 7, which has become a protest site after the December 15 violence.

The students of Jamia welcomed the New Year with cries of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Azaadi’.

The sit-in protest by women at Shaheen Bagh continued after a night where they welcomed the New Year by singing the national anthem and raising the slogan ‘Azaadi’.

Ms. Bhaskar visited the protest site after addressing the gathering at Jamia Millia Islamia.

Amid heavy sloganeering, students from various universities, States and regular visitors to the monument participated in the “reading of the Preamble” on the first day of the year.

Shivalika Acharya, a homemaker and a resident of Lucknow, said that she had come to the national capital in solidarity with the movement against the recently passed law.

“My heart bleeds for the students. They have shown strength by taking the movement forward. The situation in Uttar Pradesh is quite grave which is why I have come to Delhi to be part of the protests. We (in U.P.) are always in the eye of storm. This fight is nothing less than the fight that freedom fighters fought,” said Ms. Acharya.

City resident Hanna said: “There is no other place than here that you can actually raise your voice. The CAA, NPR and NRC will end up taking away rights of several people. Maybe the government cannot see how the poor will suffer, but it is important for us to raise our voices against it. It is not like we don’t have documents to prove citizenship but we are still here to express solidarity with the uneducated, poor and disadvantaged.”

The pledge taken by the people read: “We, the Young India, reiterate our resolve to fight for our sovereign, secular, democratic, socialist India. We are in no way going to discriminate our fellow people on the basis of gender, race, colour, language, sex, caste or religion.

“We have woken up late but now we have woken up. You have woken up the entire country. We are here to thank you,” Ms. Bhaskar said and termed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act a “targeted” law.

While Mr. Ayyub raised slogans such as Hum EK Hain and Inquilab Zindabad, Ms. Bhaskar recited lyricist Varun Grover’s poem against the citizenship law which has the punchline hum kaagaz nahi dikhayenge (We won’t show documents).

310,2020/01/02,Arudra celebration at the nagadosha parihara sthalam,"Arudra Darisanam is celebrated at all Siva temples during the month of Margazhi, when the star of the day is Tiruvadirai on full moon. This year, the day falls on January 10. The cosmic dance of Nataraja is the focus on this day and the deity is brought out of the temple before dawn, in a procession, dancing and swaying. Devotees gather in thousands to witness the beautiful spectacle. Although the occasion is associated with Chidambaram, it is celebrated with equal fervour and joy at other temples too. The Nageswaraswamy temple, situated in the heart of Kumbakonam town, is gearing up for the festival. An Ancient Chola temple, constructed by Aditya Chola, the temple has many special features. The presiding deities are Nageswaraswamy and His Consort Periyanayaki.

Separate niches

Referred to as a Nagadosha pariharasthalam, the temple has shrines common in Siva temples such as Ganesa, Subramanya and Dakshinamurti. Special mention should be made of Durga, Rahu, Pralayakala Rudra, Jurahara Vinayakar and Arthanariswarar, each image a beauty. Adiseshan, Dakshan and Kaarkotakan worshipped the presiding deity here. Sun also is said to have worshipped Siva here and there is a shrine for Surya, Suryakottam and Kizhkottam being other names for the temple.

The main shrine is in the form of a chariot. A beautiful horse drawn chariot, carved out of stone stands as a symbol of this architectural marvel.

Legend goes that when the pot of nectar broke, the various parts falling at different places giving Kumbakonam its name, the vilva leaves in the water landed where the temple is now located. The sthala vriksham is vilvam and Vilvanathar is a name for Nageswaran.

Tirugnanasambandar has praised Him in the Thevara padhigam, ‘Eviyidar-k-kadalidaipattu...’ When the temple was in a dilapidated state, Padagacheri Ramalinga Swamigal collected money, renovated it and conducted the consecration in 1923. Kumbabishekam was done in 1959 and 1988.

It is believed that Nataraja descends on this temple from Kailasa. He is in Ananda Sabha and has four elephants paying him obeisance. The entire paraphernalia comes in a chariot drawn by two horses. Nataraja dances to the taalam of Sivakamasundari and Venugopala plays the flute. The Arudra Darisanam will take place at 5 a.m. on January 10 (Friday) and procession aroudn the Mada Streets at 8 a.m. Special homam and abhishekam will be conducted at 9 p.m. on January 9.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/wtjeg/article30459422.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRNAGESWARAN2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/arudra-celebration-at-the-nagadosha-parihara-sthalam/article30459423.ece
311,2020/01/02,The pioneer of printing process,"In addition to the rulers, kings, British commissioners, Dewans who built Bengaluru, many philanthropists, bureaucrats, and some officials, in their personal capacities have made an amazing contribution for the development of various aspects of Bengaluru and have added feathers to the glory of the City. One of such eminent personalities is Bengaluru Puttaiah, who, through his extraordinary skill and art in printing technology made the Mysore Government known all over the country and abroad, during early part of the last century.

His son, Dr. B.P Radhakrishna, a well known geologist, Padmashree award winner and founder of Geological Society of India with its head quarters in Gavipuram, Bangalore, has written the biography of his father in Kannada, titled Nanna Tande, published in 1945. It got reprinted in 2011. A few chapters of the book give a vivid picture of B. Puttaiah’s contribution to Govt. Printing Press and an equally remarkable service he rendered to some other pioneer organisations of the city between 1909 to 1945. Dr. B.P. Radhakrishna also passed away a few years back.

B. Puttaiah started his career in IGP’s office in Bengaluru. However, with the permission from the Dewan V.P. Madhava Rao, he took long leave and with his close friend K.H. Ramaiah got involved to start Vokkaliga Organisation. He took the responsibility of bringing out a magazine in the name of the community, mainly to educate the rural folk. Yet, on February 8, 1909 he joined along with B. Srinivasa Iyengar as probationers in Govt. Printing Press. After three years training, on May 27, 1922, they were sent to England for higher learning. B. Puttaiah used to regularly send weekly articles to his magazine on both his training and other experiences. The Superintendent of Govt. Press, Mr. C.H. Yates used to fondly call them as Puttaiah’s Weekly. B. Puttaiah’s deep concern about the development of his beloved city Bengaluru was so much that he sent several suggestions from England through his writings for the systematic development of the city, especially when he came to know that Sir M. Visveswaraya was going to become the Dewan of Mysore Province.

He completed his training in flying colours. In fact, Mr. J.R Riddell, the Principal, Bridge Foundation Printing School, Bridge lane Fleet Street, London, in his letter dated August 10, 1915, writes an appreciation letter highlighting the achievements of B. Puttaiah in particular.

The success of the Bengaluru Boys left everyone proud and almost all the news papers eulogised the rare feat of these young men from the city. ‘Karnataka’ a news paper which was widely read, wrote: .

“We are glad to hear messers B. Puttaiya, B.A., and B. Srinivasa Iyengar, B.A., Sub Assistant superintendents of the Government Press, Bangalore, have passed the City and Guilds of London Institute examination in Typography in the first class with honours. It is particularly gratifying that Mr. Puttaiah heads the list of candidates for the United Kingdom and Colonys and has won the Institute’s Silver medal and an additional prize for being the best student taking a first class certificate. Mr. Puttaiah is the first Indian student who has achieved this distinction in typography, and we congratulate him on this brilliant success, and also Mysore Government and Mr. C.H. Yates, Superintendent of the Govt. Press, for the help and the encouragement they gave him for achieving this result and for bringing credit to India in general and Mysore state in particular.”

From 1923 to 1934 B. Puttaiah was the Head of The Mysore State Government Press. During his tenure, the press rose to a higher scale of success and won the accolades from the Dewan and other luminaries even from neighboring states, for printing the Dewan’s speeches, Reformation measures undertaken by Mysore Government, Works of Mysore University and calendars.

The ‘Daily Post’ Bangalore, dated 19.2.1926 wrote….. “We are glad to learn that the Committee of Judges appointed for selecting the prize winners in the Calendar competition instituted by Messers, John Kidd & Co. Printing Ink Manufacturers of London have awarded the first prize of Rs. 150 to the Mysore Government Art Calendar for 1926, printed at the Mysore Govt. Press, Bangalore.

Sir K.P. Puttanna chetty said that it was a credit to the Government press. Sir M Visvesvaraya wrote: ‘I feel I should send you a personal letter of thanks for the trouble and interest you took in printing the Report and Evidence of the Bangalore Disturbances Enquiry Committee. You are always ready to add your own, whenever you thought that they would improve the quality of the work.” Mysore Govt. Press received several such praises.

After his retirement from the Govt. Press, B. Puttaiah was roped in by Mokshagundam Ramachandra Rao to deliver a series of lectures on ‘Printing as a Career’ to unemployed youth in a big house at Shankarapuram. The talks were so popular that ‘British Printer’, a popular paper at that time, dedicated to printing technology, lauded the efforts of B. Puttaiah in sensitising the younger generation about the art of printing.

When Kannada Sahiya Parishat decided to have its own printing division, B. Puttaiah was invited to set up the press. He went to Madras to purchase the required material and started the printing press, Acchukuta.

B. Puttaiah also served many other institutions like Mythic Society, Bangalore International Fellowship, Mariyappa Hostel, Jail reformation committee, Beggar’s rehabilitation committee, Mysore University Senate, and a few other such centres. B. Puttaiah lived at his beautifully built house at the fifth main road junction Chamarajapet and Bull Temple Road. DVG, while remembering B. Puttaiah, writes that his house had a serene atmosphere and was an abode of knowledge. Now, the heritage structure has given way to a modern building.

312,2020/01/02,‘TPCC doesn’t need Asad’s advice’,"The Congress has condemned MIM president Asaduddin Owaisi for his remarks on TPCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy on Twitter and said he had no business to advise the Telangana Congress president on what he should speak and how he should protest against the CAA.

“Congress is a national party with absolute clarity on issues and its leaders are highly capable of handling agitations. Asaduddin Owaisi can continue to mislead people through his role as brand ambassador of Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao,” said TPCC Minorities Department chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail in a statement on Thursday.

He said the Congress had taken the right decision of declining Mr. Owaisi's invitation to participate in the Nizamabad meeting. “Everyone knows that Owaisi has been trying to sabotage the anti-CAA protests in Telangana. He made all religious leaders surrender before KCR and the meeting at Pragathi Bhavan,” he alleged.

“Why is not the MIM holding joint protests with TRS in other areas,” he asked.

314,2020/01/02,Telangana Innovation Yatra from Feb. 19,"The Telangana Innovation Yatra (TIY-2020), a four-day journey to showcase different innovations that have taken birth through personal pain and observation of problems across Telangana will be held from February 19.

The TIY, being organised by the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) and Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC), aims to make participants explore the real-time frugal innovations and expand their knowledge beyond the horizons of traditional ideation. As a prelude to it, an Ideathon will be organised in all the universities.

The yatra will travel to 33 districts in Telangana and will throw limelight on the novel innovations in each district, said Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, IT Department. He launched the poster for the event in the presence of Prof. T Papi Reddy, Chairman, TSCHE; Prof. R Limbadri and Prof. V Venkata Ramana, Vice-Chairmen; N Srinivas Rao, Secretary, TSCHE and Annie Vijaya, Project Director, TSIC.

Prof T Papi Reddy said that TSCHE is the Education Partner at TIY 2020 and it would be responsible for promoting and managing the Ideathon across all the universities, as the preliminary step to participate in TIY 2020.

He said Ideathon will be conducted in collaboration with each university and students with innovative ideas will get chance to participate in it.

315,2020/01/02,"TRS is totally opposed to CAA, says KTR","Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) working president and IT Minister K T Rama Rao on Thursday said the party was totally opposed to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the party’s stand was made clear in Parliament itself when the bill was opposed.

In response to a news report published in The Hindu on Thursday, he said the report had attributed unverified comments to him, and it sent a wrong message to people.

“I have not made any such comments and there is no ambiguity on our party’s stand on the issue since the beginning,” he told The Hindu.

Mr Rama Rao argued that when the bill had already become an Act, there was no way the party could now support it, and that too after voting against it in Parliament.

The party’s opposition to the CAA was due to the exclusion of Muslims as the Constitution did not discriminate against people in the name of religion, he said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/trs-is-totally-opposed-to-caa-says-ktr/article30462932.ece
316,2020/01/02,Newly recruited SPF personnel to guard vital installations,"The deployment of newly recruited Special Protection Force personnel to guard vital installations including the State Secretariat has finally gathered pace.

Verification of the credentials of the newly recruited SPF personnel has been completed and they were asked to report to duties. The new recruits will be given intensive training starting January 11 and the officials reportedly decided to train these personnel in batches of 100 each at a time. Senior officials said that in the normal course, personnel recruited for the SPF would require almost nine-month training, but it has been decided to reduce the training period considerably so that they can join duties at the earliest.

“The training will be staggered, in that a batch of 100 members each would be trained at a time and deployed on duty so that the next batch can be trained,” a senior official said. Following shortage of experienced staff on account of allocation of personnel to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh post-bifurcation, the State government had recently recruited 485 personnel so that sufficient number of personnel could be deployed at important places.

They were handed over appointment letters with December 11 as the joining date, but the process has been delayed on account of verification of their credentials by the Special Branch. The development paves the way for relieving around 100 SPF personnel allotted to neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, but are continuing to work here post-bifurcation in view of the shortage of staff faced by the State government.

In all, 850 SPF personnel of AP origin were retained in Telangana due to shortage of staff, but a majority of them had to be repatriated recently following a request from the neighbouring State government. Around 100 personnel allocated to AP are still working in Telangana and they would be relieved once the new recruits are trained and deployed on duties. “Efforts are on to assess the requirement of SPF personnel and make deployment accordingly so that vital installations as well as medical institutions like Gandhi and Osmania hospitals are provided adequate security,” the official told The Hindu.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/moepm/article30462731.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY03SPF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/newly-recruited-spf-personnel-to-guard-vital-installations/article30462732.ece
317,2020/01/02,Disquiet among senior IAS officers,"The appointment of Mr. Somesh Kumar as Chief Secretary superseding several of his senior colleagues has, apparently, created disquiet among them.

Even when the name of Mr. Somesh Kumar, along with other Special Chief Secretary cadre officers, who were his seniors, was doing the rounds for the top post, it was said then itself that in case of Mr. Somesh Kumar being chosen, many of the senior officers would have to be shifted so that they need not report to him directly on day-to-day basis.

Some of the IAS officers, it was learnt, went on leave, reportedly disheartened that their seniority had been overlooked. And some seniors reportedly are reluctant to report to their junior.

Mr. Somesh Kumar is a 1989 batch IAS officer, while his senior most colleagues who were eligible for the Chief Secretary post were from the 1983 batch. “Either propriety-wise or protocol-wise it is a bit delicate for a senior officer to report to his junior,” remarked an officer though stating he was not privy to any such development.

Among 13 senior IAS officers senior to Mr. Somesh Kumar, those outside the State and serving at the Centre like Mr. Binoy Kumar, Ms. Pushpa Subramanyam and others would not have any grievance. Mr. B. P. Acharya, senior most officer and Director-General, MCR HRD Institute of Telangana, and Mr. Suresh Chanda, Member-Secretary, Telangana State Finance Commission, may not be affected as any way they are working outside the Secretariat.

But other senior IAS officers functioning from the Secretariat and who directly have to report to the Chief Secretary may have some reservations reporting to their junior. “It depends on the equation and comfort level between the new Chief Secretary and his senior officers. In the past, some seniors worked under a Chief Secretary who was junior to them. But it is an individual call of the officer concerned,” some officers said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/disquiet-among-senior-ias-officers/article30462572.ece

This number is way higher than the 454 structures demolished last year, though several unauthorised structures still continue to be built across various circles with impunity.

Maximum number of structures were demolished in June and July last year, when a drive was taken up to identify and pull down the unauthorised buildings.

The drive was taken up after principal secretary Arvind Kumar, in a meeting with Town Planning officials, expressed displeasure about several illegal structures springing up across the city.

Many of the illegal structures pulled down were additional floors over and above the permitted number, while a few were built in the stilt floor allocated for parking. All the demolitions were of ongoing structures that had not yet been occupied.

Encroachments were removed from a total of 466 locations throughout the year.

320,2020/01/02,Model code of conduct may delay TDR launch,"After several postponements, the model code of conduct (MCC) could be the next hindrance in the way of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) bank to be launched online by the GHMC. Though complete in all respects, the online facility might not be launched till the municipal polls are over, as the code has been in place within GHMC too.

The web page, where the transferable developmental rights may be sold or bought, has been under construction for quite some time. TDRs are offered in lieu of monetary compensation whenever properties are acquired by GHMC for public infrastructure such as roads and flyovers or to widen storm water drains.

The rights may be sold or utilised at the same place or elsewhere within ORR. The relaxation of built-up space admissible under TDRs is 400 per cent of the space surrendered by property owners, which may be utilised by constructing an additional floor over and above the permissible limit.

There has been no forum thus far, where TDR-holders may find buyers, or buyers seeking to build additional floors may find sellers of the right. GHMC has decided to address this gap by building an online platform for the transactions.

Once the platform is in place, GHMC will issue the TDRs online and deposit them in the account of the property owner expressly created for this purpose. Another exercise will be carried out to create accounts for existing TDR-holders.

“We will keep the window open for the existing TDR- holders to register with the web portal so that they can transact easily. Each person will be given a separate user name and password,” said a senior official.

So far, GHMC has given 507 TDRs in lieu of monetary compensation, thus saving ₹250-300 crore.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/m0xfr7/article30454455.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-FLY-FILE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/model-code-of-conduct-may-delay-tdr-launch/article30454454.ece
321,2020/01/02,GHMC readies elaborate vector control calendar,"Stung by disease outbreak post monsoons, which has drawn widespread criticism over its laxity, GHMC has prepared an elaborate calendar of vector control activities throughout the year, by its entomology wing.

Named ‘Hyderabad Urban Malaria Scheme’, the calendar lists activities to be taken up each month to curb the spread of vector-borne diseases. According to the plan, the vector control operations must begin in March every year, by way of a door-to-door survey and preparation of logistic estimate. Procurement of drugs, equipment, and review of stocks should be taken up, and disease prone areas should be identified.

In April, the Aedes larval survey should be conducted in disease prone areas, and incidence of fever and disease should be monitored on daily and weekly basis.

GHMC level task force meeting should be conducted in May with line departments under the chairmanship of principal secretary, Director of Health and GHMC chief to discuss the strategy for control of vector borne diseases. The preparations would peak in June, with spraying operations and intensification of campaign for observance on Friday as the Dry Day for control of Aedes larvae.

Anti-larval operations, spraying and fogging are to be taken up at all the vulnerable locations, and medicines should be stocked up at all PHCs and Basti Dawakhanas. The same will continue through July and August too. In July, another door-to-door survey will be conducted, and focal spray operations are to be taken up.

During September and October, larval and adult mosquito density should be measured and feedback should be given to the chief entomologist.

322,2020/01/02,Metro rail rides into 2020 with new record,"Hyderabad Metro Rail, which ran its services till 2 a.m. for the convenience of New Year revellers, saw as many as 4.60 lakh passengers making use of the facility. It is 40,000 more than what the mass public transport system had carried ever since it launched operations in November 2017 and without any significant incident, said metro rail officials on Wednesday.

“Passengers were very well behaved last night. There has been no untoward incident or de-boarding of any passenger. Our senior officers and security personnel monitored the services till 2 a.m,” informed managing director N.V.S. Reddy.

“We usually carry about 4.10-4.20 lakh passengers a day in the two metro corridors in operation — Miyapur to L.B. Nagar (Red Line) and Nagole to Raidurg (Blue Line).

About 2.68 lakh passengers, used the Corridor One facility (29 km) and about 1.91 lakh used Corridor Three (28 km),” he explained.

For the Blue Line, the highest number of passengers have been from terminal station of Raidurg at 21,336 followed by 17,654 at Hi-Tec City, 14,730 at Uppal and 14,080 at Secunderabad, all recorded at the entry gates.

For the Red Line, heavy passenger footfall was witnessed at the terminal stations of L.B. Nagar (25,121), Miyapur (20,159) and KPHB (18,697). The Ameerpet inter-change station between both the corridors saw 28,696 passengers entering trains.

Green Line launch

In the meantime, metro rail officials are giving finishing touches for launch of the remaining corridor — Jubilee Bus Station to Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station (MGBS), an 11-km stretch, which has had a contentious construction history, some time towards the month-end since the election code due to the municipal polls has come into effect.

Word is that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao will be requested to inaugurate this second corridor as it will effectively complete the first phase of metro rail project of about 68 km from the originally envisaged 73 km.

The route from MGBS to Falaknuma has not been taken up due to issues of alignment and properties acquisition raised by the Majlis Party earlier. Now the issue is about the escalated cost as there has already been a delay of five years.

“We are focusing on making the entry and exit points of the stations on the second corridor ready for the passengers before commercial operations begin. We will take up other street level works beneath the stations gradually,” added Mr. Reddy.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/d2s6m/article30454339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy02Metro,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/metro-rail-rides-into-2020-with-new-record/article30454331.ece
323,2020/01/02,Tinkering and tampering with vehicle plates to hoodwink police,"The high security number plates (HSNP) for vehicles are stacked from the floor to the ceiling in a 10ftx10ft room at the Telangana State Road Transport Authority facility in Kondapur. “We have taken that warehouse on rent for storing number plates which customers have not taken. They date back from 2014,” says Tirupati, pointing to a house where registration number plates are neatly stored in shelves.

Tirupati manages the HSNP affixing business at Kondapur RTA. “The number plates were fixed by a private party here. But now, showrooms are supposed to fix the number plates to vehicles,” informs the RTA official.

Periodic audit by the HSNP facility revealed that 18,000 to 24,000 number plates remain undelivered per quarter. The result? Chaos on the roads of Hyderabad. Missing number plates, some covered with paint or duct tape on one digit, and bent on hundreds of vehicles plying in the city. “We caught them for not wearing helmet and they started removing the paper covering the number plate. This can be a very dangerous offence,” says a senior traffic officer as his colleagues stop vehicles near Gudimalkapur. The two boys grin, pay ₹200 fine and zip away.

Surveillance fear

With the rise in surveillance cameras in the city, there has been a spurt in vehicle owners resorting to criminal techniques to hide or deface the registration numbers to avoid penalties. Even the accused in the Shadnagar gangrape and murder case had destroyed the number plate of the veterinarian’s vehicle.

The dependence of traffic police on surveillance cameras can be seen from the fact that the department, in 2019, logged 39,48,752 non-contact Motor Vehicle Act violations, as against 6,80,083 violations where the police had to intervene.

Usual suspects

Hiding the number plates is a high stakes criminal enterprise when it comes to heavy-duty trucks transporting building debris and construction material. “Look at this. He has smudged two digits of the rear number plate and hung a black cloth to block the view from the front,” says a police official as the driver of AP22-1302 tries to cook up an explanation.

In September, the Municipal Administration and Urban Development Department notified GO-632 that levied hefty penalty for transporting construction and building debris. The first offence draws a penalty of ₹25,000, the second offence ₹50,000 and a third offence would lead to confiscation of vehicle used and a penalty of ₹1 lakh.

“Unless we can press criminal charges against vehicle owners for disfiguring the number plates, this will go on,” says the traffic official overseeing the checkpoint at Gudimalkapur.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/vsz9s6/article30454317.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy30Number,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/tinkering-and-tampering-with-vehicle-plates-to-hoodwink-police/article30454309.ece
324,2020/01/02,A mother’s plea to save her son’s life,"Barely a month after Lokesh was born, he was diagnosed with Pure Red Cell Aplasia, a rare blood disorder. It was a bolt from the blue for his parents, B. Ravi, a daily wage labourer, and B. Surekha, a small-time tailor, especially since doctors warned them of the dangers unless he was put on medication, lifelong.

Lokesh is now 17 and Surekha a widow — Ravi died of a heart attack in February 2017. Since Ravi’s death, it has been more difficult than ever to continue her son’s treatment on her ₹3,000 income, what with two other children — another son and a daughter — to look after. The four live in a government-sanctioned house in Abdullapurmet, Hayatnagar.

She also gets ₹2,000 pension from the government, but even with that, managing daily expenses and Lokesh’s medical care has been nothing short of a struggle.

Worse, she has to repay several outstanding loans. Due to the financial crisis, she had to dig into her lifetime savings and take more loans from relatives.

Despite all of it, she could not continue paying her children’s school fees as a result of which her elder son had to drop out of school.

Lokesh, too, had to discontinue education as teachers asked that he have someone by his side throughout the duration of school hours. Her daughter, however, continues going to a government school.

“Lokesh’s medicines for a month cost around ₹4,000. He needs two rounds of blood transfusion too. We have to spend ₹1,000 to travel between home and the blood bank. I stopped taking loans as people started questioning how I intend to repay it. I request people to donate money for his treatment or buy us the medicines so that my son can live,” says Surekha.

When at one point, Surekha could not afford to buy medicines for two months, Lokesh’s health started declining. “His iron levels increased and doctors said we have to continue the medicines to avoid further risks to his life. If someone helps us with our medical expenses, my son can be saved,” she adds, appealing for help.

Those willing to donate money can send it to B. Surekha (Andhra Bank, Chikadpally branch, Hyderabad; bank account number: 007610100054512, IFSC: ANDB0000076) or contact her on 86867-29184.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/kegby9/article30454299.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy01Lokesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/a-mothers-plea-to-save-her-sons-life/article30454289.ece
325,2020/01/02,"Come back, Uttam tells Telangana Congress deserters","Telangana Congress wants to woo its leaders and cadre who drifted away from the party and moved closer to the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) in the recent years.

TPCC chief N. Uttam Kumar Reddy in fact gave an open invitation to all the former Congressmen to come back to the party fold and strengthen its fight against the TRS in the ensuing municipal elections. He said the Congress is the only party that has space for people from all walks of life and social backgrounds.

His comments came at the joining of former Congress leader and former Mandal Praja Parishad (MPP) of Wanaparthy district, Shankar Naik. Mr. Naik joined the party along with his supporters and said he had joined the TRS earlier for various reasons but was unable to stay there.

The TPCC chief also used the occasion to target the TRS leaders who dubbed him as the one fearing the loss in municipal polls and searching for excuses.

He said he had won six times in his political career and it is unfortunate that those who never won an election are commenting on him.

Will take fight to TRS

Mr. Reddy said the party will take the fight right into TRS, raising the unfulfilled promises of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao. Where is the unemployment dole promised during 2018 election campaign, where the farm loan waiver and the Rythu Bandhu amount that has not been delivered so far, he asked. He asked the party cadre to take this message to every village and places where the municipal polls are being held. The Chief Minister is not answering these questions and diverting people’s attention from the real issues with the false propaganda on development, he claimed.

‘Jail bharo’ programme

The TPCC chief said the party would soon organise a ‘Jail bharo’ programme to highlight the high-handedness of the police and mistreating of the party and its cadre.

He said the voice of the Congress is being suppressed by the police on the directions of the Chief Minister.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Shankar Naik said he was never happy in the TRS. “TRS lures leaders from other parties with posts and works, but ignores them totally once they join,” he claimed.

Former Minister G. Chinna Reddy and others were present at the programme.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hqrkhj/article30454461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY02GANDHIBHAVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/come-back-uttam-tells-party-deserters/article30454231.ece
326,2020/01/02,How Chennai’s Nimirvu Kalaiyagam is changing the narrative of paraiyattam,"The parking space behind Vadapalani Metro Station has a motley group of people — all dressed in black T-shirts and blue jeans — gearing up for their performance. Anklets above their red shoes add to the peculiarity of the outfit. They are sitting in a circle, heating their parai — a customary practice to up the volume of the instrument. Little Pavan does not know the significance of the performance, but he strikes the parai, worn on his shoulder, vigorously. A crowd is already here to cheer even before the group begins. And this is how Nimirvu Kalaiyagam, a group that focuses on the traditional art form of paraiyattam, begin their performance, which was also the last of the CMRL’s Metro Music Edit series.

Nimirvu Kalaiyagam aims to break stereotypes associated with the instrument, and has been performing at public places in addition to running a music school, to train more people. The group consists of over thirty members — all students undergo training at Chellammal College. Muthamil Bharathy is the organiser of the group’s Chennai branch, whose diversity is what makes them unique. The youngest member is a seven-year-old and the oldest is 58 years old. The team also shows diversity in gender and professional backgrounds — there are lawyers and doctors amongst them.

They begin their performance by saying “Parai kalai iyarkai makkal”, raising the sticks up in the air, meaning paraiyattam is for all. Throughout the entire one-and-a-half-hour duration of the performance, the crowd remains consistently high — most of them are from the nearby mall. “I came all the way from Tambaram with my family to see their performance,” says Murugan V, an excited audience member. Some even enquired on the process of enrolling for training. Nimirvu Kalaiyagam ends up inducting more people into their team. The undying energy of each and every member is a marvel. “It all comes from parai,” says Ranjani R, an active member.

Outside the station, at the parking lot, a motorist is tapping his feet to the beats of Nimirvu Kalaiyagam.

327,2020/01/02,Chennai’s indie musicians to come together for Road To GIF,"The team behind The Road To GIF has been keeping a sharp eye on Chennai skies. “We have been watching the weather closely. There is less chance of rain, so we are positive that there will be some amazing music performed this weekend,” says Arjun Madhavan of Unwind Center, which is behind the event that will be bringing together nearly 20 of the city’s musicians to an amphitheatre surrounded by greenery.

Originally scheduled for December, with a line-up of over 26 artistes, including bands from Mysuru and Guwahati, the festival was blindsided by a sudden spurt of rain that flooded the open-air venue. This time, however, the organisers are confident, and their line-up of artistes is backing them up spiritedly. Many, like vocalist Bimal Tangachan of Owl Monk Collective, are excited not only to perform, but also to see other talent in action. He says, “I have heard a lot about Othasevuru and their folk music; they seem to be everywhere. I also really like Siennor’s songs, and he has made a full-fledged band act this time, so I am excited to hear that.”

Siennor is not the only one: Vocalist Mr Kev is back with four accompanying artistesas well, playing under the bannner Mr Kev And Friends. Also worth looking out for are the metal band Frankendriver and alternative hiphop band Maanjah Boys, both of whom have been keeping Chennai grooving for a few years now.

LS Shenkar and Eddie Prithviraj, together called Shenkar and Eddie, form what is probably the oldest act in the line-up. The veteran musicians perform under the name Radiotronics, which is an electronic music act featuring some finely intricate compositions. Also performing are some comparatively new, but nevertheless promising acts like The SyZyGy and Tabby and Sanjai. The former is a five-member band that composes across a variety of genres, while the latter is a duo that goes for intriguing, soulful and introspective pieces.

It isn’t all performances, however. The organisers have thrown in competitions for poets and beatboxers into the mix, and there will be a flea market as well.

The Road to GIF is essentially a pre-event; the intention is to drum up enthusiasm for Unwind’s main event of the year, Global Isai Festival or GIF. Though dates for GIF 2020 have not been finalised yet, editions before this have featured anywhere between 10 and 20 acts, not only from this region but also from across the country and abroad. Earlier performers have included rock bands from Japan and Blues acts from France.

The Road To GIF will be held on January 4 and 5 at Buck’s Amphitheatre, YMCA Grounds, Nandanam.

328,2020/01/02,When Pt. Birju Maharaj rendered thumris,"It was a rare treat to watch and hear Pt. Ajoy Chakraborty and Pt.Birju Maharaj at the Tata Theatre, NCPA. In the first half, Pt. Ajoy presented a few thumris. He explained how his guru incorporated thumris in Patiala gharana.

Thumris in raag Khamas and Charukesi were comprehensive melodic sojourns. Pieces like ‘Shyam na ab tak aaye’ and ‘Mora Saiya’ conveyed the pangs of waiting for the lover and waking up all night in his thoughts. The singer praised Yogesh Vamsi, the tabla accompanist, for his sense of taal, calling him his son.

When Pt. Birju Maharaj, assisted by his senior disciple Saswati Sen, came on stage, the audience greeted him with standing ovation.

“Maharaj is an all-time great,” said Pt. Ajoy, recalling their Kolkata connection, but it was for the first time that they had got together in Mumbai, for a singing session. The chemistry between the two maestros was palpable.

The Kathak legend sang a few traditional thumris composed by Bindadin Maharaj. He informed that his grandfather Bindadin had composed over 5,000 thumris. He said that he could not match his genius and recalled how his uncle Shambhu Maharaj’s rendering of thumris and abhinaya were veritable feasts.

The varied expressions in ‘Chhodo chhodo’ when the gopi beseeches Krishna to leave her pot and not to touch her was an emotive experience. His upper torso brought out the beautiful dance ingrained in him.

In another thumri, when the gopi reprimands Krishna for annoying her, Maharaj used minimal hand movements to depict the gopi shunning Krishna.

Maharaj asked Pt. Ajoy to sing a segment with rhythm and came up with suitable abhinaya to every beat.

Maharaj appealed to the audience to take classical arts ahead by training their children.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/p4cw78/article30460002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03frAjoyandPanditBirjuMaharajjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/when-the-maestros-met/article30460003.ece
329,2020/01/02,Har Har Gange — a river’s story in songs,"As the cool morning air signalled Margazhi, we entered Rasika Ranjani Sabha to hear Subramanian Chidambaran narrating the story of the Ganga that left one with the sacred feeling of having taken a dip in its waters. ‘Har Har Gange,’ a musical narrative presented by Mumbai’s Shravanam, attempted to unravel the connection between music and storytelling.

Narrator Subramanian Chidambaran, vocalists Sidhi Krishnamoorthy and Kanchana Manyam, who were clad in red and white Bengal-style saris, and the accompanists offered a refreshing performance with their sincere and scholasticapproach.

Chidambaran’s references to Adi Sankara’s verses, the Ramayana, and Vedas elevated the programme. Another interesting moment was the rendering of Muthuswamy Dikshitar’s composition ‘Gange Mam Pahi’ (Jenjhuti). There were also some verses composed by the narrator.

The narrative that began with the song ‘Har Har Gange,’ focused on the origin of the river, its course and the state it is in today. “When Vishnu reveals himself as Trivikrama, the Lord places his feet on the heavens. Brahma pours water from the kamandalu on the Lord’s feet, and this water flows as Akasha Ganga,” said Chidambaran.

Bageeratha’s penance

Bageeratha through his penance tries to bring Ganga down to wash away the sins of his ancestors, but since its force would split the earth, he decides that none other than Siva would be able to take Ganga on to his head. And that is how the river rests in Siva’s Jatamandala. A song by Appayya Dikshitar illustrated this.

Bageeratha does penance again to make the Ganga flow on earth. As she flows down to earth, the fishermen treat her as a mother and a daughter as seen in the folk song ‘Shivuni Sirasupaini.’ She flows through the Himalayas turning into many streams. So the story continues until she flows to the Netherworld and washes the ashes of Bageeratha’s ancestors, who get satgati.

There are several references to the Ganga in literature, folklore and music. The relationship of Kartikeya with Ganga comes through in the song ‘Kartikeya Gangeya Gowri Tanaya.’ That Ganga reaches Kasi finds reference in the piece ‘Ma Ganga Kashi Padhari.’ Folklore portrays Gowri and Ganga as the two wives of Siva. Adi Sankara in Soundarya Lahari paints the different moods of Amba, and mentions Gowri’s anger at Ganga. Another song refers to her as the flow of Knowledge, Bhakti and Shraddha. The reverence attributed to drinking even one drop from the holy Ganga comes through in the words ‘Ganga jalalava Kanikapita’ in Adi Sankara’s ‘Bhaja Govindam.’

A visual on the screen showed the polluted state of the Ganga today leading to the song ‘Ganga behti ho kyun,’ by Bhupen Hazarika, its beautiful lyrics decrying the state of the Ganga today. A beautiful visual of aarti on the banks of the river was followed by the rendering of the songs ‘Patitodharini Gange’ and ‘Mangalam Bhagavati Ganga.’",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/6z19gi/article30459957.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03frHarHarGange3jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/har-har-gange-a-rivers-story-in-songs/article30459958.ece
330,2020/01/02,What 2020 has in store from Chennai’s indie musicians,"They might be just a couple of tracks old, but they are turning heads in the city already, making their presence felt with constant gigs and taking open mics by storm. Music lovers in Chennai have a lot of talent to look forward to in 2020. Here are three that we have our eye on.

Tabby and Sanjai

“If your dreams came to life

Everything you ever wanted

Would you be satisfied?

Would it suffice?”

Like their track ‘Oceans’, most of Tabitha Kagoo and Sanjai Shine’s music is deeply introspective. Relationships, ambition, loss and grief... no subject is too uncomfortable for them to explore, to turn into something beautifully soft and haunting. Tabitha, a teacher for children with special needs, and Sanjai, who scripts films for the visually-challenged, have been an acoustic duo since 2017, but started creating their own music only last year. Their first track, ‘Pale Blue Flower of the Ocean’ was about telling someone you love that you miss them — a far cry from the song that got picked for IndiEarth’s Indie100 album in 2019. Set to be released in 2020, the track is about “a very exhausting relationship. You are tired of yourself and of the other person... You are drained but you’re in love at the same time,” explains Tabitha.

So clearly, each song is different, dealing with topics as diverse as Nature and death; songs to hum along and songs to grieve with. “We have about seven or eight tracks written, and are in the process of recording them,” says Sanjai, adding that the duo hopes to have its first extended play (EP) out this year.

“Our songwriting involves a lot of vulnerability. With most of our songs, we let it grow; we let our experiences touch it and go back. There’s no pressure, no rush.”

Nitika Kurian

“Thanks to you I always feel like you’re never enough

Thanks to you I don’t fear the idea of love

Thanks to you I never thought I would be this strong

I’m rising up.”

Her début track ‘Phoenix’ came out in August last year, and by December, had been streamed 40,000 times in 79 countries.

Her second track ‘Blue’, which architecture student Nitika Kurian is planning to release in March, is all about the sea. “I have moved a lot of places, from Goa to Puducherry to Chennai. Somehow, everywhere I have been, I have been surrounded by the sea,” she says. Naturally, her childhood is peppered with memories of water, from being soothed by the sound of waves at bedtime to just sitting on the shore and letting the water come up and “hug” her. Such is her love for the blue that after she wrote this song, she went back home to Goa and sang it to the sea. Yes, she is aware that it seems a little weird.

Nitika’s fans might have more than just a new track to look forward to this year; more, even, than her quirky spoof videos like the ‘Girls Like You’ parody about strict college dress codes that garnered thousands of views on Instagram. Her EP, featuring nine to 10 songs, including some she wrote as a child, is also in the works. “I want to start with the first song that I wrote, back when I was 11 years old,” she says. So the subject matters will clearly be diverse, and she isn’t committed to a particular genre either. Here’s hoping we get to hear it soon.

Joint By The Sea

“I can feel the world around me

Untied from the greed and all the sound

I can smell the earth and it has rained

Abundance in the green, I’m in my dream...”

A lucid dream is one where you are well aware of the fact that you are dreaming. Those who have had lucid dreams do not forget them easily; it is a surreal experience, one that vocalist Gheshna, guitarist Vajahath and percussionist Jeric have in common. In fact, they wrote their first song about it.

There is something about the track, with its swaying tempos and dreamy tones, that strikes a chord. It is the only original single that the trio (with Karthik joining in on the cajones from time to time) has been performing for a while, but it is enough to have earned them a following. Now, Joint By The Sea has at least three or four songs in the pipeline, and will be coming out with the maiden EP this year. They won’t all sound dreamy and trippy, however: the band is playing with Tamil folk, a mix of Afro and jazz, and even a lullaby, Vajahath informs us.

331,2020/01/02,Ashwath Narayanan’s lucid enunciation of ragas,"Of course, talent is inborn. However, Ashwath Narayanan has discovered it at a young age and nurtured it too. And his well-attended morning concert proved his creative genius. The purity of music, its scope and range and his ability to hold the attention of his audience were impressive.

Ashwath could invest Arunachala Kavirayar’s ‘Yarendru Raghavanai’ (Yadukula Khambodi) with grace and colour. The context of the song in Rama Nataka is significant. When Rama goes after the golden deer, Sita and Lakshmana hear Rama’s cry for help. Sita asks Lakshmana to rush to Rama’s rescue. At this moment, Lakshmana asks Sita, ‘Oh, Mother, who do you think Rama is?’ And he goes on to describe the omnipotent power of Rama. With his resonant voice, Ashwath emotionally brought out its very soul, creating an atmosphere of absolute devotion.

The centrepiece of the concert was ‘Nidhi Chala Sukhama’ of Saint Tyagaraja. The Kalyani alapana was handled with imagination, style, lucid phrases and rendered in the true spirit of the kriti.

On the violin, R. Raghul, disciple of M. Chandrasekharan, while staying within the contours of Ashwath’s delineation, displayed his individuality and ingenuity. Extensive niraval and all-embracing swaras were at ‘Mamata Bandhana Yuta.’

The thani by Arun Prakash (mridangam), disciple of M.N. Kandaswamy, and N. Guruprasad (ghatam), who learnt the art from his father Nagaraja Rao and later from T.H. Vinayakram, was as eloquent as it was educative. Arun Prakash commenced the proceedings in the slow pace Tisra nadai in Misra Chapu. He reminds one of the subtleties of the inimitable Pazhani style, in nourishing the keerthanas.

Ashwath’s Atana was characteristic of the KVN bani. No wonder, as he had his tutelage under him and then from Padma Narayanaswamy. In Tyagaraja’s ‘Bala kanakamaya,’ he presented wide-ranging niraval and swaras at ‘Rara Devadi Deva.’ Raghul’s response had exciting inputs in the form of notes in pure classical genre.

Ashwath’s two-hour concert began with the Mohanam varnam, with swaraprasthara at ‘Sannuthanga,’ followed by ‘Rara Mayinti’ (Tyagaraja-Asaveri), with kalpanaswaras at the Pallavi. Similarly, for ‘Samajavaragamana’ (Hindolam) too, Ashwath chose to render swaraprastaras at the Pallavi.

He wound up the concert with a Behag Virutham followed by the Tiruppavai, ‘Oruththi Maganai Pirandhu’ and the popular Paras Tillana of Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/f53te0/article30459908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRASHWATHNARAYANANCARNATICVOCAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ashwath-narayanans-lucid-enunciation-of-ragas/article30459909.ece
332,2020/01/02,Sowmya proves her musical wisdom,"S. Sowmya’s constant quest to explore and bring out the traditional facets of classical music was once again evident in her concert. She made confident statements through her selection of ragas and kritis .

She began with Thodi varnam ‘Era napai’ with a few rounds of swaras and followed it up with ‘Mariyadagadayya’ of Tyagaraja in raga Bhairavam which one hears rarely on concert platforms. The commendable part was the swara trail on ‘Tanavaru lanyunave’.

An exhaustive and erudite Khambodi alapana came up next. The raga was presented in all its majesty. Sowmya negotiated the beautiful segments of the raga in lower, middle and upper octaves. There couldn’t have been a better choice than ‘Evarimata’ of Tyagaraja to match the magnificent alapana. In place of the customary ‘Bhakta paradhina,’ Sowmya chose ‘Shakti gala mahadevudu’ for niraval and swaras. But she went in for a brief swarakalpana. The focus was more on the raga, kriti presentation and niraval.

Her next was Husseni raga exposition. The raga carries a slight forlorn tenor and it came through perfectly in Sowmya’s approach. Matching the mood, it was Arunachala Kavi’s ‘Eppadi manam’ which brought forth the anguish of Sita in the Rama Nataka kritis. Moving into a brisk phase, Sowmya rendered‘Brova barama’ in Bahudari . The pallavi came with rapid-fire swaras, bringing to the fore the brightest shades of Bahudari.

It was time for RTP, Sowmya, as expected, used her musical insight to showcase rare ragas. So she familiarised the audience with a raga named Padi. She said it is an ancient raga dating to the time of Annamacharya. Muthuswami Dikshitar had composed a Trithiya Vibhakti kriti ‘Sriguruna palitosmi’ in it. A derivative of Melakarta raga Mayamalavagowla, she mentioned that her guru, the legendary Dr. S. Ramanathan, had sung RTP in this raga. Sowmya presented a ragam and pallavi in Padi. Not every raga offers scope for the musician to expand it in detail; it is the knowledge, comprehension and ingenuity of the artiste and the manner in which it is presented play a major role in making the listeners enjoy.

Sowmya proved that she is a musician who can identify and presented the best of the intricate aspects of every raga and composition. The exquisite RTP went as ‘Paadi mukti pera vendum, iraiyai, guruvai, isayai’. There was neither an overstatement nor an underplay. It showcased the extent to which the raga can be developed and sung. R.K.Shriramkumar at every step matched Sowmya’s vision perfectly. His answers in Khambodi, Bahudari and Padi were excellent.

Neyveli R. Narayanan and Chandrasekara Sharma on the mridangam and ghatam need to be credited for their support. The thani avartanam was a compact treat of rhythmic sallies. Keeping with the tradition, Sowmya concluded her concert with a padam and javali.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gsna2b/article30459871.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRSOWMYA-PIC,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sowmya-proves-her-musical-wisdom/article30459872.ece
333,2020/01/02,Krishna Ramarathinam — Finding his roots in music,"It is evidently a lifetime’s mission of the Sydney-based musician to propagate the legacy of Sathur A.G. (Angarai Ganesan) Subramaniam, his paternal grandfather. The compositions featured at a recent recital for Kedaram, at the Raga Sudha Hall, Chennai, were, each one of them, favourites with Subramaniam, asserts Krishna Ramarathinam with pride.

Moreover, in a sign of the man’s growing recognition since the 1940s, says Krishna, Sathur came to be prefixed to his grandfather’s name after the popularity of his recitals in the town. A string of performances in Chennai, besides the above venue close to Nageshwara Rao Park, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, are part of the youngster’s decade-long sojourn during the Margazhi music festivities.

When this scribe caught up with him one evening, amid the crowded concert schedule, the computing and management graduate recounted at length his musical trajectory of more than two decades. His formal initiation into Carnatic music at the age of five was by Dr. M.S. Ramanathan, the disciple of Palghat K.V. Narayanaswamy. But prior to that exposure, Krishna began a more casual acquaintance with the Carnatic musical scales as a toddler, as he invariably tagged along with his mother to her regular classes in Sydney, his parents migrated to Australia when he was barely three years.

By the mid teens however, the path ahead seemed increasingly more definitive, thanks to some rigorous learning from Dr. Ramanathan. His frequent trips to Chennai also enabled him to hone his skills with V. Subramaniam, a student of Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer. Krishna’s tutelage continues under vocalist A.S. Murali, violin maestro Dr. M. Chandrasekharan and the mridangam vidwan Melakaveri K. Balaji.

Over coffee that same evening, not far from the home of his annual India visits in West Mambalam, Krishna also spoke about meeting Mahati, his violinist-wife from New Zealand. Yuva Sangeetha Margam is the offshoot of the couple’s collaborative efforts with fellow-artistes in Sydney. A memory to cherish, says Krishna, was the 2018 Radel Mid-year concert at the Music Academy. A maiden appearance at the Cleaveland Tyagaraja music festival is an aspiration he has been working towards.

Krishna’s recital for Kedaram was notable for his lively presentation of the opening kriti: Purandaradasa’s ‘Jaya jaya jaya janaki kantha,’ in ragam Natta. His choice of Dikshitar’s navagraha kritis, ‘angarakam asrayamyaham,’ in ragam Surati, was perhaps no surprise, given that the performance was on a Tuesday. The rest of the recital focused on the compositions of Tyagaraja — ‘Sangeetha nyanamu’,’ in Dhanyasi and ‘Chala kallaladukonna,’ in Arabhi and ‘E tavunara,’ in Kalyani. V.V. Ravi on the violin, Srimushnam Raja Rao on the mridangam and V. Suresh on the ghatam were the accompanists for the performance.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/5d7xdx/article30459748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRKRISHNARAMARATHNAMVOCAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/krishna-ramarathinam-finding-his-roots-in-music/article30459749.ece
334,2020/01/02,Bhavya Hari: Need to add more energy,"Bhavya Hari’s sweet voice and her soulful rendition of the compositions are sure to earn her brownie points. Nevertheless, her main raga Khambodi would have glowed better had she approached the exercise with a stronger touch and majesty, as the raga demands it, to create a significant impact. Each raga carries an image and identity and that needs to be recognised by the artiste and treat them with extra care. Bhavya’s delivery of Tyagaraja’s kriti ‘O Rangasayee’ carried on with enough impetus. Her niraval on ‘Bhooloka vaikuntam’ and the string of swaras with daivatam as the landing note elevated the overall image of the presentation.

Sumptuous treat

In the earlier segment Bhavya Hari elucidated raga Ramapriya for Patnam Subramania Iyer’s popular ‘Korina varamu.’ The competent raga essay and the extrapolation on ‘Rama manohari’ were systematic. These apart, her concert package also featured the standard Thodi raga varnam ‘Era napai’, Gopalakrishna Bharati’s ‘Kanaka sabhapathikku’ in Atana, Tyagaraja’s ‘Nadadina’ in Janaranjani with a brief raga sketch, Papanasam Sivan’s ‘Matha innum vaada’ in Sriranjani where Bhavya’s bhava-laden rendition was explicit and a brisk Thiruppugazh in Nalinakanti. The last item was the lively thillana of Lalgudi Jayaraman in Rageshree.

Vaibhav Ramani on the violin responded with perfection in ragas and swaras. Nochur Nagaraj and Sivaramakrishnan on the mridangam and the ghatam respectively were quite modest in their playing.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/2zoahw/article30459719.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27FRBHAVYAHARI2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/bhavya-hari-need-to-add-more-energy/article30459720.ece
335,2020/01/02,Ranjani Sivakumar put her training to good use,"A young and talented musician, Ranjani Sivakumar Sidda Reddy is blessed with a voice that has a rich timbre. Her music has a poise and finish that comes from a technique acquired from hertraining under seniors such as Seetha Narayanan and Pantula Rama.

Commencing with the Kedaragowla varnam, Ranjani presented a good package in her afternoon concert.

Patnam Subramania Iyer’s ‘Manasu karugademi’ (Hamsadhwani-Rupakam) was preceded by a melodic Virutham, ‘Sada Balaroopaapi.’ While Ranjani rendered niraval at Charanam, ‘Aramara Etiki,’ the swaraprasthara was at the Pallavi. In the latter, the tisra nadai passages were brilliant.

In the Varali alapana, Ranga Priya, disciple of Embar Knnan, on the violin offered an outstanding response.

Ranjani rendered Syama Sastri’s ‘Kamakshi Bangaru’ (Misra Chapu) with niraval and swarams at ‘Thamasamela Rave.’ Her sancharas in the upper octave brought out the essence of the raga.

Extensive alapana

After Kalyani Varadarajan’s ‘Aparna Parvathi’ (Nalinakanthi – Rupakam), Ranjani rendered an extensive and majestic Kharaharapriya alapana. She commenced Tyagaraja’s ‘Soumitri Bhagyame Bhagyamu,’ at the Anupallavi, ‘Chitra Ratnamaya’.

The niraval and swaraprasthara at the Charanam, ‘Baguga vinta’ inducted the tempo of the Alathur school, which enhanced the appeal of the concert. In the thani, Sunaadha Krishna, a student of Tiruchi Kumar and Mannargudi Easwaran, played some lovely tisra phrases.

After the Javali ‘Mutta vaddura’ (Saveri – Desadi talam), Ranjani concluded her recital with Mysore Vasudevachar’s ‘Janaki Manoharam Bhajeham’ in Maund and a Surutti Thiruppugazh ‘Karanamathaaka Vanthu.’",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/jc6p17/article30459538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRRANJANISIVAKUMARCARNATICVOCAL,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/ranjani-sivakumar-put-her-training-to-good-use/article30459539.ece
336,2020/01/02,‘NRI musicians are cultural ambassadors’,"The role of NRIs in propagating culture was stressed at the inauguration of Trinity Arts Festival. The three-day event held at Asthika Samajam, Venus Colony, Alwarpet, showcased young talent from abroad. It was commendable that these Indians nurtured music by investing time to learn and hone their skills even as they were engaged with their main pursuits such as education and career, observed N. Ravi, Publisher, The Hindu, presiding over the event. “It will be appropriate to call them cultural ambassadors,” he said.

In his Anugraḥa Bhashanam, Sri Sankara Vijayendra Saraswati looked back seven decades to the pre-Independence period. He said his Paramaguru, Sri Chandrasekharendra Saraswati, had urged artistes to become cultural ambassadors for the nation. As an emerging independent nation, India needed to build bridges with other countries and arts, especially music, lent itself as an ideal tool, he thought and encouraged everyone to focus on the aspects positive and common, which could unite people instead of harping on differences.

Sastriya Sangitam was to Music what Panini’s grammar (Sanskrit) was to languages, said the Acharya. It served as the foundation for all streams of music, he added. Sanskrit is taught and learnt with dedication and discipline, which is true of Carnatic music too. “Just as learning Sanskrit enables one to learn foreign languages, well-trained Carnatic musicians can master the music and instruments of other countries,” he said. This was because the training was based on excellence with the right orientation.

A mind soaked in music merges with the divine like a river, which merges with the ocean. The music Trinity — Tyagaraja, Muthuswamy Dikshitar and Syama Sastri — have proved this. The Acharya emphasised the need for efforts to revive the link between music, yoga, and Pranayama which are closely allied to the body, mind, and intelligence. “Carnatic music helps to increase the attention span, memory and quick recall. It is a medium, which leads one in a divine path even as it entertains,” he said.

In this context, the Sankaracharya lauded the music sabhas, which featured concerts on a regular basis. He appealed to them to open more slots for NRI artistes. Even abroad, music festivals are held at several places, to connect people and propagate Carnatic music, he pointed out.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/t7r4i5/article30459505.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FRTRINITY,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/nri-musicians-are-cultural-ambassadors/article30459506.ece
337,2020/01/02,Music has a healing quality: L Subramaniam,"To be born amidst a family of artistes is truly a blessing. It comes with great privilege that needs to be checked responsibly. To use that privilege in ways that would bind different traditions and cultures, to further the arts and make it accessible to a larger audience is the task of any true artiste. L Subramaniam’s musical genius needs no introduction. As an artiste, he has relentlessly pursued his own music as well as World music in many ways. Entering into its 29th edition is the Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival (LGMF), organised in the memory of his father, mentor, guru and the legendary violinist Prof. V. Lakshminarayana. Through the years, the festival has brought in artistes from all continents, consistently experimenting and never restricting itself to what is traditional.

Prof. V. Lakshminarayna

Says Subramaniam, “Music in itself is an extremely powerful medium to communicate, without the barrier of language. It also projects our culture, our philosophies, our ways of thinking, rituals while interacting with different people and artistes. It brings in peace and harmony in a different way. But I think involving other global players in this takes it to the other side of the coin. To collaborate with your own people is one thing, but global collaborations bring in brilliant inputs, expressions and emotions. The total impact leads to understanding of different cultures from our side, because from our side, unless someone is extraordinarily artistic or is financially capable, she/he cannot go to different countries. We try to bring them to the doorstep, so that they are exposed to international arts, including instruments which have never been brought to India before.”

It is his father who largely left an imprint on the young boy. “After his passing in 1990, my sister Viji and I wanted to do something in his memory,” says Subramaniam. Lakshminarayana was not simply a violinist. His grandeur also lies in the fact that he put the violin on the global stage as a solo instrument. The festival began in Chennai’s Madras Music Academy, where TT Vasu, a close friend of Subramaniam’s was the President. It was only a matter of time before Subramaniam’s music, along with the festival met legendary artistes. His collaborations and recordings with icons like Stephane Grapelli, Yehudi Menuhin, Herbie Hancock, Jean-Pierre Rampal, Joe Sample, Staneley Clarke, George Duke, Larry Coryell, Tony Williams and Maynard Fergusson only added to the opulence of the festival. The festival does not stop with concerts and performances, but foundation courses with Subramaniam Foundation and the Subramaniam Academy of Performing Arts (SaPa) wherein the students are introduced to different schools and the artistes who conduct workshops. “We focus a lot on practice. You cannot read 200 books on how to sing a raga, you have to sing it and then go deeper. It is important in our theory to learn other cultures as well, learn about Western music, which is very strong in harmony. It is also important to be familiar with forms like Latin American music, African and Indonesian music. The structure in itself is very interdisciplinary,” adds Subramaniam.

Ace singer and his wife Kavita Krishnamurthy has played a pivotal role in inspiring his music and creative faculties. He remembers when they first met for a project called Global Fusion Album for Warner Brothers in Bangalore. “For the album, I had representation from five different continents. I was living in the US at that time, which is when a friend suggested that I listen to the tapes of a few singers whom I could use for the recording. I heard her voice; it had a bigger range, different emotions and a kind of depth. Kavita had never done any fusion work at that time, when I approached her. She came and did the first piece, some time in 1999. It was a huge success musically.”

Musical tribute

Kavita Krishnamoorthy

For its 29th edition LGMF is also celebrating the 150th birth year of Mahatma Gandhi. The festival starts in Delhi with a musical tribute by Subramaniam and Kavita featuring Symphony Orchestra of Castile and Leon from Spain, followed by Hyderabad and Pune. The concert at Hyderabad will also see performances by his children’s band ‘SubraMania’ and his granddaughter Mahati. The performances will feature ‘Spring Rhapsody’, one of Subramaniam’s own compositions published some time back alongside the bhajans ‘Raghupati Raghav’and ‘Vaishnav Jan Toh’ followed by a composition which is a tribute to Purandara Dasa.

“We have grown so much as a family of artistes. Ever since, we have been trying and experimenting with many things. Most of the compositions I do for orchestras are raga based contemporary compositions. They have branded it as fusion whereas what I was doing for orchestra was based on Western harmony and raga harmony. Music is like an ocean and I want to explore as much as possible. It makes me travel both literally and virtually. It has a healing quality wherein everyone finds something,” he says.

The LGMF book was just released, too, recording and documenting up to 25 years of the festival. The LGMF awards this year will be conferred upon violinist TN Krishnan and mridangist Chandramouli. As to his winter concert in Delhi, Subramaniam chuckles, “I am looking forward to the concert but not to the cold.”

The Lakshminarayana Global Music Festival 2020 will be held on 4th January at 6 p.m. at Siri Fort Auditorium, New Delhi.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/h8ox1s/article30459442.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dr-L-Subramaniam,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/music-has-a-healing-quality-l-subramaniam/article30459447.ece
338,2020/01/02,Metro ridership touches all-time-high,"Kochi Metro ferried a total of 10.40 lakh commuters during the 12-day Christmas-New Year season, with ridership touching an all-time-high of 1.25 lakh on Wednesday.

A total of 90,332 passengers travelled on December 28 and 84,957 on December 31. “The increase in ridership which we witnessed during the festivities is unprecedented. People are relying on the metro for shopping and daily commute. This is a healthy sign,” said Alkesh Kumar Sharma, MD of KMRL.

Public Transport Day

Meanwhile, KMRL has decided to declare one day in a week as ‘Public Transport Day’. This year, Friday will be observed as Public Transport Day. All employees of the metro agency, including Kudumbashree personnel who are deployed in metro stations, will commute to and from office using either public transport or non-motorised transport.

“The decision was taken in continuation of our aspirations to undertake initiatives that enhance the quality of life in Kochi city. Every citizen should use non-motorised or public transport at least a day every week. Being a transit company, it is apt that employees of KMRL rely on public transport,” said Mr. Sharma.

“Through the initiative, we are making a paradigm shift in mobility good practices, thus minimising the environmental impact as well as traffic congestion associated with the use of personalised vehicles like cars,” he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/metro-ridership-touches-all-time-high/article30462627.ece
339,2020/01/02,"Now, excise to use dummies of drugs to create awareness","The Excise Department is all set to roll out a novel awareness module in the district whereby dummies of narcotic and psychotropic substances will be used to familiarise parents and teachers to help them detect drugs found in possession of youngsters.

The department opted for a such a programme realising that young substance abusers were often exploiting the ignorance of parents and teachers to avoid detection of drugs.

“The programme will be rolled out this month itself in awareness campaigns centred around schools to help parents and teachers to identify such contraband by sight. We can use only dummies since even we are restricted from keeping custody of seized narcotic and psychotropic substances. We also plan to use audio-video materials for the purpose,” said A.S. Ranjith, Deputy Excise Commissioner, Ernakulam.

The premium narcotic drug like LSD which comes in the form of stamps is passed off as normal stamps and prescription drugs like nitrazepam for insomnia and anxiety are constantly abused for high as normal vitamin tablets or pills for head ache or fever.

“We also aim at alerting parents and teachers to see through the ploys used by youngsters to hide such contraband. For instance, ganja has been found to be hidden beneath the belts and even inside socks. Materials that come in constant contact with stuff like ganja exudes an odour, which should alert parents instantly,” said Mr. Ranjith.

Early detection

Noted psychiatrist C.J. John said that the new module could indeed prove vital in early detection as the ignorance of parents about drugs was one of the reasons why substance abuse go unnoticed in initial stages.

He recalled a recent incident in which the parents of a 15-year-old boy approached him with a dried plant that they recovered accidentally from their son’s room and which eventually proved to be cannabis, dealing them a rude blow.

“How to validate whether the substances used by their children and which they stumble up on accidentally are drugs or not should also be part of the module. They should know whom to approach for the matter. If the substances turn out to be drugs then how to handle the situation should also be part of the campaign,” Dr. John said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/now-excise-to-use-dummies-of-drugs-to-create-awareness/article30462561.ece
340,2020/01/02,IOAGL targets one lakh piped gas connections this year,"Indian Oil-Adani Gas Pvt Ltd (IOAGL) targets establishing infrastructure to provide one lakh piped domestic natural gas connections by the end of 2020. The target has been set for the city and its suburbs, where the joint venture company is laying pipelines both in the Kochi Corporation and neighbouring municipalities.

The New Year and the target of one lakh connections will mark a big breakthrough for the piped gas provider, which has been pushing hard to achieve a breakthrough over the last five years. IOAGL has so far provided about 1,200 domestic connections in six divisions of the Kalamassery Municipality.

IOAGL deputy general manager Ajay Pillai told The Hindu on Thursday that piped gas infrastructure was expected to be ready in the municipalities of Aluva, Thripunithura, Eloor, Maradu, Kalamassery and Thrikkakara as well as in 15 wards of the Kochi Corporation. He was speaking after piped gas connection was released for the first home in the Thrikkakara Municipality.

K.P. Padmavathi of Vadakkemaliekkal house in Ward 26 of the municipality was all smiles after she lighted her gas stove with natural gas as fuel for the first time to boil a pot of milk. Flanked by Assistant Collector M.S. Madhavikutty and Municipal Chairperson Usha Praveen, she said it was quite an experience.

Ms. Madhavikutty said Kerala towns were lucky to take advantage of a less polluting fuel like natural gas.

Councillor P.S. Sajal said he was extremely happy with the first gas connection being provided in his division as he was among the first members to take a big interest in getting the infrastructure works going as soon as it was announced in the municipal council.

Mr. Pillai said that about 1,000 gas connections were expected to be provided by the end of January in the municipality. Works are on in divisions 18, 23, 24, 25, 26 and 30, he said.

IOAGL had already received 40,000 applications registered for fresh connections in these municipalities as well as the corporation. The registrations from the corporation area account for 20,000. Mr. Pillai expressed confidence that pipe-laying work in the corporation area would take off. He also said that there was no resistance from the people. In fact, people were only too eager to have the new fuel, he added.

The IOAGL official said that there should be no worries for the civic authorities about the company’s road restoration works after the pipelines are laid. The Public Works Department has been satisfied with the restoration works, he said.

The Ernakulam geographical area has a population of around 34 lakh living in around 8.5 lakh households. If about 50% of these households get piped gas connections it would amount to about 4 lakh to 4.5 lakh connections, said Mr. Pillai.

Meanwhile, works in Thrissur and Palakkad districts are about to take off, said Mr. Pillai. The first connections in Thrissur could be achieved early this year, he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/dde3qd/article30462441.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KIPIPEDGASCONNECTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ioagl-targets-one-lakh-piped-gas-connections-this-year/article30462442.ece
341,2020/01/02,"Cheriya Kadamakkudy: From silence, an isle learns to speak","On a quiet Sunday morning, the residents of Cheriya Kadamakkudy are engaged in various chores, a majority of them having returned home from Mass at a tiny church on the isle. A few women bring out buckets of clothes to be washed by the riverside. A handful of men repair their fishing nets, while a few others are working in fields where alternate cycles of pokkali and shrimp cultivation are undertaken. The only concrete stretch of road on the isle runs along a straight line, behind which are perched residents’ houses and the only church in a neat row.

As she hangs her freshly washed laundry on the exposed iron bars of railings of the dilapidated old bridge connecting the isle to the nearby island of Pizhala, Nimmy George recollects how the islanders’ lives have changed over the last five years.

Muppathadam project

When she came to the isle 21 years ago as a young bride, Nimmy had to quietly tuck away all hopes of going to work. “Water was supplied to the island only once a week, through tankers atop jhankars. At least one person from a house had to stay back to collect water,” says she. But that changed with the Muppathadam project that augmented water supply to the regions of Kadamakkudy and Varapuzha. Domestic connections were issued, and they turned functional four years ago, ending years of “utter misery”. Today, Nimmy goes for a job on the mainland, not having to constantly worry if there will be enough water for her family.

Pokkali farming

Life has changed too for 63-year-old Paskel P.A., a farmer engaged in Pokkali rice cultivation. He remembers a time when people from near and far would come to Cheriya Kadamakkudy to take part in the harvest. “They would stay in homes here for nearly 20 days to harvest the crop. It was a festival of sorts,” he says. Though Pokkali farms are still active on the isle, the cultivation has declined in the last 15 years, adds the farmer. Changes in weather conditions, unavailability of labour, and the difficulties involved in mechanizing Pokkali cultivation have contributed to the waning enthusiasm. This year, with the rains playing truant early on, Paskel could not sow Pokkali seeds and hence did not take up cultivation for the season. Several others who sowed seeds lost all their crops, he says, adding that the farmers are now pinning their hopes on the alternate prawn farming season.

Metallic bridge

In 2018 too, farmers and fish workers on the isle were hit hard by the mid-August floods. But the floods brought into focus the commuting woes of Cheriya Kadamakkudy, which led to the Navy ‘adopting’ the island. In last September, the Navy opened to traffic a steel-arch bridge that connects the island of 60 families to Pizhala. The bridge, with a guaranteed lifespan of five years and the capacity to ferry vehicles of maximum three tonnes, has brought respite, albeit temporary, to the islanders, who earlier had to walk around 2 km to the nearest point of available commute. But, even today, the islanders are not free of the precarious jhankar ride from Pizhala or the long walk along the under-construction Moolampilly bridge to access the mainland.

The Navy also constructed three houses for the flood-hit on the island, besides installing a reverse osmosis plant for ensuring safe drinking water. But the plant has been rendered unusable due to the inadequate power supply to the island. “Power supply to the island keeps fluctuating and is unreliable,” says Ajeesh Joseph, a resident. The Navy was also willing to construct an anganwadi on the island, but the plan, he says, was opposed by the Kadamakkudy panchayat, citing Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) norms.

‘More water than land’

Cheriya Kadamakkudy ward member Cerine Xavier terms it irrational to impose CRZ norms on a region such as Kadamakkudy, where “there is more water than land.” In Cheriya Kadamakkudy too, there are more farmlands than residential plots, and the island is too narrow, surrounded by water on all sides. “Most people here are fish workers and depend on the backwaters for their livelihood. They cannot hence move to other places. They have inherited small portions of land near the waterfront here, and it is unfair to deny them the right to build houses on those plots,” he says, while demanding exemption from all CRZ rules for the region. The strict enforcement of these norms has denied Cheriya Kadamakkudy any chance of development, says the ward member.

Located nearly 2 km from Pizhala, which grapples with its own set of commuting woes, including the incomplete bridge connecting it to Moolamppilly, Cheriya Kadamakkudy has remained in isolation for as long as the islanders can remember. Ajeesh says it has been a constant struggle for the islanders, always having to fight for their basic needs. Fed up with years of neglect, in 2015, the islanders collectively decided to find their voice, and put up “one of their own” as a candidate for the local body polls. In a mandate that surprised the islanders, Cerine, a resident of Cheriya Kadamakkudy, won the election, and now represents Ward 10, which also comprises parts of Pizhala.

Road widening

The residents say many a time they have had to take matters into their own hands. Tired of waiting for the authorities to widen the muddy road on the Pizhala side of the bridge, the residents pooled in funds and built a retaining wall and widened nearly 0.5 km of the stretch. Though the road turns muddy during rains, they hope it may someday pave the way for development. “If anything has ever been done for Cheriya Kadamakkudy, it has been done so by the islanders themselves,” says Cerine.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/m6eplc/article30455284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02-KI-AKADAMAKUDY-2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/from-silence-an-isle-learns-to-speak/article30455289.ece
342,2020/01/02,"Not enough KWA hydrants, say water tanker owners","District Collector S. Suhas held a meeting with water tanker owners association here on Wednesday on Operation Pure Water initiative.

It was decided at the meeting that water meant for supply through tankers could be collected only from Kerala Water Authority hydrants, and operators were given 15 days to implement the order.

For the record, the Assembly Committee on Petitions had ordered that water tankers be colour-coded in accordance with a High Court directive, besides ensuring ethoxylated polyethiemine (EPI) coating inside the tanker. Moreover, each tanker has to be registered separately. Water tanker owners told the Collector that the KWA did not have enough hydrants to meet the requirements of the city.

The meeting discussed issues such as increasing the number of hydrants, separate registration of tankers supplying drinking water and those providing water for construction purposes, fixing the price of water, formation of a sub-committee for efficient supply of water, setting up hydrants at Maradu and Aluva plants for round-the-clock water supply, collection of water from public sector bodies like FACT, and obtaining permission to collect water from wells for construction purposes. The Collector ordered water tanker owners to ensure colour coding is in place. He also deployed a KWA official to handle the issues at the District Emergency Management Centre. Yet another meeting will be held on Friday.

343,2020/01/02,KWA gets flak for ‘failure’ to provide enough water,"The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) came under fire from representatives of residents associations, apartment owners, hotels, and hospitals here for its alleged failure to ensure adequate supply of water to consumers.

The users complained that they were forced to depend on private water tankers in view of the growing demand and the widening gap in supply from the authority.

“The authority should clarify whether its piped water supply will experience shortage when water is given for supply through water tankers. Already, the supply is erratic owing to distribution loss and numerous diversions,” said P. Rangadasa Prabhu, president of the Ernakulam District Residents Association Apex Council at a meeting convened to discuss initiatives under Operation Pure Water project at the collectorate.

Representatives of an apartment owners association at Edachira near Kakkanad said their application for enhancing water supply through the KWA line in accordance with the number of occupants had been pending before the authority for long. “The existing line remains inadequate even to meet our basic needs,” they complained.

The district administration had asked KWA officials to appoint a person specifically at the district office to address the concerns of the public. “Complaints pertaining to shortage of supply and capacity enhancements should be done in accordance with rules,” it had said. KWA officials maintained that they could only go by the rules when it came to providing new connections to apartments and other establishments. “Regular water supply will not be hit when water is provided to private tankers on a daily basis,” they said.

Representatives of various associations said no private tanker should be allowed to supply contaminated water. However, the administrators can consider stretching the deadline given to tanker owners to meet all the directives to January 10. A monitoring mechanism involving officials of various departments and enforcement agencies and the public should be launched to check such violations, they said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kwa-gets-flak-for-failure-to-provide-enough-water/article30455222.ece
344,2020/01/02,Residents in a fix as water tankers stay off the road,"Hundreds of Kochiites depending on private water tankers to meet their daily drinking water needs had a harrowing time on Wednesday as operators stayed away from the road in protest against the stand of the district administration that water can now be drawn only from the hydrants of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).

The flash strike was called under the aegis of the Ernakulam District Drinking Water Transporters Welfare Association. Several consumers were left clueless after private tanker owners informed them in the morning that they were facing water shortage owing to the district administration’s insistence that water could be drawn only from KWA sources.

The administration had warned of strict action against operators, maintaining that they were denying the right of the public to have quality water. Deputy Collector S. Shajahan told a meeting, which was attended by representatives of various apartments, hotels, and hospitals at the collectorate, that tanker owners’ claim that there was scarcity of water available for supply under the KWA was baseless. KWA officials had maintained that around 9.5 million litres of water was available under the 13 supply points of the authority in the district, and that it was adequate enough to meet the needs of users depending on private water tankers.

At its sitting held here on December 5, the Assembly Committee on Petitions had directed the administration that water should be drawn only from the supply points of the KWA after it was reported that a section of tankers was supplying contaminated water taken from illegal sources. The Hindu had reported on Sunday that four of the nine water samples collected from water tankers in the district had the presence of coliform bacteria, indicating faecal contamination.

Mr. Shajahan said private tankers refusing to operate may be seized to ensure uninterrupted water supply to the public. The directive that water should be collected from KWA sources is applicable only to drinking water supply. It is not applicable to water being used for industrial and construction purposes, he added.

The officer asked private tanker owners to complete the registration process with the Regional Transport Office, Ernakulam, as specified by the Assembly Committee without delay. Only those vehicles will be permitted to supply water in the district, he said.

Manoj K., Joint Regional Transport Officer, said only 12 of around 250 tankers had completed the registration process as on Tuesday.

Zakir Husain, president of the District Drinking Water Transporters Welfare Association, said there were only a few supply points available under the KWA in the district. The distribution point of the authority at Aluva lacks space to park water tankers. Moreover, the price of ₹60 charged by the authority for a kilolitre of water is high, he added. Representatives of the association said the district administration should permit them to draw water from private wells that had cleared the quality check test. However, the administration said it was not practical as hundreds of wells needed to be checked on a sustained basis to ensure quality.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/axat83/article30455183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ki01-KWA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/residents-in-a-fix-as-water-tankers-stay-off-the-road/article30455184.ece
345,2020/01/02,Corporation issues notices on revised property tax,"In a last-ditch attempt to replenish its fast emptying coffers, the Kochi Corporation has begun issuing notices to inform property owners of revised property tax rates.

Property tax rates were revised on the basis of plinth area estimates by the Government in 2013 but was left unimplemented across several municipalities in the State, according to an official from the corporation’s revenue section. A Government Order (GO) from 2016 asked local bodies to implement the revised rates with effect from that year.

Despite a GO from March 2019 requiring notices to be handed out by September that year, the corporation failed to do so. According to the order, property owners were to pay the revised tax amount retrospectively from 2016 onwards in five instalments within 10 months of receiving the notice — a deadline that passed in December 2019 without most property owners even receiving the notice. After having delayed implementation for years, the corporation has begun handing out notices with renewed energy only for the past two weeks, according to officials. A request to extend the deadline for payment has been submitted to the government, they said.

The civic body may have dithered about implementing the revised rates as per the deadline in September fearing an unfavourable outcome in the Ernakulam bypoll in October, said an Opposition councillor.

Too litte, too late?

Property tax revision may not be the manna the corporation wants it to be. Going by the revised rates, tax on residential buildings over 2,000 sq ft will be hiked by 25%, while commercial buildings will see an increase of up to 100%. As many as 3,15,035 buildings, mostly commercial, will now have to adhere to the new rates.

Since the revision will only apply to a small number of residential buildings with a large plinth area, it is unlikely to drain pockets in the city or contribute significantly to the corporation’s revenue, officials said. Besides, buildings constructed after the revision in 2013 were already being taxed with the revised slab.

The corporation last saw a tax revision on the basis of the annual rental value in 1997. Implementing the revised rates now will mostly affect older commercial buildings constructed between 1997 and 2000 when their annual rental value was low. Since the annual rental value within the corporation limits was always fairly high from the early 2000s onwards, recently constructed buildings are unlikely to feel the pinch.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corporation-issues-notices-on-revised-property-tax/article30455166.ece
346,2020/01/02,Kochi Corporation coffers in dire straits,"Despite plans in the current financial year’s budget to augment the Kochi Corporation’s revenue, little has been done.

The budget put forth a proposal to take up municipal bonds to fund development projects, an idea that still remains on paper. A councillor admitted that the municipal bond may have been included in the budget when the State Government suggested it earlier, but no homework was done to ensure it came through.

Besides, for a municipal bond backed by a Government security to materialise, the corporation’s credit rating should play a significant role, said M.B. Muraleedharan, member of the standing committee for finance.

As of 2017, the corporation had a credit rating of BBB (moderate credit risk) as assessed by a credit rating agency for Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) cities. The rating, estimated on the basis of the civic body’s assets and liabilities, is only a notch above the high risk of default category. The rating rationale report of the credit rating agency specified low overall tax collection efficiency (49%) as one of the reasons for the rating.

Apart from the Centre and State Governments funding for various projects, the corporation’s revenue largely comes from property tax amounting to around ₹101 crore for the 2019-20 financial year, including arrears. The civic body collects over ₹44 crore as profession tax and ₹6.12 crore as rent.

According to Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar, around 112 bills worth ₹28 crore were awaiting clearance from the Government, along with ₹75 crore to be reimbursed to the corporation for salary payments, but was delayed by the State’s treasury curbs.

The goods and services tax (GST) system denied local bodies the power to levy entertainment and advertisement tax, lowering income by close to ₹15 crore, Mr. Muraleedharan said.

Mr. Premakumar sees the implementation of property tax revision as an important step towards improving the civic body’s financial situation.

But the Opposition maintains that not enough was done in time to stave off loans, considering the large expenses to be borne by the civic body. The corporation is likely to soon take a loan of ₹10 crore to pay contractors, close on the heels of another ₹25 crore to pay the civic body share to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana beneficiaries. The council had earlier rejected a proposal to avail of a loan of ₹20 crore to complete the construction of the new corporation office. “Little has been done to increase income from rent or through bonds,” said K.J. Antony, Leader of the Opposition.

“The corporation requires ₹11 crore per month to keep the civic body running—₹7 crore for payment of salaries and the remaining for electricity, hiring machinery, petrol charges for corporation vehicles, and other expenses,” said C.K. Peter, councillor from Konthuruthy.

“Both loans and dues have increased. Some of the Plan Fund money has gone towards paying library cess and dues to the Kerala Water Authority. Besides, property tax assessments have not been completed properly, and sections of buildings have been left out of the estimates,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/4fx5vn/article30457064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tvki-hard-timesREV2col,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/corporation-coffers-in-dire-straits/article30455114.ece

348,2020/01/02,"Muslims take out massive rally, demand scrapping of CAA","Waving the national flag, thousands of Muslims, under the aegis of the coordination committee of Muslim organisations, took out a massive rally in Kochi demanding the scrapping of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

In his inaugural address, Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) State president Sayed Hyderali Shihab Thangal said Muslims of India, who had a history of valiantly taking part in the freedom struggle, would reject demands for proving their citizenship. Muslims have the legacy of Umer Khali who resorted to non-payment of tax as a mode of protest much before the nationalist freedom movement, he said.

“The Muslims of the country will declare that India belongs to all Indians. Every Indian who was born here has the freedom to live and die here. Those attempting to curtail freedom will fail miserably,” Thangal said.

The new legislation is aimed at denying citizenship to the Muslims of the country. The legislation goes against the secular traditions of the country and its pluralistic society. It is the realisation that after Muslims other sections too will be targeted that led to the countrywide protest against the legislation, he added.

Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar, general secretary of the All India Sunni Jamiyyathul Ulama, said the campaigns against the legislation led by the Chief Minister and others would be supported. “The legislation is an attempt to isolate Muslims and hence needs to be opposed. The government brought in a rule regarding Triple Talaq and made a big issue out of it. The community showed extreme restraint when the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict in the Babri Masjid case,” he recalled.

Mahal committees will organise meetings on the Constitution on January 26, said Congress leader T.H. Mustafa.

350,2020/01/02,Panchayat president quits as feud intensifies within Twenty20,"After being touted as a novel alternative governance model, Twenty20, a corporate-backed charity outfit that clinched power winning 17 of the 19 seats in Kizhakkambalam panchayat in suburban Ernakulam in the last local body polls, has now run into trouble with panchayat president K.V. Jacob putting in his papers on Wednesday.

Mr. Jacob chose to resign without waiting for the panchayat committee to take up the no-confidence motion backed by 14 members from Twenty20 and unleashed a scathing attack on Sabu M. Jacob, businessman and chief coordinator of Twenty20.

“The governance here is in violation of all established practices of administration in a democratic system because of which around ₹5 crore of government funds lapsed over the past three years. Mr. Sabu Jacob meddles in all matters related to governance and it is impossible to put up with his autocratic ways,” maintained Mr. Jacob who is set to address a press meet on Thursday.

While affirming that Mr. Sabu Jacob and Twenty20 had done many good things, Mr. Jacob alleged that it was no ground to operate arbitrarily and dictate terms in a democratic system. He alleged that contracts for road development executed without proper agreements were lagging behind, putting officials to hardships.

Mr. Sabu Jacob, however, denied the allegations as politically-motivated, wondering how Mr. Jacob who had been part of Twenty20 since its inception in 2012, had suddenly woken up to alleged autocratic ways.

Levelling corruption allegations against the president, Mr. Sabu Jacob said that the 12-member high power board of Twenty 20 and 16 of the 19 ward committees had voted for his resignation after he joined hands with Opposition parties to disrupt the work of a road in the panchayat by plotting to issue a stop memo by the panchayat secretary against it.

“Some government funds earmarked for specific projects may have lapsed but that was because the panchayat already had those projects up and running and there was no reason to waste those funds,” Mr. Sabu Jacob said.

Dissent brewed in Twenty20 a couple of years ago when two members, elected under its banner, chose to dissociate with it owing to the alleged autocratic ways of Mr. Sabu Jacob. M.V. George, one of those members, alleged his decision was triggered by Mr. Sabu Jacob's demand not to invite two Opposition members to his daughter’s marriage. He further alleged that Twenty20’s food security shop famous for dispensing essential items at much lower prices than the market rates was arbitrarily closed down in May by the chief coordinator.

A senior panchayat official alleged that the arbitrary ways of executing projects had created discontent among officials.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/panchayat-president-quits-as-feud-intensifies-within-twenty20/article30455030.ece
351,2020/01/02,13 outstanding theatrical performances of 2019,"This year the stage threw up apostles of hope aplenty, whose quiet energy and presence allowed us to re-imagine our own lives in the sheer privacy afforded by a seat in a darkened auditorium. Here’s a baker’s dozen of those who’ve left an impression with their ephemeral one-night-only outings that still linger on.

Abir Abrar , Sounding Vanya

In this free-wheeling dismantling and restructuring of Uncle Vanya, Abrar plays almost every part, yet she is an entity with a narrative all of their own. She owns the play’s emotional highlights and whips up intensity in spades, and even when she recedes to the sideline, she is a smouldering presence who adds much to the goings-on. Its a part that allows the consummate actor to blossom untrammeled.

Jyoti Dogra, Black Hole

The sheer artistry of what Dogra effects on stage, accompanied with just a sheet, is just one facet of her performance in Black Hole, a play she’s single-handedly created. There is also the heartbreaking trajectory of a terminally ill woman and her daughter. Dogra starts off as anxious narrator, before settling into a more self-assuredly cerebral presence, taking the play’s engagement with science to a more transcendental plane.

Kaustav Sinha , Raamji Aayenge

Sinha’s anthropomorphic vanar Bhonpu is a stand-in for battleworn Estragon from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, of which Raamji Aayenge is an adaptation. He chips in an understated turn sans ostentation, with a consistency of quality never short on truth or intensity or humour. His Zen-like bearings adds volumes to the play’s temporal shifts across ages, even as he crafts an ‘otherness’ that helps reveal the follies of mankind.

Keatan Jadhav , Avyahat

By dint of characterisation, Jadhav has the onerous task of bringing to life the Buddhist monk Upali, who sought to demystify the Buddha in Asoka’s time. It’s an author-backed role that the young actor does full justice to, handling the period-inflected dialectic text with considerable aplomb, and evoking to no small degree the fortitude and gravitas and formal manner of a radical visionary quite ahead of his time.

Himanshu Talreja , Gagan Damama Bajyo

Supported by a chorus who collectively evoke the zeitgeist of the 1920s, Talreja as Bhagat Singh nonetheless appears to single-handedly bear the cross of his generation. His is a demeanour charged with both the naiveté of youth and the halo of an impending matrydom that he recognises as inevitable. Far from chest-thumping, Talreja’s intensely private potrayal stays with audiences long after the music dies down.

Manikandan , Pulijanmam

Enacting the Pulaya epic hero Kari Gurukkal in a retreading of a classic text, Manikandan breathes fire and fury into an elemental performance that extracts blood both psychologically and physically (he plays an ostensible master of ten martial arts). As a man who turns irrevocably into a tiger, the underrated actor channelises both human and feral torment in a composite of anguish and unwitting actualisation that is bone-chillingly evoked.

Parna Pethe , Bone of Contention in Cosmopolitan CHS

In a broad farce that plays off stereotypes to hilarious effect, Pethe brings a self-possessed poise and an introspective eye as the ubiquitous friendly neighborhood help, who does the rounds of many bickering households. In a part that’s not without its high jinks — Pethe even raps with alacrity — it is at her most sedate that her worldly-wise character omnisciently gives us a soft-eyed glimpse of real cosmopolitanism.

Pallavi Jadhao , Man Maana Square

In an ensemble piece that she’s devised with three other actors, Jadhao is all spirit and vim, and laces her characters with a deliriously humorous edge good for many laughs. Her unabashed (and touching) portrayal of repressed feminine desire and angst finding some expression, rescues her parts from becoming easy caricatures, with her alternatively subaltern and bourgeois women acquiring fleshed-out inner workings that make them characters for the ages.

Puja Sarup , Sounding Vanya

What Sarup gives this inventive retread of Anton Chekhov’s masterpiece is a bewitching and almost careless languor, switching between men and women of distant Russia without scarcely gendering the act of transference, watching over the play with her gaze and breathtakingly holding the drama even in her moments of utter stillness. It’s a performance that displays an effortlessness of craft that calls for very little of her trademark flamboyance.

Rachel D’souza , Shikaar

In a high-camp performance that calls into magical submission both the comedic and the cataclysmic, D’souza is one of an intrepid breed of dyed-in-the-wool chudails. While she revels in the commune’s self-sufficiency of spirit and ‘wicked witchiness’, she essays a conflicted soul whose persuasions are decidedly off-beat. It is textbook humour performed with heart, and in the process broad strokes acquire a disarming subtlety.

Ronita Mookerji , i am not here

In a tight two-hander, Mookerji is a devil-may-care presence seemingly untouched by the piece’s feminist angst but mindful of its repercussions on her own body. As she physically negotiates a curve from prescriptive Bharat Natyam to her own free form style, she steadily throws up charged metaphors that remind us of pain and resilience equally, and allows the play to reach its moments of insight and revelation.

Tavish Bhattacharyya , A Few Good Men

In the eye of the storm in a military tribunal, Bhattacharyya’s Harold Dawson commands begrudging attention as a man who acts in collusion with higher-ups but will not acquiesce to becoming a fall guy. It’s a measured turn that straddles both dissent and loyalty, and Bhattacharyya’s stoicism and composure go a long way in a play that owes more to its moments of stillness than to occasional scenery chewing.

Vijay Patidar , Eidgah Ke Jinnat

As his right-wing Hindu soldier posted in strife-ridden Kashmir teeters on the edge of overwrought delusion, Patidar gives us a heart-breaking glimpse of his battered soul. In a role that is part apologia and part indictment of the veritable heart of darkness that has engulfed its converts, Patidar deftly walks a precarious tightrope between caricature and believability, between judgement and conciliation, and never once loses his balance at all.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/5tfvxr/article30463263.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Abir-Abrar-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/13-outstanding-theatrical-performances-of-2019/article30463282.ece
352,2020/01/02,‘Medea’ in the round,"The stage is ready, instead of a set it is packed with chairs for the audience, while the house lights are on. The performers are neither in the wings nor on stage. In their simple Greek costumes, they break into dialogue from among the audience in the hall as they begin their performance. In Pandies’ Theatre group’s adaptation of the Greek classic, “Medea”, theatre director Anuradha Marwah explores a democratic performance dynamic that brings actors and audience on the same level, setting aside the idea of the stage.

Performed in the round, the concept attempts to bring classical drama into everyday arena by merging spaces and challenging conventional theatre strategies. The production has been featured in diverse settings across Delhi, ranging from intimate performance venues like the basement theatre at India Habitat Centre and Studio Safdar to colleges and women’s shelter homes.

Levelling the stage

“This is the concept of Samtal,” she explains. “Mostly, classical works are performed on the proscenium stage, in ways that are inaccessible to the general public. With Samtal, we take nuanced and profound themes to everybody, focusing on the human element that often gets overlooked when the productions are extremely intellectualised.” The term ‘samtal’ literally means a level field. Seeking to bring world theatre classics to new audiences, the concept also involves opportunities for discussions between the audience, cast and crew of the production.

Marwah reflects on the evolution of the idea that inspired her to direct the play, “I was inspired by the work of theatre group Ten Thousand Things’ and dreamed-up of ‘Samtal’ while in Minneapolis on a Fulbright-Nehru Academic and Professional Excellence (FNAPE) Fellowship in 2017. It’s a door that opened up a whole new area of creativity for me. I am essentially a writer, and never actually thought of myself as a director. When I started to think of Samtal, it was something very new for me and I was like a child wanting to explore new things.” The community theatre work of Ten Thousand Things involved taking iconic plays to non-traditional venues. Performing in the round, with all the lights on, attracted her because the audience would also become a part of the performance in this way.

Finally, in 2019, Michelle Hensley, founder of Ten Thousand Things along with playwright Kira Obolensky, came to Delhi and trained the creative team of Samtal for performance in the round.

Adapting ‘Medea’

A scene from “Medea”

“Finding the play that would begin this programme was really challenging,” recalls Marwah. “The script is very strong and I was apprehensive whether a radical work like Medea would work in the kind of rendering we were planning.” When she presented the first draft of the adaptation to her performers at the reading, they found it challenging and amusing. “It seemed too grandiose to be performed in the round. I realised it had to be much more conversational and spent another month reworking the script!”

Though the play is distant in time and space, Marwah was confident that it would resonate with contemporary contexts and spark discussion and debate with the audience. “We premièred the play in Shakti Shalini shelter home for women in Nithari Basti. The audience had absolutely no familiarity with Greek drama yet they responded and wanted to talk.” The power of the play lies in bringing out the audience from the space of passive spectatorship into an active dialogue about their own lives. “In educational institutions, or studio spaces, it was intense, people wanted to talk about their lives – relationships, sexuality. Topics that are conventionally taboo could be broached because we are looking at them through the play, it was somebody else’s story, so it becomes easy to voice opinions.”

Democratic forum

The shows extended much beyond the performance with deeper conversations with each group. While the text and theme of Medea opened up insights into the audience’s own lives, the discussions delved into different points of view. In the shelter home, for instance, women opened up about their own experiences of abuse and abandonment. Urban audience in studio settings were enamoured with the dynamic aesthetics of performance in the round, while students expressed curiosity about politics and directorial choices.

For Marwah, exploring theatre as a levelled and democratic space stems from her own beliefs and feminist politics. “The beauty of performing in the round with classical texts is that a wide range of audience respond to it, cutting across class and socio-economic divide.” As the production gains momentum, there are more performances coming up in other cities, towns and villages. The theatre group is busy bracing up for unexpected questions from the audience, more intense dialogues to draw them in and their own conversation with a classic from the past.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/fo61we/article30461690.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Medea-1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/medea-in-the-round/article30461626.ece
353,2020/01/02,A rib-tickling fare,"There are some plays that continue to enthral audience despite their repeated staging. One such is the ever popular American playwright Joseph Kesserling’s “Arsenic & Old Lace”. Its Hindi adaptation attracted a sizeable audience despite the prevailing cold conditions when put on board last week at the Panna Bharat Ram Theatre Festival, Shri Ram Centre for Performing Arts’ annual event.

With an excellent content in hand – a farcical black comedy – director Nayana Sagar made watching this play an enjoyable experience. The acting, innovative lighting, set design, timing, music, props and pithy lines elicited repeated applause from the audience. It was laugh-a-minute show that didn’t allow a boring moment in the two-hour long play.

Homicidal maniacs

The plot revolves around the Vasai-based D’Silva family, whose members include insane homicidal maniacs. Martha (Aarti Nayyar) and Rosa (Sohaila Kapur), the two old aunts, believe they are doing “social work” by killing elderly, lonely men, when they turn up looking for accommodation in their house. The victims are offered home-made elderberry wine, ironically made from the fruit growing in adjacent graveyard, laced with arsenic, strychnine and a pinch of cyanide. Their nephew, Jonathan (Ashutosh Kumar Keshav) is a psychopath killer with a plastic surgeon, Dr. Talwar (Manish Panwar), as companion, who changes the former’s appearance after every murder.

Jonathan’s present makeover prompts everyone to compare him to Amrish Puri, much to his annoyance and the surgeon’s discomfort. Alfie (Kirti Kaushik) is the schizophrenic nephew, who thinks he is Hitler, dressed up in a uniform, complete with a swastika arm band. He helps the aunts to bury the old men, thinking they are Jews, exterminated in the concentration camp. The sane nephew Bobby (Utkarsh Sharma), a theatre critic, in love with neighbour Julie (Shreya Pokhriyal), is left to handle this bizarre and berserk crowd.

Off to a slow start, the play warms up with two sisters taking the centre-stage. Their acting, timing and synchronisation reminded one of a high-scoring partnership in cricket, with both complementing and supplementing the other, in terms of emoting, actions and dialogues. Dressed in long skirts or black mourning dresses, with a cross dangling from their chains and their Anglo Indian accent, slow movements and slight stoop, made them look genuine aunts.

Perfect foil

Bobby proved a perfect foil for them. He excelled by displaying his bewilderment, amazement and inability to make sense of the actions of his aunts and brother, Jonathan, in a perfect measure.

Ashutosh made Jonathan’s portrayal as a psychopath look real with the frenzied and quick actions and words. The scar across his face, made him look menacing. Alfie’s “Heil Hitler” salute, blowing the bugle at crucial points and talking about invasion of Poland, added to the humour. Other supporting actors contributed in equal measure, rendering the performance seamless.

While the sudden movements by actors gave a momentum to the proceedings and kept the audience engaged, its repeated use seemed at times jarring.

The well-designed set by Nayana, with minimal props adequately gave one the feel of the living room, the basement where the dead were buried and the adjoining kitchen. The stage lighting played a crucial role in heightening the drama as did Sayam Raj Sagar’s music.

The dramatic twist at the end as the aunts try to better Jonathan’s tally of victims, had the audience in splits.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/nbcqhy/article30461561.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Arsenice-and-Old-Lace3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a-rib-tickling-fare/article30461562.ece
354,2020/01/02,The Azamgarh Mahotsav: In harmony with nature,"The 12-day Azamgarh Mahotsav featured different theatrical forms, music concerts, dance recitals and symposia in different parts of this sprawling district of eastern Uttar Pradesh. It evoked a sense of joie de vivre and camaraderie among theatre practitioners that will be remembered for long.

Organised in collaboration with the civil society and district administration, the spectacular performances unfolded on an elaborate makeshift stage on a huge lawn popularly known as Jajee Ka Maidan which was equipped with advanced lighting devices.

One of the visually and aurally enchanting experiences was offered by “Bastar Band” which was remarkable for presenting rhythmically graceful dance movements and soul-stirring musical tunes. The colourful costumes, the display of enviable skill by drummers, the enactment of daily chores of tribal people in harmony with nature created beautiful imagery.

Bow’s melody

We know bow and arrow are essential for tribals for hunting but here the women also created melodious tunes from the bow, celebrating harmonious community life. One of the tribal ritualistic performances, based on a traditional form, Dhankul Jaagar, was woven around the earth which produces grains for humanity. The vibrant imagery formed by tribal artists revealed the soul of tribal life whose self-reliant and simple lives are now under threat by attempts to curtail their forest rights.

The show was directed and conceptualised by Padma Shri Anup Ranjan Pandey, who was trained in Habib Tanvir’s repertory and was initiated into music by his parents. He has been working with Bastar tribals, scattered across in the vast forest landscape. They are losing their cultural identity and their rare art forms which are now on the verge of extinction.

Pandey is working with them for the last one-and-a-half decades, collecting musical instruments and musical tunes and bringing diverse groups under the umbrella of Bastar Band. He has revived a number of mythological stories and tribal ritualistic art forms and presents them on the modern stage.

The works of Bhikhari Thakur, who is known as Shakespeare of Bhojpuri, continue to be staged by contemporary theatre practitioners of Bihar. One of his plays “Bidesiya” is frequently staged. Satish Anand, a veteran theatre director now based in Delhi, has evolved his own technique of staging “Bidesiya”, incorporating elements of Brechtian theatre. At the Azamgarh Mahotsav, this play was presented under the direction of Sanjay Upadhyay in an innovative style.

In the original form, it is staged by actors who remain in standing posture thought out the show. The strong chorus also sings songs while remaining standing. The Naach which reveals the earthy vigour is a vital element of “Bidesiya” and is mostly performed by men in female dress.

Upadhyay, a leading stage music practitioner, director, and Sangeet Natak Akademi awardee, has transformed the play into a musical. The actor-singer remain sitting on the stage while singing. There are no dance sequences. The presentation has sophistication and elements of classical music have been incorporated into the musical score.

Agonised bride

The production reveals the agony of a young bride whose husband has left home just after their marriage is solemnised and remained in Bidesh – foreign land – only to return after years of separation to tell the eternally waiting wife that he has a family in Bidesh. Upadhyay's production is innovative which will appeal to a sophisticated urban audience.

At Rahul auditorium, named after Mahapandit Rahul Sanskrityayan, a great scholar and prolific writer who was born in Azamgarh, the Repertory Company of Bhartendu Natya Akademi, Lucknow presented “Maar Parajay”. Written by Raj Kumar, the play is directed by Manoj Sharma with panache, creating an ambiance that enables performers to reveal their dilemma with dramatic force.

This is one of the few plays about Gandhi, seen in recent months, that explores with intensity only one aspect of Gandhi's life rather than presenting the vast canvas of his eventful life. “Maar Parajay” is structurally taut which explores Gandhi's experiment with celibacy while he was in South Africa, championing the cause of the South African Indians. The entire action takes place in the house of Gandhi with a focus on his intense interactions with Kasturba and his sons.

Bapu’s restrictions

One day Gandhi reveals to Kasturba his resolve to maintain celibacy, declaring that the sexual relations between husband and wife should be restricted only to give birth to children and after that, they should maintain absolute celibacy. Gandhi's experiments are not only restricted to observe celibacy, but he also stopped taking salts and sugar. He imposed these restrictions on his family members also. This was a kind of torture for his family.

There are painfully touching sequences like children demanding sugar which is denied to them by Kasturba, torn between her tender motherly feeling for the children and her sense of moral duty towards Gandhi. There is another sequence full of anguish where Gandhi orders her to clean pot of human feces, which she refuses. Enraged, Gandhi orders her to leave the house and pushes her towards the exit door. Weeping children rush towards their mother and cling to her. Later, Gandhi repents his inhuman act. There is another poignant scene when girls living in the Ashram complain to Gandhi that his son tried to molest them, Gandhi commands his son to leave home at once and takes scissors to cut the long, black and beautiful hair of the girls considering them as the source of sexual lust. Kasturba intervenes.

Som Ganguli as Gandhi gives a creditable performance. His Gandhi struggles hard to free himself from sexual lust. Pawani Gupta as Kasturba reveals the inner strength of her character.

“Hansuli”

Adapted from Dr. Akhilesh Kumar Chandra’s short story by Raj Kumar Shah, “Hansuli” (silver ornament)depicted the conflict between two brothers over the division of ancestral landed property and the lone silver ornament of the mother.

355,2020/01/02,Play of emotions,"“Oh Devas, the mighty rulers of the world! The fruits of your blessings, once tender and sweet, have now become useless.” Nala, the erstwhile King of Nishadha, looked up to the heavens and started pleading with the Gods.

An enthralled audience in Thiruvananthapuram recently witnessed the enactment of the first two scenes of Nalacharitham - Monaam Divasam by Ettumanoor P Kannan.

The performance started with ‘Lokapalanmare...’ in Thodi raga. This padam portrays a desperate, perplexed and heartbroken Nala, the king in exile, pleading to the Gods to grant him peace. Kannan clearly conveyed the mindset of the king, who had lost his kingdom to his brother and deserted his wife in the forest due to Kali’s influence.

Nala initially questions the Gods for their indifferent behaviour towards him, even though he worships them daily. He goes on to say that nobody would respect them if they treat their devotees in such a manner.

His mood, however, soon shifts to supplication, wherein Nala starts pleading with the Gods to take care of Damayathi and never let him lose his mind due to excessive sorrow.

Kannan was impressive in handling this transition with effective use of face and body. His elaborations at certain junctures need special mention, especially the part where he prayed to the Gods to take care of Damayanthi.

The second scene portrayed Nala reaching a philosophical frame of mind and enjoying a temporary state of calm and bliss. The padam ‘Khoravipinam …’ in raga Kalyani was a perfect blend of abhinaya, music and percussion. In this padam, the king fools himself into believing that being in the forest is better than living in the palace and the city.

While the two padams were enacted with precision and perfection, the highlight of the performance was the crisp and effective manodharma attam towards the end. The whole attam was pegged around the bleakness in Nala’s life, thus doing justice to the literature of Nalacharitham.The first ray of hope Nala receives is from Karkodaka after he bites Nala. Kannan avoided long segments and resorted to short and crisp nuggets that made the attam effective.

Another highlight of the performance was when Nala fluctates between hope and guilt. Nala, trying to console himself, compares himself with Parameswara. Nala says that even Lord Siva must have had bad patches in his life. However, he feels guilty as he recollects how Lord Siva had never deserted his consort Parvathi. The guilt is intensified when he sees a pregnant cow elephant being escorted by a male during a forest fire.

The performance ended with Nala hearing a request for help from within the forest fire and steps into the fire.

Kannan was ably supported by Pathiyoor Sankarankutty and Nedumbulli Rammohan on the vocal. The percussion was led by veterans Kalamandalam Krishnadas on the chenda and Margi Rathnakaran on the maddalam.

356,2020/01/02,Remembering Safdar Hashmi: When art’s passion met layman’s anger,"This Wednesday marked the 31st Shahaadat Divas (martyrdom day) of theatre activist Safdar Hashmi, and the crowd gathered at Jhandapur in the Sahibabad Industrial Area to celebrate his memory, as on every January 1, showed that neither the theatre world nor those politically affiliated to the Communist Party of India and the workers’ organisation CITU have forgotten him.

Safdar Hashmi from Halla Bol festival Safdar Hashmi Trust

January days in the Delhi-NCR offer a brief spell of sunlight soon to be snuffed out by the early onset of evening. But more than sunlight was snuffed out on January 1, 1989, the day Safdar Hashmi came with his group Jana Natya Manch (JANAM) to perform the street play “Halla Bol” in Jhandapur village, as part of their efforts to educate the factory workers and make them aware of their rights and powers. The group was attacked by goons owing allegiance to the Congress party (of the 10 attackers later convicted of the murder, one was the party’s mayoral candidate), and Hashmi succumbed to his injuries the following day. A factory worker Ram Bahadur was shot dead.

Stunned as Hashmi’s supporters were by his tragic end, the flame he ignited refused to go out. Not only did JANAM, led by Safdar’s wife Moloyashree, return to complete “Halla Bol” at the very same spot two days after his death, they also turned it into a pilgrimage of sorts. Every January 1, it is here in Jhandapur that artists and workers come together to celebrate the sacrifice and the unbreakable pledge made by Safdar Hashmi.

This year, apart from artists of JANAM, those gathered at the site included other theatre practitioners, young people from different walks of life, factory workers and their families, plus three special guests: Shabana Azmi and Javed Akhtar, known for their pro-people activism that is as strong as their art practice, and CPI (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechuri.

The noon air was festive with the “circus” as the crowds referred it, watching the seasoned nat performing acrobatic skills on a tightrope rigged up on a precarious looking set of poles dug into the ground. Crossing the rope on foot and while balancing on a steel wheel (with no protective net or mattress on the ground), and jumping through a flaming hoop, the nat and his two young companions, a tiny boy and girl, earned the applause of the onlookers. The audience then turned to the other side of the courtyard where a stage was set up.

The JANAM group led by stalwarts like Kajal Ghosh and Sudhanva Deshpande sang rousing songs including the poignant “Lal jhanda leke comrade aage badhte jayenge” which contains the line “Tum nahin rahe, iska gham hai par aage badhte jaayenge (Though it saddens us that you are no longer with us, still we will carry on)”.

Eloquent address

Javed Akhtar Shiv Kumar Pushpakar

Aside from JANAM’s play on the plight of workers burdened by a lack of freedom to protest and denied just working conditions, it was in the eloquent address of Javed Akhtar that the torch of poetic anguish met the fire of the commoner’s anger at circumstances. Injustice is like the climate, said the celebrated poet and lyricist, drawing attention to the prevailing situation where workers and the poor have never had it easy, regardless of the ruling dispensation. But sometimes, he added, it’s colder than at others. These days, he said, it’s very cold.

Like other speakers, he drew parallels between the daily fight for justice waged by the oppressed and the current countrywide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the National Population Register (NPR) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). He pointed out that these moves were not against the minority but against the poor of every community, and that the move was but a stepping stone to controlling the majority. He also recited two of his more recent pieces of poetry, including the ghazal “Likh”. The ghazal exhorts poets to write the words that others are afraid to utter, to throw away the pen they used for sycophancy, and fearlessly write the truth, for never before has the night been as dark as this night.

His impassioned words brought out the truth of Yechuri’s statement that artists give inspiration to the foot soldiers of a movement.

Inspirational poetry

Shabana, speaking fondly of the days when her father, poet Kaifi Azmi, used to take her to such meetings of workers, and reciting lines from both Azmi’s and Akhtar’s inspirational poetry, also released an important publication on the occasion. This was Sudhanva Deshpande’s “Halla Bol: The Death and Life of Safdar Hashmi” (LeftWord). The book has been published in both English and Hindi versions.

It seemed just the right time for this biography. While Hashmi has always been a symbol of non-violent resistance and resilience in the face of heavy odds, the outpouring of public wrath through non-violent protests across India this winter has brought his example even more into the limelight. The book will be a reminder that art and politics are indeed inseparable, that culture is of the people and by them.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/j8wzkn/article30458874.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG0904,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/remembering-safdar-hashmi-when-arts-passion-met-laymans-anger/article30458880.ece
357,2020/01/02,‘Jeevani’ to revive weekly markets,"The traditional ‘Azhcha Chantha’ (weekly market) for the direct sale of local agriculture produce by farmers is set for a grand comeback in 10 grama panchayats under the Koduvally block panchayat. Coordinators of ‘Jeevani’, a new scheme by the Agriculture Department for the promotion of organic farming and healthy food habits, will lend a hand for the cause and strive to revamp the traditional style of agri-marketing, which is expected to fetch its direct benefits to the farmers.

The expense for facilitating the weekly markets will be borne by the department under the new supportive scheme, which will be launched soon in the district. Support of various agriculture working groups will be sought for the effective coordination of the rural sales initiative. For the year-long project, the department, with the support of Agricultural Technology Management Agency and Horticultural Mission, will invest about ₹2 crore.

Kizhakkothu and Omassery grama panchayats will firstly resume the conventional weekly trade under the scheme. The required revolving fund for starting the operation will be granted by the department from its project fund. Similar weekly markets will be considered in the limits of Koduvally municipality and other grama panchayats such as Kattippara, Puthuppadi, Madavoor, Kodenchery, Koodaranhi and Thiruvambadi.

Project coordinators say the re-start of Azhcha Chantha will give a new energy to the conventional farmers to directly sell off their harvest and facilitate their frequent interaction with the new generation buyers. According to them, it will also promote organic farming among youths and its role in leading a healthy life.

As part of the preparations, most of the local bodies held a special meeting of their agriculture development committees on Wednesday and finalised the proposals for implementation. Apart from the weekly market promotion, Jeevani will strive to promote the traditional farming knowledge, exchange of high-yielding variety of seeds, setting up of local nurseries and small farm schools.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/o8ensa/article30457150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01KI-MARKET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/jeevani-to-revive-weekly-markets/article30457151.ece
358,2020/01/02,Agriculture has become unviable: CPI(M),"The Narendra Modi Government which came to power with promises to double the income of farmers has done nothing for them and with wrong policies it has made agriculture an unviable venture, S. Ramachandran Pillai, CPI(M) Polit Bureau member, has said.

Inaugurating the national conference of the All India Agricultural Workers Union here on Wednesday, he said the agriculture sector is facing serious problems and every day a farmer is forced to commit suicide.

“To double the income, it was necessary to increase the production and remunerative price for the crops; but the Government has done nothing,” he said. The wrong policies adopted by the Government have increased the input cost for agriculture and there is no proportionate growth in the prices of the crop. This is a reason why peasants are forced to sell their land, cattle and implements and failed to pay back the loans, he observed.

He further noted that the Indian economy is in unprecedented slow down leading a serious recession. All the economic indicators confirm this serious recession phase in India, but the Government at present is manipulating statistics, Mr. Ramachandran Pillai alleged.

“Despite the manipulation of statistics, the GDP is the lowest in the past 15 years, unemployment is at the highest level in the past 45 years, family consumption expenditure has come down to the lowest level during the past 40 years and the non-performing assets of the bank arer at the highest record level,” he claimed.

Taking a dig at Governors, Mr. Ramachandran Pillai said they had become instruments of the ruling party at the Centre and their political masters. Citing the incidents that took place during the Indian History Congress at Kannur recently, he appealed to the Kerala Governor to close and not to extend the controversy, as it was not good for all.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/l38q7e/article30457130.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/National-Conference9,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/agriculture-has-become-unviable-cpim/article30457131.ece
359,2020/01/02,Joint protest against CAA on January 3,"Over two weeks after the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) leaders staged a joint protest in the State capital against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a similar event is being planned here on January 3.

All major political parties except the BJP, religious and cultural organisations, and residents’ associations, and students’ outfits will participate in a rally to be taken out in protest against the Act.

The event would highlight Kozhikode’s opposition to the CAA, which, he said, was against the secular fabric of the nation.

M.K. Raghavan, MP, is the patron of the committee. Both LDF and UDF legislators such as Binoy Viswam, Elamaram Karim, and M.K. Muneer had expressed support to the rally, the organisers said.

At 8 p.m., the DMK won 30 panchayat union wards while the AIADMK bagged 26 wards including the unopposed election of its candidate C. Andaldevi of ward 7 in Pudhur union. The AMMK (4 wards), MDMK (3 wards), DMDK (1 ward) and 9 independents too found a place in the list of winners.

Of the 17 district panchayat wards, result for only ward 10 was declared in which AIADMK candidate Selvakumar got elected as he defeated Congress candidate Jesuvadiyan.

While the DMK managed to win majority of panchayat union wards till 8 p.m., the AIADMK candidates were leading in most of the district panchayat wards.

As the counting started at 8 a.m., agents of the candidates were asked to be present at the main entrance of the counting centres from 6 a.m. onwards and they were allowed inside the counting centres only after thorough frisking and they produced their passes issued by the State Election Commission.

Collector Sandeep Nanduri, who visited the counting centres, said 300 officials had been posted in each of the 12 counting centres and 3,600 personnel were involved in the task. Over 1,500 policemen had been deployed in the counting centres.

When declaration of results and issue of winner’s certificate got delayed in the counting centres for a few minutes, agents of candidates affiliated to the DMK and its allies started raising slogans that forced the police to evict them from the counting centres. However, the winners with minimum number of their supporters were allowed to remain there on the condition that they should not create any problem inside the counting halls until they receive the winner’s certificate.

Victory of Mettilpatti village panchayat president in Pudhur union in the district was decided by lot as candidates Jayachandran and Kathirkaaman polled 322 votes each. When the lot went in favour of Mr. Kathirkaaman, an upset Mr. Jayachandran, after leaving the counting centre climbed up a tree and threatened that he would commit suicide by holding the overhead power cable. However, the police pacified him.

Declaration of results for ward 1 of Vilaathikulam union got delayed by 3 hours as the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries created ruckus by accusing the officials of hiding 5 ballot boxes after their candidate lost the election and pushed to the third spot. Even after the officials proved that votes polled in all ballot boxes were counted by tallying the round-wise counting and the total number of votes polled, AMMK union secretary Velavan and others raised slogans. They left the spot around 2 p.m. and the result for ward 1 that could have been declared by 11 a.m. was officially announced only at 2 p.m.

After the AIADMK agents snatched the passes of the AMMK agents from them just before the 6th round counting of votes polled in wards 12 and 13 of Kayathar panchayat union at SSTM College in Kovilpatti, the police had to intervene to settle the issue.

While 288 posts of village ward members and 10 village panchayat president posts were won unopposed in Theni district, most of the remaining posts were taken by independent candidates. In Dindigul district, village ward members and panchayat president posts were won by independent candidates but the posts of union and district councillor had candidates from political parties locked in a tight competition.

The AIADMK, which lost two Assembly seats in Theni district in the bypolls held in May, managed to win 21 out of the declared 45 seats of union councillor as of 8.15 p.m.. The DMK, on the other hand, managed to win 17 seats while DMDK and the Congress won two seats each.

Even the AMMK, led by T.T.V. Dhinakaran, made its entry into the panchayati raj system by winning a seat of union councillor in Andipatti union. The AMMK drew a blank in the recent Lok Sabha Polls but the party can be happy that it has gained foot in village administration.

At the counting hall, the papers were counted in batches and wardwise.

In Dindigul and Oddanchatram counting centres, government school teachers who were designated as counting officials staged a walk out as they were not provided lunch till 4 p.m. They complained that there was no drinking water available and no toilet facilities for officials. This led to a brief suspension in counting process in both centres and teachers were engaged in an argument with BDOs who later arranged for lunch.

In Palani and Thoppampatti centres, counting began quite late in the morning as the officials came late and opened the counting hall. Party agents were seen waiting for a long time.

In Natham and Guziliamparai centres, there were minor arguments between counting officials and party agents as the opposition parties claimed discrepancy in the counting, which was settled later.

The officials declared many postal votes invalid as they did not follow the proper procedure of annexing form 17 with the postal ballot. In Oddanchatram union, around 73 out of 75 postal votes for a post of union ward councillor was declared invalid due to this reason.

Elsewhere in Theni district, officials found ballot papers that did not bear proper stamp and declared those votes invalid.

On completion of the process, ballot papers were counted with the record on number of votes polled in each booth.

“Except for a few cases where one or two ballot papers were missing, the tally was intact,” an official at counting centre for Virudhunagar panchyat union said.

The separated ballot papers are taken to the counting halls – different counting halls for four different posts. Here, the officials unfolded the ballot papers and displayed the arrow cross mark left by voters for electing the candidate of their choice and they are again sorted out based on the votes gone to each candidate. Separate boxes were kept for ballot papers with invalid votes.

After ballot papers were verified for the votes cast against different candidate/symbols, the votes secured by each of the candidate was counted and results declared.

365,2020/01/02,"When currency notes, booth slips came out of ballot boxes","Officials counting ballot papers for Virudhunagar panchayat union were surprised when two currency notes in the denomination of ₹ 50 were found pinned to two different ballot papers inside a ballot box on Thursday. The currency notes had a small note, written in small pieces of white paper – that read: (Please) help reach this to its owner. The man from Koorakundu identified himself with a name.

When a sorting official showed the unexpected material found in the ballot box, the official in-charge instructed him to report it to the Returning Officer.

Counting agents, who witnessed the incident, laughed. While one of them said that the voter could have been angered probably for bribing him. A counting staff said it could be possible that the voter was irked as he was not given the money by some candidate.

One of the agents wondered as to how the voter could take out currency notes and personal notes from his pockets and pin them in two ballot papers and managed to put them in the ballot box without getting noticed by any of the seven/eight polling officials at the booths.

A sorting officer, who was a polling official, said that many voters took their own time to cast their votes in each of the four ballot papers. “Since they do everything behind an enclosure, these kind of activities could not be noticed by officials,” she said.

A senior official said it could be a tactics by the candidate or his agents to check foul play in swapping of ballot boxes. “They satisfy themselves by putting these weird or unexpected things inside the ballot box and check whether these things are displayed by officials. During last local body polls, we found rings inside boxes,” one of them said.

Officials at the sorting rooms said they found a few booth or voter slips inside ballot boxes.

“Probably, the voters got confused between the voter slip and the ballot papers meant for village panchayt member. Because both voter slip and ballot paper (for panchayat ward member) are white,” one of them said.

A Scheduled Caste woman, who polled only 10 votes, has become the president of Pitchivilai village panchayat in the district because of the poll boycott by almost all caste Hindu voters.

Pitchivilai village panchayat, with six wards having 785 voters, was reserved for ‘SC – Woman’ this time though the rural local body has only six Scheduled Caste voters and 779 voters belong to an intermediate caste. Upset with the move, voters of the intermediate caste announced an election boycott, and hence no nomination was received for ward member posts.

Only two nominations were received for the post of village panchayat president from Rajeswari and Sundarachi. On the day of polling on December 27, only six SC voters exercised their franchise while all others abstained from the poll process. When the polling was about to be wound up around 5 p.m., seven intermediate caste voters polled their votes to take the total number of votes polled in the booth to 13.

When the votes were counted on Thursday, Ms. Rajeswari, who bagged 10 votes, got elected while Sundarachi got only two votes, and one vote was declared invalid.

“Since the village panchayat has no ward members, a by-poll will be conducted,” officials said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/81jn1b/article30463244.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma03CandidateRajeswarijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/polling-just-10-votes-sc-woman-becomes-panchayat-president-thoothukudi/article30463201.ece
367,2020/01/02,HC grants anticipatory bail to AMMK man,"MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to an Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) functionary, S.V.S.P. Manickaraja, who referred to a woman contesting the rural local body election by her caste name.

In his petition, Manickaraja said the case of the prosecution was that he referred to a woman candidate of the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) by her caste name during an election campaign in Kayathar in Thoothukudi district.

He claimed that he did not defame the candidate nor her community. Moreover, the woman candidate herself did not want to press her charge. Seeking anticipatory bail, he said he would not evade the process of law.

After perusing the transcript of the speech delivered by the petitioner during election campaign, Justice G.R. Swaminathan observed that there was absolutely no necessity for the petitioner to refer to the community of the woman candidate.

“On a careful perusal of the transcript of the speech of the petitioner, one can come to the conclusion that in the heat of election campaign, he had displayed an element of sarcasm. There is the element of teasing in the tone of the petitioner. It cannot, however, be called an abuse,” the court said.

The court took cognisance of the fact that the woman did not want to pursue the matter. “But then, a case arising under the provisions of the SC/ST ((Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, is not a compoundable one”, the court said.

Granting anticipatory bail to the petitioner, the court said even if the complaint made by the woman was taken at its face value, the offence under the provisions of the SC/ST ((Prevention of Atrocities) Act was not made out.

The court said the arrest of the petitioner was not going to serve any purpose. However, the relief granted would not have any bearing on the investigation in the case.

After it was submitted that the petitioner would undertake to file an affidavit expressing his regret and unconditional apology, the court directed him to file two affidavits – one also to the lower court at the time of his surrender.

He should also file an affidavit through the police to the woman. Further, he should give an undertaking that in future election campaigns, he would refrain from uttering unwarranted expressions, the court said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc-grants-anticipatory-bail-to-ammk-man-madurai-thoothukudi/article30462373.ece

371,2020/01/02,"Madurai Railway Division poised for greater transformation in two years, says DRM","With completion of gauge conversion and doubling works, Madurai Railway Division will undergo significant transformation in the next two years, according to Divisional Railway Manager V. R. Lenin.

He was addressing the executive committee meeting of Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry here on Wednesday.

Referring to the Madurai-Bodi gauge conversion project and doubling work under way between Madurai and Tirunelveli/Thoothukudi sections, he said they would help doubling the number of train services in the division. More train services would lead to economic development of the the region.

The Madurai-Bodi gauge conversion work was scheduled to be commissioned by April. Even if it got delayed, the section should become operational by June.

Mr. Lenin said that despite an economic slowdown, the earnings of Madurai division of Southern Railway had increased by 10% in the last quarter.

He appealed to traders to make use of parcel vans in trains that could be attached based on the requirement.

During an interactive session, a trader from Ramanathapuram said that more train services should be introduced from Rameswaram as a large number of domestic and foreign tourists visited the island. Train was the most preferred mode of travel because it was economical and safe.

in his response, Mr. Lenin said the present government was giving much importance to development of Rameswaram railway station. The Centre was also showing keen interest on extending the railway line up to Dhanushkodi.

Asked about providing stoppage of Madurai-Chennai Tejas Express at Dindigul railway station, he said it could soon happen.

Chamber president N. Jagatheesan wanted the railways to expedite Madurai-Thoothukudi new railway line project via Aruppukottai.

Senior president S. Rethinavelu said all stakeholders should press for bringing metro services to Madurai as the Centre had proposed to provide metro connectivity to 25 cities across the country.

Improving Koodal Nagar to make it the second railway station for Madurai city was also reiterated at the meet.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/h88lk1/article30456927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA02-RAILWAYMADURAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/madurai-railway-division-poised-for-greater-transformation-in-two-years-says-drm/article30456928.ece
372,2020/01/02,Bird watchers flock to Venthankulam to see garganeys,"After welcoming new year, over 300 bird watchers, mostly children and youth, gathered on the banks of Venthankulam near new bus stand here on Wednesday morning to watch the arrival of garganeys (Spatula querquedula) from Europe to the recently desilted tank.

As Agasthiyamalai Community Conservation Centre (ACCC), in association with Nellai Nature Club, ATREE, Mayan and TVS Groups, proposes to conduct Tamirabharani Water Bird Festival 2020 in select water bodies being fed by the perennial river in Tirunelveli and Thoothukudi districts, the first ‘bird walk’ event was organised at Venthankulam. The winged visitors from Europe are camping at this new-look waterbody where around 5,000 fingerlings were released to feed the water birds. The number of birds camping in the tank has increased enormously.

More than 18 species of water birds could be seen here,” said researcher Soubadra Devi of ATREE and Mathivanan of ACCC.

Besides distributing brochures carrying colour photographs of Tamirabharani basin water birds, ATREE and ACCC volunteers had installed a spotting scope and gave a good number binoculars to the public to take a closer look at the birds either swimming in the tank or relaxing in the artificially created sand mounds so that they could easily identify them.

Birds sighted

The visitors walked along the northern bund and saw Common Coot’s nest at two places - one with egg and the other with a chick - and Common Coot pairs defending their territory by chasing away other birds entering into their ‘land’ to save the egg and the chick from the intruders that included a Black Kite hovering at low altitude.

“It’s so nice to see the Garganey and Lesser Whistling Duck that breeds in Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia in such large numbers. With the release of good number of fingerlings, the waterbody will attract more birds. Hence, the desilted fresh-looking tank should be carefully protected by all means,” said renowned wildlife photographer J.C.R. Sridevi.

District Forest Officer K. Thirumal agreed to supply a good number of tree saplings to be planted along the bund of Venthankulam and also grown-up babool trees to be planted in the sand mounds so that the birds can easily build their nests.

373,2020/01/02,Now solar-powered boat ride in Manimuthar dam,"There is some good news for those planning to visit Manimuthar dam during Pongal holidays in a fortnight - Kalakkad – Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve’s (KMTR) Ambasamudram division has presented tourists a New Year gift in the form of solar-powered boat ride in the dam, a first-of-its kind in the State.

After the trials in the largest reservoir of the district were completed successfully in phases, the boat, worth ₹80 lakh, was formally commissioned by Deputy Director Kommu Omkaram on Wednesday.

KMTR administration had introduced coracle ride in the first quarter of last year in the dam to attract tourists. Now it has deployed the 26-seater solar-powered boat, including two seats for the crew, fabricated by Mahindra Group. Under the Tamil Nadu Innovation Initiative, the Department of Forest received ₹2.25 crore for promoting envoronment-friendly tourism activities in KMTR and a portion of this grant has been utilised for procuring the solar-powered boat.

The boat, propelled by a lithium-ion battery, is 11.8 metre long and four metres wide.

One of its unique aspects is that it has a German motor (20 KW) with solar roof on top which can generate 3.8 KW of power. The solar roof will help the boat get partially charged while moving. The field trials were conducted successfully with 24 persons aboard. Once it becomes operational, the boat will take tourists into the interiors of the dam surrounded by Western Ghats.

Mr. Omkaram said the boat performed well during the trials and met all pre-set parameters. “The boat is very easy to operate though it would be windy in Manimuthar dam between June and September,” he said.

As the dam has water for about 115 feet against the maximum storage level of 118 feet, the solar boat is expected to attract a decent number of tourists every day. There will be a good crowd during Pongal holidays as people visit picnic spots on the day after Pongal, to be celebrated on January 15.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/wlmefx/article30456903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02MATVL-BOAT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/now-solar-powered-boat-ride-in-manimuthar-dam/article30456904.ece

It appeared that the police target a section of society, he alleged.

Mr. Rajendra said that there were several doubts over police firing and police barging into the Highland hospital in the city. Only the judicial inquiry can bring out the truth.

He said that the committee visited and spoke to the doctors and the injured at Government Wenlock, Highland, and Unity Hospitals.

Its members have also visited the places of violence. The final report will be released next week, he said.

Mr. Rajendra alleged that police have registered an FIR targeting a section of society and they are false. The government should withdraw them.

The PUCL demanded that Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha and Police Inspector Shantarama Kunder, who was seen allegedly making a controversial remark in a video which went viral, should be suspended for the police firing. The government should release the compensation of ₹10 lakh each to the families to two persons who died in police firing.

Mr. Masood said that Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, at a meeting with the committee and others in the city on December 31, had appealed to them to postpone the January 4 convention by 10 days. He said that, honouring the appeal, the committee will not hold any convention in the city till January 15.

381,2020/01/02,BJP MLAs stop toll collection at Talapady,"Vehicles operating between Karnataka and Kerala through the Talapady Toll Gate on the National Highway 66 had a free run after BJP workers led by two MLAs forcibly stopped toll collection on Wednesday.

The toll gate is located about 17 km from the city on the border with Kerala.

Mangaluru City South MLA D. Vedavyas Kamath and Mangaluru City North MLA Y. Bharat Shetty, who led the party workers, said that Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd. (NUTPL), concessionaire for the 90-km-long highway widening and upgradation project between Talapady and Kundapur (excluding the stretch from Nanthoor to Surathkal), has failed to complete the project for over a decade.

The service roads and two flyovers under the project remained unfinished. Hence, motorists are facing hardship. Notwithstanding Member of Parliament, Dakshina Kannada, Nalin Kumar Kateel arranging for ₹ 56 crore loan to NUTPL through Axis Bank to complete the work on Pumpwell flyover in the city, the company has failed to complete it on time.

They said that the company had been set several deadlines to complete the project. If it was facing financial issues, it was its internal matter. The company would have to settle it within itself.

The MLAs said that they stopped toll collection as a symbolic protest to bring pressure on the company to complete the project within this month as promised by it at a meeting chaired by Mr. Nalin Kumar Kateel here on Tuesday. It also gave a commitment in writing on Tuesday.

They said that if the company failed to keep its commitment, the party would intensify its agitation from next month.

The BJP workers, who gathered near the toll gate at about 7.30 a.m., forcibly removed the barricades and made vehicles pass through without paying toll. The workers of the company managing the toll booth did not resist. Vehicles were allowed to pass through without having to pay toll till late in the evening.

Shivaprasad Rai, the company’s in-charge of toll collection at Talapady, Hejmady and Sasthan on the highway, told The Hindu that NUTPL collected about ₹ 7 lakh as toll daily at Talapady from over 12,000 vehicles. The loss on Wednesday could be about ₹ 4 lakh. Toll collection is high during day time when compared to night, he said.

The project is being implemented under build, operate and transfer (BoT) basis under phase III of the National Highways Development Project.

383,2020/01/02,Opposition parties are on a smearcampaign against CAA: Kateel,"State BJP president Nalin Kumar Kateel said here on Wednesday that the Opposition parties are on a smear campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) to mislead the people of the country.

Addressing party workers at a regional level workshop on the CAA organised by the BJP, he said that the Opposition parties are trying to create unrest in society through their negative propaganda on the CAA.

They are attempting to tarnish the image of the Union government led by Narendra Modi. But the BJP will take up activities to convey to the people the real components of the CAA.

He said that the Congress expected trouble in society after triple talaq, Ayodhya verdict and on matters related to Article 370 of the Constitution.

But people of the country showed their maturity on these issues. Unable to tolerate the prevailing situation, the Congress is, under the guise of protests against CAA, trying to divide society now. The Congress is doing politics on CAA knowing very well the reality of the law, he said.

Mr. Kateel said that the CAA is not targeted against any particular community.

384,2020/01/02,India's Dec factory activity picks up to 7-month high but business optimism weakens,"India's factory activity expanded at its fastest pace in seven months in December as a jump in new orders prompted companies to ramp up production, a private business survey showed on Thursday.

Business optimism fell to an almost three-year low, however, as companies worried about challenging market conditions.

The Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), compiled by IHS Markit, rose to 52.7 in the final month of 2019 from November's 51.2.

The reading was the highest since May. It also remained above the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction for a 29th month, the longest since July 2013.

“The uptick in Indian manufacturing sector growth signaled by the latest PMI results will be welcomed by policymakers, particularly given the concerning results observed in October,” noted Pollyanna De Lima, principal economist at IHS Markit.

“Factories benefited from a rebound in demand, and responded by scaling up production to the greatest extent since May.”

A sub-index that tracks overall demand in the sector hit a five-month high in December, which along with a strong growth in output led firms to hire at the quickest pace since early 2019.

Solid growth in demand was despite output prices rising at the fastest rate in nearly three years and input cost inflation hitting a 13-month high, which suggest a further quickening in overall inflation.

Rising price pressures forced the Reserve Bank of India to hold interest rates steady in December after five cuts earlier in 2019 and could leave it with less room to ease policy in coming months to support the sputtering economy.

The PMI survey also showed optimism about output over the coming 12 months declined to its lowest since February 2017.

“The degree of optimism signalled at the end of 2019 was the weakest in just under three years, reflecting concerns over market conditions, which could restrict job creation and investment in the early part of 2020,” added De Lima.",economy,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/n33w8d/article30457830.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THPMI,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/indias-dec-factory-activity-picks-up-to-7-month-high-but-business-optimism-weakens/article30457831.ece

389,2020/01/02,TRAI’s new tariff framework: More channels at lesser price,"In a bid to protect consumer interests, TRAI on Wednesday made amendments to the new regulatory framework for cable and broadcasting services under which cable TV users will be able to access more channels at lower subscription price.

Significantly, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) capped at ₹160 the amount consumers will have to pay monthly for all free to air channels. TRAI, in a statement, said it has decided that in case of multi-TV homes where more than one TV connection is working in the name of one person, it will charge a maximum of 40% of declared Network Capacity Fee (NCF) for the second and additional TV connections.

After examining various provisions, TRAI has also reduced the maximum NCF charge to ₹130 (excluding taxes) for 200 channels.

In addition, it has also been decided that channels declared mandatory by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting will not be counted in the number of channels in the NCF.

The Authority has also permitted Distribution Platform Operators (DPOs) to offer discounts on long-term subscriptions which are for six months or more.

The sum of the a-la-carte rates of the pay channels forming part of a bouquet shall in no case exceed one and a half times the rate of the bouquet of which such pay channels are a part, the TRAI said.

The a-la-carte rates of each pay channel (MRP), forming part of a bouquet, shall in no case exceed three times the average rate of a pay channel of the bouquet of which such pay channel is a part, it said.

TRAI also decided that only those channels which have an MRP of ₹12 or less will be permitted to be part of the bouquet offered by broadcasters.

The regulator said it has also considered the concern of broadcasters regarding huge carriage fee being charged by DPOs.

A cap of ₹4 lakh per month has been prescribed on carriage fee payable by a broadcaster to a DPO in a month for carrying a channel in the country, the TRAI said.

The Authority has also considered giving more flexibility to DPOs to place the TV channels on Electronic Programme Guide (EPG) and mandated that channel of a language in a genre will be kept together while placing channels on EPG.

Such EPG lay out is to be mandatorily reported to the TRAI and no change in this can be done without prior approval of the Authority, the statement said.

390,2020/01/02,Rupee skids 16 paise against U.S. Dollar on higher crude prices,"The Rupee lost 16 paise to close at 71.38 against the U.S. Dollar on Thursday as steady rise in crude oil prices and stronger dollar against key global currencies weighed on sentiment.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the domestic currency opened weak at 71.27 a dollar. It touched the day’s high of 71.26, before finally settling at 71.38, a drop of 16 paise over its previous close.

The Indian currency is trading in a narrow range amid lack of directional cues from the global market, experts said.

Rise in crude oil prices weighed on the domestic unit, but robust domestic equities supported the Rupee and restricted the fall, they said.

Brent futures, the global oil benchmark, rose 0.50% to $66.33 per barrel. Meanwhile, the dollar index, which gauges the greenback’s strength against a basket of six currencies, rose by 0.24% to 96.67.

On the domestic equity market front, the 30-share BSE Sensex ended 320.62 points, or 0.78%, higher at 41,626.64. Similarly, the NSE Nifty closed 99.70 points, or 0.82 %, up at 12,282.20 — its new closing record.

“Rupee extended losses to 71.36 on back of crude prices holding at higher levels which is making importers buy the dollar to hedge the net outflows for crude buying,” said Jateen Trivedi, Senior Research Analyst (Commodity & Currency) at LKP Securities.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) bought equities worth ₹688.76 crore on a net basis on Thursday, according to provisional exchange data. “This month (January), economic calendar on domestic front remains little muted and focus will be primarily on the inflation number that has seen an uptick in last few months following rise in food prices.

397,2020/01/02,No country for procedural justice,"In early December 2019, the Supreme Court heard a petition on the extrajudicial killing of four men who had been arrested on charges of rape and murder of a veterinarian near Hyderabad. Following the incident, the Telangana government had assured the courts that it had already initiated an investigation and inquest into the killing. The judges were surprised, however, that the FIR registered by the police was not against the policemen who had killed the four accused, but against the four men killed, for ‘attempt to murder’. The court found it “rather odd” as it is “obvious that no prosecution could be contemplated against dead persons who can neither be tried nor convicted”. What the court found odd has long been the norm in such extrajudicial killings — an FIR is usually filed against the killed, and not against the killers.

Investigating encounter killings

In a landmark judgment in A.P. Civil Liberties Committee v. Government of A.P. (2009), a five-judge Bench of the Andhra Pradesh High Court recognised the perversity of such a practice. The Bench made it mandatory for the police to register an FIR against police officers after every ‘encounter’ death. The court held that the finding of the police after such investigation would be examined by a judicial magistrate, who would then decide the next course of action. The court said that the policemen were free to claim the right to private defence, but such a defence could not pre-empt the investigation and would only be decided upon by the judicial magistrate at the appropriate stage. However, the Supreme Court stayed this judgment soon after, when an appeal was filed against it by the Andhra Pradesh Police Officers Association. The appeal was kept pending in the Supreme Court for 10 years only to be disposed of in July 2019.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court heard another appeal from the Mumbai High Court and framed guidelines to be followed in ‘encounter’ cases, in People’s Union For Civil Liberties v. State of Maharashtra (2014). These guidelines were ambiguously worded, however, and have been interpreted by the police to allow the practice of filing FIR against the dead to continue.

Additionally, the requirement of government sanction to prosecute police officers gives the police further legal immunity for ‘encounters’. In the case following the infamous Pathribal encounter in Anantnag district in 2000, the Supreme Court gave a particularly expansive meaning to the requirement of sanction. Although the Central Bureau of Investigation argued that cold-blooded murder by security forces would not require any sanction for prosecution, the court interpreted the requirement of sanction widely. As a result, unless the government concerned sanctions such prosecution, as happens rarely, the police enjoy impunity. In a few instances police officials have been convicted for such killings, but these have been few and far between.

The 2009 judgment of the Andhra Pradesh High Court was especially remarkable as the State has a bloody history of encounter killings, with more than 4,000 people allegedly killed in ‘encounters’ since 1968. This case itself stemmed from a series of writ petitions asking the court to order investigations against the police in four different ‘encounters’, three of which were against alleged Naxalites. A report titled ‘Encounters are murders’, published by the Civil Rights Committee, documented 77 ‘encounter’ killings during the Emergency alone. These campaigns led to the passing of guidelines in 1997 by the National Human Rights Commission on the standard operating procedure in encounter cases, largely ignored by the States. While such killings had been condoned in the case of Naxalites, they slowly began to be carried out for other crimes too.

Hierarchy of offences

In recent years, there has been a clamour for exceptional treatment for certain offences, resulting in stringent statutes for terror cases, narcotics offences, economic offences and sexual offences. These offences increasingly invite harsher punishments but more importantly lead to fundamental departures from the basic principles of criminal justice. From strict liability to presumptions of guilt to minimum mandatory sentencing to the question of bail, these offences are often deemed to require special treatment. Recently, while arguing for bail for former Union Minister P. Chidambaram, it was repeatedly argued that economic offenders cannot be given bail. In anti-terror and narcotics cases, in order to grant bail, the court has to be satisfied that the accused is not guilty even before trial, which is impossible. The clamour for exceptional treatment of sexual crimes has reached unprecedented levels in recent times — as seen in the President’s wish that mercy petitions be withdrawn from child sexual abuse cases and the Andhra Pradesh government’s proposed law which requires rape cases to be completed within 21 days. There is a kind of a hierarchy of heinousness of offences within which this discourse of criminal reform has unfolded. The result is an acceptance of differential standards for such offences.

Procedure seen as a problem

When these parallel tracks are adopted for these exceptional offences, procedure itself is seen as a problem. Already the dilution of procedural safeguards is seen as acceptable for heinous offences. But now even that is perceived as not going far enough. Extrajudicial killings by the police therefore are thought by many as just and necessary. The ideal of substantive justice dominates the Indian public sphere, with complete impatience for procedural justice. The language of judicial reform since the 1970s has embraced this disdain for procedure, as seen in tribunalisation, Lok Adalats, and Public Interest Litigation. Procedural safeguards have come to be seen as un-Indian, no less.

Popular cinema has long sensed this disdain for due process and has egged us on. Last year, for instance, began with Simmba in which the protaganist, a policeman, heroically murders two rape accused in his custody and gets away with it. Celebrations after the killing of the four accused in Hyderabad showed that due process is widely seen as a pesky hindrance to the rough and ready solutions promising substantive justice. Vigilantism is acceptable by many, their judgment in each instance predicated only upon the sociopolitical profile of the victim and perpetrators. Ideas of popular justice and legal justice have diverged so far in India that even the fig leaf of rule of law is disappearing fast, largely unmourned.

398,2020/01/02,Preparing for fires,"India saw at least three major fire accidents in 2019. The first, in a four-storey central Delhi hotel in February, killed 17 people. The second, at a coaching centre in Surat in May, killed 22 students. The third broke out in a factory in Delhi and resulted in the death of 43 workers. In the second and third instances, it was found that buildings authorised to be residential complexes were operating as commercial buildings instead. (According to the Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India report of 2015, residential buildings are most prone to fire outbreaks.) Despite major fires in the past, flagrant violations of building and fire safety norms continue unabated and fire accidents take place with alarming regularity. It is high time safety is taken seriously and violators are brought to book. Past incidents show that most fire accidents take place due to three major reasons: electrical short circuit and gas cyclinder/stove bursts, human negligence, and ill-formed habits. All three need to be addressed to make buildings safer.

Adherence to National Building Code

So, what all can we do to reduce fire accidents? On the regulatory side, adherence to the National Building Code of 2016 should be made mandatory. This is a detailed set of guidelines for the construction, maintenance and operation of buildings of all kinds (residential, educational, institutional, assembly, mercantile, industrial, business, etc.) and includes a separate and comprehensive chapter on fire and life safety. The National Building Code specifies, for instance, how many exits should be provided in a specific kind of building and where they must be placed. In the case of the Delhi fire, it was not only reported that a residential space was operating as a commercial space, but also that the fire exits in the buildings were blocked, thus trapping people inside.

But before all that, the first stage towards a fire-safe building is to construct the building with fire-resistant/retardant materials and install smoke detection systems and fire alarms. A building’s fire alarm/detection system should be connected with the city’s fire system. Fire compartmentalisation (area/floor wise) should be made mandatory to restrict the spread of fire through horizontal and vertical spaces. Further, a systematic procedure should be outlined for periodically assessing and monitoring fire risks. While the fire safety udit (FSA) is a good tool to assess fire safety standards of an occupancy, there are no clear provisions in any legislation regarding, say, the scope or periodicity of an FSA. FSAs should thus be made mandatory everywhere.

Once electrical and fire installations are in place, they should be certified by authorised persons and agencies. These will help identify and monitor risks of short circuits due to changes in building use, change in load pattern, etc. Only qualified persons and firms should be authorised to inspect buildings. No-objection certificates should be renewed only after verifying the originally intended use of the building being certified and any change in the building’s pattern.

In case fires break out despite all this, fire services should always be in place. This too is lacking in India. Data show that fire services are not at all adequate. In 2017, for instance, the Home Ministry told Parliament that that in 2012 India had just 2,987 fire stations against the requirement of 8,559. It is hoped that there are more now. It is important to not only increase fire services but also modernise fire fighting departments.

Building awareness

Awareness of fire safety is nearly absent in India. In schools, the curriculum should have a chapter on fire safety. Regular drills should be conducted so that children are prepared to handle such incidents. Communities managing housing and commercial premises need to regularly organise awareness programmes with assistance from authorised persons and agencies. These need to be not only on fire safety but also on other disasters such as earthquakes and floods.

Infrastructural changes are mandatory too. We need dedicated access lanes for quick movement of emergency vehicles. Under the Smart Cities Mission, ‘smart control rooms’ should be able to guide emergency vehicles through the shortest route and enable coordination among various departments such as police, traffic police, fire, ambulance, and security forces.

A lot of ground has to be covered before India can claim to be a fire-safe country. It is imperative that lessons are learned from the Delhi incident at least now. India can work towards a new goal this decade if everyone cooperates and takes precious lives seriously — the goal of a ‘surakshit Bharat’(safe India).

399,2020/01/02,The abiding power of protest,"On the back of their improved majority in Parliament following the 2019 general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah have accomplished the unimaginable in a democracy of India’s size and diversity: they have negated nearly every potential political challenge to their ascendancy. Apart from the Opposition, potential challengers in a democracy with India’s characteristics are the media and corporate sector. The astonishing thing is that much of the negation has been achieved without obviously violating democratic procedures. It has been achieved either through parliamentary majority or using the legitimate powers of the Indian state.

Impervious to criticism so far

However, democracy is also about norms unwritten, such as giving the Opposition time to respond and never using brute force in Parliament to push bills through or deploying the threat of criminal investigation outside it to rein in dissenting journalists, intellectuals and corporate leaders. Two areas where the Modi government has had remarkable success in having its way, or at least has so far remained impervious to criticism, are Kashmir and the economy.

One does not have to be an enthusiast of Article 370 of the Constitution to disagree with Mr. Modi’s policy in that area. First, however irrelevant an erstwhile provision, for the Centre to change the constitutional status of a State without so much as giving notice constitutes an abuse of power. Then came the simultaneous bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir and the conversion of the parts into Union Territories. Finally, the detention of its political leadership, who have not been charged with any wrongdoing, and the communication channels blockade are despotic.

The slowing growth of the economy does not even begin to capture the condition of the unemployed. There is also evidence that consumption expenditure may have declined. Unperturbed by evidence of these phenomena, Mr. Modi continues to assert that the economy is poised to attain the $5 billion mark, and his government has shelved the report that points to the decline in consumption on grounds of “adverse findings”. Few prime ministers have gotten away so easily. In the 1950s, in response to Rammanohar Lohia’s assertion that poverty was not declining, erstwhile Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru constituted a committee headed by India’s pre-eminent statistician to investigate the claim.

Protests that show some truths

Nothing it seemed could unsettle the present leaders of India. That was until its youth had spoken. They have now, and we may be witnessing a transformation of India’s democracy. Starting at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia students in campuses have arisen in protest. There has always been student participation in political movements, but in the past they may have been parochial, even when democratic ideals were at stake. In the 1960s the students of erstwhile Madras State had agitated successfully against the imposition of Hindi as the sole official language; later the students of Osmania University at Hyderabad had agitated for a separate Telangana; and in the 80s the students of Assam succeeded in bringing about the Assam Accord. Now students are agitating for a constitutional democracy expressing their dissent towards the Citizenship Amendment Act which they perceive as blatantly communal.

We cannot say where this will lead us, but their protest shows us some truths. First, it disproves the perception that the present generation is only concerned with entitlements. Many of the campuses on which the protests are taking place are solidly middle class, but the students are protesting the violation of democracy not agitating for privileges for themselves. Second, the campuses where the protests are occurring far outnumber Jamia and Aligarh Muslim University. This busts the idea fashionable in some circles that India has been irretrievably communalised. Finally, the student protests appear to be spontaneous. Political parties of every hue — the nationalists, the secularists and the identity mongers — could not but have taken note.

400,2020/01/02,The need for a single energy ministry,"Five different ministries along with a multitude of regulators govern India’s energy sector. Petroleum and natural gas, coal, renewable energy and nuclear energy have separate ministries or departments. We also have a Ministry of Power, along with State-level bodies that regulate electricity distribution companies, or DISCOMS. Add to this, the presence of different regulators for each type of fuel and energy source which makes it cumbersome for businesses operating in this sector. Further, the petroleum and natural gas sector has two regulators – Directorate General of Hydrocarbons for upstream activities and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board for downstream activities.

Data constraints

There are also issues with data collection. No single agency collects energy data in a wholesome and integrated manner. Data pertaining to consumption are barely available while supply side data collected by agencies of respective ministries are riddled with gaps. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation collates data available from various ministries and conducts surveys at sporadic intervals. On the energy efficiency front, the Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the sole statutory authority with the mandate to regulate energy efficiency on the consumption side. There is no agency or body for the same purpose on the supply side.

This stands in stark contrast to most other nations with their varied energy governance models. Developed and efficient countries such as the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom have their vibrant, diverse and prolific energy sectors administered by a single ministry or department. There are also instances where the energy ministry is in conjunction with other portfolios such as environment, climate change, mines and industry. For example, the U.K. has the “Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy”, France has the “Ministry of the Environment, Energy and Marine Affairs”, Brazil has the “Ministry of Mines and Energy” and Australia has the ‘Ministry of Environment and Energy’. The predominance of unified energy ministries is evident.

The Kelkar Committee in its report “Roadmap for Reduction in Import Dependency in the Hydrocarbon Sector by 2030” (2013) stated that “Multiple ministries and agencies are currently involved in managing energy-related issues, presenting challenges of coordination and optimal resource utilization, hence undermining efforts to increase energy security”.

In the Draft National Energy Policy (NEP), the NITI Aayog has advocated that a Unified Ministry of Energy be created by merging the Ministries of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG), Coal (MoC), New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) and Power (MoP). The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) has been left out since it has implications beyond the scope of energy and involves national security issues. The proposed ministry would have six agencies under it to handle various aspects of the energy sector — Energy Regulatory Agency, Energy Data Agency, Energy Efficiency Agency, Energy Planning and Technical Agency, Energy Schemes Implementation Agency and Energy R&D Agency.

Enabling optimisation

A single unified ministry of energy would help India to have an integrated outlook on energy that would enable us optimise our limited resources to meet the goals of energy security, sustainability and accessibility. In the fast-changing energy landscape of our country, having a single energy ministry would be beneficial as it would allow for a quicker policy response. Formulating an integrated and wholesome energy policy in the current governance structure is a complex and challenging task not only due to lack of coordination among ministries but also due to the absence of good quality consumption data and an inadvertent promotion of their own fuels over other choices, which may not always be the best option.

The present government has already taken some steps towards unifying the governance structure of the energy sector such as appointing a single minister for both MNRE and MoP. This move has been lauded across sections of society as both those sectors are heavily interlinked. Having the same person heading both of these ministries will help resolve long-standing issues faced by both conventional and renewable power generators such as power balancing and transmission infrastructure planning.

The hotly debated issue of non-payment of dues by DISCOMS to the generators might also be resolved with such synergy in administration. In the past too, this government has had the same minister for MNRE, MoP and MoC with great results in village electrification, LED bulb distribution (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All, or UJALA), power sector reforms (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana, or UDAY), coal block e-auctions and alleviation of coal shortages. This demonstrates the intention of the political leadership to reform the energy governance structure.

The ‘Jal Shakti’ example

They have already shown a disposition towards unifying critical ministries. A pertinent example is the newly created Ministry of Jal Shakti which was formed by merging the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation and the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation. The objective of this action is to unify water management functions, treat the issues of water management holistically and ensure better coordination of efforts. This was a crucial decision at a time when nearly 600 million Indians faced “high to extreme water stress”, while 75% households did not have drinking water on their premises.

Though the actions by this government are a step in the right direction, there is a long road ahead. Accepting and implementing the recommendations of the NEP on reforming energy governance, which is to be placed for the approval of the Cabinet soon, would need to be carefully traversed given their hard-hitting implications on the existing bureaucratic structure. But nothing is more important than ensuring energy security, sustainability and accessibility. In this age of energy transition, this can only happen with quick and holistic decision-making as well as providing a level playing field for various fuels, all of which can happen if a single ministry handles the entire sector. Such a Unified Ministry of Energy will not only enable India to keep up with the global energy transition but also to continue to be a leader in adopting cleaner energy sources.

401,2020/01/02,Infrastructure push: On Centre’s ₹102-lakh-crore plan,"For an economy that is tottering, a big bang announcement from the government can sometimes work to turn around sentiment. The unveiling by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Tuesday of a mega push to infrastructure investment adding up to ₹102 lakh crore over the next five years belongs in this category. Projects in energy, roads, railways and urban infrastructure under the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) have been identified by a task force. About 42% of such identified projects are already under implementation, 19% are under development and 31% are at the conceptual stage. The NIP task force appears to have gone project-by-project, assessing each for viability and relevance in consultation with the States. Considering that the NIP will be like a window to the future, a constant review becomes paramount if this is not to degenerate into a mere collation and listing of projects. A periodic review, as promised by the Finance Ministry, is necessary. The government’s push on infrastructure development will not only enable ease of living — such as metro trains in cities and towns — but also create jobs and increase demand for primary commodities such as cement and steel. From this perspective, this push to invest in infrastructure is welcome.

Also Read Core sector output shrank 1.5% in November

Identifying the projects to be put on the pipeline is the easy part. Implementing and commissioning them will be the more difficult one. There are a few hurdles that the NIP task force needs to watch out for. First, the financing plan assumes that the Centre and the States will fund 39% each while the private sector will chip in with 22% of the outlay. Going by the present fiscal situation, it will be no small challenge for the Centre to raise ₹39 lakh crore, even if it is over the next five years. The financial position of States is even more perilous. Second, the ₹22 lakh crore expected from private investment also looks steep considering the lack of appetite for fresh investment by the private sector in the last few years. In fact, this factor has been a major drag on economic growth. Given the scale of investment, debt will play an important role and it remains to be seen if banks have gotten over their apprehensions on infrastructure financing as a major part of their bad loans originated there. Finally, cooperation from States becomes very important in implementing infrastructure projects. The experience on this count has not been very happy till now. While these are genuine obstacles that the task force needs to manage, these should not detract from the need for a concerted effort to invest in infrastructure. The key will be following up and reviewing the pipeline at regular intervals.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/infrastructure-push-the-hindu-editorial-on-centres-102-lakh-crore-plan/article30453765.ece
402,2020/01/02,A persisting variance: On sustainable goals index,"The NITI Aayog’s Sustainable Development Goals Index for 2019, released on Monday, does not reveal any surprising information. The South’s Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka are joined by Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim and Goa as the best performers while the northern/north-central and north-eastern States have been laggardly in achieving the U.N.-mandated goals by 2030. Poor performers such as Uttar Pradesh have shown discernible advances in the indices — measured between 2018-19 — especially in adopting cleaner energy and improving sanitation. But the regional divide is stark in basic livelihood goals such as “eradication of poverty”, and “good health and well being” or even in measures such as “industry, innovation and infrastructure”. This points to variances in both State governance and in administrative structures and implementation of welfare policies. The South, led by Kerala and Tamil Nadu, has done much more in orienting administrative institutions to deliver on basic welfare, leading to actions on health care, education, poverty eradication and hunger, with a governance structure tuned to competitively monitoring actions on these fronts. The converse is true of northern States — Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — where outcomes have remained relatively poor despite there not being much of a difference in the governance structure. The obvious answer to the puzzle could be the presence of historical socio-political movements that have resulted in greater circulation of elites in power and which have addressed issues related to welfare more thoroughly in the South — Kerala and T.N in particular. Yet even these States need to go further in reaching the UN’s SDGs and achieving the living standards of both the first world and other developing nations.

The western States, especially Gujarat and Maharashtra, are also better off in economic growth and industry, indicating a diversified economy, higher employment ratios, skilled labour and better entrepreneurial culture. A major fault-line in India is in achieving gender equality, where barring middling performers such as Himachal Pradesh, Kerala and Jammu & Kashmir, the rest of the country falls short. Low sex ratio (896 females per 1,000 males), poor labour force participation and presence in managerial positions (only 17.5% and 30%, according to the report), high level of informality of labour, a major gender pay gap (females earn 78% of wages earned by males in regular salaried employment), lack of adequate representation in governance (14.4% in Parliament, but 44.4% in local government) besides high crime rates against women and girls are among the major national level indicators that have contributed to this. States need to climb a mountain to achieve gender equality, but immediate steps such as enhancing women’s participation in governance through parliamentary reservations would go a long way in addressing several of the issues faced by them.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-persisting-variance-the-hindu-editorial-on-sustainable-goals-index/article30453785.ece

405,2020/01/02,"T. Nagar e-seva centre has turned into a parking lot, say residents","The e-seva centre at the Chennai Corporation ward office 136, on Masilamani Street in T. Nagar, has turned into a parking lot for two-wheelers.

The centre, launched in 2016, was supposed to be a one-stop shop for getting Aadhaar cards, voter IDs, paying electricity bills, water charges and tax, getting copies of birth and death certificates and also filling online forms for engineering admissions. However, residents complain that centre is no longer functional.

V. Jayaraman of the T. Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said the centre had not been functioning for several months now. “Residents of the area have to now go to different Corporation offices or the thasildar’s office. Even when it was functioning many services were not provided,” he said.

Priya K., a college student, who came to the centre last week to get a voter identification card, was told that the centre had been shut down two months ago as the woman running the centre was on maternity leave. She was told to go to the Kodambakkam zonal office.

On Thursday, an employee at the ward office said the centre had been shut down as the machine did not function. Srinivasan, a resident of Raja Street, said, “I tried to get a copy of my wife’s death certificate some months ago. I went four times but all the time the centre remained locked. Later I had to go to the Saidapet taluka office to get it done.”

406,2020/01/02,Chennai residents demand repairs to OMR-ECR link roads,"Several roads connecting Rajiv Gandhi Salai (OMR) and East Coast Road (ECR) running through Neelankarai and Palavakkam are in a bad shape and need repairs and re-laying. Motorists are forced to take these roads -- Pandian Salai, Periyar Salai and Kamaraj Salai -- to avoid heavy traffic on OMR to reach their destinations.

M. Dhananjayan, a resident of Periyar Salai, said that these are internal roads and are dotted with residential apartments, individual houses and shops and attract a lot of traffic. “The roads are pothole-ridden, and if you don’t concentrate while riding, you will end up falling down due to the craters that are sudden and very deep. Repairs are not taken up on these roads. Some roads have not been laid after the Chennai Corporation took over these areas,” he said.

Residents said that proposals to widen and strengthen these roads to take more vehicles made several years ago, are yet to see the light of day. Both the Chennai Corporation and Highways Department had made announcements at different points of time regarding this.

“There was a plan to widen two existing roads and also lay one road connecting the Thoraipakkam Radial Road and ECR. Wider roads would take more traffic and help take the pressure off OMR since it does not have any connecting grid roads that can be taken by motorists. If you are stuck on OMR in traffic you cannot just take an alternate road since there are none,” said Mythili, another resident.

One proposal is on hold since residents have filed a case against the project. Motorists hope that until the widening happens, at least potholes will be repaired and roads re-laid to ease traffic congestion.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a240xe/article30458249.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02JANTH-ROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-residents-demand-repairs-to-omr-ecr-link-roads/article30458250.ece
407,2020/01/02,Suresh Krishna calls for more Tamil songs in concerts,"Stressing the need for striking a balance between lyrics and music, Suresh Krishna, Chairman, Sundaram Fasteners Ltd, said “when language is not understood, the audience switches off.”

Presiding over the Sadas of the Music Academy on Wednesday, Mr. Krishna made a strong case for including more and more Tamil songs, arguing that “when a song in other than Tamil is rendered music dominates and not the lyrics.”

“There should be a balance between lyrics and music. Music tends to dominate when lyrics are not understood,” he said after conferring the Sangita Kalanidhi award on vocalist S. Sowmya. “Music must touch,” he said and pointed out that “Carnatic music today restricts the audience to a certain section and in my opinion is not desirable.”

Mr. Krishna also made it clear that the Carnatic Trinity could not be replaced as they were part and parcel of the cultural identity of the Tamils, but Tamil songs should be given space. “We should not make Mother Tamil plead. We should respect Tamil. If you want to captivate a larger audience, I personally feel more Tamil songs must be sung,” he said.

To drive home the point, he gave a few examples from Ms. Sowmya’s concert.

Rejecting the argument that all the Tamil poems were not lyrical, he said there were enough of them. “At least there will be 10,000 songs. But they are not sung as frequently as other songs. There are 4,000 Divyaprabandhams, 11,000 Kambaramayana songs, 24,000 Villi Bharatham songs, Thevaram and Thiruvasagam, Thiuppugazh, Papanasam Sivan songs, and Muthaiah Bhagavathar songs,” he said.

Earlier, he presented Sangita Kala Acharya awards to Seetha Narayanan and M.S. Sheela. Nagaswaram player Vyasarpadi G. Kothandaraman and vocalist V. Rajkumar Bharathi received the TTK Awards. The Musicologist award was given to Arati N. Rao.

411,2020/01/02,Work at Parivakkam junction to be completed by Pongal,"Work to lay concrete and strengthen the Parivakkam junction on the Chennai - Bengaluru Highway will be completed before Pongal. Concrete-laying work on both sides for a length of 200m began on December 22.

The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) took up repair work at three junctions — Vanagaram, Velappanchavadi and Parivakkam — following complaints of bad roads.

“These junctions got damaged due to watertankers using them frequently. Each time the vehicles stopped, water would spill onto the bitumen surface from the tankers, which lead to the surface getting damaged. The only way was to divert the traffic to the service lanes and lay the concrete, which was carried out,” said an NHAI official.

The work that began in August, is being carried out at a total cost of ₹9.92 crore. A few days ago, traffic was permitted on one side of the road at Velappanchavadi junction. Repairs on the other side had already been completed and was opened to traffic. “Taking into consideration, the soil condition at this junction, fibre and silica fumes were added to the concrete to achieve the requisite strength,” the official added.

Meanwhile, another contractor is carrying out operation and maintenance of the stretch between Maduravoyal and Sriperumbudur at a cost of ₹8.25 crore. Repair of potholes, patch works, cleaning of road, median cleaning, removal of bushes and painting of median are being taken up.

Jayanthi Velmurugan of Malliga Fancy Store in Vanagaram welcomed the repair works. “They have laid concrete that we use in building construction. That has reduced the potholes at the traffic signals and traffic flow has improved. However, they have dumped construction debris in some places, and those stretches also must be laid with concrete. The dust getting kicked up from the road should be scrubbed and cleaned,” she suggested.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/wi7z7s/article30454893.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THBADROADCONDITIONS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/work-at-parivakkam-junction-to-be-completed-by-pongal/article30454894.ece
412,2020/01/02,Police manage to instil sobriety among New Year revellers,"In a special drive, the Chennai Traffic Police booked over 700 cases for offences ranging from drunken driving to rash driving.

The four main government hospitals in the city received more than 200 persons, including many hurt in road accidents and assaults related to New Year revelry.

In the city’s suburbs, six lost their lives. However, the city police claimed that these were not connected with New Year revelry.

Thangavel, 19, of New Perungalathur, was returning home from Marina when he rammed his bike into a bus plying between Tambaram and Poonamallee near Tambaram bus terminus. He sustained injuries on the head and chest. The police have arrested bus driver Subramani.

Sundar, 47, who was riding his bike on the Ennore-Beach Road, died after his bike collided with another. In Kathirvedu, Sabakar, 31, who was riding a bike, was hit by an unknown vehicle. The police have registered a case. Ramalingam, 40, was run over by a lorry near Puzhal jail. Mohammad, 45, a resident of Porur, was hit by an autorickshaw in Kumananchavadi and died on the way to hospital. An elderly person was also killed in Poonamallee after being hit by an auto. Two inspectors, Jayachitra and Pushparaj, sustained minor injuries in accidents.

Preventive drive

The traffic police divided the city into 10 sectors and 110 vehicle checkpoints were placed. “We had identified 62 bike race-prone zones, including Wallajah Road, Adams Road, Thiru Vi Ka Bridge, Poonamallee High Road, Cathedral Road and New Avadi Road,” said a police source.

A total of 42 drunken driving cases, 63 cases of rash driving, 159 of triple riding, 330 of speeding and 110 miscellaneous cases, including minors driving, were registered prior to 11 p.m. Last year, during the same drive, 263 drunken driving cases, 33 of rash driving, 233 of triple riding and 80 of speeding cases were registered.

Many residents complained of speeding bikes in most parts of the city. “I live along the Old Mahabalipuram Road. On New Year’s eve, I saw policemen warning bikers, on the public announcement system, to ride slowly to avoid accidents. But no one seemed to be bothered. The roaring of bikes was a disturbance,” a resident said.

Fewer injuries

According to officials of GVK-EMRI, which operates the 108 ambulance service, there were a total of 113 road traffic accident cases from midnight to 12 noon on Wednesday in Chennai as against 147 cases last year.

The four GHs received a fewer number of persons injured in accidents when compared to last year. Except for a few persons, who suffered fractures, the severity of injuries was less too, hospital authorities said.

Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital treated 26 persons as out-patients and 22 as in-patients with minor injuries. Royapettah Hospital received 30 patients injured in RTAs and 22 injured in assaults. Kilpauk Medical College Hospital received 38 persons injured in accidents, 43 self-falls and 10 persons with burns that included cracker injuries. Stanley Medical College Hospital treated 30 patients, officials said.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/w7bqr8/article30454883.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02THREVELRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/police-manage-to-instil-sobriety-among-new-year-revellers/article30454884.ece

415,2020/01/02,Hand over 400 kg of firm’s gold to SBI: NCLT,"The Division Bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Chennai, has directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to hand over 400.47 kg of gold seized from Surana Corporation to C. Ramasubramaniam, the company’s liquidator.

It also directed the liquidator to take all precautions to keep the gold in safe custody of State Bank of India.

In 2018, Surana Corporation was brought under the insolvency proceedings in a petition filed by SBI and the total amount of default as on March 2, 2018 was about ₹ 699.25 crore. Other lenders include Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank and Bank of India. Later, liquidation was ordered against Surana Corporation.

In 2011, Surana, which was was in the business of selling the precious metal, imported gold. The CBI seized the gold for alleged violation of import laws. The CBI Court directed it to hand it over to SBI to initiate the insolvency proceedings against Surana Corporation.

However, MEPZ Special Economic Zone, which comes under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry, objected to the release of the gold.

The NCLT ruled that MEPZ is at liberty to proceed against the suspended directors of Surana for any violation of procedure and any penalties could be claimed before the liquidator and not to hold back the asset, which has to be distributed to various stakeholders of the company as envisaged under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy code.

416,2020/01/02,"Two Tangedco workers electrocuted, case registered","Tense moments prevailed in Audiyappa Naicken Street in Parrys after two Tangedco workers were electrocuted while they were working on a transformer on Wednesday afternoon.

According to the police, the names of the victims were given as Udhaya, 45, and Vincent, 40,working in the Sowcarpet East Tangedco office.

They had gone to attend to a complaint. Around 11 a.m., they reportedly switched off the power supply and were working on the transformer.

All of a sudden, the two were electrocuted. While one was thrown away, the other lay dead on the transformer. People present at the spot immediately alerted the Tangedco office and the police about the accident.

The Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services were called for help. The personnel ensured that the supply was completely cut and brought the worker’s body down from the transformer. Both the bodies were sent to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital for postmortem. A case has been registered and further investigation is on.

419,2020/01/02,The new worry of depleting diplomatic capital,"In the initial year of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s first tenure (2014-19), his foreign policy moves were given priority. Putting the past with the United States behind him — it had cancelled his visa for nearly a decade and criticised his actions in Gujarat — Mr. Modi’s government forged an extra close bond with the Barack Obama administration, opening a new chapter in Indo-Pacific policy. With China, he also cast domestic sentiments aside to welcome its President, Xi Jinping to India, following it up with a visit to China. Finally, with India’s neighbours, he signalled a new start from his party, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s traditionally hard-line policies on Pakistan, Bangladesh, even Sri Lanka, putting bilateral ties over domestic concerns.

The contrast between that period and the first year in his second tenure (2019-2020) could not be more pronounced; rather than dealing with bilateral ties, the Ministry of External Affairs and its missions abroad are now fully devoted to dealing with India’s domestic concerns and their fallout. Among them, the decision to amend Article 370 of the Constitution on Jammu and Kashmir, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, 2019, and the proposal for the National Register of Citizens (NRC) have been called into question by several countries and international organisations.

State of U.S., European ties

The impact of these policies has been most keenly felt in ties with the U.S., where bipartisan support for India has been the norm for at least two decades. The whittling away of Democrat support was evident early on during the “Howdy Modi” event in September 2019, where only three out of the two dozen lawmakers at the event were from the Democratic Party; the party, especially under Mr. Obama, had been very supportive of the Modi government. While the ostensible reason was that they did not wish to share a stage with U.S. President Donald Trump, it was significant that even among the five Indian-American lawmakers, only one was present. Nor has the discomfort in Washington been limited to the Opposition party alone. In the weeks that followed “Howdy Modi”, the State Department and several bipartisan committees have issued statements of concern over continued detentions in Kashmir and the CAA, held hearings in the U.S. Congress, and even inserted language on Kashmir into the annual Foreign Appropriations Act for 2020. A resolution urging India to lift restrictions in Kashmir, sponsored by Indian-American lawmaker Pramila Jayapal, now has 29 co-sponsors, including two Republicans, and a lawmaker who had earlier attended “Howdy Modi”.

The same issues found voice in the U.K. Parliament. In the European Parliament, last September, there were also discussions on Kashmir. It also led to heated battles within their polities, as Kashmir became a campaign talking point between Labour and Conservative candidates in the U.K. elections. The Modi government’s invitation to far-right Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) to visit Kashmir (last October) has riled European diplomats from various countries — they have been denied similar access.

Denting Bangladesh relations

In the neighbourhood, the government has upset both friend and foe with its wording of the CAA. Pakistan is predictably angry, while Afghanistan is more muted. But the real damage has been done to ties with Bangladesh. In the past decade, and especially after completing the Land Boundary Agreement, Dhaka and New Delhi had worked hard on building connectivity, opening energy routes, trade and developing travel links. The relationship was seen as a “win-win” in contrast to the preceding years when terror safe-havens and border killings dominated the India-Bangladesh narrative. By clubbing Bangladesh with Pakistan and Afghanistan on treatment of minorities, India has introduced a note of bitterness that is hard to mistake in the bilateral engagement. Some in Sheikh Hasina’s government have pointed out that the Modi government’s desire to naturalise only one group of immigrants from Bangladesh but castigate the others as “illegal immigrants” and “termites” cannot but be seen in a communal light. If India’s motivation was compassion for the religiously persecuted, they ask, then why was the Modi government so impervious to Ms. Hasina’s repeated requests for help in the Rohingya refugee issue?

Regardless of the reasoning, India’s diplomats, including new Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla, who had earlier served in Dhaka, will have their work cut out in repairing the damage. If close friend Bangladesh that defends India at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation feels that India’s actions are religiously discriminatory, it is only a matter of time before others in the Islamic world, most notably the Arab countries, who have been muted so far, will become more vocal. The OIC’s plans for a special meet on Kashmir and the CAA in April 2020, possibly in Islamabad, is one such indicator.

It would be easy to dismiss all of the above with the simple line that they constitute interference in India’s internal affairs. Even if countries issue statements and world bodies pass resolutions on the detentions and the Internet ban in Kashmir, the crackdown in Uttar Pradesh and protests across the country, does New Delhi really need to worry? There are, in fact, a number of reasons why the government must weigh its diplomatic posture on these issues carefully, as all of them are likely to dominate its time in 2020.

Steps that could pack a punch

First, not all statements and resolutions are empty rhetoric, and could lead to worrisome measures against India. The U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) has already recommended sanctions be considered for Home Minister Amit Shah and other officials. While this may be considered an extreme step, even laughable, it must be remembered that it was the USCIRF that first recommended a visa ban against Mr. Modi, as Gujarat Chief Minister, in 2005. To date, he remains the only individual worldwide sanctioned thus under the U.S.’s International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. In the U.S. Congress too, lawmakers can effectively block defence sales to India, or pursue sanctions on the S-400 missile system purchase from Russia, for example, regardless of support in the Trump administration for India.

On the international stage, the United Nations and its affiliated bodies, which often seem toothless, could provide a platform for India to be targeted. In December 2019, a suit by a relatively remote player, the Gambia, ensured that Myanmar’s top leadership was made to appear for a public hearing at the International Court of Justice at The Hague in connection with the Rohingya issue. New Delhi’s break in ties with Turkey and Malaysia for their comments at the UN on Kashmir could also lead to them vetoing India’s legitimate position at the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where it hopes to blacklist Pakistan for terror financing this year.

At the very least, the unrest that has emerged from the policies will lead to a lower number of foreign visitors, and visit cancellations/postponements by leaders, recent examples being Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, or Bangladesh’s Foreign and Home Ministers.

Getting bogged down

The government must also evaluate the toll on its diplomatic resources that have been diverted for much of the year in firefighting negative international opinion. The skills of the Minister of External Affairs, himself a trained diplomat, for example, could be better used than they have been; he has had to give a barrage of interviews to the European and U.S. media and the “think-tank blitz” in Washington and New York to deal with questions about Kashmir and the NRC. Missions everywhere, including in friendly countries, have been overworked, disseminating FAQs and lobbying with lawmakers on Article 370, the Ayodhya verdict and the CAA. Many are occupied martialling their strengths to prevent resolutions with objectionable wording from being drafted, and UN Security Council meetings from being held.

Finally, the government must consider the impact of its domestic actions on India’s diplomatic capital. This capital is a complex combination of the goodwill the country has banked on over decades as a democratic, secular, stable power, bilateral transactions it can conduct in the present, and the potential it holds for future ties, particularly in terms of its economic and geopolitical strengths. At a time when the western world is in flux, the economy under stress and the rules-based order in recess, India’s diplomatic capital is being depleted at a rate unseen in the last few decades. And to paraphrase Cassius in Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar”, the fault may not lie in our diplomatic stars, but in ourselves, and the problematic message the government is now trying to convey.

420,2020/01/02,On-screen abuse,"It is refreshing to find that someone is calling out our ‘masala’ films for what they are: an attempt to mainstream patriarchal and regressive cultural conceptions of what gender relations should look like (OpEd, “Standing up to on-screen abuse”, January 1). Films are not just for entertainment. They serve as a backdrop for public discourse, have substance to impress upon young minds and can be powerfully self-reflective. It is time that people associated with a project take ownership of the message they send out to society.

421,2020/01/02,Test for diplomacy,"The recent “declaration” by Pakistan of an OIC meeting to discuss India’s domestic agenda indicates another strategy to “bleed India through a thousand cuts”. Despite India’s various attempts to strengthen ties with West Asian countries, this baffling manoeuvre, if true, calls into question the reach of Indian diplomacy. There needs to be a calibrated approach in diplomacy to counter these moves (Editorial, January 1).

422,2020/01/02,Constitution’s essence,"It is ‘everybody’s Constitution’; it is indeed the Constitution of (We) the people of India. The Constitution of India is ‘common sense’ codified, which is superior to any ideology, trumps fanaticism and bigotry in a jiffy, and with which the ordinary citizens of India are perfectly at home with, thanks to the principle of equality enshrined in Article 14. The Constitution not only represents the collective wisdom of the people of India but also the doubly-distilled wisdom of the finest legal minds and jurispurdential experts comprising the great Constituent Assembly of India. It is timeless (Editorial page, “It is everybody’s Constitution”, January 1).

The CAA’s plain meaning is that non-Muslims of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan can become Indian citizens provided they are religiously persecuted. The secular fabric of our Constitution is more in favour of permitting such an eventuality than denying it. Setting aside the Constitution and the Supreme Court of India for a moment, such a gesture cannot be faulted because the whole intention is to ensure that there are no illegal immigrants in India who may be a national threat and to underline the fact that India does not become a refugees’ den. It is a fallacious argument that the present dispensation is trying to divide our country on religious lines. The Supreme Court’s likely verdict will hopefully silence many protesters.

423,2020/01/02,Madurai set to run plastic-free marathon,": “Going by the registrations, not less than 5,000 people are expected to run the marathon on Sunday and we are happy how it is inching closer to our aim of turning into one of the biggest annual events in the region,” says Dr.Hema Sathish, the key planner, coordinator and everything else required to organise such mega events rolled into one. “It has earned lot of goodwill and now figures in the calendar of professional marathons conducted across the country,” says her husband Dr.Sathish Devadoss.

Among the participants will be R Selvakumar, all prepared to run his fourth consecutive marathon. “I am excited to be able to do something normal like all others,” says the 56-year-old who is visually challenged. After successfully running 21 km in the previous three years, he says, the feat makes him feel proud.

Born with night blindness, Selvakumar works as lift operator at Devadoss MultiSpeciality Hospital, helmed by doctor couple Hema and Sathish, as Managing and Medical Directors respectively. They have the support of their entire team of employees to either run, manage or volunteer at the marathon. The training Selvakumar undergoes is the evening walk at Walker’s Club led by a core team and a trainer from Devadoss Hospital two months prior to the event. Seeing him walk, jog and run, many regular walkers at the park have got inspired and enrolled for the marathon.

“I do get tired while running and slow down when needed. It is the happiness of reaching the finishing line that keeps me going,” says Selvakumar who has been clocking a little less than three hours to complete the half marathon.

Like him, there are are quite a few regulars who have been participating in the Madurai marathon since 2017. “I was 20 years old when I came to the city for a job from my hometown Kottayam,” says K Pretty, working as physiotherapist at Pink gym. “I remember seeing an ad for the marathon in the first year. Getting bored alone on a Sunday at home, I just went thinking I will watch what happens. But seeing other young and old runners, I got tempted and went for on-the-spot registration and with much ease ran five km,” she says. The satisfaction of touching the finishing line was enough for Pretty to return in 2018 and 2019 for 10.5 km. This year as she celebrates her 23rd birthday, she is taking her friends from the gym. “I run for fun and feel very fit and fresh,” she says.

Paramesh M, IT professional with Honeywell, has been into group runs for a decade. He ran 10.5 km in the first Madurai Marathon and felt “refreshed and recharged”. “It is good to be health conscious and maintain your physique,” says Paramesh, who stays in practice with his regular morning walks. Last two years, he completed the half marathon in little over two hours. “The long run calms me down. I don’t participate to compete but I know I am bettering my timing each year,” he adds. As an organiser of sports activities in his company, Paramesh has motivated 50 employees and their family members to participate in this year’s marathon.

This is the best weather to run and there have been enquiries from professional runners from Kenya, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and Nepal, says Sathish. Hema quips, people experience a sense of pride when they run a marathon. The couple ensure that everybody who participates or comes to cheer returns with a valuable health tip. If in the previous years, the themes varied from healthy body and healthy nation to cleanliness, this year’s theme is “run to save a life.”

In the run-up to the marathon, brief training demos in Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) were given at various public places, schools and colleges by teams from Devadoss Hospital. CPR is a vital medical assistance that can be given in an emergency situation. “At the inaugural and valedictory sessions of the marathon too, the CPR training will be demonstrated for all participants while at multiple stalls there will be ongoing demos too for general public who come to watch and cheer while the marathon is on,” says Sathish.

Every participant will be given a free sapling along with all the other goodies, certificates and medals they take home after successfully completing the marathon. “We will also distribute seed balls among the visitors as part of our green campaign,” adds Hema.

The runners will enjoy the scenic backdrop of the green Alagar Hills and by keeping the marathon free of any plastic at hydration points and providing breakfast on leaf-plates , we hope the realisation for a clean and green environment and healthy ourselves will remain strong in each individual who joins us on Sunday,” says Sathish. “When you run the Madurai marathon, the simple takeaway is to be a hero and save lives,” adds Hema.

424,2020/01/02,Irish PM leaves for Delhi after celebrations in Goa,"Ireland’s Prime Minister Leo Varadkar left for New Delhi on Wednesday afternoon after New Year celebrations in Goa, an official said.

Mr. Varadkar, who is on a private visit to India, stayed at a plush resort in North Goa district to welcome 2020. He had arrived in the coastal State on Monday.

“His entire trip was private and he did not even avail of any police security for it,” a senior police official said. The Irish Prime Minister flew in an AirAsia flight from the Dabolim airport in Goa to New Delhi in the afternoon, the official added.

On Sunday, Mr. Varadkar, who is of Indian origin, visited his ancestral village of Varad in Sindhudurg district in Maharashtra along with his family members. It was his first visit to the village, said Mr. Varadkar, who became the Prime Minister of Ireland in June 2017. His father Ashok Varadkar, a doctor, moved to the United Kingdom in the 1960s.

The visit was a “special moment” as three generations of his family gathered at Varad, the Irish Prime Minister said after the villagers felicitated him.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6ox63w/article30456801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMLEOVARADKAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/irish-pm-leaves-for-delhi-after-celebrations-in-goa/article30456802.ece
425,2020/01/02,Organisers accuse Mumbai Police of ‘sabotaging’ anti-CAA agitation,"The Joint Action Committee (JAC), which has been at the forefront of organising protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and related issues, released a strongly worded statement on Tuesday night, accusing the Mumbai Police of ‘trying to sabotage’ their recent protest.

The agitation, which was held at Azad Maidan on December 27, was planned as a rally — Inquilab Morcha — from Byculla to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, after the police denied permission, it was changed to a peaceful protest at Azad Maidan, which witnessed participation in large numbers.

The JAC had planned another event — Jashn-e-Ekta concert — at Carter Road on Tuesday, which was supposed to be a song and poetry recitation event to raise awareness of the CAA, the National Registry of Citizens, and the police action on protesters across the country. The police, however, did not issue permission and it had to be cancelled.

In a series of tweets from their official handle on Tuesday night, JAC said, “The denial of permission by Mumbai Police for jashn-e-ekta concert is unfortunate. While we are grateful to Mumbai Police for maintaining peace in the city during anti-CAA protests, it is important to highlight how it tried to sabotage Inquilab Morcha held at AzadMaidan on Friday as well.”

JAC talked about how the permission for Inquilab Morcha was denied citing security concerns, traffic issues, and challenges in crowd management. “However, in the recent past several large rallies, including Kisan March, Maratha Morcha & the protest against death of Rohith Vemula, have followed this very route. Besides, almost all of the anti-CAA rallies in the city’s suburbs & rest of the state were peaceful & disciplined,” the tweets said.

The organisation alleged that the police tried to sabotage the Azad Maidan protest. “To begin, the police roped in some of self-anointed leaders of Muslim community in the city to dissuade organisers from carrying out the rally. Two days before the protest at meeting of Muslim organisations in Khilafat House, these leaders resorted to fear-mongering about the event. However, they were bogged down due to overwhelming public opinion in its favour. The next day, there were identical stories in Urdu media proclaiming that the police had denied permission to the rally, even though the approval process was still on. The stories were clearly planted, as they cited unnamed police sources. This despite the fact that the organisers hadn’t received any communication from the police till then,” JAC tweeted.

Making a direct accusation against Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve, JAC tweeted, “The same day, while organisers discussed possibility of carrying out rally, police Commissioner Sanjay Barve conducted meeting with some Muslim ‘religious scholars’ in Nagpada to pour cold waters over community’s concerns regarding CAA-NRC & discourage frm participating. At the meeting, the commissioner proclaimed that CAA & NRC won’t affect Muslims in India. This statement is not only misleading but also unbecoming of senior police official, who should be focusing on carrying out responsibility of maintaining law and order and not giving political speeches.”

Mr. Barve is also alleged to have dissuaded the community from taking to streets against the CAA and the NRC by saying Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has already announced that the NRC won’t be implemented in the State.

“If you have anything to say, pray to God, said police chief...Barve also tried to discredit the anti-CAA movement, saying that most of those seeking permission for rally are from ‘left’. This despite the fact that the organisers belong to a diverse ideological spectrum including Ambedkarism and Islamism. We know their backgrounds and their intent, he said in a blatant attempt to smear a student-led non-political effort,” JAC tweeted.

The JAC also alleged that the police detained volunteers who were campaigning for the rally in Nagpada and Byculla, citing their prohibitory orders against unlawful assembly.

426,2020/01/02,"Upset MLAs continue to sulk, portfolio allocation today","Portfolios to the newly sworn in ministers in the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government will be announced on Thursday, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, all three MVA allies continued to face discontent over the allocation of Cabinet berths.

Leaders of the Shiv Sena, Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) met for over four hours on Wednesday evening to finalise portfolio distribution. After the meeting, Mr. Pawar said, “There could [still] be certain demands, but it is better not to stretch things to the breaking point. The portfolio distribution is final and will be announced on Thursday evening.”

Earlier in the day, senior ministers of the three parties had to come out claiming “all is well” and “‘everyone cannot be accommodated” to pacify upset leaders. Of the three, the Sena seems to have the highest number of upset MLAs, with some openly questioning the party’s decision.

Bhaskar Jadhav, the Sena MLA from Guhagar in Ratnagiri, said, “I don’t know the reasons for denying me a ministerial berth. I will have to ask Uddhavji if I fell short somewhere … I don’t know what happened at the last minute.” Mr. Jadhav said he has sought an appointment to meet Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. The MLA had left the NCP for the Sena days before the elections.

Non-Sena MLAs chosen

According to Sena sources, the induction of three Independents — Shankarrao Gadakh, Bachhu Kadu and Rajendra Patil-Yadravkar — from the party’s quota forced out some Sena MLAs.

Tanaji Sawant of Bhoom-Paranda in Osmanabad on Wednesday reached Mr. Thackeray’s residence, Matoshri, but was unable to meet him. Sources said the miffed Mr. Sawant, the water conservation minister in the last Cabinet, has informed the CM he won’t be coming back to seek a berth.

Former minister of State for finance Deepak Kesarkar told reporters, “I do not know the reason for not inducting me into the Cabinet. Neither did I violate any party order, nor do I have any allegations against me.”

Other hopefuls who were denied ministerial berths are Sunil Prabhu (Dindoshi), Ravindra Waikar (Jogeshwari), Sunil Raut (Bhandup), Pratap Sarnaik (Thane), Prakash Abitkar (Radhanagri-Kolhapur), Ashish Jaiswal (Ramtek-Nagpur), Sanjay Shirsat (Aurangabad) and Sanjay Raimulkar (Buldhana).

Earlier in the day, Congress minister Balasaheb Thorat met Mr. Thackeray to demand an additional portfolio, either rural development or agriculture, for his party. Sources close to the CM, however, said it would be difficult to make changes.

Mr. Pawar said it is not possible to satisfy everyone in a three-party government. “But we have spoken to people and everything is under control,” he said. State Finance Minister Jayant Patil, too, said everything was fine within the party.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/upset-mlas-continue-to-sulk-portfolio-allocation-today/article30455310.ece
427,2020/01/02,City begins the year at 15 degrees Celsius,"The long-awaited winter finally arrived on Wednesday, with both maximum and minimum temperatures dipping in the past two days.

At 15 degrees Celsius, Mumbai woke up to the coldest day this new year with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting a further dip in temperature for Thursday. While the Santacruz observatory recorded 15 degrees Celsius, the Colaba observatory recorded a minimum temperature of 17 degrees Celsius. In 2018, the lowest minimum temperature was recorded on December 28 at 14.4 degrees Celsius.

According to the IMD, around Mumbai Metropolitan Region, Panvel was the coldest at 11.03 degrees Celsius. Under the Brihanamumbai Municipal Corporation limits, Borivali (East) recorded 13.19, Kandivali (East) 13.77 degrees Celsius, Malad (West) 16.12 degrees Celsius, Bandra Kurla Complex 16.27 degrees Celsius, Andheri (East) 17.69 degrees Celsius, Mazgaon 17.38 degrees Celsius, Worli 20.19 degrees Celsius, and Colaba 19.67 degrees Celsius.

IMD officials said rain, a drop in temperature over the northern plains and snowfall along the Himalayan range had resulted in cold northerly winds blowing over Mumbai, leading to the fall in maximum and minimum temperatures. IMD’s forecast for Thursday was a maximum of 28 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 14 degrees Celsius.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/city-begins-the-year-at-15-degrees-celsius/article30455300.ece
428,2020/01/02,"Soon, you can wait for your train in style at CSMT","Passengers travelling from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) will soon be able to wait in a world class lounge which is being set up at the station.

The Central Railway (CR) has awarded a contract to build, operate and maintain the lounge. The contractor will pay the CR ₹8 lakh per annum for the same. “The contractor will refurbish the existing air-conditioned (AC) waiting room and provide modern facilities like Wi-Fi and television screens,” a senior CR official said.

Passengers with reserved tickets will be allowed access for a charge of ₹10 per hour. The existing AC waiting room is currently situated along the corridor that connects platform 18 with main entrance to CSMT. CR officials said the lounge could be accessed by all passengers as it is centrally located. The new waiting lounge will also contain a screen with the trains arriving at various platforms. The new lounge is expected to be thrown open by the end of January.

CR officials said that typically waiting rooms were built and maintained by the Railways and were additional burden on its coffers. Since the Railways are currently facing a funds crunch due to a dip in revenue, the scheme is being undertaken under the non-fare revenue bracket. This is the latest in a series of initiatives of the CR to shore up its non-fare revenue.

“Our aim is to provide better passenger amenities at our stations. If the model is successful we will explore setting up similar lounges at other stations where long-distance passenger trains halt or terminate,” Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, CR, said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/7ywuwm/article30455255.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02bmCst-waiting-room,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/soon-you-can-wait-for-your-train-in-style-at-csmt/article30455256.ece
429,2020/01/02,Gujarat plans to double Garvi Gurjari stores across India,"The Gujarat government has announced plans to double the number of Garvi Gurjari outlets, which showcase and retail traditional handicrafts, artefacts and clothing made by the State’s artisans.

The State’s Cottage Industries Department runs 25 such outlets in eight States across India, and the plan is to add another 25 in the near future.

Recently, the Gujarat government opened a new showroom at Juhu to extend the brand’s presence. The store operates under the banner of Gujarat State Handloom and Handicraft Development Corporation (GSHHDCL), a State government undertaking.

Dharmendrasingh Jadeja, Minister of State, Cottage Industries, Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection, government of Gujarat, said, “Our showrooms are getting good response as all the products are made by the artisans and artists from various districts of Gujarat.”

He said the main objective of expanding the retail network is to encourage the artisans and their art form as well as to enhance their income.

Besides income from showroom sales, the artisans and their groups are given subsidies, soft loans and other facilities by GSHHDCL, which is also helping them sell their products at exhibitions.

“The products in the showrooms are of high quality and were once used by royal families. Through these showrooms, we are taking these products to the people at rates that are 35-40% lower than market rates,” the minister said.

Shankarbhai R. Dalwadi, Chairman, GSHHDCL, said artisans from the State have been provided with facilities for production of handmade products.

430,2020/01/02,Finding ways of healing geopathic stress,"Ancient literature indicates that while planning a township, many civilisations in Germany, India and other parts of the world first let cows, horses and sheep graze at the site before deciding the location, says Ajay Poddar, a businessman and civil engineer from IIT Delhi.

Ever wondered why children and animals avoid sitting or sleeping at certain places, or why anthills and beehives come up at certain locations? Or why, out of six machines of the same make installed at the same time at the same location, only one breaks down repeatedly, inconveniencing the plant operator and causing losses to the factory owner?

To find an answer to these questions, Mr. Poddar used his experiences and carried out research both in India and abroad. The businessman says he established that the areas avoided by animals and children have negative radiations emitting from the core of the earth. This, he says, is called geopathic stress — the idea that earth energies affect human well-being.

Eventually, Mr. Poddar and architect Manisha Matanhelia created material composites to change the nature of the radiations and make them harmless to people, animals, plants and even machines, and in the process create healthy spaces.

The origin

It all started in 1989, when soon after setting up an LPG cylinder manufacturing plant at Sikanderabad district of Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Poddar witnessed a technologically inexplicable breakdown in one of the units, while other machines of the same make were working perfectly.

Since he could not change his plant layout, he started looking for other solutions. He studied and funded research on ancient sciences and modern technology to find out the reason for such an occurrence.

“Research at many churches, temples, forts and monuments revealed that they were built factoring in these principles [of geopathic stress], though there was no documentation to show how it was done. These include the Duomo in Milan, the Chartres cathedral in France, Mamallapuram and Gingee Fort in India, and the Acropolis in Greece,” Mr. Poddar said.

According to Mr. Poddar, animals do not graze at places where there are negative geopathic stresses because they have a sensitivity to avoid such negative zones. “As a result, our ancestors knew where and how to build living and working spaces. They built walls or kept open and infrequently occupied public spaces on the affected zones.”

He said, “With surveys, it has been found that more than 20% of the earth’s surface is affected by geopathic stresses. Research in Germany, France, U.K., Austria and U.S. has shown strong correlation to cancer, blood pressure, skin diseases and stress-related diseases to prolonged exposure to them.”

After using the material composites at his plant, Mr. Poddar implemented these solutions at the houses of friends and relatives with great success.

Soon, he co-founded a company with Ms. Matanhelia, Syenergy Environics Ltd., which detects geopathic stress lines and installs non-intrusive solutions at important installations like refineries, steel, power, aluminium plants, airports, educational and social institutions, industries, hospitals, hotels, corporate offices and even at homes.

While implementing the solutions in homes, they realised that often, the residents’ ailments like pain and sleeplessness were directly related to geopathic stress zones crossing the area of the bed or the study table.

In plants and factories, despite machines being of the same make and purchased at the same time, some of them were breaking down more often than others. Most of the times, these faulty machines were in geopathic stress zones. After correcting the negative impact, their breakdowns reduced, leading to higher productivity, Mr. Poddar said.

The company, through special devices, records pulse/ heart rates of people, breakdown records of machinery and health, and attrition before and after applying the solution. “More than 6,000 types of data from people indicate a substantial decrease in pulse rates after the correction, which means lower environmental stress on them without making any lifestyle changes,” Mr. Poddar, who is the managing director of Syenergy Environics Ltd., said.

Mobile phone chip

In 2010, when many of their customers expressed concern about their children’s obsession with mobile phones and other electronic gadgets and how it might be harming them, the company came up with Envirochip. The product is based on the same philosophy of changing the nature of harmful radiations instead of reducing or altering them.

“The challenge was how to test it, as the solutions were non-electrical and did not involve any change in values. The approach again was to change the nature of the radiation so that it was not harmful to people, who were not likely to reduce use or exposure to electrosmog,” Mr. Poddar said.

He said excessive exposure to Wi-Fi radiation and electrosmog can cause glioma (cancer of the brain), skin rashes, stress, loss of immunity, reduction in sperm count and hearing loss. He said people do not heed recommendations of cell phone manuals, which urge users to text more than talk, use hands-free, keep the device 10 mm away from the body (not in shirt or pant pocket) and not talk more than six minutes at a time.

He said their research has been extensively tested and the results published in international journals like JBISE, and MIT’s Technology Review. Today, over 2,000 establishments covering 100 million sq.ft have implemented their solution, Environics, and more than two million people are using Envirochip.

Mr. Poddar said, many of the company’s corporate clients have found improvement in attrition rate, while public sector refineries and steel plants have been able to reduce breakdowns after correction. Hundreds of people have said they feel less fatigued at the end of the day and have better sleep quality after corrections at their office and homes, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/oi3nmq/article30455237.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Mr-Ajay-Poddar,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/finding-ways-of-healing-geopathic-stress/article30455238.ece
431,2020/01/02,‘Right kind of mattress crucial to fighting sleep deprivation’,"Most Indians know this, but research has only confirmed just how sleepless we are as a nation: a 2016 report by Fitbit said India is the world’s second most sleep-deprived country after Japan. And according to ‘The Great Indian Sleep Scorecard’ compiled by new age firm Wakefit Innovations Pvt. Ltd. in 2019, almost one in five Indians suffers from insomnia, and 90% people in the country wake up once or twice at night. The Wakefit study covered 16,000 people.

While the benefits of sleep are well known, the lack of sleep has far more dangerous consequences, including the risk of obesity and heart disease. While the duration of sleep is one part of it, the quality of sleep is another issue altogether. The uneven distribution of pressure when adopting wrong sleep postures can give people back ache, neck pain or even hip issues. Therefore, it is necessary to have the right kind of mattress that ensures the body is supported well, even during movements of sleep, said Chaitanya Ramalingegowda, co-founder and director, Wakefit.

While foam mattresses are used to enhance the quality of sleep, memory foam is recommended to enjoy a restful and uninterrupted night’s sleep, he said.

“Memory foam mattresses take the shape of the body when a person lays down on it, thereby enabling equal distribution of pressure across the mattress. This, in turn, increases blood circulation and enhances the quality of sleep,” Mr. Ramalingegowda said. People must avoid consuming alcohol and coffee and engaging with electronic gadgets before they go to sleep, he said.

Wakefit helps people get quality sleep through its scientifically-developed mattresses and pillows.

It started in 2016 with its own manufacturing unit in Bengaluru, and has been growing threefold year on year. The company is expected to close FY20 with revenues of ₹200 crore, which is projected to grow to ₹400 crore in FY21.

The online-only company delivers its products all over the country through its online platform as well as through Amazon, Flipkart and Pepperfry. Almost four lakh customers have been serviced over three years.

As the affinity towards e-commerce grows, the company is looking at a larger presence in the enhanced sleep space. “As we expand, we will be investing in technologies that will improve production efficiencies as well as achieve scale at a rapid pace,” Mr. Ramalingegowda said. “New product portfolios and variations in existing portfolios are the key elements of our expansion plan,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/e5qc7p/article30455199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1BMChaitanya-Ramalingegowda,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/right-kind-of-mattress-crucial-to-fighting-sleep-deprivation/article30455200.ece
432,2020/01/02,‘VBA foiled move to spark riots at Bhima-Koregaon’,"Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar on Wednesday claimed that his party and the allies of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government foiled a move by certain people to politicise the Bhima-Koregaon battle celebrations and spark riots this year.

Mr. Ambedkar was speaking after paying obeisance at the Ranstambh or victory pillar in Perne on the 202nd anniversary of the historic 1818 battle of Bhima-Koregaon. The celebrations went off without incident under taut police vigil. Besides the 5,000 policemen of the district police force, 1,500 home guards and 12 to 15 SRPF companies were deployed on the occasion, taking to the total force manning the crowds up to 10,000 personnel.

Mr. Ambedkar said, “At the time of the Namantar (name change) movement in 1977-78 to rename Marathwada University in Aurangabad as Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar University, there were politically engineered riots across the State, with atrocities on Dalits. This was due to the changed political scenario in the State at the time. Similarly, the changed political scenario this time [the ascendancy of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014], too, led to the orchestration of the Bhima-Koregaon riots in 2018 with a view to make political gain.” However, the VBA chief, in a thinly veiled jibe at the BJP, said the right-wing party’s support to riot mongers was foiled owing to the efforts of the VBA and political parties currently in the ruling government.

“Due to the transformed political scenario today, the people who were behind the 2018 riots and who were shielded by the then government, find themselves in a tough position when that government is no longer in power,” Mr. Ambedkar said.

He further expressed satisfaction with the security arrangements, remarking that the police and the district administration had made extensive arrangements to preclude any untoward incident.

“The police have also kept up a strict vigil on certain trouble mongers and have either detained them or barred them from entering Bhima-Koregaon,” Mr. Ambedkar said.

Earlier, a veritable sea of Buddhist pilgrims, representatives of Ambedkarite outfits, politicians, students and other visitors congregated near the 60-foot obelisk to pay homage to the fallen soldiers in the 1818 battle. Along with Mr. Ambedkar, Deputy Chief Minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar and Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment and Republican Party of India (A) president Ramdas Athawale visited the spot.

Clashes between two communities had marred the bicentenary celebrations of the battle, leading to massive destruction of property of members of the Dalit community besides dramatically heightening social tensions across Maharashtra.

Speaking to reporters after visiting the victory pillar, Mr. Pawar said he came to offer tributes on behalf of the people of Maharashtra. “This pillar has a rich history and every year lakhs of people come here. The resting place of Chhatrapati Sambhaji [Shivaji’s son], too, is nearby [at Vadhu Budruk village], So, I have come to pay homage to both the martyrs of the battle as well as Chhatrapati Sambhaji’s valour… Some untoward incidents marred the celebrations two years ago, but the present government is taking the utmost care and a massive security deployment is in place to prevent any law and order situation. I urge people coming here to pay homage and to maintain peace and not place faith in rumours,” said Mr. Pawar.

The obelisk is dedicated to the bravery of the Mahar soldiers who fought against the Peshwa forces in the 1818 battle. While the outcome of the battle was inconclusive, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar’s visit to the place on January 1, 1927, revitalised its memory for the Dalit community, making it a rallying point and an assertion of pride.

The police and the district administration have been extra vigilant to preclude a recurrence of the violent clashes between two social groups that had marred the bicentenary celebrations of the battle on January 1, 2018.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fqscu3/article30455179.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMKOREGAON1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vba-foiled-move-to-spark-riots-at-bhima-koregaon/article30455180.ece

The centre will offer medical, legal as well as psychological support under one roof.

Dr. Pallavi Saple, dean of JJ Hospital, said the centre will remain open 24x7. “A victim can walk in at any hour. Their privacy will be taken care of as all the procedures from counselling and medical tests to police examination will be done under one roof, ” she said.

The hospital also has a centre for acid attack victims that has been functional for the past six months. “Psychiatric counselling is crucial in such cases. Doctors from the forensic department also come into the picture to gather evidence, and then there is the aspect of providing legal advice to the victims as well as social support. We will ensure that all these aspects are covered at the centre,” said Dr. Abhijit Joshi, media coordinator of the hospital. He said the Collector and district women and child welfare officer will supervise the OSCC and seek assistance from non-governmental organisations for the victims’ rehabilitation and employment.

The city’s first such centre was inaugurated at the civic-run KEM Hospital in September.

434,2020/01/02,Pune Police win Twitter game on New Year’s Eve,"A Twitter user thought he was being funny when he tried to troll the Pune Police on Tuesday. His tweet, however, led to an exchange between him, the Pune Police, the Maharashtra Police and other Twitter users that had the cyberspace in splits.

The exchange began with the Pune Police tweeting from their official handle, @PuneCityPolice, warning people to stay away from drugs on New Year’s Eve. The tweet, for poetic effect, named cannabis, marijuana and mephedrone.

Soon after, a Twitter user, identified as Gabriel, replied saying, “Guys LSD is allowed.” To everyone’s surprise, the Pune Police replied to his tweet with “Tell us where to find it? ;-) ”

The Maharashtra Police, too, threw its hat in the ring, quoting the Pune Police’s reply and tweeting, “We could arrange the ‘pick up’ anywhere in the state!”

As the tweets started gathering attention, Gabriel tweeted, “I’m stayin’ in my bed from10 to 5 I swear (sic),” to which the Maharashtra Police responded, “Not fair, we were looking forward to an eventful #NewYearsEve :-( (sic)”

Within hours, screenshots of the exchange started doing the rounds on other social media platforms, while on Twitter, the police continued to get amused accolades. Others soon jumped into the fray. One user tweeted, “Please tell us the location if you find it, for research purposes.”

The Pune Police replied, “We could tutor you personally. Visit any police station of your preference.”

Another user said, “Agar maine aap logo ko Adda bataya toh 10 pudiya meri? Chalega na Sir? (If I tell you the location, I get to keep 10 pouches. Is that okay, sir?)”

The Pune Police responded, “Aap saare rakh lena. Hum bas aapko rakh lenge. Chalega na sir? (You keep all of it. We’ll keep you. Is that okay, sir?)”

Pune Commissioner K. Venkatesham said the purpose was to emphasise on the rules while keeping the celebratory mood of New Year’s Eve intact.

“We wanted to communicate in a way that could best reach the target audience, which was the youth. At the same time we wanted to remind them about what they should not be doing,” he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-police-win-twitter-game-on-new-years-eve/article30455165.ece
435,2020/01/02,No maintenance for wife and child if adultery is proved: HC,"The Bombay High Court recently upheld the law and said when allegations of adultery are proven, a man does not have to pay his former wife and her child maintenance.

Justice Nitin Sambre was hearing a criminal petition filed by an ex-wife in 2016 challenging the cancellation of maintenance of ₹500 to her and ₹400 to her son by her ex-husband.

The couple got married on May 6, 1980, but the man divorced the wife on April 27, 2000, under Section 13 (divorce) of the Hindu Marriage Act on grounds of adultery.

Earlier, the woman was granted ₹150 and her son ₹25 as compensation, which she sought to enhance. Her application was allowed on August 12, 2010, and the magistrate enhanced the compensation to ₹500 and ₹400 for the ex-wife and son respectively. The magistrate also rejected the application filed by the man for cancellation of maintenance under Section 125 (order for maintenance of wives, children and parents) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

Thereafter, the man filed a revision application for cancellation of maintenance, which was allowed. It is this application that the ex-wife challenged before the HC.

The advocate appearing for the former husband informed the court that he had initiated divorce proceedings as the allegation of adultery was proved against his former wife. He also said under sub-section 4 of Section 125 of the CrPC, the ex-wife and their son are not entitled to maintenance.

The sub-section reads, “No wife shall be entitled to receive an allowance from her husband under this section if she is living in adultery, or if, without any sufficient reason, she refuses to live with her husband, or if they are living separately by mutual consent.”

The High Court dismissed the plea.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jcdxs7/article30455162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMBOMBAYHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/no-maintenance-for-wife-and-child-if-adultery-is-proved-hc/article30455163.ece
436,2020/01/02,IndiGo flight to Singapore diverted to Nagpur,"An IndiGo flight from Mumbai to Singapore was diverted to Nagpur following a suspected oil leak on Wednesday.

The aircraft, an Airbus 320neo fitted with a Pratt and Whitney engine, took off from Mumbai at 2.12 a.m. and landed in Nagpur after about 45 minutes of being in the air. An IndiGo spokesperson said the aircraft had since been grounded at Nagpur for a technical inspection.

“Another aircraft was brought in from Hyderabad and passengers were flown to Singapore,” the spokesperson said. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said it would call for a report on the incident.

On November 25, the DGCA had barred IndiGo from operating the Airbus A320 and 321neo aircraft with turbine blades built with titanium, which are prone to damage and lead to a midair engine shutdown. The airline will have to replace such aircraft with sturdier engine turbine blades built with nickel-chromium alloy, according to a directive issued by the aviation regulator.

On January 1, IndiGo, the country’s largest airline, had over 250 aircraft in its fleet after inducting at least four new ones on December 31.

The airline, which has a domestic market share of more than 47%, is also the first Indian carrier to have this fleet size. Recently, it also became the first airline to operate 1,500 flights per day.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/indigo-flight-to-singapore-diverted-to-nagpur/article30455156.ece
437,2020/01/02,Ghatkopar residents come back to burgled houses,"Several residents of Sainath Nagar in Ghatkopar were in for a rude shock after celebrating New Year’s Eve, as they returned to find their houses burgled on Wednesday morning. While the police have only received five complaints so far, residents said at least 11 houses have been targeted.

According to the residents, the burglaries were committed some time between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m., while most of them were out to ring in the new year. A preliminary estimate by the police places the value of stolen articles at ₹30,000.

Pooja Sawant, a resident, said she had gone to her native place for the occasion and returned to see that the lock to her main door was broken. “The thieves could only break the main door’s lock, but were unable to enter my house as I had also put locks on the doors of all the rooms,” she said.

Another resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “The thieves broke into my house and decamped with ₹10,000 in cash and a mobile phone. We have requested the police officials to trace the location of the phone, but it has been switched off since morning.”

The police said the precision with which all the burglaries were executed indicates prior planning and reconnaissance. “We suspect that some sophisticated tools were used to break into the houses, as no one in the locality seems to have heard anything. The thieves seem to have been either watching the area for some time or had help from someone from the locality, as they knew exactly which houses would be unoccupied,” an officer with the Ghatkopar police station said.

Shiraz Ahmed, who runs a laundry in the area, said, “The area was very lively till 2 a.m. as everyone was celebrating New Year’s Eve and bursting crackers. The burglars definitely struck between 2 a.m. and 5 a.m.”

The police have registered cases of burglary against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code and are scanning CCTV camera footage from the locality and surrounding areas. Officers said several residents were yet to return home as they had gone out of station, and might register complaints after they are back.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/at7ik3/article30455144.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMHOUSEBREAKIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ghatkopar-residents-come-back-to-burgled-houses/article30455145.ece
438,2020/01/02,MVA government’s remote control in New Delhi: Fadnavis,"Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Wednesday alleged that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is being run from New Delhi and not Matoshree, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray’s residence in Bandra.

Making a veiled reference to Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Mr. Fadnavis said the MVA’s remote control is being held by the ‘Matoshree’ in New Delhi. Mr. Fadnavis made the statement at an election rally in Palghar on Wednesday, adding fuel to the allegations that the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party have greater control over the affairs of the MVA.

Kicking off the campaign for the zilla parishad polls in the district, Mr. Fadnavis asked voters to give a befitting reply to the Shiv Sena for “betraying the public mandate”. The Opposition leader said, “It is unfortunate that the Shiv Sena has had to make a compromise with those who abused Hindutva ideologue V.D. Savarkar. The voters much teach them a lesson.”

Mr. Fadnavis said the voters were not at fault for giving a clear mandate to the BJP-Sena alliance in the Assembly polls. He said, “But it is the Sena which backstabbed the voters and betrayed their mandate. A government with this foundation cannot run for long,” he said. The zilla parishad polls will be held in Palghar on January 7 and the results will be declared the next day.

Meanwhile, All India Congress Committee secretary Sanjay Dutt hit back at Mr. Fadnavis. Mr. Dutt said it was shocking that such a statement was made by a person who himself was remote-controlled by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah during his term as the chief minister.

He said, “Such wild allegations by the former CM only further establishes the fact that he has still not got over his embarrassing failure to hang on to the CM’s chair despite the BJP’s surreptitious early morning coup.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/ll01wa/article30455134.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMFADNAVIS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-governments-remote-control-in-new-delhi-fadnavis/article30455135.ece
439,2020/01/02,"People don’t trust pathology lab results, says survey","Getting wrong reports from pathology laboratories is not that uncommon, and trust in them is on shaky ground, according to a survey conducted by a social media platform. Nearly 30% of people who were surveyed said they had received wrong reports up to three times in a span of three years. As many as 34% of the respondents said they did not trust pathology laboratories, while 48% said they trusted the laboratories but remained vigilant.

The survey was conducted by LocalCircles, a social media platform, which received responses from 22,000 Indians on six questions related to the topic. The survey was prompted by a large number of people raising the issue of better regulations on path labs.

As many as half of the respondents felt that their doctors asked for more tests than required.

The survey also discussed an important issue of cuts and commissions between doctors and laboratories. Nearly 92% of the respondents were of the view that laboratories found to be incentivising doctors should lose their licences; 89% said doctors’ earnings in a hospital should not be related to the tests they refer patients for; 66% respondents also said their doctors have suggested specific laboratories to get the tests done.

“All in all, the survey highlights the mistrust that citizens have of pathology laboratories and how, according to people, there is a strong need to address the doctor-laboratory nexus through the formation of clear consumer protection rules, and then driving enforcement of these rules through the local health and consumer departments,” said a press statement from LocalCircles. The platform plans to write to the government urging action.

Dr. Prasad Kulkarni, executive council member of the Maharashtra Association of Practicing Pathologists and Microbiologists, said they have been fighting the issue of bogus pathologists for several years. “We have been demanding regulations and checks on laboratories, which are not there. The regulations should be implemented as strictly as the Pre Conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act,” said Dr. Kulkarni.

People should confirm the presence of qualified pathologists before submitting their samples in laboratories, he said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/people-dont-trust-pathology-lab-results-says-survey/article30455078.ece
440,2020/01/02,‘Few miscreants give a bad name to community’,"A recent study published by Pune-based Support for Advocacy and Training to Health Initiatives (SATHI) revealed how doctors continue to accept incentives from pharmaceutical companies in the form of leisure trips, microwave ovens, tablets, silver items, gold jewellery and petrol cards. What startled the community was the case of three neurologists from Mumbai who as per the study went on a foreign tour with two “south Indian heroines”, all arranged by a pharmaceutical company. The study, carried out by Dr. Arun Gadre and Dr. Archana Diwate, consisted of 50 in-depth interviews conducted in six cities. Dr. Gadre talked to The Hindu on what led to the study and what are the solutions.

What triggered the need for such a study?

We had a lot of anecdotal experience on the existence of such practices. This has been [going on] for a very long time. We brainstormed with many stakeholders and experts and decided to carry out a study to understand the present scenario. The aim of our study was to learn about the promotional and marketing practices of pharma manufacturers in different parts of India, and to understand the status of regulatory mechanisms and codes for promotional practices in the Indian context on the field.

How does the nexus between doctors and pharmaceutical companies impact the public?

Ours was a qualitative research that did not touch on this aspect completely. But there is no denial that promotional practices eventually lead to irrational prescriptions and pushing of high-cost drugs. Having said that, one has to also understand the complexity of the medical field. A well-meaning, ethical doctor may prescribe a certain expensive brand of drug only for a better outcome. Quality of the drug is very important, but who is keeping a tab on that?

Instead of considering the seriousness of your findings, doctors’ bodies questioned its authenticity.

How the associations react to the findings depends on them. We have never claimed that all or the majority of doctors indulge in malpractices. We, like the Indian Medical Association (IMA), believe that there are a few miscreants who give a bad name to the entire community. So, ideally, civil society organisations and the IMA should work together to bring effective regulations for pharmaceutical companies.

What are the solutions? Should the government step in to tighten norms or should associations like the IMA play a better role to break this nexus?

The IMA is not a statutory body. The State medical councils and now the National Medical Commission are. They should tighten the implementation of the code of conduct. Most State councils have no funds, infrastructure or investigative powers to carry out their duties in the best way. The government has to step in and tighten policies that are crucial.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/fpnamr/article30455039.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BMARUNGADRE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/few-miscreants-give-a-bad-name-to-community/article30455040.ece

442,2020/01/02,Man makes away with ₹3.96 cr. meant to be loaded in ATMs,"An agency responsible for loading cash in ATMs has filed a complaint with the Koparkhairane police against one of its employees after finding out that he had made away with ₹3.96 crore.

On December 26, Sachin Shivaji Wagh of Securitrans India private limited, who was the custodian of route number 2 in Koparkhairane, had not reported to work. When Prakash Vhankeri, regional manager of the Koparkhairane branch of the firm, dialled his mobile phone, it was switched off. On visiting his residence, it was found that he had left the home as usual at 6 a.m. for work.

Upon finding something something suspicious Mr. Vhankeri asked for an audit of route number 2. In the audit of 35 ATMs of the 37 on the route, the auditors found discrepancies in depositing of ₹3.96 crore. It was also found that Mr. Wagh along with one or more accomplices had been removing cash from the ATMs on the pretext of loading them.

On December 30, Vilas Narayan Naik, the security manager of the agency for Maharashtra, filed a complaint. According to the police, the crime is suspected to have occurred between December 11 and 25.

Mr. Wagh was the only one to have the key and the password to the machines on the route. Mr. Wagh had not only taken out the existing money in the machines but also made away with the ones he was in possession of for loading.

“Prima facie, it is suspected that Mr. Wagh was supported by a bank officer. We are investigating and no arrests have been made yet,” senior police inspector Suryakant Jagdale from Koparkhairane police station said.

A case was registered under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by banker or agent), and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

443,2020/01/02,Starting new year on a high: 778 penalised for drunk driving,"The Mumbai traffic police penalised 778 drunk drivers this New Year’s Eve from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning. Dahisar topped the list in terms of location, with 58 cases being registered in the suburb.

A total of 2,400 traffic police personnel were pressed into service to ensure action against violations of traffic rules, with drunk driving being the priority. The number this year was significantly higher than the 450 cases registered last New Years’ Eve. Of the total, 578 cases were against two-wheeler riders and the remaining against drivers of four-wheelers.

Traffic police officers said 224 people were checked in Dahisar, where 58 were found to be driving under the influence of alcohol. In other areas, Sahar, Mulund and Chembur recorded 35 cases each, of which most of the offenders were two-wheeler riders.

In south Mumbai, Byculla and Malabar Hill recorded 24 cases each, which was higher than other areas.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Suburbs) Sandeep Bhajibhakre, Mumbai traffic police, said, “Most people come from Thane to Mumbai to celebrate at fancy restaurants, while many people go to Thane to spend their New Year’s Eve. Therefore, areas like Mulund, which are adjacent to Thane, saw a higher number of cases. The same is true for Dahisar as people visit Mumbai from areas like Madh Island and Mira-Bhayander. Additionally, people going to Gujarat are also checked at Dahisar.”

Of the 58 people found to be driving drunk in Dahisar, 50 were two-wheeler riders. Meanwhile, 24 two-wheeler riders were penalised in Byculla and 19 were found to be inebriated in Malabar Hill.

Worli and Pydhonie saw the least number of cases with eight and nine offenders respectively.

“We had made special arrangements at spots like Bandra Reclamation, Bandstand and Girgaum Chowpatty, which were visited by large crowds. Several roads were closed for two-wheelers and no-parking was enforced at a lot of locations. We had specially arranged checkposts for riders who indulge in overspeeding and rash driving,” Mr. Bhajibhakre said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dqb8gz/article30454986.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMDRINKANDDRIVE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/starting-new-year-on-a-high-778-penalised-for-drunk-driving/article30454987.ece
444,2020/01/02,MVA government likely to hike taxes to ease financial burden,"A meeting of all revenue generating arms of the Maharashtra government has been called next week to explore ways to increase tax collection in the State.

The tax levied through stamp duty, excise duty and vehicle registration is likely to be hiked, and the State might also explore monetisation of land as a revenue source, officials said after an emergency meeting of the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government on Wednesday.

The meeting discussed ways to increase the State’s revenue following the announcement of a ₹25,000 crore farm loan waiver. The Centre’s non-payment of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) compensation has also added to the worries of the government. “The meeting was about how to increase the GST revenue,” said Finance Minister Jayant Patil after the meeting, which was chaired by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray.

Mr. Patil said the GST collection for 2019 had fallen short of the estimated target of ₹1,42,000 crore by 10%. He said, “Since the implementation of the GST regime, the State’s revenue has dipped. The Centre has not compensated us for it. We are making efforts to secure the compensation from the Centre and are looking at ways to increase revenue at the same time.”

The Shiv Sena has already warned of a looming ‘conflict’ with the Centre if compensation for revenue losses borne by States is not paid on time. Mr. Patil had recently warned of an imminent tax hike to shore up adjusted revenue on account of implementation of the GST regime in the State. Last month at a pre-budget consultation meet in New Delhi ahead of the Union Budget, Mr. Patil had said the State government would be compelled to even increase general taxes if the Centre fails to the provide the GST compensation at the earliest.

On Wednesday, Mr. Patil also said there were technical issues with regard to the merger of the scam-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank with the Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank. He said, “The PMC Bank’s operations are spread over three States. So there are difficulties in merging it with the MSC Bank. We are looking at the option of merging the PMC Bank with another bank that fits the legal requirement.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jplnkv/article30454978.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2BMJAYANTPATIL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mva-government-likely-to-hike-taxes-to-ease-financial-burden/article30454979.ece
445,2020/01/02,Murder accused held after 12 years,"The Shivaji Nagar police have arrested a murder accused who was absconding for 12 years after fleeing from the Mazgaon court premises.

Yusuf Musa Sayyed (36) was arrested in 2006 with three others in a murder case. While being taken to the Sewri court, he allegedly assaulted the police personnel escorting him.

A separate case was registered against him with the Kalachowki police, and in 2008, while being taken to the Mazgaon court in the assault case trial, he managed to give the police the slip. Officers said he jumped from the third floor of the court building while being taken to the bathroom and fled.

In 2019, another case of attempted murder was registered against Mr. Sayyed.

On Tuesday, the police received a tip-off that he had changed his name to Sameer Tauf and was staying in Mumbra. A police team arrested him from his Mumbra residence.

“Mr. Sayyed was produced in court on Wednesday, and has been remanded in police custody till Saturday,” senior police inspector Sudarshan Paithankar, Shivaji Nagar police station, said.

447,2020/01/02,Flying out of Chennai Airport? This is where food sold at this airport gets cooked.,"It is something unique to Chennai International Airport. No other airport in the country has provided the master concessionaire responsible for food and beverages outlets with a building of its own — and with an area of more than 15,000 sq.ft., it is quite some space.

The building, which is operated and managed by Travel Food Services (the master concessionaire under contract with the Airports Authority of India), features state-of-the-art equipment and employees working round-the-clock shifts in order to continuously meet the demand for food products from outlets at the terminals.

“We started operating in Chennai in 2013. Earlier, this kitchen was inside the T2 terminal, but then AAI started its demolition, after the new T1 and T4 terminals were opened. So, instead of being moved around terminals, they (AAI) decided to set us up with a permanent space,” says Srinath Raghavan, regional director, TFS Chennai.

Taking the lead

The facility cost nearly ₹20 crore to build. “It is the first of its kind facility as far as India is concerned,” he adds. Arvind Singh, Chairman, AAI, in a statement to media, had noted how the cooking equipment could take up various jobs such as stewing, braising, deep-frying and boiling, and that this facility improves “efficiency and output”.

As Nikhil Rastogi, executive chef, TFS Chennai, takes us on a tour of the facility, he points to the VarioCookingCenter equipment, describing it as an “automated wok”.

“The recipes are already fed inside. There is a touch board. You just need to feed it fish, meat or rice and the vegetables. It will fry, sauté, boil, grill and roast,” he remarks, adding that such equipment helps them produce food quickly, to be supplied to the 87 outlets and six lounges the kitchen serves inside the Chennai Airport.

“We make around 1,800 samosas a day here,” Rastogi adds, providing an insight into the non-stop production cycle. There is also a bakery and confectioneries section.

Right from the processing stage, the kitchen segregates the vegetables and meat produce that it receives in its bay. Once the food is cooked and packed, a colour code helps demarcate vegetarian dishes from meat-based food. “There is also a steriliser equipment for the knives used,” Raghavan adds, emphasising upon hygiene standards.

There are also two blast chillers, besides 11 walk-in freezers, which can get the temperature of hot food from over 75 degrees Celsius to below five degrees Celsius in under two hours.

This level of automation and optimisation enables TFS to operate with limited manpower if needed, although there are nearly 1,000 people employed by the firm in Chennai alone, Raghavan notes. “Around 160 people work here in the kitchen. The remaining work in the outlets in the terminal,” he says.

Umbrella brand

The biggest advantage of the master concessionaire system, Raghavan adds, is that complaint redressal is effective. “It works to the advantage of AAI, the franchise outlets as well as the customer,” he says.

Rastogi adds: “For instance, for general complaints about the food served, there is a customer care number printed on the bills. You can call it and quote the bill number to lodge your complaint. Our team will go to the spot and do a proper root cause analysis before getting back in touch. We ensure that we win back the customer who has a grievance.”

Until two years ago, Chennai and Kolkata were the only two AAI-controlled airports which had separate master concessionaires to operate F&B and retail outlets in terminals.

Then, AAI decided to open up 12 more airports — primarily in tier II cities like Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar, Raipur, Lucknow and Guwahati — to master concessionaires. TFS was a beneficiary of the proposal.

“Besides Chennai, we operate outlets in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Goa. There is also a small outlet of ours at the Chennai Central railway station,” Raghavan says.

The firm has extended its reach beyond airports to include both national highways and the massive Indian Railway network, and now, in-flight catering may not be too far an objective for them. “The thought process is there but we need a security programme in place,” Raghavan notes.

Rastogi chips in: “There is some process differentiation. In-flight food has to be prepared only 24 hours before flight, and it needs to go into blast freezers immediately after. We have built the infrastructure to meet those needs, but it will take time.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/sfg05c/article30459385.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MPAirport-Kitchen-3,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/flying-out-of-chennai-airport-this-is-where-food-sold-at-this-airport-gets-cooked/article30459387.ece
448,2020/01/02,Get gourmet on a budget,"Looking to dig into some comforting pasta, but don’t want to head out and go through the whole shebang of restaurant dining? What if you could whip up a bowl of pasta, restaurant-style, right at home, minus the numerous steps? Or impress your date with an elaborate home-cooked meal without breaking into a sweat? Apparently you can, with this instant food line that has a variety of pastas and soups to soothe the hungry soul. Launched by 25-year-old chef Kavya Krishnamurthy, Veekes and Company offers options such as aglio olio, pepper alfredo, and cilantro pesto, among others.

If the name rings a bell, it is because Veekes and Company was originally a chain of budget-continental restaurants that launched in 2009. At their peak, they had 17 restaurants across four cities. “We had set out to do to continental food, what Chinese food is to Indians today. Good food and good music were what we were (and still are) known for,” says Kavya, “At the time, we had a central kitchen to maintain consistency across the board. This prompted us to think of launching a line of gourmet flavours with the same principles of consistency, affordability and accessibility.”

The instant food line launched on a trial basis in 2013, before eventually completely morphing into a packaged food business in June 2018. Today, the company offers seven variants on store shelves: aglio olio, pepper alfredo, cilantro pesto, Mediterranean caprese, French onion soup, mulligatawny soup, and minestrone soup. Their USP is that their food is free of preservatives. “Being a chef by profession, I am constantly looking for ways to improve our existing range and bring new flavours to customers. I work closely with food labs and food technologists for this. At the same time, we want to make sure that our products do not contain added preservatives and we are looking at using freeze-dried technology to improve and expand our offering,” says Kavya, adding, “In the pipeline, we have a masala de inde pasta flavour, a lemon coriander soup, a new and improved pepper alfredo and Mediterranean tomato sauce; we hope, in time, to become known for a range of niche international packaged foods right from Vietnam to Italy.”

Given that the market is so saturated with instant food brands, what sets Veekes and Company apart? “If you look at our current range, flavours like French onion and aglio olio are unique to us; you will not find a pesto for less than ₹50 in this space. V&C sauces are a base for customers to build on to make a gourmet meal with ease. We encourage them to add vegetables and condiments to make it their own. It is not a snack. Furthermore, since our sauces are in the powder form, they require no preservatives, no refrigeration post opening and have a decent shelf life,” she says. Calling the venture a “complete family affair”, she says that the packaging was designed by her brother Athreya, a graphic designer.

She adds that the company uses culinary art and food technology to produce its range of instant food. “The products are made with dehydrated/dried ingredients, which allows us to develop shelf life without the use of preservatives. In time, we want to change the landscape of instant foods, as they are currently perceived largely as unhealthy snacks. Our products are manufactured at state-of-the-art certified factories close to Kochi,” says the Bengaluru-based entrepreneur.

Incidentally, Kavya holds a bachelor’s degree in Culinary Arts, has worked at the JW Marriott Marquis, Dubai for three years, and is a member of the Emirates Culinary Guild.

The company currently supplies to over 30 restaurants and boutique hotels, as well as stock on store shelves. With a presence in five cities and on e-commerce sites, their packages are priced at ₹49.

“By March 2020, we want to touch a visibility of 500 stores (currently they are present in 120 stores). That apart, we plan to keep bringing out new products,” says Kavya.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/fbp2oc/article30459094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3MPVeekesjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/veekes-and-company-kavya-krishnamurthy/article30459096.ece
449,2020/01/02,Debunking Mexican food myths,"One can be forgiven for mistaking Colibri Jimenez for an actor or model. Perfect features in an oval face devoid of blemish help create that impression. However, Colibri is far more than just a pretty face.

Fresh off her debut on television as a contestant on The Final Table, Colibri has been on a whirlwind tour around the world in an attempt to bring Mexican cuisine to the masses.

Mexico is home for Colibri who has loved cooking since she was a little girl; she began pursuing it in earnest around the time she turned 18. Now, she’s 30 years old and despite not having a restaurant to her name as yet, Colibri still shares her culinary creations with one and all. “I do nomad cooking around the world,” she says with a smile.

Pop culture has restricted the image of Mexican cuisine to tacos and nachos. Ask Colibri about the popularity of Tex-Mex and she laughs. “It is popular everywhere and gets more popular the further you move from Mexico. It is fast food,” she says, crediting its success to basic ingredients such as beans, rice, cheese and avocado.

Her maiden trip to India, included stops at Mumbai, Delhi, Agra Bengaluru, Pune and Jaipur.

“There are a lot of similarities between Indian and Mexican cuisines. The use of various spices, multiple ingredients and chillies are a common factor,” says Colibri, who enjoyed biryani and different kinds of chutneys during her stay here.

“What I enjoyed the most were the thaalis perhaps because Indian food has a lot of balance, with every meal involving most of the food groups,” she says.

Extensive preparation is another thing in common with Indian and Mexican cuisines. She recalls mole from her country which she describes as ‘a type of Indian curry or sauce,’ which takes a long time to make.

“Different kinds of mole are made in different parts of the country and could take up to a day, from the grinding of the spices till it is served on the table.”

Again, like in India, spice powders in Mexico are traditionally prepared with stone grinders. There are traditional dishes where the meats are laid under a layer of volcanic rocks and agave leaves and left to slow cook overnight.

Colibri says a chilli chicken dish she tried in Delhi was very similar to Mexican polloand salsa verde(chicken and green salad).

“Also, the rice pudding (payasam or kheer) served in India is similar to what we serve too, except we don’t use cardamom so much. Cinnamon is our spice of choice,” she says.

If she wasn’t into food, Colibri who loves animals, especially horses, says she would’ve been a veterinarian.

While she doesn’t run a restaurant, her company @AventrutaGastronmica is dedicated to the preservation and promotion of traditional Mexican dishes, requiring a fair amount of research.

Colibrí has documented her finds in the book ‘Una Aventura Gastronomica,’ sharing photographs and incidents of her culinary journey to the farthest corners of México.

Currently, Colibri is collecting more material research for her next book on street food, chefs and agriculture in Mexico, which she hopes to bring out in Mexico.",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/ghk3lp/article30458476.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Colibri6JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/debunking-mexican-food-myths/article30458477.ece

451,2020/01/02,Youth resist bid to sacrifice idea of India: Satchidanandan,"Terming the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) a blatant violation of the principle of secularism in the Constitution, poet K. Satchidanandan on Wednesday said that the voices of protest of young men and women reverberating across the nation represent the resistance to attempts to sacrifice the idea of India.

Mr. Satchidanandan was inaugurating a debate on ‘Art, literature and culture: Contemporary pathways of resistance’ organised here as part of the district conference of Purogamana Kalasahithya Sanghom.

An extraordinary situation exists in Indian democracy today where the people who betrayed the Independence struggle are glorified as patriots and the people who, in reality, led it are treated as traitors, Mr. Satchidanandan said.

“People who are courageous enough to speak out are being labelled ‘urban Naxals’ and ‘tukde-tukde gang.’ A new vocabulary itself has come into existence — urban Naxals, tukde-tukde gang and the like — to denounce movements of resistance,” the award-winning poet said. He urged writers and artists to engage themselves in the ‘literature and art of dissent.’

While their immediate cause might be CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the countrywide protests reflect the intense hardships faced by the people in the past six years. Today, the youth of the country have come together ignoring distinctions of religion, caste, gender, ideology and race to shout from campuses and streets that “We will not allow this any more,” he said.

True democracy

Democracy is less a phenomenon that expresses itself every five years through an election than the sum total of events that take place in the five years between two elections, Mr. Satchidanandan said.

The true moment of the people and democracy arrives when citizens make a government their own through participation, resistance, protest, elections and assertion of civil rights. “Because, the power held by a regime is first and foremost a power that was stolen or alienated from the people,” he said.

The tools used

Today, the government can convert India into a prison without even declaring an Emergency. This is being done with the help of the new media, technology, Aadhaar cards and mobile apps and by the imposition of Section 144 and precluding organised protests and public meetings, he said.

The contemporary Indian scenario, Mr. Satchidanandan said, calls for an exploration of commonalities in the ideas that bring together people like Mahatma Gandhi, Karl Marx and B.R. Ambedkar rather than dwelling on what separates them, he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/4pdtw8/article30456848.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02tvtvsatchi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/youth-resist-bid-to-sacrifice-idea-of-india-satchidanandan/article30456849.ece

454,2020/01/02,110 new storm water drains in Thiruvananthapuram by March,"The city Corporation will complete the works on 110 new storm water drains by March this year under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) scheme. Out of these, 70 storm water drains have already been completed over the past two years.

The civic body has given priority to areas of high waterlogging within the city for implementing the project.

“Once these works are completed, some areas which have been experiencing waterlogging even during light rain will be free of it. We had identified many such spots in Thampanoor, Kamaleswaram and Manacaud, among others. Drains have also been constructed in several bylanes, in addition to the main roads,” said an official co-ordinating projects under AMRUT.

The entire project is being implemented at a cost of ₹48 crore. An important works under this is currently on at the S.S. Koil Road, which has been witnessing flooding, even as situation improved in the rest of Thampanoor after Operation Anantha.

Slow progress

But, progress has been slow, due to the technical difficulties of shifting utility lines and the topography of the place, which requires more than just a storm water drain to solve the issue.

Another project under AMRUT, the sewerage network project covering the Kazhakuttam-Technopark-Medical College area, is also progressing.

Contractors reluctant

The project was also delayed due to reluctance of contractors to take up the work due to issues regarding road cutting. The Kerala Water Authority is the implementation agency.

The network will run through the whole of Kazhakuttam, leading to the Muttathara sewage treatment plant. Pumping stations will be set up along the way in the medical college area as well as in Pattoor.

“In the current phase, the main transmission line will be laid. The distribution lines to the sides will be constructed later under various other projects, as lesser funds are required for the same,” said the official.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/110-new-storm-water-drains-by-march/article30454679.ece
455,2020/01/02,Cheetah Patrol to ease traffic in Thiruvananthapuram,"The Kerala Police have operationalised the Cheetah patrol system in the city to boost traffic regulation and ensure smooth vehicular flow.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan formally flagged off 10 Cheetah Patrol jeeps at a function held here on Wednesday. He also launched a new traffic regulation system by way of which the number of traffic sectors has increased to 30 – 14 under the traffic north sub-division and 16 under the traffic south sub-division – from 11 in the city.

State Police Chief Loknath Behera had announced the plan to mobilise the Cheetah Patrol teams during a meeting of various stakeholders, including residents associations, in November. The squads have been mandated with detecting traffic violations, easing traffic snarls, adopting steps to prevent accidents, and report information regarding pothole-ridden roads and stretches where motorists’ safety is endangered by trees and electric posts leaning precariously.

The round-the-clock traffic enforcement mechanism will involve the Cheetah Patrol squads, each led by a sub-inspector, being assigned surveillance duties in areas that came under multiple police station limits. Each squad will be expected to attend to traffic duties in three or four traffic sectors under the new arrangement.

The areas that have been assigned to the squads are as follows: Cheetah 1 – Kazhakuttam, Thumba, Cheetah 2 – Medical College, Sreekaryam, Cheetah 3 – Peroorkada, Mannanthala, Cheetah 4 – Vattiyurkavu, Poojappura, Cheetah 5 – Museum, Cantonment, Cheetah 6 – Fort, Thampanoor, Cheetah 7 – Nemom, Karamana, Cheetah 8 – Pettah, Vanchiyoor, Cheetah 9 – Poonthura, Valiyathura, and Cheetah 10 – Vizhinjam, Kovalam and Thiruvallam.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ukqdvi/article30304908.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14DECTH--TRAFFIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/cheetah-patrol-to-ease-traffic/article30454653.ece
456,2020/01/02,Surprise raid at estate house for wild meat,"Armed poachers seeking to bag bushmeat for sale in the black market are operating with impunity in the ill-policed wildlife reserves in Thenmala and Punalur divisions in Kollam district, according to top Forest officials. In a midnight raid to deter the organised criminal networks, Chief Wildlife Warden Surendra Kumar mounted a surprise inspection at a remote estate bungalow in forested Nagamala locality on New Year’s Eve. About 40 armed forest enforcers surrounded the cottage sited atop a scenic hill.

Enforcers said they had information that a set of local poachers were serving wild meat and hooch to visitors who had booked the bungalow in advance for the celebrations.

‘Contraband removed’

However, they did not find any raw game meat, illicit brew or weapons. An official said it was likely that the gang had removed the contraband on spotting the headlights of multiple patrol vehicles coming uphill through the rugged switchback trail.

The department had kept the raid a secret till the last minute to prevent any leaks from inside. A perceived lack of interest on the part of local enforcers to investigate the reported killing of a wild buffalo near plantation house had prompted the inspection.

The forests bordering the estates in Thenmala are replete with wild buffalo, Sambar deer, flying squirrels and mouse deer. Passers-by routinely find antlers and entrails of Sambhar deer and wild boar parts disposed of on the side of forest roads.

Gourmet status

Officials said poachers conferred a gourmet or prestige status on wild meat. They charged exorbitant rates from willing buyers for game meat. The networks used country made muzzleloaders to hunt game. Poachers hid the firearms, gun powder and shot covered in waterproof packing in the woods.

Wildlife enforcers said they had identified a set of persons who use the cover of tenant farmers to penetrate the nearby forests regularly for the game. They operated with the tacit connivance of local police, forest and check post officials.

Arrest of watchers

In December 2018, forest enforcers had arrested three watchers who regularly hunted wildlife for sale in the 4,000-acre forest encompassing Kerala Plantation Corporation-owned rubber and oil palm estate in Athirappilly.

In August the same year, forest enforcers arrested three police officers and Postal Department employee on the charge of regularly hunting deer in Ponmudi forests.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/surprise-raid-at-estate-house-for-wild-meat/article30454635.ece
457,2020/01/02,"Water supply in Thiruvananthapuram to be affected on Jan. 4, 5","Water supply to several areas in the capital city will be disrupted on January 4 and 5 — Saturday and Sunday — as the 86 mld (million litres a day) water treatment plant (WTP) at Aruvikkara will be shut down for the second phase of a four-stage renovation programme.

The Kerala Water Authority (KWA), which is carrying out the renovation, has asked the public to stock water for the two days and also to use it sparingly and responsibly. The WTP will be shut down for 16 hours from 2 p.m. on January 4 to 6 a.m. on January 5, KWA officials said. Supply will be fully restored to city areas only by 6 a.m. on January 6, Monday.

The work in this phase involves installing a new pump set each in the raw water treatment facility and the clear water unit of the WTP and linking them to the electrical panels. The 86 mld plant employs pump sets and electrical equipment that are over 20 years old, which has affected the capacity of the plant.

Replacing equipment

The KWA had announced the four-phase renovation to replace aging equipment and to modernise the plant. This would help the KWA enhance city supply by another 10 mld. At present, city areas consume 270-280 mld.

The KWA had shut down the 86 mld and 74 mld plants at Aruvikkara on December 13 and 14 for the the first phase works. In Phase III, the 86 mld plant will be shut down for six hours on January 11. The Phase IV works are planned on February 1. In this final phase, both the 86 and 74 mld plants in Aruvikkara will be temporarily shut down for 16 hours.

As part of the Phase II shutdown the coming weekend, the KWA is making arrangements to ensure water supply to the Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital, the Regional Cancer Centre and the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences and Technology. Tanker water supply will be ensured for essential services including all hospitals and police stations.

To prevent a water supply crisis in city areas, the KWA will ensure tanker water supply with vending points at Vellayambalam, Aruvikkara, PTP Nagar, Choozhattukotta, and Attingal.

459,2020/01/02,Love to find the perfect pass: Fernandes,"This has been a breakthrough season for Brandon Fernandes. The 25-year-old midfielder is enjoying arguably his best ISL campaign, while also cementing his place in the Indian team. Fernandes is the sort of creative, technically-gifted, passing midfielder the national side has long craved; over the last few months he has steadily emerged as one of the country’s finest.

Ten games into this ISL season, Fernandes leads the assists charts (5); he has now provided more assists than any other Indian player in the history of the league (13) which, considering he’s only featured in 45 matches, is saying a lot. In India’s 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, all three of the team’s goals have been assisted by Fernandes, his set-piece delivery a real asset.

“I love to provide assists,” Fernandes tells The Hindu. “I’ve got better and better every season. I also want to score goals but we (FC Goa) have goal-scorers so I have to provide good passes for them to score. I just focus on putting the ball in the right place.”

Some regret

For all the rewards this season has brought Fernandes, 2019 will remain a year tinged with some regret. When Stephen Constantine named the Indian probables for the AFC Asian Cup, the Margao midfielder did not find a place in it. The omission must have been disappointing, but Fernandes does not wish to dwell on it.

“It’s not good to speak about that,” he says. “I expected a call-up and it didn’t happen. But I don’t want to say anything about that. That was 2019. And 2020 is a new year.”

Constantine quit after the Asian Cup, though, and Igor Stimac was appointed India’s new head coach. The Croat called Fernandes up at once, handing him his first India cap against Curacao in June.

“Igor Stimac told me that he saw my ISL matches and he said I was a very important player for him,” says Fernandes. “He told me that if I work hard I’m going to get my place in the team.”

Stimac has deployed Fernandes as a deep-lying play-maker; at FC Goa, he plays mainly as a left-sided attacking midfielder but is also sometimes used as a 10. “As long as I am playing, I’m happy,” he says. “Different coaches see me in different ways. I try to adapt and give them whatever they ask for.”

FC Goa’s first game of 2020 is against Bengaluru FC, at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium here on Friday. Matches between the two sides have always tended to be close and Fernandes expects another tense encounter. He is hopeful, though, of beginning the new year just like he ended the old one. “It has been a very good season for me so far,” he says. “There were a lot of ups and downs but I kept going. I will continue doing that.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/2mdmek/article30463566.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03BRANDONs,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/love-to-find-the-perfect-pass-fernandes/article30463567.ece
460,2020/01/02,‘He is always injured’: Mourinho on Tottenham’s Tanguy Ndombele,"Tottenham is waiting to find out the extent of Harry Kane’s hamstring injury after the striker left Southampton’s stadium on crutches after a 1-0 loss at Southampton on Wednesday.

Kane picked up the problem in the process of scoring an offside goal, sparking fears he could be set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines.

“For Harry to come out is negative,” Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho said. “Hamstring is always a negative. Is it tear? Is it a spasm? Is it a contraction? In this moment I cannot say.”

Kane was not the only player Spurs lost to injury as Tanguy Ndombele limped off in the first half and it caused Mourinho to lose his patience.

The France midfielder has been beset by fitness concerns following his summer move from Lyon and recently told his manager that he did not want to be selected for the Boxing Day win over Brighton.

Mourinho did not hold back in his assessment of the club’s record signing, who was brought in by previous manager Mauricio Pochettino.

“He is always injured, he is injured, is not injured,” Mourinho said. “He plays one match, the next week he is injured, he plays another match. We are full of hopes and this is since the beginning of the season.”

“Of course it is a concern, you think you have a player, you think the player is in an evolution process, he plays very well against Norwich, you think today he is ready for it and he is not ready for it. I cannot say much more than that because it is a situation that comes from the beginning of the season,” Mourinho said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/vsqnyo/article30457554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-ENGLAND-SOU-TOTREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/he-is-always-injured-mourinho-on-tottenhams-tanguy-ndombele/article30457555.ece
461,2020/01/02,"Manchester Utd considering January reinforcements with Pogba, McTominay injured","Manchester United could be forced to recruit midfielders during the January transfer window with the injured Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay set for lengthy spells on the sidelines, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said on Wednesday.

Pogba is set to undergo surgery to treat an ankle problem that will rule the Frenchman out of action for around a month, while McTominay is out for longer with knee ligament damage sustained in last week's win over Newcastle United.

Pogba, who has been linked frequently with a potential move away from United, spent over two months sidelined with an injury to his left ankle and has only made eight appearances for his club in all competitions.

“We've had scans, it's nothing major but it's something that has to be sorted and dealt with within a time frame,” Solskjaer told a news conference after United's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal, which Pogba played no part in.

“He's been advised to do it as soon as possible. We've been without him all season, it's a big blow. Scott will be out for a few months. He's been magnificent and we just hope that Paul can come back within a month or so... We've been suffering a little bit, especially in midfield and we've got to cope with it,” he said.

Solskjaer said the absence of the two influential midfielders would play a part in the club's decision-making process on whether to sign reinforcements this month.

“We've got loads of games and important games. But still, it's got to be right and that's the big point here,” the Norwegian manager added. “If it's available and if it's possible we'll do something, definitely. We're looking at one or two (potential signings).”

Pogba's future at United remains the subject of much transfer speculation, especially since recent comments from his agent Mino Raiola criticising the club.

“Now Pogba's problem is Manchester (United),” Raiola told the Italian newspaper, La Repubblica. “It's a club out of touch with reality, without a sports project. I would no longer take anyone there. They would even ruin (Diego) Maradona, Pele and (Paolo) Maldini. Paul needs a club and a squad, one like Juventus was before.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/hfyq5w/article30457471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKSOCCER-ENGLAND-ARS-MUNPREVIEW,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/manchester-utd-considering-january-reinforcements-with-pogba-mctominay-injured/article30457467.ece
462,2020/01/02,Premier League | Arsenal blow away Man Utd to hand Arteta first win,"Mikel Arteta claimed his first win as Arsenal manager in impressive fashion as his side outplayed Manchester United to secure just a second victory in 16 games with a 2-0 win at the Emirates.

Nicolas Pepe and Sokratis Papastathopoulos struck before half-time to reward arguably Arsenal's finest 45 minutes of the season so far.

The Gunners started the game three times as many points off the top four as the relegation zone, but a first home win in 87 days hauls Arteta's men up to 10th and within four points of United in fifth.

There were signs of encouragement for Arsenal in Arteta's home début against Chelsea on Sunday when only a late collapse saw a 1-0 lead turn into a 2-1 defeat.

However, this time the hosts saw the game through as a dismal United performance raised fresh questions over their chances of finishing in the top four.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men were again shorn of Paul Pogba, who faces another few weeks on the sidelines due to an ongoing ankle injury.

United have grown used to coping without Pogba this season, but still struggle to create when denied the counter-attack and failed to recover after falling behind early on.

For the first time Arsenal started with all of Pepe, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette and Mesut Ozil together in attack and Arteta's bold choice paid dividends eight minutes in.

Pepe scored just his second Premier League goal from open play since a £72 million move from Lille when he swept home Sead Kolasinac's cross at the back post.

The Ivorian was suddenly brimming with confidence as he twisted and turned Luke Shaw before cross for Aubameyang to volley just over.

Lacazette then rolled Harry Maguire easily in a night to forget for the world's most expensive defender before pulling his shot across goal.

David de Gea is another of United's more experienced stars suffering an alarming dip in form and a poor clearance from the Spaniard offered another sight of goal to Pepe, whose long-range strike came back off the post.

Arsenal's first half dominance was rewarded with a second goal before the half-time interval as De Gea could only palm Lacazette's header from a corner back into the danger area and Sokratis pounced to fire into the roof of the net.

As the hosts' energy levels dipped from a frantic first 45 minutes, United were allowed to dictate the game but did have the guile to make their possession count.

Andreas Pereira had the best chance to give United a lifeline but fired into the side-netting from Nemanja Matic's clever reverse pass.

Mason Greenwood also forced Bernd Leno into a smart save, but United's normal source of goals, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, were kept in check as a much-maligned Arsenal defence kept just a fourth Premier League clean sheet this season.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/u8301a/article30455886.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SOCCER-ENGLAND-ARS-MUNREPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premire-league-arsenal-blow-away-man-utd-to-hand-arteta-first-win/article30455887.ece
463,2020/01/02,Premier League | Jesus extends mastery of Everton in Man City win,"Gabriel Jesus extended his remarkable record against Everton as the Manchester City striker's second-half brace sealed a 2-1 win on Wednesday.

Jesus was handed the start as City manager Pep Guardiola rested Sergio Aguero, but the decision to select the Brazilian ahead of the club's record goalscorer could easily have been inspired by his mastery of Everton.

Repaying his manager's faith, Jesus feasted on the Everton defence once again.

He has now scored seven times in his last five appearances against the Merseyside club, who must be sick of the sight of him.

City remain third in the Premier League after a second successive win left them 11 points behind runaway leaders Liverpool, who have two games in hand on the champions.

Richarlison got one back for Everton, but it was a first defeat for new boss Carlo Ancelotti, who had masterminded wins over Burnley and Newcastle in his first two matches since replacing the sacked Marco Silva.

The former Chelsea chief got the better of Guardiola in their previous meeting -- two Real Madrid wins against Bayern Munich in the 2014 Champions League semi-finals.

There would be no repeat against a City side with a point to prove after a spluttering end to 2019.

City won 10 trophies, including four Premier League titles, in the decade just closed, but Liverpool's remarkable form over the last 18 months is a serious threat to that dominance.

Guardiola has already conceded City have no chance of catching Liverpool this season, instead setting his sights on a more sustained challenge next term by admitting they need to “play better and pray”.

There was no need for divine intervention against Everton, although with Aguero, Raheem Sterling and Kyle Walker among those left out by Guardiola, the visitors nearly snatched a shock lead when Seamus Coleman's volley forced a one-handed save from Claudio Bravo.

Nervous finale

City thought they had taken the lead when Phil Foden met Joao Cancelo's cross with a close-range finish in the 13th minute.

But the hosts' celebrations were curtailed by VAR as the goal was ruled out for a tight offside against Riyad Mahrez, who had supplied the pass to Cancelo.

It was the latest VAR decision to go against City this season and Mahrez responded with a stinging drive that forced a good save from Pickford.

City should have been in front just before half-time when Jesus picked out Mahrez in space in the area, yet the Algerian dragged his shot wide.

Guardiola's team have failed to score a first-half goal in six of their last eight home league games.

But they only needed six minutes to take the lead after the break.

Ilkay Gundogan's pass split the Everton defence and Jesus took a touch inside before a curling a fine finish into the far corner.

Dominic Calvert-Lewin had five goals in his last five appearances and the Everton forward nearly grabbed an instant equaliser with a close-range header that flashed wide.

It was a crucial moment as Jesus struck again in the 58th minute.

Kevin De Bruyne teed up Foden and he found Mahrez as City carved opened the Everton defence before Jesus applied the finishing touch with a powerful low drive for his 13th goal of the season.

City went to sleep in the 71st minute, allowing Richarlison to slot home after Claudio Bravo made a hash of passing to Fernandinho.

Jesus wasted a chance to kill off Everton when his close-range shot smacked the post in a nervous finale, but City held on.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/ub0m8a/article30455185.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GABRIELJESUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/premier-league-jesus-extends-mastery-of-everton-in-man-city-win/article30455020.ece
464,2020/01/02,Machilipatnam: Pale shadow of a glorious past,"Machilipatnam, which was a cosmopolitan town before Independence, is still waiting to register any development post-Independence.

The commencement of the construction of the deep seaport has been delayed for over a decade, while the expansion unit of Bharat Electronics Limited was shifted outside Machilipatnam in 2016.

In recent years, the Gilakaladindi harbour has also been closed down owing to technical reasons, depriving hundreds of coastal communities of a livelihood.

Waning population

According to the British India Census (1871-72), the population of Masulipatnam was 35,056 in the Madras Presidency while it was 9,336 in Vijayawada. At least 30,000 people died in the 1864 cyclone that hit this coast.

However, the population of the town has not increased in the past decade. A former Krishna District Magistrate observed: ""Machilipatnam was on the only district headquarters in the country to have witnessed a decrease in the decadal growth of population — from 1,79,353 in 2001 to 1,69,892 in 2011 — a trend that is a bane for any town.""

Lack of employment opportunities, economic activity, and the absence of fishing and maritime trade operations on the Machilipatnam coast are suspected to be the key factors that triggered the migration of locals in search of better opportunities. Of late, the port town has become a favoured destination for retired people.

Missing deadlines

In the first half of the past decade, the town witnessed protests over the controversial land acquisition, while the latter half was the alleged ""betrayal"" by the State government in not reviving it into a ‘maritime trade post’ as promised.

Over a decade has gone by since the foundation stone for the construction of a deep seaport was laid. The port project, that was projected as a‘growth engine’, is yet to take off.

""The shifting of the expansion unit of Bharat Electronics Limited from Machilipatnam to Nimmakuru in 2016 and closure of the harbour at Gilakaladindi have dealt a major blow to the development of the port town,"" a realtor told The Hindu.

Toll on economy

The closure of the Gilakaladindi harbour, which could anchor 100 boats, has derprived hundreds of locals of employment, apart from having an adverse impact on economic activity. On the administration front, the district officials have mostly abandoned the district headquarters after head offices of the government departments were shifted to Vijayawada and Amaravati.

A Retired Special Deputy Collector and amateur historian Mohammad Silar said: ""The cosmopolitan features of this town are only in the pages of history. The present state of affairs is a result of the policies of successive governments.""

Mr. Silar adds: ""The textile and handloom industries were the prime attractions for the foreign trade companies in Machilipatnam. Such industries with huge employment opportunities have largely disappeared.""

A government employee serving here said: ""Machilipatnam was the prime destination for the Europeans for sea-borne trade. The British even ran a train between Machilipatnam and Vasco in Goa and such transportation facility shows how the port town was considered as strategic for trade and defence"".",vijayawada,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/t4x9v/article30460541.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/220898418jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Vijayawada/machilipatnam-pale-shadow-of-a-glorious-past/article30460170.ece

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy launched the Village and Ward Secretariat system on October 2 after filling up most of the posts of secretaries and volunteers.

However, three months down the line, many posts in the city’s secretariats are still lying vacant owing to various reasons.

As per the population of the city, 286 ward secretariats have been sanctioned by the State government and about 90% of them are already functional. In all the 286 Ward Secretariats that were strategically located in the city, 2,860 secretary posts have been created and so far only 1,469 of secretaries were recruited, according to VMC officials.

While recruitment of 700 more secretaries is under process, the remaining 691 posts are yet to be filled, an official said.

During a review meeting at the Zilla Parishad hall here on Wednesday, Mr. Prakash asked officials to acquire only government land to the extent possible. Land which has been given to various organisations in the past but is lying unused could also be acquired, Mr. Prakash suggested.

The house sites would be distributed to the landless poor on the occasion of Ugadi.

The sites identified should be close to the village and within reach of social and basic infrastructure, Mr. Prakash said. He urged the officials to ensure that justice was done to the poor and weaker sections in tune with the Chief Minister’s pet scheme of ‘Navaratnalu’ to foster their social and economic development.

Surplus land given to various organisations, barring medical institutions, temples and religious places, could also be acquired, he said, adding that the services of village and ward volunteers could be utilised for the purpose. Their services could also be used to create awareness among the public on various schemes being implemented by the government.

Collector V. Vinay Chand said that barring ‘C’ category lands, those falling under categories ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘D’ under 22 A could be acquired. Many of the lands given for establishment of small industries were lying unused, he said.

The victim has been identified as Kancharla M. Kamalakshmi, while the accused is Kacharla Sobhan Raju (55).

According to police, Raju used to pick up fights with Kamalakshmi over fidelity issues after consuming liquor regularly.

In the wee hours of Wednesday, Raju reportedly returned home drunken and exchanged heated arguments with Kamalakshmi. In a fit of rage, Raju allegedly hit Kamalakshmi on her head with a grain pounder and fled from the spot.

The locals found Kamalakshmi lying in a pool of blood and shifted her to the government hospital at Payakaraopeta. However, the doctors there advised them to shift Kamalakshmi to King George Hospital (KGH) in Vizag.

474,2020/01/02,"Vizag sees ‘sober’ New Year revelry, thanks to strict law enforcement","The city witnessed a rather sober celebration on the New Year eve this time, thanks to stringent enforcement of law and restricted sale of liquor. No untoward incident such as accident or ruckus was reported from the city on Tuesday night, the police said.

The city police not only restricted the entry of vehicles to the Beach Road stretch from Naval Coastal Battery to Park Hotel Junction and Telugu Talli flyover, but also deployed special teams at all strategic junctions such as NAD Kotha Road, Maddilapalem, Satyam Junction, Gajuwaka and Gopalapatnam among others.

“Strict monitoring brought down the rash driving and overspeeding to a great extent,” said DCP (Zone-I) Ranga Reddy.

A huge police force was deputed along the Beach Road and special teams were seen patrolling the stretch on segways.

The enforcement was strict on Beach Road as it has been the hub of New Year revelry in the past many years. Senior officers including Police Commissioner R.K. Meena monitored the crowd.

In the previous years, the city saw at least two to three fatal accidents on the New Year eve. But, no such incident was reported this time, said a senior officer. According to Mr. Ranga Reddy, the traffic department was issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) and it worked out well.

Special teams

The city police had formed around 50 teams to check drunk driving and around 280 cases were registered on Tuesday night. The accused were also counselled on Wednesday morning.

The restricted sale of liquor, as part of the government move to implement total prohibition in a phased manner, was another reason for the sobriety, said Assistant Commissioner of Police (Zone II) M.R.K Raju.

Excise policy

After the implementation of new excise policy, the number of liquor shops has come down from 423 to 321 and the permit room system has been abolished. The sale timings for liquor outlets and bars and have also been restricted to 8 p.m. and 10 p.m respectively.

Furthermore, the liquor prices have gone up. All these measures had an impact on the New Year revelry, said an officer of Prohibition and Excise Department.

“Even as the liquor sale figures saw an increase this time when compared to that of previous years, there was a drop in the quantity of sales,” said the excise officer.

The district recorded a sale of ₹15.57 crore on the new year eve this time, when compared to ₹12.27 crore in 2018. However, the quantity of IML sold was put at 18,155 cases and beer 12,914 cases on Dec 31, 2019, when compared to 18,918 IML cases and 19,558 beer cases in 2018.

“The rise in the sale figures is due to the increase in the liquor prices,” explained the excise officer.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/u5uq4h/article30454641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VZ3YEARENDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-sees-sober-new-year-revelry-thanks-to-strict-law-enforcement/article30454642.ece
475,2020/01/02,Man arrested on charge of stealing from train passengers,"In a joint operation by Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force (RPF), a man, who has allegedly committed nine thefts involving the estimated loot of more than ₹10 lakh, was nabbed here on Wednesday.

The offender has been identified as Biswajit Khosla (25), native of Koraput district in Odisha. According to RPF Senior Divisional Security Commissioner Jitendra Shrivastava, the accused has allegedly been lifting personal belongings of train passengers since March last year. He has allegedly been committing the crimes in running trains between Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram.

Describing his modus operandi, RPF inspector P.S. Rao said the he would board trains that start from Vizag and target isolated customers. “Khosla would wait for the passengers to go out to fetch a water bottle or to the toilet. He would steal items such as laptops, bags and cellphones and move to another coach. After travelling a distance, he would get down from the train,” said Mr. Rao.

After receiving a series of complaints, the GRP and the RPF had increased surveillance and acting on field inputs and CCTV footage, the joint team nabbed him on Wednesday. “We have seized six laptops and three cellphones from Khosla.

476,2020/01/02,Third lane connecting city railway station with Gopalapatnam sought,"In an attempt to ease the rail traffic congestion, the Zonal Railway Users’ Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) has proposed the third lane from Visakhapatnam railway station and Gopalapatnam diamond crossing.

The proposal, which was once considered for study by the Railway Board, has been take up again by the committee members.

“The new lane stretching over 7 km will cost around ₹30 crore to ₹40 crore. The rate of return on the project has been assessed by the divisional and zonal office and it has been submitted to the Railway Board,” said ZRUCC member N. Gajapathi Rao.

As many as 25 sets of regular and special trains are bypassing Visakhapatnam station, which is among the largest revenue-churner for the Railways.

Proposal submitted

“Diversion of trains to Duvvada will stop if the third lane is laid. The abstract estimate including the report and rate of return has been sent by the zonal office to the Railway Board. The proposal, if materialises, will ease traffic congestion to a large extent. More over, the land acquisition for the project will be minimal,” said Mr. Gajapathi Rao.

He sought extension of Howrah-Chennai Duronto Express five days a week to the main station from Duvvada.

Referring to AP Express, which plies between Visakhapatnam and New Delhi, he said it is being run with 16 Linke Hofmann Busch (LHB) coaches. Attaching sleeper class coaches is being pursued with the approval of North Central Railway and availability of stock, he said.

Train to Bengaluru

Mr. Rao said due to heavy demand, the East Coast Railway sent a proposal on November 28 to South Western Railway to run a bi-weekly special train between Visakhapatnam and Banaswadi for which the concurrence is awaited.

477,2020/01/02,Indira Gandhi zoo procured seven rare species in 2019,"The Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (IGZP) witnessed an eventful year in 2019, with the arrival of a number of rare species to the zoo as part of animal exchange programmes, apart from improving various amenities for the visitors.

According to officials, the zoo registered record footfalls during the Karthika Masam.

It all started in December 2018, when the zoo procured two male Royal Bengal tigers and several other species in exchange of animals with Pilukula Biological Park in Manguluru of Karnataka. In April last year, the zoo welcomed Sarus Crane, Indian Grey Wolf from Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens in Mysuru. In the second half of the year, Asiatic Lions and Grant’s Zebra and a few other animals were procured.

“We started working from the second half of 2018 on various proposals related to animal exchange programmes. It is tough to implement one animal exchange programme in a year. But in 2019, we successfully had completed three such programmes and added seven new species to our zoo,” said IGZP Curator Yesoda Bai. She attributed the success to Central Zoo Authority (CZA) for granting permissions at the earliest. “Without the cooperation from the officials of the other zoos across India and railways authorities who helped transport the animals, this could not have happened,” said Ms. Yesoda Bai.

Dream come true

According to the zoo officials, procuring pure-bred of Asiatic lions and a pair of Grant’s Zebra was a dream, as many attempts earlier had failed.

After the CZA’s nod, a pair of Asiatic Lions were procured from Sakkarbaug Zoo, in Junagarh of Gujarat in August, 2019. The lions were rescued from Sasan Gir in Gujarat. A pair of Grant’s Zebra were received from Zoological Garden at Alipore in Kolkata in November and the IGZP became the fourth zoo in India to have this species.

Tragic incidents

However, the zoo also saw the death of a baby giraffe after 17 days of its birth. This was also first time the zoo officials performed the first in-house breeding (captive breeding) of giraffe. However, it failed even after taking many preventive measures.

The male giraffe Beacon and female May that were brought from Zoo Negara in Kuala Lumpur of Malaysia in 2012 gave birth to a female giraffe in June, 2019. The zoo officials said the calf developed lactose intolerance, a digestive disorder that led to its death.

According to Ms. Yesoda Bai, the zoo did not receive feed charges from the government. “Only ₹30 lakh has been sanctioned when compared to the total amount of around ₹2 crore. The sanctioned amount was spent by May itself and the zoo has been bearing the burden since then,” she said.

Funds awaited

The zoo officials said it has been a long wait to receive the World Bank funds proposed under the Andhra Pradesh Disaster Recovery Project. The zoo is yet to receive around ₹360 crore as a part of the project, of which ₹180 crore is proposed to be spent on animal areas to improve the night and day house facilities while around ₹120 crore was proposed for restoration of buildings, visitor amenities and etc.

“The Detailed Project Report (DPR) prepared by the previous consultancy has been scrapped. A new agency has been assigned to prepare a new DPR in August. We hope that it gets ready soon,” the Curator added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/qr5u16/article30454578.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02VZ2ASIATICLIONS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/indira-gandhi-zoo-procured-seven-rare-species-in-2019/article30454579.ece
478,2020/01/02,Experiencing a profound form,"One of the most telling metaphors in Tipitika, it describes nirvana as the goal of Buddhism -- to a lamp being blown out with nothing remaining thereafter. When Buddhism, which emerged as a major ascetic religion in ancient India spread to far off regions and in cultures antagonistic to asceticism, the consequences were fascinating particularly in poetry and the arts.

A new vision of the world wedded Buddhist philosophy of impermanence to the celebration of that very principle of impermanence. This is particularly true of Japanese art. Said Van Gogh, who was deeply influenced by Japanese art : ‘Study Japanese artists. They show a whole world in the drop of dew.’ It is the same ideal that William Blake also held as fundamental: ‘To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower.’

The well-known artistic expressions of Japan like haiku poetry, landscape paintings, bonsai and so on are expressions of epiphanic celebration of the immediate which underscores Buddhist philosophy of impermanence at the same time upholding the world of senses. The celebration of senses is also reflected in other Mahayana Buddhist schools like Tibetan Vajrayana. Haiku poetry became internationally recognised, praised and imitated the world over. The imagistic poetry of Western modernism was an offshoot of Japanese haiku. Eisenstein one of tallest film makers of Europe too was deeply in by Japanese haiku poetry. It shaped his art of editing which he thought was fundamental to film making.

The present book (Basho's Narrow Road: Spring and Autumn Passages (Rock Spring Collection of Japanese Literature): Matsuo Basho, Hiroaki Sato) is a must-read for all lovers of Haiku poetry. Like anything that becomes globally acclaimed art forms the the international understanding, this form has also become stripped of its cultural, linguistic and spiritual specificity. This book is a corrective to superficial understanding of a profound form of poetry by locating it in the real life situations of the greatest haiku poet of the world, Basho.

Basho the monk and poet set out on a hike to the wilds of Northern Honshu in the spring of 1689. The outcome of this trip was one of the greatest classics of Japanese literature. Called ‘oku no Hosomichi’, it is a travel diary of sorts written in a mixture of haiku poetry and haiku-like prose.

Having failed to succeed in producing similar works in the past, he did not want take a chance this time. He worked with utmost dedication to finetune it for full four years after the journey was accomplished. Maybe that was his last love letter to the world as he passed away soon afterwards.

An appendix to this work is the renga sequence called ‘ Farewell Gift to Sora’, which was dedicated to his disciple and travel companion Sara, who had to part from the master before the completion of the journey due to illness.

Is it possible to sum up or explain a good haiku poem in other worlds? Efforts like this would lead to a situation like drawing too much attention to the finger pointing at the moon and forget to look at the moon. The same goes for this fascinating classic. It defies paraphrase of any kind like great haikus.

The mixed genres of poetry are not unknown to lovers of world literature. The champoo is an Indian equivalent. The great Sufic works like ‘ Gulistan’, ‘Parliment of Birds’, also exemplify this form. However, the comparison cannot be pushed further. The overarching linearity of these forms is missing in Basho’s classic. Further, it has a strong autobiographical element which strangely enough does not give us sufficient autobiographical clues.

The gnomic minimalism of the style is more than offset by rich resonances of every word, every image which make up the inalienable specificity of each: what Mahayana Buddhism would call Bhootatathata (That-ness of things). The Welshman poet Hopkins would have called it ‘instress of the inscape of things’

Here is sample passage:

That night we stayed in Izuka. There was a hot spring, so we took a bath, then sought a lodging place. It turned out to be a poor house where straw mats laid on the earth floor. Because there was not even a lamp we made our bed by the light from the fire pit and lay down. At night thunder rumbled and rain fell without interruption. There were leaks where we lay, and bitten by fleas and mosquitoes, we were unable to sleep...’

Places, people, scenes, monuments, birds, animals, insects and objects come and go. There is no elaborate description anywhere. But after a very brief entry and a very rapid exit they stay back in our minds like the smith who hosts Basho in a difficult terrain or the swordsman who conducts him safely through an impenetrable forest.

But what is running through all the prose and poems of this unique book is the poignancy of the beauty and evanescence of all things like in the following line from a haiku:

Quietness: sleeping into the rocks, the cicada’s voice.

Or:

I will ring the bell for fun as flowers scatter on me

In sum, renga is a sequence of haiku poems written by different poets but held together by a common theme in a conversational way. An example:

To spurn this world may be difficult, but you even refuse me temporary lodging.

—SAGYO

Having heard you have spurned the world I only hope you won’t think of a temporary lodging

-PROSTITUTE TAE

Basho himself recapitulates the central theme of art that seeks to reconcile the passing to the permanent:

In this world which place

Can I say is mine? Wherever I end up

I call it my inn

479,2020/01/02,"To see, to understand","One of the minor characters in this novel says - “Don’t paint any colour to anything that you find here. The truths that are accessible here have their own colours. If possible do recognize their true colors; otherwise just keep quiet…” (p.50). The novel Agedashtu Nakshatra by Sumangala, is an exploration of this idea of uniqueness in the things around us and the dire need to perceive them as they are, but not as we want them to be.

A post doctoral scholar of Archeaology, at the instance of his guide, chooses to participate in an excavation work on a site called Dholavira, in Gujarat. Along with the excavation work at the site, a series of explorations take place in and around the lives of three people in the novel. The three characters offer three simultaneous narratives juxtaposed with each other – the first narrative is of the main narrator himself who feels lost when his boyhood friend, whom he had thought had loved him, leaves for good to get married to a doctor; second narrative is of his friend, who is a computer engineer who opts out of marrying the man she had liked for her own reasons, who subsequently leaves her job as she finds it meaningless and takes to socially relevant work; third is of the scholar’s guide who is a widower, successfully faces the wrath of many around him when he wants to get married to a widow. Through each one of the three, the novelist is able to portray the complex nature of human behaviour. The common thread that binds the three distinct people in the novel is their concern, their understanding and their long association with each other.

The first narrative is about an excavation in literal terms. The excavation that is undertaken here is not just an academic exercise. There are personal, social, cultural and political dimensions to it. The task of getting ready for excavation both physically and emotionally, the actual hardwork of excavation under extreme environmental conditions, and putting the findings in an order to draw broad generalisations about the life that existed in the distant past are all experientially satisfying details presented here. The process is actually digging the past to understand the present complexities. The excavation as an image is also quite interesting. Agedashtu Nakshatra - The more you dig, the more you get – but though materialistically speaking, the outcome is just a clay star that is procured as a gift to the beloved, the act of exploration is in itself valuable.

The second narrative includes personal interviews of five people who were directly affected by the suicides of families in old Mysore area. Though the main reason for farmers’ suicide appears to be sheer financial crises in their lives, a closer exploration reveals that the genesis of the problems is also of socio-cultural nature. The heavy loans, which are beyond the capacity of repayment of any of these families, are taken for compelling socio-cultural reasons. Though it is men who commit suicide, cutting across caste, it is only women in their families who take all the brunt of it, - it is always either the wife or the mother or the daughter, or the sister of the deceased. However poignant each suicide is, and however useless it is to track the nature of suicide as no help seems to be forthcoming either by a governmental or a non-governmental agency immediately, interviewing the families is found to be important as it could lead to an understanding of the complex nature of human beings in great distress. The third narrative has to do with the marriage of a widower with a widow; but the people belonging to the families related to them are deeply affected by it, rightly or wrongly. The relationship is challenged on moral, social and economic grounds. But the firm stand taken by the two ends in the marriage.

The two protagonists of the first two narratives come to live together to lead a life of their own. Agriculture, which affected the lives of the five farming families so tragically, is chosen as a medium for their expression of social and cultural concerns.

The predictable nature of the characters and the plot lessens the impact of the narration in the novel. But the sensitive nature of the narrative as a whole makes the reading enjoyable.",reviews,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/wl8yh2/article30459064.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bgfdance2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-reviews/to-see-to-understand/article30459065.ece
480,2020/01/02,Mukesh Garg’s “Sahitya aur Sangeet” fills the gap between literature and music,"Literature and music share a complex relationship although both deal with sounds and turn them into meaningful expression. However, their treatment is very dissimilar as literature deals with ideas, thoughts, feelings and emotions while music deals with only feelings and emotions. When they interact with each other, the interaction often results in the expansion and enrichment of both the art forms. Many tomes have been written on Hindustani music dealing with various forms like classical, semi-classical, folk and film music but there is hardly any book that focuses on the complexity of the relationship between literature and music.

Cover of Mukesh Garg’s book

This gap was filled when Mukesh Garg, who retired from Delhi University’s Hindi Department as Associate Professor, selected and edited articles that dealt with the literature-music tango and produced two volumes of “Sahitya aur Sangeet” (Literature and Music). It speaks volumes about the state of intellectual curiosity in the worlds of both Hindi and Hindustani music that, although Vani Prakashan brought them out more than five years ago in 2014, they have not received adequate attention.

Mukesh Garg and his family are living examples of the way literature can gainfully combine with music. He trained in violin and one of his gurus happened to be N. Rajam, the foremost exponent of violin in Hindustani classical music who honed her musical skills under the guidance of the legendary Omkar Nath Thakur. He also edited the monthly magazine “Sangeet” for more than twenty years. And, herein lies a tale that many may not be familiar with.

Sharp message

The wider world of Hindi literature has not forgotten Kaka Hathrasi (September 18, 1906 - September 18, 1995) who was the uncrowned king of Kavi Sammelans because of his extraordinary wit and a rare ability to compose funny poems on the spot. Although his poetry was satirical and comic in nature, it also contained sharp social and political messages. His real name was Prabhulal Garg and he was Mukesh Garg’s uncle. While the world knew him as hasya-kavi Kaka, he had another persona that was as much, if not more, important as his public one. He was an expert in Hindustani classical music and his services to the cause of its promotion remain unsung.

In 1932, Prabhulal Garg established Sangeet Karyalaya in his home town Hathras in western Uttar Pradesh and collected, edited and published old treatises on classical and other forms of music. He himself wrote many books and launched a monthly Hindi magazine titled “Sangeet” in 1935. It was the only magazine of its kind and there was a time when musicians such as Ravi Shankar wrote for it. It carried informative articles on gharanas, history of music, forms of vocal and instrumental music and introductory books about various musical instruments and the technique of their playing. Later, Kaka’s nephews Lakshmi Narayan Garg and Mukesh Garg helped him in editing the magazine which, though past its prime, survives to this day.

Little wonder that Mukesh Garg emerged as a highly regarded musicologist in addition to being an authority on that period of medieval Brajbhasha poetry that is known as Reetikaal in Hindi academic circles. He also established a pan-Indian organisation Sangeet Sankalp towards the end of 1980 to provide platform for struggling young musicians and to promote and propagate Hindustani music. Now, it has nearly 125 chapters in various cities and towns all over India.

The two-volume “Sahitya aur Sangeet” is a veritable treasure trove and contains 71 articles penned by the likes of Acharya Brihaspati and Prabhudayal Meetal. They cover the entire history of the evolution of Hindustani music, right from the Vedic age to the present day and offer informative as well as analytical articles that tell us about the way music has shaped up the country’s cultural life. One finds articles on music in Buddhist Pali literature and orchestra in Buddhist art, music in our epics, The Ramayana and The Mahabharata, Kalidasa’s works as well as Shudrak’s plays, music in the Sikh tradition as well as in the Vaishnavite Haveli sangeet, the relationship between music and the works of Surdas and other Ashtachhaap poets, Sufi music and the evolution of qawwali and other forms.

They also discuss the contribution of Panditraj Jagannath – the last great aesthetic theorist in the long tradition of Sanskrit poetics– to Brajbhasha poetry and the region’s music, musical compositions of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah ‘Rangeela’, musicality in Hindi poets like Prasad and Nirala, the element of thumri in Rajasthani folk songs, and indifference to the words of the bandish in khayal singing.

Mukesh Garg has written an introduction that raises many questions – some of them methodological – about the complex nature of the relationship between literature and music. Only scholarship based on rigorous research can find answers to them.",authors,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/books/books-authors/mukesh-gargs-sahitya-aur-sangeet-fills-the-gap-between-literature-and-music/article30459545.ece

The 28-year-old said the nagging injury has come in the way of her dream to be a part of India’s Tokyo Olympics campaign this year.

“Today is a very emotional day for me as I have decided to retire from International Hockey,” she said in a statement issued by Hockey India.

In the team since 2008, Lakra captained India during the 2018 Asian Champions Trophy, leading the side to a second-place finish in the event. In all, she played 139 matches for India and her achievements also included being part of the side that claimed the 2014 Asian Games bronze medal.

“I was very fortunate to have played at the Rio Olympics in 2016, India’s first appearance in over three decades. As much as I wish to be part of the Indian team as they prepare for the Tokyo Olympics, my knee injuries have cut short my dream. I have been told by the doctors that I would be requiring another knee surgery in the coming days and I am unsure how long it would take before I fully recover,” she explained.

Lakra said after recovering, she would continue to turn up in domestic hockey.

“Pursuant to my treatment, I will play domestic hockey and play for NALCO who have supported my career by providing me a job,” she said.

“I have come a long way in the sport and I carry with me some great memories with the Indian team who have stood strong by my side and the girls were always my family away from home,” she added.

Lakra thanked her teammates and chief coach Sjoerd Marijne for their support.

“My heartfelt thanks to Hockey India who ensured I was given the best treatment during my injury and I am grateful for their unparalleled support to women’s hockey. My family, my husband and friends back in Odisha have been my strongest supporters and I wish to thank them for helping me pursue my passion for hockey. I could not have come this far without their encouragement,” she said.

India captain Rani Rampal said Lakra would be missed.

“Congratulations @sunitalakraodisha26 for a wonderful carrier. Will definately (sic) miss the best moments we have shared on the field and dressing room for more than a decade.
