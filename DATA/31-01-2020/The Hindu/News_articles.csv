0,2020/01/31,"Sathiyan, Sharath present a picture in contrast","G. Sathiyan and Sharath Kamal present a contrasting picture when it comes to being motivated to win the men’s singles title in the on-going National table tennis championship here.

Ranked 30th in the world and favourite for a maiden National title this weekend, Sathiyan is keen to put aside the poor showings in the recent World Team Qualification tournament, for the 2020 Olympic Games, and ensure the crown that eluded him last year.

Sharath, ranked 33rd and the most successful men’s National champion, gives the impression of not being motivated enough to win a 10th title. Last year, he was lucky to beat Sathiyan and break Kamlesh Mehta’s record — set in 1995 — of eight titles.

No secret

Sathiyan makes no secret of his resolve to win this time. “I value the National title. I know, things did not go my way in Portugal recently but I’m confident of producing my best here.”

In contrast, second seed Sharath says, “Though we did not qualify as a team for the Olympics, overall, I’m happy with the way I played. Here, people expect me to win my 10th singles title but I’m not losing my sleep over it. I’ll give it a shot but will not be too disappointed if I don’t win.”

Serious challenge

From the top-half of the draw, Sathiyan could face some serious challenge Manav Thakkar or former champion A. Amalraj in the semifinal.

For Sharath, a quarterfinal clash with former champion Soumyajit Ghosh, seeded seventh, looks possible. Thereafter, the next rival could be either former winner, left-handed Sanil Shetty or Harmeet Desai.

Among the ladies, where Manika Batra is the only absentee, top seed and former holder Sutirtha Mukherjee was the first to sail into the round of 32.

Not unexpected

Meanwhile, not entirely unexpected was the exit of defending champion Archana Kamath. Despite not having recovered fully from a knee-injury suffered recently in Gondomar (Portugal), the fifth seed played and lost 0-4 to Manushree Patil. Archana’s ouster made it easier for fourth seed Ayhika Mukherjee.

Sutirtha can expect eighth seed Reeth Rishya in the quarterfinals and Ayhika in the semifinals.

The lower half has Sreeja Akula and Anusha Kutumbale, seeded two and seven, eyeing a last-eight berth. The winner of their clash could face last year’s finalist Krittwika Sinha Roy or Prapti Sen, seeded three and six, in the semifinals.

3,2020/01/31,Petroleum men and Railways emerge victorious,"Before the men’s team final, if anyone had suggested that Petroleum’s formidable trio of G. Sathiyan, Harmeet Desai and Manav Thakkar could be taken to deciders by little-known rivals from Delhi, many would have scoffed at the idea.

The difference

As it turned out, Parth Virmani, Sudhanshu Grover and Payas Jain did last five sets before exposure and experience made the difference in the National table tennis championship here.

Eventually, the scoreline read 3-0 in Petroleum’s favour without reflecting the closeness of the contest. Of the lot, Sathiyan lived most dangerously against Virmani. Facing three match-points at 7-10 in the decider, Sathiyan pulled off five straight points.

The women’s final witnessed proceedings contrary to expectations of a close clash.

Railways’ Sagarika Mukherjee, Takeme Sarkar and Moumita Dutta joined hands for a resounding 3-0 victory over defending champion Bengal-A.

For the record, the title was the 11th for Railway women and first since January 1999, when they triumphed in Chennai. Since its last win, Railways finished runner-up six times.

For Petroleum men, it was the 24th occasion as champion.

Delhi, playing the final after 1983, came up with a gallant display. Grover, struggling for the better part of the team event, took the first two sets against Harmeet to inject the much-needed self-belief in the Delhi camp.

But as the match progressed, Harmeet proved stronger and raced away with the last three sets.

Fighter

Sathiyan, expected to brush aside Virmani in quick time, dropped the second and fourth sets in contrasting ways before staring at defeat in the fifth. Serving at match-point, Virmani played it safe with a short serve and Sathiyan was quick to finish the point. Thereafter, Sathiyan gave nothing away.

Payas, 16, touted as the most promising talent in the country, made the most of the big stage by winning the close first and fourth sets, before Thakkar broke away from 3-3 in the decider to win eight of the last nine points.

The results (Team championship finals):

Men: Petroleum bt Delhi 3-0 [Harmeet Desai bt Sudhanshu Grover 7-11, 8-11, 11-5, 11-4, 11-6; G. Sathiyan bt Parth Virmani 11-8, 9-11, 11-5, 6-11, 12-10; Manav Thakkar bt Payas Jain 9-11, 11-6, 11-6, 11-13, 11-4].

4,2020/01/31,"Rivals on court, friends off it","The smiles said it all! The mutual respect that World champion P.V. Sindhu of Hyderabad Hunters and former World No. 1 Tai Tzu Ying of defending champion, Bengaluru Raptors, have for each was evident when they shared the stage for a promotional event of the on-going Premier Badminton League here on Thursday.

Ahead of their clash — billed as one of the contests of this edition — their camaraderie served as a reminder of the friendship they carry off court.

“Our rivalry is confined to the court and we never take it beyond that. The rivalry has to be there to spur you to give off your best and that is why these sporting rivalries are most talked about,” Sindhu said.

Respect

Tai Tzu, communicating via an interpreter, revealed the respect she has for Sindhu. “It will be a very tough match tomorrow. The home crowd will be cheering Sindhu and I have to be at my best to beat her in what is obviously a very important match for our team,” said the superstar from Taiwan.

For Sindhu it is a different proposition to play in the PBL as compared to the Super Series or the Inter-Continental championships.

Demanding format

“The 15-point format is demanding as there is no way you can relax. You have to stay focussed especially when the scores are tied 14-all. It is one point which separates the winner. That is something really exciting and challenging,” Sindhu said.

“You have to change your strategy according to the team’s needs,” said Tai Tzu.

Sindhu brushed aside the absence of China’s big guns in the PBL.

“It is not disappointing as the PBL still has world-class players like Tai and many others. There is no dearth of either class and quality and the young talent can learn so many things watching them,” she added.

When the two champions posed with the winner’s trophy, not surprisingly, there were quite a few lighter moments shared by them to the delight of the select audience.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/7vtncn/article30693929.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th31bad,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/rivals-on-court-friends-off-it/article30693930.ece

Ankita broke serve seven times, and capitalised on the nine double faults that the Swiss delivered in the match. Ankita handled the climax well, as she raced through from 3-4 in the decider, dropping four points in all, and breaking serve twice.

In the semifinals, Ankita will play another Swiss, Leonie Kung.

Ankita made the doubles final, as the top seed in partnership with Bibiane Schoofs of the Netherlands. The duo will play the Thai team of Supapitch Kuearum and Mananchaya Sawangkaew in the title clash.

6,2020/01/31,Australian Open | Dominic Thiem beats Alexander Zverev to reach final,"Dominic Thiem won the new-generation battle with Alex Zverev 3-6 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(4) to reach his first Australian Open final on Friday and set up the ultimate test against Melbourne Park maestro Novak Djokovic.

In an enthralling semifinal featuring a rain interruption, a lighting failure and a plenty of drama besides, the fifth seeded Austrian shrugged off a sluggish start and was braver on the big points under the roof at Rod Laver Arena.

He thrashed two blazing forehand winners to raise three match points in the decisive tiebreak, then sealed it with a cross-court volley to book his third Grand Slam final after losing the last two French Open deciders to Rafa Nadal.

“Both of us could have won this today,” Thiem, who dumped Nadal from the quarterfinals, said on court.

“Maybe (I have) a little bit of experience, little bit of something else. He's just 22, maybe not long before he makes it to his first Grand Slam final.

“It was an unreal match, again two tiebreaks, so tough and so close. It was almost impossible to break him.”

With the men's Grand Slams dominated for years by the 'Big Three' of Djokovic, Nadal and Roger Federer, Thiem will bid to become the first man born in the 1990s to win a major title.

For two players seeking a maiden final in Melbourne, it was a nervous start with each dropping their opening service games before rain halted play briefly for the roof to close.

After the resumption, Thiem was the first to blink with a double fault opening the door for Zverev, who crashed through to break the Austrian in the seventh game.

Still rattled, Thiem conceded the set in a flurry of unforced errors.

Zverev had served woefully in his dreadful ATP Cup in the leadup to Melbourne, but he needed only two second serves in the entire first set.

The demons returned briefly, however, as he opened the third game of the second set with consecutive double faults before dropping serve.

But that was just the cue for a madcap phase of service breaks and sparkling rallies -- and also a few bone-headed shots -- from both players.

Thiem finally held to 5-3, but the madness continued.

In an outrageous game of net-rushing, botched overhead smashes and thumping groundstrokes, Thiem fought off two break points before blasting an ace down the 'T' to take the set and level the match.

Light failure

The pair had literally shot the lights out, and play was halted for a second time after Zverev held serve to 1-0 in the third set due to lamps failing on the roof.

Following a break of some seven minutes, Thiem landed a crushing blow, luring Zverev into an ill-fated trip to the net before ripping a backhand past him to take his serve again.

He began throwing Zverev around the court with his power but the German hung tough, claiming a spell-binding rally with a searing pass after Thiem had dived like a goalkeeper for a volley.

Thiem dropped serve and Zverev lifted with some superb tennis.

His line call challenges were appalling, however, and he used up his quota by the ninth game, leading to a minor tantrum and a code violation for an audible obscenity.

Fired up, he prised two set points from Thiem but the Austrian nervelessly saved both before racing away in the tiebreak.

A sizzling forehand down the line brought three set points, and Thiem converted the first with a sumptuous one-handed backhand winner fired from an absurd angle.

There was no glorious dash to the finish line for Thiem, with the fourth set a grind but he was magnificent in the tiebreak as he courageously attacked the lines before claiming it with a decisive rush to the net.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/bbgdzf/article30703916.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THIEM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/australian-open-dominic-thiem-beats-alexander-zverev-to-reach-final/article30703917.ece

Health Agency's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing in Geneva as he declared a “public health emergency of international concern.”

Over 20 children, aged between six months and 15 years, were rescued after an armed man, a murder convict who took them hostage after inviting them for a birthday party at his house in a village at Farrukhabad, was killed on January 30 night, police said.

India’s economy needs to be evaluated in terms of the global misery index (GMI), the Congress said on Thursday. The benchmark measures people’s “misery score” based on parameters such as unemployment and inflation rate instead of the conventional gross domestic product (GDP), it said. At a press conference at the party’s headquarters just days ahead of the Budget, former Union Minister Manish Tewari said India now ranked high on the global misery index as it scored poorly on the key economic parameters factored in by the GMI.

India should address the concerns regarding the new citizenship law, the envoy of the United Kingdom said here on Thursday High Commissioner Sir Dominique Asquith’s comment came even as the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) maintained that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, is an internal matter of the country. “We noted what the government said that, ‘together with all, development for all, trust for all’, and I believe that is the manifested commitment of this government and I trust that it will continue to address the concerns that have been expressed. But that is for the Indian government and the Indian people,” Sir Dominique said.

The United States on Thursday extended exemptions to let an internationally-backed nuclear deal with Iran go forward, even as it announced new sanctions to step up pressure.

Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and the global protest movement “Fridays for Future” were nominated Thursday for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize by two Swedish lawmakers. “Greta Thunberg is a climate activist, and the main reason she deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is that despite her young age, she has worked hard to make politicians open their eyes to the climate crisis,” Left Party Parliamentarians Jens Holm and Hakan Svenneling wrote in a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

9,2020/01/31,Donald Trump likely to be acquitted,"With a key Senator declaring that he would vote against new witnesses in the impeachment trial of U.S. President Donald Trump, the President is likely to be acquitted before the close of Friday’s Senate session. GOP Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said Mr. Trump’s relationship with Ukraine were inappropriate but not grounds for his removal.

“It was inappropriate for the President to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold U.S. aid to encourage that investigation,” Mr. Alexander, who is retiring this year, said via a statement. “But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the President from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.”

Mr. Trump was impeached by the House of Representatives in December for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. A House Democrat-led inquiry had concluded that Mr. Trump conditioned $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine and a crucial White House meeting with its President Volodymyr Zelensky on the Ukrainians publicly announcing investigations into former Vice-President and leading Democrat candidate for the White House, Joseph Biden, and his son, Hunter, who was on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.

“The question then is not whether the President did it, but whether the U.S. Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday,” Mr. Alexander said.

Democrats would like to hear testimony from former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who had said, as per reports of a leaked book manuscript, that Mr. Trump had asked him to withhold aid pending Ukraine’s announcement of investigations.

A minimum of four Republican senators would need to vote with their 47 Democrat colleagues to get the 51 of 100 votes required to summon new evidence and witnesses. In addition to Mr. Alexander, Democrats were hopeful that three others would vote with them — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine and former Presidential candidate and Massachusetts Governor Mitch Romney.

Ms. Collins has said she will vote for new witnesses and Mr. Romney has indicated he is also likely to vote that way.

“Why should this body not call Ambassador Bolton?” Ms. Murkowski asked the President’s counsel on Thursday night, as two days of Senators asking questions, moderated by Chief Justice John Roberts, drew to a close.

Even if Ms Murkowski decides to vote for witnesses on Friday, it only gets the ‘ yes ’ votes to 50 – potentially requiring Justice Roberts to break a tie. It is unclear whether the Chief Justice will intervene.

Trump heads to Iowa

Mr. Trump addressed a rally at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa on Thursday — where the 2020 presidential race kicks off on Monday night when members of the Democratic and Republican party begin the process of choosing their presidential candidates in the Iowa Caucuses.

“Washington Dems have spent the last 3 years trying to overturn the last election – and we will make sure they face another crushing defeat in the NEXT ELECTION,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Thursday night.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/wbcoab/article30705796.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Lamar-Alexander,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-likely-to-be-acquitted/article30705797.ece

11,2020/01/31,SARS-like coronavirus outbreak: Court slams police for crackdown on ‘rumour’,"A too-harsh crackdown on online rumours during China’s deadly viral epidemic had undermined public trust, the country’s top court said on Wednesday, in a highly rare rebuke of the police force.

China has been battling the spread of infection that has surpassed the global reach of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-03.

Authorities informed the World Health Organization about the new virus on the December 31, 2019. A day later, eight people were punished by police for claiming online that Wuhan was in the grip of a fresh SARS outbreak.

The group were reprimanded for “publishing or forwarding false information on the internet without verification”, a police statement at the time said.

But Supreme Court judge Tang Xinghua wrote on Wednesday that officers should have been more lenient.

“If the public had believed these ‘rumours’ at the time, and carried out measures like wearing masks, strictly disinfecting and avoiding wildlife markets... it might have been a good thing,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sars-like-coronavirus-outbreak-court-slams-police-for-crackdown-on-rumour/article30705602.ece
12,2020/01/31,Brexit brings a new dawn for United Kingdom: Boris Johnson,"Britain on Friday ends almost half a century of integration with Europe, finally making its historic departure from the EU to begin a new — but still uncertain — future, with emotions running high following years of wrangling and several false starts.

At the clocks strike 11:00 p.m. (2300 GMT) — midnight in Brussels — Britain becomes the first country to leave the 28-member bloc and will go it alone for the first time since 1973.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed Brexit since the 2016 referendum vote to leave that triggered deep bitterness and division but he has promised to unite the country in a new era of prosperity.

“Our job as the government, my job, is to bring this country together and take us forward,” Mr. Johnson said in a statement to mark the occasion.

“This is not an end but a beginning. This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act.”

A ‘sea change’

German Chancellor Angela Merkel called Britain’s departure a “sea-change” for the bloc, although nothing will immediately feel different because of an 11-month transition period negotiated as part of an EU-UK exit deal ratified this week.

Britons will be able to work in and trade freely with EU nations until December 31, and vice versa, although the U.K. will no longer be represented in the bloc’s institutions.

But legally, Britain is out — with no easy way back.

And while the exit terms have been agreed, Britain must still strike a deal on future relations with the EU, its largest trading partner, which sets out its negotiating position on Monday.

“We want to have the best possible relationship with the United Kingdom, but it will never be as good as membership,” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said.

Years of tumult

Getting this far has been a traumatic process.

Despite Britain’s resistance to many EU projects over the years — it refused to join the single currency or the Schengen free travel area — the 2016 vote to leave was a huge shock.

It unleashed political chaos in London, sparking years of bitter arguments that paralysed parliament and forced the resignations of two Prime Ministers.

Mr. Johnson brought an end to the turmoil with his decisive election victory last month, which gave him the parliamentary majority to ratify the Brexit deal.

In Scotland, which backed remaining in the bloc in 2016, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called it “a moment of real and profound and sadness... tinged with anger”.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/8l1vh/article30705522.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-johnson,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/brexit-brings-a-new-dawn-for-united-kingdom-boris-johnson/article30705523.ece

Mr. Erdogan, a strong advocate of Palestinian rights, singled out Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman.

“Saudi Arabia in particular, you are silent. When will you break your silence? You look at Oman, Bahrain, and Abu Dhabi is the same,” he said.

“Shame on you! Shame on you! How will those hands that applaud (the plan) give an account of this treacherous step?”

15,2020/01/31,Britain reports first case of coronavirus infection in two from same family,"Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for coronavirus, the first such cases in Britain, health chiefs said on Friday as an evacuation flight brought Britons home from the centre of the outbreak in China.

Officials had warned that the United Kingdom was highly likely to have cases of the new coronavirus, which first emerged in China's central province of Hubei and has killed 213 people so far.

“The patients are receiving specialist National Health Service (NHS) care and we are using tried and tested infection-control procedures to prevent further spread of the virus,” said England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty.

He said the two infected patients, who local media said had been staying at a hotel in the city of York, had been transferred to a specialist infectious disease unit in Newcastle, northeast England.

Mr. Whitty said it could turn out to be a relatively minor infection as there was only a 2% mortality rate.

Staff, other patients and the general public would not be at risk, he said and health officials were tracing those who had been in close contact with the pair.

Mr. Whitty also said they were extending their advice so that anyone who had returned from China should “self-isolate” if they developed symptoms of any kind.

On Thursday, Britain raised the perceived risk level to the country from an outbreak of coronavirus in China to moderate from low after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.

A plane carrying 83 British and 27 European Union nationals from Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, landed in Britain on Friday and was due to fly on to Spain. The returning Britons will be quarantined for 14 days at an NHS facility in northwest England.

One of those on board, Ben Williams, told BBC TV he had just got married in China and had been on his honeymoon. He said he had been forced to leave behind his wife, a Chinese national, because they had not had time to arrange for her to come.

“Hopefully it's only a few months,” he said. “It's good to be back but I also miss China as well.”

Mr. Whitty said the intention was to keep those who had returned close to medical services in case they needed them.

“What we hope is that all these people will have 14 days isolated from the general public but not in the sense of solitary confinement and then they will be able to be released without any symptoms at all,” he said.

Senior British minister Michael Gove said Britain would send another plane to Wuhan if necessary.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qiuzgx/article30704755.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BRITAINCORONAVIRUS-24jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/britain-reports-first-case-of-coronavirus-infection-in-two-from-same-family/article30704739.ece

There were no reports of casualties or major damage from the exchange of fire overnight, which came amid heightened tensions after President Donald Trump released his Mideast plan, a U.S. initiative aimed at ending the conflict that heavily favors Israel and was rejected by the Palestinians.

Gaza has been relatively calm in recent months as Egyptian and U.N. mediators have worked to shore up an informal truce between Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules the coastal territory.

Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have rejected the Trump plan, which would allow Israel to annex all of its Jewish settlements, along with the Jordan Valley, in the occupied West Bank.

19,2020/01/31,"In boost for Trump, key Republican senator opposes calling witnesses","A key Republican senator said late Thursday that he would oppose calling new witnesses at Donald Trump's impeachment trial, paving the way for the possible acquittal of the president by the Senate as early as Friday.

Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said he would vote ""no"" when the question of calling further witnesses at the trial is considered on Friday.

Four Republican votes were needed to introduce new witnesses into the proceedings, and Alexander had been considered one of a handful of Republican senators who might support the motion.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she would support the call for witnesses, and Utah Senator Mitt Romney has said he was ""very likely"" to do so.

Another wavering Republican -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- has said she will announce her decision Friday morning.

Republicans hold a 53 to 47 seat edge in the Senate, and four Republicans needed to side with the Democrats for new witnesses to be introduced.

If the motion for new witnesses is rejected, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could conceivably call for a vote to convict or acquit the president as soon as Friday.

Democrats are particularly eager to hear from former national security advisor John Bolton, who reportedly claims in an upcoming book that Trump personally told him that military assistance to Ukraine was tied to Kiev investigating his Democratic rival Joe Biden.

20,2020/01/31,Trump vows deportation relief for Iraqi Christian immigrants,"President Donald Trump promised Thursday “to make sure we do everything we can” to shield Christian Iraqi immigrants from deportation.

The president’s promise came during a half-hour speech to workers at a suburban Detroit axle factory.

As is his custom, Mr. Trump touched on a number of topics within a short time, particularly his price over the new trade agreement between the United States, Mexico and Canada.

""We’re going to make sure we do everything we can to keep people who have been good to this country out of harm’s way,” Mr. Trump said of offering visa extensions to the immigrants. He left unclear, however, who would be eligible to remain in the United States.

A Trump executive order barring admission into the U.S. of nationals from seven nations, including Iraq, had triggered immigration raids in June 2017 that placed about 1,400 Iraqis into immigration detention. Moolenaar and U.S. Rep. Andy Levin, a Democrat who represents a suburban Detroit district, have introduced legislation to block the deportations.

21,2020/01/31,State of emergency declared as bushfire threatens Australian capital,"Australian officials declared a state of emergency for the capital city of Canberra and surrounding regions on Friday, as soaring temperatures and strong winds threatened to propel a large bushfire beyond the control of firefighters.

Andrew Barr, Chief Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), said the decision to declare the first state of emergency since fatal wildfires in 2003 indicated the potential danger over the weekend.

Officials said an uncontrolled fire in the ACT's south, on the doorstep of Canberra, had grown to 185 sq km, almost 8% of the territory's land mass.

“This fire may become very unpredictable. It may become uncontrollable,” Mr. Barr told reporters in a televised briefing. ”The combination of extreme heat, wind, and a dry landscape will place suburbs in Canberra's south at risk.”

Australia's federal parliament is located in Canberra, which is also home to several government and independent institutions as well as national museums. Four people died and almost 500 homes were destroyed in the 2003 Canberra fires.

The state of emergency declared on Friday will run for 72 hours, giving authorities greater powers to order evacuations, close roads and take control of private property.

Heatwave conditions are also expected to sweep through Victoria and New South Wales states over the weekend, where some 80 fires are burning.

In neighbouring New Zealand, where smoke from the Australian blazes has turned glaciers brown, firefighters were battling to contain around 25 fires that spread rapidly to cover around 100 hectares on the South Island. Heatwave conditions were also forecast for much of the country over the weekend.

Australia has been battling bushfires across its east coast that have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. Around 2,500 homes have been destroyed as more than 11.7 million hectares (117,000 sq km) have been razed.

Key events on Friday in the bushfire crisis:

* There were 58 active fires in NSW state, 20 in Victoria and 22 in South Australia.

* Temperatures across NSW and Victoria states were forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degree Fahrenheit) on Friday.

* The Australian Energy Market Operator, attempting to prevent supply shortages, urged people in Victoria to restrict energy use on Friday evening when demand is expected to peak because of unusually high humidity.

* Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who critics say has not done enough to address the impact of climate change, on Friday pledged funding for emissions reduction projects as part of a A$2 billion ($1.37 billion) package to increase gas supplies in NSW.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/37myo4/article30511705.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ABHINAYABUSHFIREAUSTRALIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/state-of-emergency-declared-as-bushfire-threatens-australian-capital/article30699420.ece
22,2020/01/31,"China reports new cases, deaths as virus declared emergency","The World Health Organization declared the outbreak sparked by a new virus in China that has spread to more than a dozen countries a global emergency after the number of cases spiked more than tenfold in a week, including the highest death toll in a 24-hour period reported Friday.

China counted 9,692 confirmed cases with a death toll of 213, including 43 new fatalities. The vast majority of the cases have been in Hubei province and its provincial capital, Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. No deaths have been reported outside China.

The U.N. health agency defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.

China first informed WHO about cases of the new virus in late December. Eighteen other countries have since reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.

Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and have noted with concern instances in other countries - including the United States, France, Japan, Germany, Canada, South Korea and Vietnam - where there have also been isolated cases of human-to-human transmission.

Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted the worrisome spread of the virus between people outside China.

""The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,” he said. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.”

""This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,” he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.”

A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.

China’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said Thursday evening in New York that “we are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus” but stressed that the epidemic is still mainly confined to China and urged the international community against any overreaction.

Mr. Zhang told reporters “we are still making our assessment” of the WHO declaration.

""While we understand the concerns of other countries, we should also listen to advice of the director-general of WHO” who said he had full confidence in China’s efforts in fighting the epidemic and “there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with the international travel and trade,” Mr. Zhang said.

In the wake of numerous airlines cancelling flights to China and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald’s temporarily closing hundreds of shops, Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China.

""There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.

On Thursday, France confirmed that a doctor who was in contact with a patient with the new virus later became infected himself. The doctor is now being treated in an isolated room at a Paris hospital. Outbreak specialists worry that the spread of new viruses from patients to health workers can signal the virus is becoming adapted to human transmission.

Russia announced it was closing its 4,185-km border with China, joining Mongolia and North Korea in barring crossings to guard against the new viral outbreak. It had been de facto closed because of the Lunar New Year holiday, but Russian authorities said the closure would be extended until March 1.

Meanwhile, the United States and South Korea confirmed their first cases of person-to-person spread of the virus. The man in the U.S. is married to a 60-year-old Chicago woman who got sick from the virus after she returned from a trip to Wuhan, the Chinese city that is the epicenter of the outbreak.

The case in South Korea was a 56-year-old man who had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the new virus earlier.

Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus in Japan and Germany is worrying.

In Japan, a man in his 60s caught the virus after working as a bus driver for two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, a man in his 30s was sickened after a Chinese colleague from Shanghai, whose parents had recently visited from Wuhan, came to his office for a business meeting. Four other workers later became infected. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China.

""That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee.

The new virus has now infected more people in China than were sickened there during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/o9aybo/article30670855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th27-BINDU-LANCGA271L4VR3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/china-reports-new-cases-deaths-as-virus-declared-emergency/article30699351.ece
23,2020/01/31,Japan to enforce special measures for coronavirus from Saturday: government,"Japan said on Friday that it would bring forward the date that the coronavirus will become a ”designated infectious disease” to Saturday from Feb. 7, as a third chartered flight carrying Japanese citizens arrived from Wuhan.

Japan now has 14 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, an epidemic that is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Two of those returned on the first chartered flight and had shown no symptoms.

An image of a coronavirus.

As worries grew in Japan over a further spread of the disease, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone infected and consider stricter screening for suspected cases, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.

Mr. Suga also told a news conference that the government would consider paying for the chartered flights out of Wuhan, as opposition lawmakers criticised its policy of charging passengers 80,000 yen ($730) each.

“We decided on these changes in view of the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of a global emergency,” Suga said.

The government classified the new coronavirus as a designated infectious disease on Tuesday, but the designation was only set to take effect on Feb. 7 after ordinances are issued, in line with regulations. The designation allows compulsory hospitalisation and the use of public funds for treatment, among other measures.

The third flight out of Wuhan, which arrived on Friday morning, brings the total number of expatriated nationals to 565, Suga said.

24,2020/01/31,Prince Harry loses complaint against ‘Mail on Sunday’ over Instagram photo,"Britain's press watchdog has rejected a complaint by Prince Harry over a tabloid newspaper article which said wild animals pictured in photos he posted on Instagram had been drugged and tied up.

Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, posted the pictures he had taken of African wildlife on his Instagram account, which then had 5.6 million followers, to mark Earth Day and highlight conservation efforts.

But the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported last April that the photos had not revealed the full story. It said the animals involved had been tranquillised and that a picture of an elephant in Malawi had been edited so that it was not possible to see there was a rope around its hind legs.

“Drugged and tethered ... what Harry didn’t tell you about those awe-inspiring wildlife photos,” read the headline.

The prince argued the report was inaccurate because it indicated he had intentionally misled the public to think that he was a superior wildlife photographer who had captured the pictures under dangerous circumstances, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) watchdog said.

Harry said his caption had made clear the animals were being relocated as part of conservation efforts and that the photo had only been edited to meet Instagram's formatting requirements.

However, the paper said Harry had not explained the circumstances of the photo to his followers and that he had not needed to crop the pictures in the way he had.

IPSO's complaints committee supported the paper's argument and rejected Harry's claim that the article was inaccurate.

“The committee did not consider that it was significantly misleading to report that the photographs posted on the complainants Instagram account did not quite tell the full story and that the complainant had not explained the circumstances in which the photographs had been taken,” it said.

Harry and his wife Meghan have increasingly become embroiled in conflict with Britain's tabloid newspapers.

Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, and Harry has accused some newspapers of bullying his wife in the same way they treated his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her limousine sped away from chasing paparazzi.

Earlier this month the couple, who are currently in Canada with their baby son Archie, announced they would no longer use their royal titles and were seeking an independent new life based mainly in North America.

Last week, lawyers for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, issued a warning to media not to use paparazzi pictures of the couple.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/zne7m/article27050141.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HARRYKB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/prince-harry-loses-complaint-against-mail-on-sunday-over-instagram-photo/article30699230.ece

26,2020/01/31,U.S. life expectancy up for first time in four years,"U.S. life expectancy is up for the first time in four years, driven by factors including a fall in the rate of fatal drug overdoses and cancer deaths, official statistics showed Thursday.

The increase in 2018, the latest year for which data is ready, was marginal: 78.7 years compared to 78.6 years for the year before, but it was enough to arrest a slide that began in 2014. The figure was 76.1 for men and 81.2 for women.

“This has not happened through coincidence, it's happened through causation,” said White House advisor Kellyanne Conway, announcing the figures. “It's owed in large part to a whole of government approach to treat the whole person, led by President Trump.”

The government also said that 2018 saw the first decline in drug overdose deaths in almost three decades, confirming preliminary data that was announced last year. There were more than 67,000 drug overdose deaths in the United States in 2018, a four percent decline from 2017 when there were just over 70,000 deaths.

Second worst year - 2018

But that still leaves 2018 as the second-worst year on record, with the rate of overdose deaths around triple what it was in 1999. And the rate of drug overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, its analogs, and tramadol increased by 10 percent compared to the previous year.

Fentanyl, used medically as an intravenous anaesthetic, can be lethal in a dose of as little as two milligrams, equivalent to a few grains of sand. Despite overall good news on the life expectancy front, with death rates also down for heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s, there were some negative factors too.

The suicide rate ticked up 1.4% while the influenza and pneumonia death rate rose 4.2%. Amid worry over the U.S. spread of the Novel Coronavirus originating in China, it was important to remember that 8,000 Americans have died in this flu season alone (starting last fall), said Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir, urging people to get their shots.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-life-expectancy-up-for-first-time-in-four-years/article30697127.ece
27,2020/01/31,"Despite pressure, United States renews exemptions for Iran nuclear deal","The United States on Thursday extended exemptions to let an internationally-backed nuclear deal with Iran go forward, even as it announced new sanctions to step up pressure.

President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled out of the accord negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama, sending tensions soaring with Iran and leading Tehran to curb compliance, but European powers still back the deal.

Brian Hook, the U.S. pointman on Iran, said the U.S. would for another 60 days issue exemptions in its sweeping sanctions to let Russian and other companies implement it without fear of punishment by Washington. The extension will “permit the continuation of non-proliferation projects that constrain Iran’s nuclear activities,” Hook told reporters.

“We will closely monitor all developments in Iran’s nuclear program, and Secretary (Mike) Pompeo can end these projects as developments warrant,” he said. The exemptions affect the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant and the Arak Heavy Water Reactor, with the nations in the accord working to ensure they are not put to military use.

The Trump administration has repeatedly extended the waivers but stopped doing so in November for another site, Fordo, in retaliation for Iran’s lifting its level of uranium enrichment. This step, which still leaves its uranium well below weapons-grade, aimed to pressure Europeans to show tangible benefits of the nuclear deal despite the U.S. imposition of sanctions.

New sanction in place

Just as it extended waivers, the United States announced new sanctions on the head of Iran Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi. The nuclear chief “personally inaugurated the installation of new, advanced centrifuges to expand its uranium enrichment capacity,” Mr. Hook said.

The new sanctions freeze any U.S. assets Mr. Salehi may have — a move with little practical effect as Iran is already under severe sanctions. Mr. Hook also announced the first transaction with Iran under a new financial channel aimed at easing humanitarian trade, with the sale to the country of cancer and transplant drugs.

Since Mr. Trump imposed sanctions on Iran, the United States has insisted that humanitarian goods are exempt. But with the United States vowing to end virtually all trade with Iran, many companies have been hesitant, fearing they could get caught up in U.S. sanctions. The United States announced the humanitarian channel in a joint initiative with Switzerland last year.

Critics voiced skepticism over the move as the United States was seeking exhaustive paperwork for each transaction and warning that it could use the documentation to impose sanctions if it finds wrongdoing. President Trump, a close ally of Iran’s rivals Saudi Arabia and Israel, has vowed to fight Iran’s regional role and earlier this month ordered the killing of Iran’s most powerful general.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/despite-pressure-united-states-renews-exemptions-for-iran-nuclear-deal/article30697221.ece
28,2020/01/31,Greece ratifies defence agreement with the U.S. amid anti-war protests,"Greece’s Parliament on Thursday approved an updated Defence Agreement with the U.S. allowing the use of Greek military facilities as hundreds protested outside.

A majority of lawmakers ratified the Mutual Defence Cooperation Agreement (MDCA) as hundreds of Communist, left-wing and anti-war demonstrators protested on central Syntagma Square. The agreement, which updates a deal originally signed in 1990 when Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ father was Premier, enables the use of the Greek military facilities, including the airbases of Larissa and Stefanovikio, by U.S. forces.

Permitted actions

Permitted actions for U.S. forces at these facilities include training, refuelling, temporary maintenance, storage and emergency response. The updated deal was originally signed in October during a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

“This agreement is beneficial to national interests,” Greece Defence Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told Parliament. The U.S. is also granted priority status for “unimpeded access and use” within 48 hours of the port of Alexandroupolis, a Balkans and Black Sea gateway of strategic value to the U.S. Navy and NATO.

The U.S. paid approximately $2.3 million to remove last year a sunken dredging barge that had blocked part of the harbour since 2010. “This agreement upgrades (Greece’s) importance in U.S. planning and can help deterrence,” the Defence Minister said, adding that U.S. forces were expected to invest over 12 million Euros ($13 million) on the Larissa base and around six million Euros at Marathi, part of the US base of Souda, Crete.

F-16 upgrade programme

Athens has signed on to an F-16 upgrade programme worth $1.5 billion, and is also interested in U.S.-made drones and, eventually, F-35 warplanes, Mr. Mitsotakis has said.

The agreement has been roundly condemned by left-wing opposition parties. “Wherever they are, U.S. and NATO bases are targets for reprisals...NATO bases do not protect,” said Communist party chairman Dimitris Koutsoumbas, warning that the government was “deepening” its involvement in “adventurism.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/n8oj2e/article30696816.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OK15Mjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/greece-ratifies-defence-agreement-with-the-us-amid-anti-war-protests/article30696810.ece
29,2020/01/31,Greta Thunberg nominated for Nobel Peace Prize,"Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg and the global protest movement “Fridays for Future” were nominated Thursday for the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize by two Swedish lawmakers.

“Greta Thunberg is a climate activist, and the main reason she deserves the Nobel Peace Prize is that despite her young age, she has worked hard to make politicians open their eyes to the climate crisis,” Left Party Parliamentarians Jens Holm and Hakan Svenneling wrote in a letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

“The climate crisis will produce new conflicts and ultimately wars. Action for reducing our emissions and complying with the Paris Agreement is therefore also an act of making peace,” they said. The pair added that without the Fridays For Future movement and Ms. Thunberg, “the climate issue would not have been on the agenda to such an extent as it is today.”

The 17-year-old Swede was mentioned as a possible Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2019, when the honour ultimately went to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for his efforts to resolve a long-running conflict with neighbouring Eritrea. In just over a year, the climate activist, who suffers from a form of autism called Asperger’s, has become the voice of a generation haunted by the climate crisis.

She began her “School Strike for the Climate” outside the Swedish parliament in August 2018, and has since inspired and mobilised millions of young people to get involved.

Nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize must be submitted by February 1 to the Norwegian Nobel Committee. Thousands of people are eligible to propose candidates, including former laureates, some university professors, lawmakers and government ministers around the world, and current and former Norwegian Nobel Committee members.

30,2020/01/31,WHO declares coronavirus outbreak a global emergency,"The death toll in China from the new coronavirus reached 213 on Friday, with overall cases worldwide rising rapidly in an outbreak that the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency.

The death toll in Hubei, the Chinese province at the centre of the epidemic, had risen to 204 and there were 9,692 cases of infection nationally, Chinese health authorities said. About 100 cases have been reported in at least 18 other countries, with no deaths outside China.

Even as the WHO said cases had spread to 18 countries, Italy announced its first confirmed cases, in two Chinese tourists.

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the government had decided to close all air traffic between Italy and China, a more drastic measure than most countries have undertaken.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, said the organization “doesn’t recommend — and actually opposes” restrictions on travel or trade with China.

Nonetheless, foreign governments have been flying home their citizens from Hubei and holding them in quarantine, while airlines including Air France, American Airlines and British Airways have stopped flying to mainland China.

Airlines are facing mounting pressure by cabin crew to stop all flights due to unease about exposure to the virus.

Stocks around the world have tumbled on fears of the economic fallout from the outbreak in the world’s second-biggest economy.

Lockdown in Wuhan

Some 60 million people in Hubei province are living under virtual lockdown.

There had been a further 1,220 cases detected in Hubei by end of January 30, taking the total for the province to close to 6,000, Hubei’s health commission said.

Mr. Tedros praised China’s response in a news conference in Geneva on Thursday evening but said the WHO was declaring a global health emergency because it was concerned about the virus spreading to countries that did not have the resources to deal with it.

“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries. Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,” he said.

The WHO move will trigger tighter containment and information-sharing guidelines to all countries, but may disappoint Beijing, which had expressed confidence it can beat the “devil” virus.

China’s U.N. Ambassador, Zhang Jun, said Beijing was assessing the declaration.

“We are still at a very critical stage in fighting the coronavirus. International solidarity is extremely important and for that purpose all countries should behave in a ... responsible manner,” Mr. Zhang said.

Wuhan should have taken measures sooner to contain it, the city's Communist Party chief said on Friday.

The impact of the virus on the rest of China and on the world “would have been less” if the containment measures had been implemented sooner, Ma Guoqiang said in a nationally televised interview.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/incoming/h3nukq/article30696939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/0001OK29Ejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-who-declares-global-emergency/article30696916.ece
31,2020/01/31,"Coronavirus: Pathogen spread to husband from wife in Chicago, says official","U.S. Health Department officials said Thursday they had identified the first case of a person who had caught the Novel Coronavirus from another person on American soil, a man who contracted the illness from his wife.

“The second person in Illinois testing positive for the contgion is a Chicago resident and is the spouse of the first confirmed travel associated case in Illinois,” said Robert Redfield, Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The first confirmed case concerned a woman in her sixties who had recently travelled to Wuhan. Her husband did not travel to China.

Jennifer Layden, the State’s Chief Medical Officer, said the man’s condition was “stable” and that his situation was exacerbated by some underlying medical conditions. Both Federal and State officials, however, stressed that the pathogen is not spreading widely in communities and the overall risk to Americans remains low.

The latest case brings to six the overall number of confirmed patients with the virus in the U.S. As of Thursday, some 7,700 cases have been confirmed in China, its country of origin, with at least 170 fatalities. The virus has spread from the city of Wuhan across China to more than 15 countries, with about 60 cases in Asia, Europe, North America and, most recently, the Middle East.

32,2020/01/31,"Web series ‘Sex Education’ uses the high -school romcom format to talk about the birds, bees and more","As someone who grew up hungry for approval, it took me a long time to understand that it was alright — even essential — to have boundaries. Being disliked was a risk worth taking if I wanted to love myself, protect my integrity, and look at myself in the mirror without a hint of shame. I had to figure out what I needed to feel safe in relationships of all kinds. Learning to say no was a life skill I had to teach myself, even if my family only sought obedience and my school only rewarded conformity. These thoughts came rushing to my mind as I watched Season 2 of Sex Education, a British web series that began streaming on Netflix India last month.

There are multiple sub-plots connected to the main storyline, which is about a sex therapist who is also a single mother; with a son who is socially awkward but runs a clandestine sex clinic at school to counsel his peers. Created by Laurie Nunn, this show has become a major talking point in urban, English-speaking India, because of the feminist values it espouses, and for being queer affirmative as well as sex positive. It uses the structural elements of a high school romantic comedy, and subverts the genre to have mature conversations about what it means to establish and communicate boundaries, to feel safe, and to express oneself fully without the threat of violence.

Unfortunately, safety has come to be equated with surveillance in India. This takes various forms — restricting women’s mobility, policing the sexuality of queer individuals, and enforcing moral standards that criminalise trans people’s access to public spaces. These practices only ensure that patriarchy is safe while the marginalised live in fear that robs them of their will to exist, their freedom to move about, and their passion to create what they are meant to. Sex Education is not set in India but brings up concerns that are undeniably relevant to our context where body shaming is as commonplace as roadside tea stalls.

A still from the show.

It is telling that in our society sexual violence is more easily talked about than sexual pleasure. Young people are deprived of opportunities to learn about bodily autonomy and sexual health. The apology of a sexuality education programme that a fraction of the population receives is couched in the language of good touch and bad touch or safe touch and unsafe touch, which puts the onus of safety on the victim of sexual assault. In this universe, safety gets reduced to saving oneself for marriage, upholding community honour, or punishing those who enjoy sexual exploration.

Season 2 opens up the meanings of consent beyond the mere formality of seeking permission before sexual intercourse. It invites viewers to think about how respect lies at the core of feeling safe and making others feel safe. It tries to take the stigma out of experiences that make people feel small, excluded or confused. It does not try to sell abstinence as an answer to questions about safety. It dares to talk about masturbation, vaginismus, sex toys, contraception, pregnancy and fetishes in ways that demystify rather than discourage curiosity. It challenges biphobia, slut-shaming, and misinformation about sexually transmitted infections. At the same time, it stays far away from being preachy.

Sex is not for all

The show affirms that sexuality education is not only about bodies, and the mechanics of what goes where, but also about relationships and emotions. Feeling safe could involve embracing the fact that sex is not exciting for everyone. There are people in the world who only seek emotional intimacy and romance from their partners. This does not imply that they are deficient. There is diversity in nature, and being asexual is an expression of that. Alternatively, feeling safe could involve recognising that you are attracted to people because of who they are, and that their sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or gender expression has nothing to do with how you feel about them.

A still from Netflix show ‘Sex Education’.

The series also depicts how pervasive and normalised rape culture has become, and what that means for girls and women on an everyday basis. The counter it offers is feminist sisterhood, not any systemic response to misogyny that would address it at the very root and get men to be accountable. Law enforcement is approached for redress but it offers very little by way of healing. The show presents alternatives to toxic masculinity in the shape of boys — heterosexual and queer — who care about the safety and pleasure of their partners, take responsibility, and ask about what feels good and what does not.

One of the sub-plots is built around a relationship between a closeted white student and an out-and-proud gay black student, which takes a dramatic turn when the latter confronts the former about the bullying he experienced from him for several years before they got physically intimate. While the show addresses the need for apology or repair, it does not acknowledge the racism inherent in the bullying.

Intimate partner violence in LGBTQIA+ communities is rarely discussed in popular culture but it is a reality. Those who grow up in the shadows fearing abandonment from their families often end up in abusive relationships because they have been made to believe that they are unworthy of love. Articulating exactly what one needs to feel safe can be a journey of a lifetime.

33,2020/01/31,Prasad Bhat is rocking the stand-up comedy stage,"When Prasad Bhat’s very first stand-up set video went viral, he was elated. Till he read the comments. “I had taken a dig at North Indians, and there was a lot of hate coming my way. But I was more bothered about the fact that there were better jokes than mine in the comments,” says the Bengaluru-based comic. As he talks about his upcoming Chennai show, Bhat of All Jokes, he baits me with some city rivalry. “It has been over 10 years since I last visited — I attended a very disappointing rock show at IIT-Madras, so I never came back. But now I hear that both cities are equally bad, so I don’t mind,” he says, with a hearty chuckle.

Mixing it up

Stand-up was not Bhat’s first career choice: he was in a metal band, then founded a design studio called Graphicurry, with clients like Disney, Marvel, Amazon Prime and Hotstar. A friend suggested he try comedy, and like most other comics, he started off with open mics back in 2016. “The problem with comedy is that it is very bizarre. You write a joke and you might find it funny, but you need to go on stage and see if it resonates with a majority of the crowd. It took about six months to get three minutes worth of material that works,” says the 36-year-old, adding, “To stand out, you need to be saying something extremely different or be way better than those who are already in the field.”

With his three YouTube videos (with a combined 3.46 million views) he has found that his life stories work best — “because they are unique to me” — and that is what he will be sharing at his new show. On the personal front, he will be talking about his family and recent experiences of fatherhood. “Luckily, my wife has a great sense of humour and she likes my jokes,” he says, when asked how his family reacts to such material. He will also reveal the real reason he went viral and how he became an artist after studying engineering. “I have failed a lot at many things, and failure makes great content. When things don’t go your way, people love laughing at that. It is also a great way to rewrite your history, and own it,” he concludes.

34,2020/01/31,Straight talk with Faye D’Souza,"Two summers ago, a video of a television journalist calmly but firmly telling off a misogynist cleric on air went viral. It announced the arrival of Faye Elvira D’Souza, then anchor of Mirror Now’s prime time show, The Urban Debate. Audiences began to tune in for her brand of scathing yet methodical deconstruction. A couple of weeks ago, another video featuring her was extensively shared across social media. This one, titled Uncle, Are You With Us?, and performed at the Mumbai Spoken Fest 2020, summed up how different sections of society are responding to the on-going CAA-NRC protests across India.

These are interesting and challenging times for journalists. The advent of social media and smart phones has changed how information is being consumed and distributed. And no one understands this better than independent commentators like D’Souza, who are determined to bring reliable news and balanced views to the public. The 38-year-old, who parted ways with mainstream media last September, around the time the media “failed to cover the truth about what was happening in Kashmir” (as she shared at the Spoken Fest), believes that sometimes, to truly do the job, “you have to create that space on your own”.

“I find that going out on the streets, into protests, meeting people and finding out what they are upset about, what they need, makes it easier for me to understand what’s going on in the country,” she says. Her crisp posts — laying bare hard truths and taking on the big powers (like her challenge to Amit Shah to debate the CAA) — on Twitter and Instagram have a strong following (869k and 195k respectively). Earlier this month, she also took her straight talking to Firework, the short video network, as 30-second videos. “The average post-millennial audience does not engage with news as we’d imagine. This demographic has apps on their phones that they never open; they only look at the notifications to get the headlines,” observes Sunil Nair, CEO, Firework India. “They don’t want to engage with news that go beyond the core of what the issue is. So, Faye is someone they connect with.”

That is not to say journalists are blind to the problems that alternative platforms of news dissemination come with. At the recent Jaipur Literature Festival, D’Souza joined fellow journalists and authors to discuss if social media has divided society. Agreeing that it can be divisive, she made her case with three arguments: there’s a lack of nuanced opinions on social media; it amplifies the ‘crazy voices in our heads’; and, most importantly, the infrastructure within Twitter and Facebook ‘allows for fake news to be pushed’. Her statement that Indian journalism is not addressing the young who are looking for information that isn’t ‘too loud, too shouty and too abrasive’ was met with cheers. In fact, that’s the gap she is hoping to bridge as an independent journalist. The Bengaluru native and Vogue’s Opinion Maker of the Year 2018 says, “I want to explore new formats and styles of getting messages out there; to talk about current affairs, to get people to think about things and talk to younger people about what’s going on in the country.”

Excerpts from a telephonic interview:

What has the response been like to the spoken word video?

Completely crazy! Almost everyone I’ve met has seen it, and people are writing to me from Canada, Australia and parts of the US. It seems to have really travelled and that’s quite overwhelming. I think everyone is forwarding it to prove that they’re not uncles, which is really funny. A lot of the younger people I spoke to said they identified with that feeling, ‘How are you silent at a time like this?’ As for the uncles in my building complex, they’re all trying to figure out which one of them it was.

Internationally, anchors like John Oliver and Hasan Minhaj have proven that comedy and current affairs can be mixed. Why haven’t we explored this format in India?

Those formats require large teams of writers and researchers, and budgets here tend to be difficult. Also, I don’t think we’ve had anyone yet who’s taken the risk here on that format. India is the perfect place for this because there’s so much going on right now. It would be nice to tell these stories in a way that people go, ‘Yes, that’s exactly what I was thinking.’ India’s youth is very involved, active and woke, but there isn’t anyone talking to them. Nobody, for example, was talking to them about the abrogation of Article 370 and telling them what these decisions being made were.

Young India is a key area of focus with you.

I think there’s a case to revisit everything, because people in their early 20s weren’t around when we were listening to ‘Mile sur mera tumhara’ on Doordarshan. They’re a new generation and someone needs to tell them why India has reservation, or if we’ve managed to solve the problem we wanted to solve with reservation, or what’s going wrong with it, or where the caste system falls in this modern-day society. These are issues people have opinions on, but nobody’s giving them enough information to solidly form these opinions. That, I believe, is the calling going forward.

Why does being woke and responsive matter to post-millennials?

Because of the internet, millennials know that there are no more gatekeepers. They have access to everyone [they feel like they know you more personally], and there’s far more scrutiny of the way things are being done. So, there’s more respect for people who are brave, who take a stand, than someone sitting in big offices in big organisations. I also think that young people are looking for people to inspire them. Kannan Gopinath [who quit the IAS over restrictions imposed in Kashmir] is a great example. They have respect for him, for the stand he’s taken, for the things he says.

You’re talking about a form of independent media. Purely in terms of finances, it is not an easy business to get into.

People are asking questions around monetisation, but, quite honestly, I believe we should pay for good service. You don’t expect your phone service to come for free and nobody gives you free internet. Once you pay for your service, then you demand the best. I believe if you want honest journalism that treats you and your intellect with respect, you have to pay for that service. I am going to encourage my viewers and customers to pay for what we put out. If you aren’t paying for your news, you aren’t the end consumer. You are the commodity that is being packaged and sold to the advertiser. That should worry you, because then your relationship is the one that chicken has with Real Good [the fresh poultry brand]. If you aren’t paying, then ask yourself who is and what interests are we serving?

Is there a downside to striking out on your own?

I don’t have an office, which means I don’t have an IT person every time something breaks down. I’m working out of various other spaces, I’m looking for investors... it is scary, but exciting, too. I believe independent journalists are going to be the way forward. Not all large organisations are able to provide you with the independence to do the work that you need to do. Sometimes you have to create that space on your own.

How much has social media informed this new kind of storytelling in journalism?

Social media creates an interesting opportunity. Twitter is where a lot of people are exchanging stories. It gives a lot of new stories the pump-up they need. I don’t think people get their news purely from other platforms like Facebook. That would worry me because their algorithm pushes what someone’s paid for. I believe there needs to be a solution that will inform you about the 10-20 important stories of the day. And just by reading that, you’re sorted.

You’ve started a format on Instagram called News That Should Be Headlines.

I write what I think is important from the stories that I’ve come across. It has got an amazing response and it happened organically. My Instagram page went from 35k to 182k followers in three months. I have people writing back saying I should do it every day and more often. It reaffirmed that this is something that needs to be done — aggregated, even-toned news with sources [for young India].

What’s next?

We are a two-member team at the moment, putting out content every day. I’m hoping to grow this into a full organisation — a news-based start-up that will talk to India’s young people, without any of the shouting and the screaming.

35,2020/01/31,Abish Mathew on the art and science of laughter,"In the space of two decades, Abish Mathew has been a musician (he was part of a school band), a radio jockey, an event host and finally, he found his calling as a comedian. Today, the 32-year-old is one of the well-known faces in the Indian comedy circuit. He enjoys alternative comedy and peppers his acts with sketches, drama and songs. Whether it is about him being a Malayali, being brought up in Delhi or being the only brother to five sisters, the content for his shows are drawn from his personal experiences and observations, he says. We caught up with him as he visited Visakhapatam for a show at Fairfield by Marriott. Abish is excited because this was his first ticketed performance in the city. But he does take time out to wax eloquent about the local cuisine, especially the gongura chicken that he describes it as a ‘tangy and spicy experience’.

“As a kid, I was always inclined towards the performing arts. In school I was also a part of a band and while I toyed with the notion of becoming a robotics engineer as a kid, I eventually settled for radio jockey,” he says. Abish believes that his instinct for comedy comes from his parents. “My father has an amazing sense of humour but isn’t so confident about his jokes ( incidentally the title ‘Son of Abish’ was his dad’s idea). On the other hand, my mother cracks bad jokes with unbelievable confidence. I inherited the funny genes from my dad and the confidence from my mother,” he laughs .

On a fun trail The comedian is also hosting a celebrity talk show called Son of Abish which recently came out with its sixth season. The episodes are available on YouTube and Hotstar.

He hosted both the seasons of Comicstaan, produced by Amazon Prime.

In 2019, he launched an audio show called The UnExperts on a streaming app Audible Suno. It is a talk show where Abish converses with celebrities.

He enjoys watching comedians American comedian Kristen Schaal and John Drone

Chasing his dreams

When he started on this path, the industry was still nascent in India. “Open mics were not common even in Delhi at that time. Comedy was rare in the times of music performances at cafes or poetry recitation,” he says. His first open mic was in May 2008. “There were hardly 30 people in the crowd and most of them were my friends and colleagues whom I had invited. The first 10 minutes were really good when people laughed at my every joke but after that I tanked very badly. I struggled to make a joke while everyone sat there staring at me blankly,” he says.

However, that did not stop him. He kept honing his jokes and frequenting open mics. It was after three years of juggling the radio station and open mics, that Abish finally quit his job and took up comedy full time in 2011. Today, he is considered one of the pioneers in the Indian stand-up comedy circle. “Being an early bird in the industry comes with its own pros and cons. While you have the advantage of making the first move you are also experimenting with an art form that you are unsure will generate any revenue. Thankfully, comedy as an art form worked, and we managed to pursue it full time,” he says.

Despite a decade of performing across the world and in India, Abish still has the pre-show jitters. “Nervousness is too weak a word to describe how I feel! The 20 seconds that pass by between the host announcing my name and me getting on stage are all about existential crisis where I begin to question everything I do. But then I get on stage and get the first laugh and I know why I chose comedy,” he smiles. Though known for his improv skills, Abish still holds on to the old way of scripting jokes. “While I write down my jokes, the connecting segment between them are always improvised. That ensures I do not stagnate and discover new things about myself in every performance,” he adds.

Sailing through changing times

Speaking of YouTube and the internet, Abish says they have revolutionised entertainment. “Before YouTube most of the material we performed used to be local and city-specific. But now the reach is so much more. Our audience is varied, across languages, age groups and sectors of society. It takes two or three viral videos for people to start recognising a comedian,” he says.

Online streaming platforms brought in even more changes. Abish believes that solo shows on these platforms are a badge of honour for any comedian. “Having a solo or a comedy show on these platforms means that companies are investing in your art. So far, for most of the comedians, their careers have been self-funded,” he explains. Abish recently released his stand-up solo Whoop on Amazon Prime.

Abish doesn’t think streaming sites will put live shows out of business. “They can never go out of fashion as people will always step out to enjoy the experience of a live show. As a comedian, live shows are always a delight as they allow me to experiment with new jokes and build new material.”

Right to express

Abish is undeterred about how comedians often become the butt of trolls. “Everyone should have the right to express what they feel fearlessly. If I think something is funny, then I should have the right to say it. If you are offended by it, you have the right to express your disagreement by tweeting or commenting, but dragging someone to court and slapping lawsuits on them for a comedy show is not the right thing.”",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/yse3i1/article30701504.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/abhishsofa,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/abish-mathew-on-the-art-and-science-of-laughter/article30701505.ece
36,2020/01/31,Recipients of the Padma awards this year talk about their respective journeys,"Three personalities from the Cauvery region have done the district proud by being named winners of the Padma awards, among India’s highest civilian honours announced annually on the eve of Republic Day (January 26).

MetroPlus speaks to this year’s Padma Shri awardees Sheik Mahaboob Subhani and Kaleeshabi Mahaboob (from Srirangam), and Padma Bhushan recipient Krishnammal Jagannathan (Thanjavur district) about their experiences.

In complete harmony

Like most long-married couples, nadaswaram exponents Mahaboob Subhani and Kaleeshabi Mahboob tend to complete each other’s sentences, and laugh out loud at shared memories. On stage, their concerts resemble a tandem ride, delicately balanced, and smooth in movement in the Thanjavur style of Carnatic music.

“We compete in a healthy way when we play our instruments. But when Kaleeshabi excels, I stand back a bit, so that she can garner the audience’s attention. She does the same when I have a good turn,” says Mahaboob Subhani.

Representing the 8th generation of a family of nadaswaram vidwans (exponents), the Srirangam-based couple has another reason to be proud this year — both Mahaboob Subhani, 66 years, and Kaleeshabi, 62 years, are among the winners of the Padma Shri awards. The latest honour is an acknowledgement of the years of hard work that preceded the couple’s rise. The story of Mahaboob Subhani’s transformation from an office worker in a tobacco factory in Andhra Pradesh to a seasoned performer is an interesting one, intertwined as it is with his wife’s own struggle against orthodox attitudes that discouraged women from taking up artistic professions.

Originally from Peda Kothapalli village in Prakasam District, Andhra Pradesh, Mahaboob learned to play the nadaswaram from his grandfather and Andhra Pradesh State Government awardee Janab Sheik Chinna Peer Sahib, and later his father, Sheik Meera Sahib from the age of 7.

“But I was not serious about music at the time, because I had to support my family by working after completing my SSLC,” he says.

Kaleeshabi, his first cousin, from the nearby village of Cherukapadu, wasn’t allowed to go to school by her conservative Muslim family. But as she showed an early talent for the nadaswaram, her paternal uncle Sheik John Sahib trained her. “Initially, nobody wanted me to go on stage, because women were not meant to be seen in public, especially performing with men. But once the vidwans started saying that I brought something special and feminine to the nadaswaram, my family had to relent,” says Kaleeshabi.

Mahaboob used to attend Kaleeshabi’s concerts in their village as a spectator, not knowing that she would be his life partner one day. Marriage offered Kaleeshabi a way out of parental objections to her choice of profession, even though Mahaboob was a newcomer to the concert circuit.

Musical achievers Mahaboob Subhani and Kaleeshabi have toured extensively throughout India for their recitals, and have also performed abroad in US, Canada, UAE, France and Germany, among other countries.

They were appointed the Asthana Vidwans of Sri Sarada Peetam in Sringeri in 2001.

In 2005, they gave a 2-hour recital at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi, for then-President APJ Abdul Kalam.

On his advice, they have been offering free music concertss to children with mental disability.

Among the many honours bestowed on them, is the Kalaimamani award, from Government of Tamil Nadu, in 1994.



“When we got married, my skill with the nadaswaram was almost nil, because I lacked practice,” says Mahaboob. “I asked Kaleeshabi for a year to relearn the instrument, enough at least to support her in concerts.”

Their first concert in Tamil Nadu was held in Dindigul in 1976, before their marriage, for which Kaleeshabi trained Mahaboob for a month.

A year later, they were married, and since then have never deviated from their duet style of recitals. The duo trained under Sheik John Sahib and underwent vocal and instrumental music lessons from K Chandramouli (principal of Government Sarada Sangeetha Kalasala in Kurnool) and nadaswaram exponent Sheik Chinna Moulana in Srirangam, among other teachers.

They shifted permanently to Srirangam in the 1980s, where Mahaboob and Kaleeshabi learned under the tutelage of Sheik Chinna Moulana for 10 years. The couple knows that it is open to public scrutiny as Muslim exponents of Hindu sacred music. “We are Muslims by birth, but performing mangala isai (sacred music) for Hindu temples has been our family profession for generations. We respect all religions equally,” says Kaleeshabi.

Of the couple’s three children, son Firose Babu is set to take forward the family’s musical legacy.

“Receiving the Padma Shri is a rare honour for instrumentalists like us. Artistes are always happy to be recognised,” says Mahaboob.

The roving reformer

Where is home for Krishnammal Jagannathan? “I am a wanderer, never in one place for long,” says the 94-year-old social service activist who will be conferred the Padma Bhushan award this year.

Krishnammal is in Chennai when we speak to her, where she has come to rally support for her housing project for those affected by the Gaja cyclone of 2018.

“I am very happy to receive the Padma Bhushan, as it will help me to raise awareness about the people left homeless by Gaja in the coastal districts of Tamil Nadu,” she says over the phone.

Born in Madurai in 1926, and later based out of Thanjavur district, Krishnammal and her husband Sankaralingam Jagannathan (1912-2013), worked relentlessly for social development and land redistribution among the poor in Tamil Nadu using Gandhian ideology.

Having participated in the Indian freedom struggle through the Non-Cooperation, Civil Disobedience and Quit India movements, after independence, the couple redistributed nearly 4 million acres of land to the landless poor people through the Bhoodan movement.

Causes aplenty Krishnammal, either singly or with her husband, has established at least 7 non-governmental institutions for the poor.

The Jagannathans also highlighted the dangers of commercial prawn farming along the coast of Tamil Nadu through non-violent rallies.

Krishnammal has been a Senate member of the Gandhigram Trust and University and of Madurai University.

Awards won: Padma Shri (1989); Opus Prize by University of Seattle (2008); Right Livelihood Award (2008).



The couple started looking at land reform issues after a wage dispute led to the massacre of 44 Dalit women and children in Kilvenmani, Nagapattinam district in 1968.

After her husband’s demise, Krishnammal has continued to work through the non-governmental organisation Land for Tillers’ Freedom (LATFI) that the couple started in 1981.

LATFI enabled Dalit farming families to get land from big landowners through a government-negotiated forum, which helped to empower rural women in the 1980s. The NGO also conducts vocational workshops for agriculturalists to help them generate income during off-season months.

Having interacted with leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Vinobha Bhave, and Martin Luther King Jr., the nonagenarian has got a long-range view of the country’s growth since independence. “I feel sad that inter-caste animosity and poverty are killing the spirit of living despite 72 years of freedom,” she says. “The great spiritual atmosphere of India is getting spoiled by religious tensions and narrow-mindedness.”

Even though she has slowed down due to her advanced years, Krishnammal says the memories of her storied life keep her going. Among these is listening to Vinobha Bhave singing spiritual songs in Tamil every morning when she collaborated with him during the Bhoodan movement in 1952. “I walked with him from Kanyakumari to Pathankot during the Bhoodan Padayatra,” she recalls.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/6vtm9y/article30703018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01TYMPMAHBOOBSUBHANI2,https://www.thehindu.com/society/padma-shri-winners-sheik-mahaboob-subhani-and-kaleeshabi-mahaboobs-tryst-with-the-nadaswaram-padma-bhushan-awardee-krishnammal-jagannathans-efforts-to-promote-social-equality-through-land-reforms/article30703019.ece
37,2020/01/31,From beef to poha: Why food multiculturalism cannot be an end in itself,"Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,

The mild-eyed melancholy poha-eaters came.

— With apologies to Alfred, Lord Tennyson

Poha, it turns out, is the new anti-national. BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya made national news when he spotted the poha-ring among construction labourers working at his house. To mix food metaphors, he smelled something fishy when he noticed they ate “only poha”. They might be Bangladeshi, he surmised.

Flattened rice fans from Maharashtra to Bengal erupted in outrage. Poha eaters came out of the woodwork. Someone found a picture of cricketer-turned BJP MP Gautam Gambhir eating poha. Indigo offers poha alongside upma as part of its in-flight offerings. Will Vijayvargiya come for upma next? Will Indigo be inculcated into the tukde tukde gang? I had a savory poha-muri snack outside the ancient temples of Pattadakal in Northern Karnataka. The poha hunters clearly have their work cut out for them if poha becomes a test of citizenship.

To paraphrase the old Martin Niemöller warning:

First they came for the beef eaters, and I did not speak out / Because I was not a beef eater.

Then they came for the egg eaters in Madhya Pradesh, and I did not speak out / Because I was not an egg eater in Madhya Pradesh.

Then they came from the Muslim food delivery boy during Shravan and I did not speak out / Because I was not a food delivery guy.

Then they came for the poha eaters and I did speak out / Because I ate poha/ cheerey/ chivda/ choora.

But all the poha jokes hide a more troubling truth. We are so used to using food as a way of designating the other. In Bengali TV soaps, the bad Westernised girl wants continental food and cake while the good Bengali bahu makes payesh and fish. There is no soap opera plot line where you can be a good girl and like cake and payesh.

I remember food writer and TV host Madhur Jaffrey talking about how she would share meals at school with classmates — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs. “I remember all those specific tastes and each one being so marvellous. With Partition, all our Muslims friends were gone and we were bereft.” Lunch tasted different. Partition had entered the tiffin box.

Food as a bridge

When I went to America, I would constantly meet people who told me they loved Indian food, almost as a badge of some multicultural honour. Food is the bridge between cultures, sharing food is the way we break down barriers. Or so we would like to believe.

Joanne Harris, the bestselling author of Chocolat, was recently at the Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet. In Chocolat, Vianne Rocher, who might or might not be a witch, arrives in a tiny and deeply Catholic French village and opens a chocolaterie. She is viewed with suspicion by the local priest and the town busybodies but the chocolate works its magic.

In a follow-up novel, Peaches For Monsieur le Curé, Vianne returns to the village which is crackling with tension because of the arrival of a group of Muslims of Moroccan origin who have built a mosque. It’s Ramadan, and Vianne’s chocolates have no effect but food still helps both ignite and defuse cultural tensions. Harris has talked often about why she uses food as a motif. “It’s the first contact with a culture because it’s something that everybody can understand. It’s a simple way of offering or accepting hospitality.”

Harris, on her first visit to India, was certainly game about trying out everything on offer, including the nolen gur sandesh on the dessert table. But she also said that food as a conduit for tolerance of the other has its limits. It’s only a first step. Food multiculturalism cannot be an end in itself. Often, we are only too happy to keep the food and kick out the people the food belongs to. Islamophobes can be biriyani lovers. Donald Trump can boast about loving tacos even as he wants to erect a wall to keep out Mexicans. ‘But I eat curry, don’t call me a xenophobe,’ can be the culinary equivalent of ‘I can’t be racist, I have a black friend.’

The ‘I-love-tandoori’ multiculturalism can be grating. But food policing is even more toxic. In the new India boiling with talk of papers to prove you belong, could the slogan of resistance du jour ‘Hum Kaagaz Nahi Dikhayenge’ be extended to our grocery lists?

38,2020/01/31,The real threat is the perceived victimhood of the majority: Kannan Gopinathan,"Kannan Gopinathan, the former IAS officer, first caught the nation’s eye when he stepped down from the service to protest the lockdown in Jammu and Kashmir. He resigned as secretary, power department of the Union Territories of Daman and Diu, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Now the intrepid 34-year-old is in the thick of the nation-wide movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

On a cold January evening, he said at a Bengaluru meet organised by Align India: “Democracy is a difficult project, and it becomes dictatorship when citizens become lazy.”

In an interview, Gopinathan says the country is seeing “a political churning.”

Edited excerpts:

What about your work in the IAS makes you feel most proud?

There are many instances. If you are able to go beyond government-prescribed work, you can achieve a lot. In Hnahthial [Mizoram], a senior told me that apart from the government’s work, I need to take an interest in people’s work. Hnahthial had no Internet or even an ATM in the sub-division, but one letter from me triggered these off in just three months. Although that was a small thing, I felt that the priorities of a district are different from those of the government.

But your resignation was sudden...

I have never been a big rebel, nor was I in student politics. When Article 370 was abrogated [in Jammu and Kashmir], I felt the deafening silence around me — that was when I felt the need to speak out, to take a stand. I did not want to resign due to the decision to revoke Article 370, because an elected government has the right to take a decision. I felt compelled to speak due to the removal of the right of the people to react to it. And the rest of the country just kept quiet.

Currently you are part of the protests against CAA, NRC and NPR. The government seems jittery, but it is also stubborn and does not seem to be backing off.

The government is putting up a brave face, but is also aware that CAA is blatantly communal and arbitrary. Either way, it is not a sustainable law. The country is going through a very tough time economically. So it is not in the interest of the country if the government thinks of its own ego rather than the country’s welfare. The government really need not worry about losing face if it takes back the law, as it can say that it is in response to the people’s protests. A number of Acts and Bills in the country have been passed and taken back in the interests of the people, after all.

The Hindu Rashtra ideology is an emotional one. But the counter to that is intellectual. Don’t we need to find an emotional counter-argument?

I don’t bother about ideology. I am more worried about the way people react when they are confronted with an alternative point of view, or with others who think differently. There is an enmity towards people who disagree, who are immediately called anti-national. What I’m saying is that people are not bothered about accepting resistance. We haven’t taught our children how to disagree and how to debate. We don’t teach our children the logical fallacies, the hierarchy of arguments. We need to teach the culture of arguments.

You mentioned the decline of democracy. But when were we really a democracy? Haven’t we elected people on the basis of image-building, branding and dynasty?

Well, we were not an ideal democracy in any sense, but in the last five to six years we have deteriorated. There was a substantive democracy and a formal democracy. In terms of party politics and internal restructuring we needed to improve. But we were a formal democracy. The post-2014 scenario is that the supporters of the government honestly believe that they are there to silence dissenters. Not to answer them, but to silence them.

Was there respect for democratic institutions earlier?

There was. Currently, the model is very patriarchal and supports a family structure, with a strong, key father figure, who is perceived as doing everything for the betterment of the family. Questioning the father figure is not allowed. These are all simple, patriarchal family constructs, which also help build the old, authoritarian government structure. Earlier, there was no one authority but a loose coalition of parties and no one could control it the way it is being controlled now. But then, one should not judge a ‘good’ party by what another party is not. It should aspire to rise above the norm.

The one overriding issue today seems to be hatred of the ‘other’.

It is this perceived victimhood of the majority, shared by all fascist countries, which has caused the real threat. They are defining the Hindu today as who he is not. This forging of a negative identity creation has helped. Hindutva is sustainable only as long as they define who you are not. But what will you define as a sustainable pan-Hindu identity creation? There are so many contradictions. Does a Hindu mean an upper-caste Hindu? Or is it about a way of life that defines the lives of Dalits?

The fear of the other is a perception created by a continuing narrative that has been going on for years, but we never confronted it. For the first time, it is out in the open now.

Don’t all movements need a strong leader?

Well, this movement is not like the Delhi-centric India Against Corruption movement. It is a pan-India movement. Local leadership is coming out, which is a political churning after 30 to 40 years. Leaders are emerging in every city, every village. It’s everywhere. We should not look up to a leader but should look up to ourselves.

So what next? Aren’t these protests actually about a hope for change in the character of polity and transformation in hearts and minds?

Well, beyond even that, I find in my tours from September onwards, that for the first time, the Muslim community, which has generally always kept quiet on issues that it had strong feelings about, is now, for the first time, coming out and asserting its Muslim identity as well as its Indian identity. It is something unique that is happening. The other remarkable thing is that the youth are breathing the air of democracy. Some questions that are uncomfortable and were never asked are now being asked. So even if there are 30 crore people who are able to stand together, that itself is a huge, huge transformation in the country.

Independent board

“The government can transfer its stake in listed CPSEs to a separate corporate entity. This entity would be managed by an independent board and would be mandated to divest the government stake in these CPSEs over a period of time,” stated the Economic Survey presented on Friday.

“This will lend professionalism and autonomy to the disinvestment programme which, in turn, would improve the economic performance of the CPSEs,” it added. The survey analysed the data of 11 PSUs that had been divested from 1999-2000 and 2003-04 and compared the data with their peers in the same industry.

“Analysis shows that these privatised CPSEs, on an average, performed better post-privatisation than their peers in terms of their net worth, net profit, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (RoE), gross revenue, net profit margin, sales growth and gross profit per employee,” the Survey said.

“More importantly, the ROA and net profit margin turned around from negative to positive, surpassing that of peer firms, which indicates that privatised CPSEs have been able to generate more wealth from the same resources... The analysis clearly affirms privatisation unlocks the potential of CPSEs to create wealth,” it added.

Interestingly, according to the government document, the recent approval of strategic disinvestment in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) led to an increase in value of shareholders’ equity of BPCL by ₹33,000 crore compared to its peer Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited.

“Aggressive disinvestment, preferably through the route of strategic sale, should be utilised to bring in higher profitability, promote efficiency, increase competitiveness and to promote professionalism in management in CPSEs,” stated the Survey.

“The focus of the strategic disinvestment needs to be to exit from non-strategic business and directed towards optimising economic potential of these CPSEs,” it added, highlighting there were about 264 CPSEs under 38 Ministries or departments.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/wdc00u/article30706187.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th01privatisationcol,https://www.thehindu.com/business/privatisation-survey-suggests-new-vehicle/article30706188.ece
43,2020/01/31,"Neemuchwala quits Wipro, analysts say it’s good for tech giant","Abidali Neemuchwala is exiting as CEO and MD of Wipro after a turbulent period during which the company saw its business growth slide and stock value move at a slow pace compared to those of its peers in the Indian tech services market.

Wipro repeatedly under-performed and fell behind its rivals — Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). Also, it lost its third position now and then to a highly aggressive HCL Technologies during Mr. Neemuchwala’s tenure, according to market watchers.

“The exit of Abidali, I think, is something positive for Wipro as it has not grown much under his tenure. Temporarily, the company will go through some uncertainty, but the transition will take the company to stability and path of growth,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of InGovern Shriram Research Services.

During Mr. Neemuchwala’s tenure, Wipro’s stock witnessed a conservative growth at 13%, while the stocks of Infosys and TCS grew 33% and 78%, respectively.

“Stock performance is a direct reflection of the business performance, and the company has been clocking flat or moderate growth back-to-back over many years, with a few exceptional quarters,” said another analyst. However, according to Phil Fersht, chief tech analyst and CEO of HFS Research, Mr. Neemuchwala’s tenure as CEO at Wipro was hampered by a constant struggle to change the leadership culture in the firm. “He was keen to bring a start-up mentality to drive more entrepreneurship and creative ideas within the company. He didn’t make all the changes he would have liked, but was in a constant battle to instil his ethos. He had some successes, such as the acquisition and expansion of Topcoder and [establishing] Rishad Premji’s VC fund,” he said.

Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder & CEO of consultancy Everest Group said, “Abid was handed a big task to turn Wipro around. In many ways he succeeded and has laid a strong foundation of good business and strong digital assets. The next CEO must focus on getting growth back...”

To a query from The Hindu, Wipro said, “The search process led by the Governance, Nomination and Remuneration committee of Wipro’s board of directors will be looking only at external candidates for the position of Chief Executive Officer.” However, analysts said Wipro was likely to consider internal leaders such as Wipro president Milan Rao, Rajan Kohli, who is responsible for Wipro Digital, or Rohit Adlakha, chief digital officer, chief information officer and global head, Wipro Holmes., as successor.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gqzgh3/article30706148.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01BUNEEMUCH,https://www.thehindu.com/business/neemuchwala-quits-wipro-analysts-say-its-good-for-tech-giant/article30706149.ece

46,2020/01/31,China trade agency to offer firms force majeure certificates amid coronavirus outbreak,"A Chinese international trade promotion agency said it would offer force majeure certificates to companies struggling to cope with the impact of the new coronavirus epidemic on their business with overseas partners.

The move by the China Council for The Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), officially accredited with Beijing's Commerce Ministry, was announced late on Thursday and comes with the death toll in the country from the virus topping 200. The number of cases confirmed worldwide has risen rapidly in what the World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency.

“Some Chinese companies have suffered severe impacts on goods and logistics and may not be able to fulfil their contracts amid the coronavirus,” the CCPIT said in a statement.

It didn't identify any companies affected, and didn't disclose whether it had received any requests for force majeure certificates, which can absolve parties of liability for contracts that can't be fulfilled due to extraordinary circumstances beyond their control.

The CCPIT said companies that can provide legitimate documents, including proof of delays or cancellation of transportation, exports contracts and customs declaration, to it online system would be granted force majeure certificates. The agency says on its website that its certification is recognised and accepted overseas.

The outbreak in the world's second-largest economy has roiled global commodity markets, raising fears of weaker demand and disrupting raw material supply chains. A Chinese government economist has forecast the country's economic growth may drop to 5%, or even lower, from 6.1% in 2019.

47,2020/01/31,Highlights of CEA Subramanian press meet on Economic Survey: from 'wealth creation' to ‘Thalinomics',"The theme for the 2019-20 Economic Survey is 'wealth creation', said Chief Economic Advisor CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian on Friday, soon after the Survey was tabled in the Lok Sabha on the eve of the Union Budget.

This year’s Economic Survey introduces ‘Thalinomics’ in an attempt to quantify what a common person pays for a Thali [a plate of food] across India, he said.

Mr. Subramanian stressed that India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on promoting “pro-business” policy and moving away from “pro-crony” policy.

""We have a slowdown in the Indian economy, and part of it is because of the global economy slowing down in 2019,"" Mr. Subramanian said at the press conference.

""India’s aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on promoting “pro-business” policy that unleashes the power of competitive markets to generate wealth, and weaning away from “pro-crony” policy that may favour specific private interests, especially powerful incumbents.""

Government intervention, sometimes though well intended, he said, often ends up undermining the ability of the markets to support wealth creation and leads to outcomes opposite to those intended.

""For example, frequent and unpredictable imposition of blanket stock limits on commodities under Essential Commodities Act distorts the incentives for the creation of storage infrastructure by the private sector, movement up the agricultural value chain and development of national market for agricultural commodities.

""Exports of network products, which is expected to equal $7 trillion worldwide in 2025, can contribute a quarter of the increase in value-added for the $5 trillion economy by 2025. This can also enable India to create 4 crore well-paid jobs by 2025 and 8 crore by 2030.""

The CEA said that ease of doing business is key to entrepreneurship, innovation and wealth creation.

""India has risen significantly in the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings. However, India lags in some aspects such as – starting a business, registering property, paying taxes and enforcing contracts.""

The CEA recommended a health index that can be used as an early warning system to anticipate liquidity crisis in an NBFC.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/2gxqcp/article30702572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SUBSKB,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/highlights-of-cea-subramanian-press-meet-on-economic-survey-from-wealth-creation-to-thalinomics/article30702573.ece
48,2020/01/31,Economic Survey 2019-20 highlights: Back to Adam Smith's Invisible Hand,"India's Economic Survey 2019-20 was tabled in the Parliament on Friday by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The survey is usually released a day before the Finance Minister tables the Union Budget in the Parliament.

And it is an official report card on the government's financial performance and the state of the economy during the year ending March 31. It also provides an outlook on future policy changes.

While the 2018-19 survey started with Dr. Richard Thaler's famous 'nudge' principle to effectively implement policies that drive behavioural change, the 2019-20 survey has shifted focus to Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' for wealth creation.

India's aspiration to become a $5 trillion economy depends critically on strengthening the invisible hand of the market, it said. And this needs to be done with the hand of trust through government intervention by facilitating pro-business policies.

Here are the highlights of Economic Survey FY20:

Economy

Amidst a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand, the Indian economy slowed down with GDP growth moderating to 4.8% in H1 of 2019-20, lower than 6.2% in H2 of 2018-19.

A sharp decline in real fixed investment induced by a sluggish growth of real consumption has weighed down GDP growth from H2 of 2018-19 to H1 of 2019-20.

Also Read All you wanted to know about the Budget

Imports have contracted more sharply than exports in H1 of 2019-20, with easing of crude prices, which has mainly driven the narrowing of Current Account Deficit (CAD).

On the supply side, agricultural growth, though weak, is moderately higher in H1 of 2019-20 than in H2 of 2018-19.

Headline inflation rose from 3.3% in H1 of 2019-20 to 7.4% in December 2019.

Rise in CPI-core and WPI inflation in December 2019 suggests building of demand pressure.

The deceleration in GDP growth can be understood within the framework of a slowing cycle of growth with the financial sector acting as a drag on the real sector.

The National Infrastructure Pipeline presents green shoots for growth in H2 of 2019-20 and 2020-21.

Based on first Advance Estimates of India’s GDP growth for 2019-20 recorded at 5%, an uptick in GDP growth is expected in H2 of 2019-20.

The government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21

Industry

The industrial sector based on Index of Industrial Production (IIP) registered a growth of 0.6% for 2019-20 (April-November) as compared to 5% during 2018-19 (April-November).

Growth of manufacturing sector was 0.9% during 2019-20 (April-November) as compared to 4.9% during 2018-19 (April-November).

Report of the Task Force on National Infrastructure Pipeline released on 31.12.2019 has projected total infrastructure investment of ₹102 lakh crore during the period FY 2020 to 2025 in India.

Services sector now accounting for around 55% of total size of the economy and GVA growth, two-thirds of total FDI inflows into India and about 38% of total exports.

Export growth remains subdued with external demand weakened by slowdown in global investment, output and heightened trade tensions, notwithstanding resilient service exports.

External debt as at end September, 2019 remains low at 20.1% of GDP.

Agriculture and its allied sectors contribution to national income has gradually declined to 16.5% in 2019-20 from 18.2% in 2014-15.

India’s food management should focus on rationalisation of food subsidy while addressing the challenges of food security, especially of the

most vulnerable sections.

With the implementation of the National Food Security Act from July 2013, the food subsidy bill has increased from 1,13,171.2 crore rupees in 2014-15 to 1,71,127.5 crore rupees in 2018-19.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/bu54bf/article30701386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Survey2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/economic-survey-2019-20-highlights-back-to-adam-smiths-invisible-hand/article30701669.ece
49,2020/01/31,Economic Survey pegs GDP growth at 6-6.5% in next fiscal,"The Economic Survey 2019-20 projects India’s economy to grow in the range of 6-6.5% in the next financial year (2020-21), while asking the government to use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms.

“On a net assessment of both the downside/upside risks, India’s GDP growth is expected to grow in the range of 6-6.5% in 2020-21,” as per the Survey tabled in Parliament on Friday.

Noting that 2019 was a difficult year for the global economy with world output growth estimated to grow at its slowest pace of 2.9% since the global financial crisis of 2009, the Survey said that the Indian economy slowed down to 4.8% GDP growth in H1 of 2019-20 from 6.2% in H2 of 2018-19, amidst a weak environment for global manufacturing, trade and demand.

It added that in an attempt to boost investment, consumption and exports, the government in 2019-20 has taken important reforms towards speeding up the insolvency resolution process under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, easing of credit, particularly for the stressed real estate and NBFC sectors, and announcing the National Infrastructure Pipeline 2019-2025.

“Based on CSO’s first Advance Estimates of India’s GDP growth for 2019-20 at 5%, an uptick in GDP growth is expected in H2 of 2019-20. The government must use its strong mandate to deliver expeditiously on reforms, which will enable the economy to strongly rebound in 2020-21,” it added.

On a net assessment, the Survey said, upside risks should prevail, particularly when the government, with “a strong mandate, has the capacity to deliver expeditiously on reforms”. GDP growth of India should strongly rebound in 2020-21 and more so on a low statistical base of 5% growth in 2019-20, it said.

The Survey added that headline inflation rose from 3.3% in H1 of 2019-20 to 7.35% in December 2019-20 on the back of temporary increase in food inflation, which is expected to decline by year end. “Rise in CPI-core and WPI inflation in December 2019-20 suggests building of demand pressure,” it said.",budget 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/2kd709/article30701197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Survey-moorthy2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget/economic-survey-says-gdp-growth-to-rebound-at-6-65-in-next-fiscal/article30701056.ece
50,2020/01/31,"Needed: fewer regulations for start-ups, says CEA Krishnamurthy Subramanian","India needs to work on improving the ease of doing business, especially the ease of starting business, registering property, paying taxes, or enforcing contracts, according to the Economic Survey 2019-20.

“One of the very important aspects of wealth creation is economic freedom, and here the ease of doing business is really critical. While India has certainly made strides in improving its performance in the ease of doing business... it lags behind on a few areas,” Chief Economic Adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian said on Friday.

Mr. Subramanian pointed out that to open a restaurant in New Delhi, one needs 45 documents to obtain the licence from the Delhi police, whereas for buying a gun just 19 documents are required.

“If you want to start up a new firm in India, it takes 18 days on an average with 10 procedures that can be often cumbersome. If we contrast it with New Zealand, which is the best in business, it takes half-a-day to fill up one form, and boom, your business is started... [The Economic Survey] makes very specific suggestions that need to be focussed on, so that India can really improve its rank and get into the top 50 EoDB rankings,” he said.

As per the Economic Survey, it takes four years to enforce a contract in India; New Zealand, Indonesia, China and Brazil require 0.6, 1.2, 1.4 and 2.2 years respectively. “With a rank of 163 of the 190 nations in enforcing contracts, only a few countries like Afghanistan, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe perform worse than India.”

While China and Singapore require only four licences to open a restaurant, India requires several more mandatory licences and approvals: Delhi requires 26, Bengaluru 36, and Mumbai 22.

“Setting up and operating a services or manufacturing business in India faces a maze of laws, rules and regulations. Many of these are local requirements, such as burdensome documentation for police clearance to open a restaurant. This must be cleaned up and rationalized, one segment at a time... The scope for streamlining is clear,” it said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t33mz7/article30706099.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CEA-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/needed-fewer-regulations-for-start-ups-says-cea-krishnamurthy-subramanian/article30706088.ece
51,2020/01/31,Supreme Court urged to relook order on posting of teachers in minority-run institutions,"The Supreme Court on Friday issued notice on a plea for a re-examination of its January 6, 2020 judgment declaring that the State is well within its rights to regulate the appointment of teachers to minority-run institutions in “national interest.”

Appearing before a three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, representing the Managing Committee, Contai High Madrasah, said the judgment “dismantles” the law laid down by an 11-judge Bench of the Supreme Court in the T.M.A. Pai case of 2002.

The 2002 judgment had held that minorities have a fundamental right under Article 30 of the Constitution to administer their institutions and appoint teachers.

The January 6 judgment by a two-judge Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra had given the State an absolute right to impose regulations on minority established and administered institutions in the appointment of teachers, saying the step was necessary to achieve excellence in education in these institutions.

Contai said the two-judge Bench has even contradicted a Supreme Court judgment as recent as September 25, 2019 which upheld the rights of the minority communities to establish and run their own institutions without government interference in day-to-day affairs of management like the appointment of teachers. The September 25 judgment of the Supreme Court in Chandana Das (Malakar) versus State of West Bengal was pronounced by a three-judge Bench led by Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman.

The petitioner said the Constitution Bench in the T.M.A Pai case was clear that “regulatory measures of control should be very minimal” and “in matters of day-to-day management like appointment of staff, teaching and non-teaching, and administrative control over them, the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency.”

The petition said the judgment segregates a particular community from the privilege of protection under Article 30. The January 6 judgment was based on a petition challenging the validity of the West Bengal Madrasah Service Commission Act of 2008. The State Act mandated that the process of appointment of teachers in aided madrasahs, recognised as minority institutions, would be done by a Commission. The decision of the Commission would be binding. Justice Mishra’s Bench had upheld the 2008 Act.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/oaaf6u/article30706068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-supreme-court-of-india,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-urged-to-relook-order-on-posting-of-teachers-in-minority-run-institutions/article30706043.ece
52,2020/01/31,Gandhi misquoted in President’s address: Yechury,"The Left parties slammed the President Ramnath Kovind’s address on Friday ahead of the Budget session, for misquoting Mahatma Gandhi to “justify” the amended Citizenship Act. CPI (M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said the Narendra Modi government has been invoking Mahatma Gandhi to propagate their lies.

“Modi government continues to lie by invoking Gandhi’s ideas; now in the President’s address, on the divisive CAA, their lies stand exposed. Gandhi spoke the exact opposite in the cited statement. Gandhiji was killed because he stood for a secular and inclusive India,” Mr. Yechury said in a tweet.

President Kovind during his address said quoting Mahatma Gandhi said, “The Muslims have said they would be loyal to India. Let us trust them with all our heart. Let us remember that truth alone triumphs, never untruth.”

Elaborating further Mr. Yechury said it is a blatant lie to say that Gandhi said all non-Muslims from Pakistan are welcome here but not Muslims.

“Gandhi had in fact said the Muslims who have chosen to remain in India are loyal to India and we should give them our complete trust. In all his writings, he has always spoken about all the religions together. He has even said that those Hindus and Sikhs who choose to go to Pakistan should be loyal to Pakistan,” Mr. Yechury added.

He pointed out that there was astounding silence on the real problems faced by people in President’s address. “Nothing concrete and substantial was said on the economic burdens imposed on the people except paying platitudes,” Mr. Yechury said.

CPI general secretary D. Raja also said Gandhi’s name is being taken unnecessarily. “It’s very inappropriate to take the name of Gandhi to justify the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the communal policy of this government. The government through the President's address tried to paint a rosy picture when the country is in turmoil,” he said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/166xw6/article30706021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NKV-Yechury,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/gandhi-misquoted-in-presidents-address-yechury/article30705999.ece

The party, in a joint press conference addressed by Rajya Sabha MP Prof. Rajeev Gowda and spokespersons Supriya Srinate and Gourav Vallabh, said the Economic Survey doesn’t provide a roadmap to increase demand and consumption to tackle the current slowdown.

The party also said that the Survey document didn’t acknowledge the growing inequalities among different sections, much less offer a solution.

“We are facing the worst economy in 42 years – unemployment is at a historic high, jobs are nowhere being created. For the first time in four decades, consumption has fallen and there is great fear of increase in poverty, increase in malnutrition. Revenues are drying up dramatically... The Economic Survey will tell you nothing of this sort because it is an exercise in obfuscation,” Prof. Gowda said.

The Congress also objected to the Survey using words like ‘Lutyen’s Delhi’ and examples from Hindi films to make an argument about encouraging small businesses.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hl5f8f/article30705905.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-R,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/survey-doesnt-address-ground-realities-cong/article30705906.ece
54,2020/01/31,Xi’s ‘authoritarian’ leadership in countering coronavirus crisis draws flak,"China’s health crisis resulting from the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus is mutating internationally into a serious critique of President Xi Jinping’s leadership style and the top-down governance model of the Communist Party of China (CPC).

A remark by the local leader of Wuhan, the epicentre of the disease, has apparently triggered an avalanche of international criticism.

In an unusually candid interview, the Mayor of Wuhan linked the late disclosure of the novel strain of pneumonia to the current regulations of the CPC, led by Mr. Xi, the party’s secretary general.

“I hope everyone can understand why there wasn’t timely disclosure,” said Zhou Xianwang, Wuhan’s Mayor. He added: “After I received information, I needed authorisation before making it public.”

Public outrage

Domestically, a wave of public anger, fuelled by social media, has so far targeted the local leadership in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province.

Public outrage in Wuhan has spiralled following revelations on social media that local authorities had suppressed early warnings of the outbreak. Bloggers have identified eight medical personnel who had raised an alarm about the virus in late December. Police apparently accused them of “rumour mongering”.

But sections of the international media see in the Mayor’s observations problems arising from centralisation of power by President Xi, and the alleged inherent “inflexibility” embedded in the CPC’s DNA.

Western media reports, even earlier had slammed President Xi of pursuing an “authoritarian” leadership approach. That criticism peaked when the 19th party congress, in 2017, extended Mr. Xi’s tenure in office indefinitely.

Conflated issues

The Financial Times is quoting Wu Qiang, a former politics lecturer at Tsinghua University in Beijing, that the local government in Wuhan did not have the power to act decisively because they were at the bottom of a chain of command that started with the “supreme leader” — a Mao-era title recently bestowed on Mr. Xi.

The health crisis in China is also being conflated with the current leadership’s lack of success, so far, in defusing protests in Hong Kong. The blame for the re-election of a pro-independence leader in Taiwan is also being pinned on Mr. Xi.

Stung by the bad press that it receiving in the West, the Chinese leadership is pushing back hard.

Building resources

Government supporters say that without a disciplined 86 million-strong CPC at the core, it would have been impossible to build, within the space of ten days, a massive 1,000-bed hospital dedicated to treating coronavirus patients in Wuhan. They were referring to the 33,900 square metre Huoshenshan Hospital, which will be up and running by February 3. The round-the-clock construction of the facility is being live streamed, attracting millions of viewers. By February 5, a similar 1,600 bed hospital in Wuhan is also expected to come online. Chinese authorities say construction of two more hospitals in the nearby cities of Huanggang and Zhengzhou is being planned, State television broadcaster CGTN is reporting.

Besides, President Xi has ordered the People’s Liberation Army to the frontline to fight the war against coronavirus. “Military hospitals must make all-out efforts to accept and treat patients, and research institutions should press ahead with their research and development to contribute to victory against the outbreak,” state-run China Daily quoted him as saying.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/k8scvi/article30693579.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Coronavirus,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/xis-authoritarian-leadership-in-countering-coronavirus-crisis-draws-flak/article30705616.ece
55,2020/01/31,Supreme Court asks U.P. government to reply on notices to protesters,"The Supreme Court on Friday asked the Uttar Pradesh government to explain its notices to certain persons to cough up money for destruction of public property during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December last year.

A Bench led by Justice D.Y. Chandrachud issued formal notice to the State government on a petition filed by Uttar Pradesh resident Parwaiz Arif Titu, who said the notices for payment of damages were “arbitrarily” sent to people. They include a person, Bannu Khan, who died six years ago at the age of 94, to two others, Fasahat Mir Khan and Sufi Ansar Hussain, both in their 90s and bedridden.

The petition said the notices were in furtherance of the “promise” made by the BJP-led Yogi Adityanath government “to avenge the loss to public property by seizing the assets of CAA-NRC protesters in order to take revenge, for political reasons, from one community who is in minority”.

“This means that 925 persons arrested so far for violent protests may not get bail easily in Uttar Pradesh till they pay up for the losses… Many of them are not involved in violent protests,” the petition said.

Notices clearly show that the persons to whom they were sent had not been booked for any offence. “There is no detail of any crime committed by them,” the petition said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3gf97v/article30705514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1TH-COU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sc-asks-up-govt-to-reply-on-notices-to-protesters/article30705515.ece
56,2020/01/31,Economic Survey 2019-20: Stubble burning incidents come down,"The number of stubble-burning incidents in 2019 were the least in four years, the Economic Survey says.

According to satellite data, there were 61,332 instances of stubble-burning in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh between October and November, 2019. There were 75,532 instances in 2018, 88,948 in 2017 and 127,774 in 2016, according to data sourced from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Serious concerns

“With various efforts, overall, the total number of burning events recorded a significant reduction. However, the continuation of this practice by farmers is reported every year starting winter, and the serious concerns about its impact on air quality are raised,” the Survey noted. The number of fire events peaked from mid-October till the first week of November, 2019. This led to an increase in the levels of particulate matter in Delhi in October and November, compared with September 2019. In September, the highest levels of PM10 and PM2.5 were 134 microgram and 80.34 microgram respectively. In October, the highest level of PM10 was 384 and the highest level of PM2.5 was 306. In November, PM10 crossed 550 and PM2.5 crossed 510. PM10 and PM2.5 started falling in December 2019 and the lowest levels recorded of PM10 and PM2.5 were188 and 153 respectively, the chapter emphasised.

The pollution levels spike when farmers in these three States burn the residue after harvesting paddy to clear the fields of the summer harvest and make way for wheat sowing. The smoke from these fires travels to Delhi, leading to a gaseous cocktail that causes air quality to plummet.

Ban not enforced

There has been a ban on burning this agricultural residue, but the State authorities have not been able to entirely stop it.

Agriculture conservation should be promoted with “low lignocellulosic” crop residues such as rice, wheat and maize. Crop residue-based briquettes ought to be encouraged and thermal power plants in the vicinity ought to be encouraged to undertake co-firing of crop residues with coal, the Survey noted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/i6p4i8/article30705486.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01STUBBLEBURNING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/stubble-burning-incidents-come-down/article30705487.ece
57,2020/01/31,Economic Survey 2019-20: High fees push poor out of education system,"High fees at the institutes of higher education push the poor and underprivileged out of the education system, the Economic Survey notes.

The comment comes at a time when a faction of students at Jawarharlal Nehru University have been opposing the fee increase arguing that it will force many poor students to quit studies.

Noting that the National Sample Survey 2017-2018 shows an increased participation in the education system in some indicators, the Survey says there are “challenges of affordability, quality, distribution of education infrastructure”.

“As many as 13.6% of those in the age group of 3-35 were never enrolled,” the Survey cites from the NSS. Those surveyed attributed “financial constraints” among the reasons for not pursuing education.

“The course fee, which is 50.8% at the all-India level (including tuition, examination, development fees and other compulsory payments)... accounts for half of the average expenditure of a basic course,” according to the Survey.

Further, the proportion of the course fee is high in both rural and urban areas. This is followed by expenditure on books, stationery and uniform, wherein students in rural areas spend 10 percentage points more than those in urban areas.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/7najvq/article30705449.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH01SCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/high-fees-push-poor-out-of-education-system/article30705451.ece

The 423-seater flight is expected to return to Delhi from Wuhan (China) at 2 a.m. on Saturday and another special flight may depart from T3, Delhi on Saturday.

On Friday the death toll due to coronavirus rose to 213, with 1,982 new cases pushing up the coronavirus-stricken figure world-wide to 9,692.

Air India CMD Ashwani Lohani said, “During the flight no service will take place in the plane. Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. There will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers).”

“Masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. For our crew, we have also arranged a complete protective gear,” he added. Air India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal. The government has reached out to over 600 Indians living in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, to ascertain their willingness to be brought back to India.

“We have made arrangements for the evacuation of 366 Indian citizens from Wuhan city in response to the emergency situation that has arisen due to outbreak of novel coronavirus in China. A team of doctors, public health specialists and para medical staff have been sent in the aircraft of AI.

59,2020/01/31,"Be aggressive on CAA, PM urges NDA partners","Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners not to be defensive over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and aggressively support it in Parliament. During the meeting allies Janata Dal(U) and Akali Dal urged the government to remove questions seeking details of parents from the National Population Register (NPR) questionnaire.

The alliance partners then also passed a resolution at the meeting lauding the Modi government for its “decisive” moves in reading down Article 370 according special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the passage of the CAA, the operationalisation of the Kartarpur corridor and the Bodo and Bru agreements that seek to end the two conflicts in the northeast.

“The NDA is one united family, and we stand like a rock behind Prime Minister Modi,” said Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan, briefing the media about the meeting.

‘Confront Opposition’

Government sources said Prime Minister Modi told NDA party leaders that the government’s moves were not something that any of the partners needed to feel defensive about. He asked them to be on the front foot over the issue, and to take the Opposition head on. An NDA leader present at the meeting said Mr. Modi also reiterated that Muslims as much a right and responsibilities in India as any other community.

The meeting took place after both Houses of Parliament had adjourned for the day after the government tabled the economic survey.

NDA partner from Bihar, the JD(U), however, raised the issue of the NPR questionnaire during the meeting, urging the government to remove questions seeking details of parents in the NPR questionnaire.

60,2020/01/31,Budget Session 2020: Congress says President’s speech used to legitimise government’s errors,"The President of India’s address to both the Houses of Parliament has become a platform to legitimise the government’s blunders, the Congress said on Friday.

Opposition leaders from 14 parties, led by the Congress, wore black arm bands, vacated the front row seats and sat in one block during the President’s address in the Central Hall of Parliament to protest against the new citizenship law, the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the proposed National Population Register (NPR).

Former prime minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, however, sat in his designated front row seat.

When President Kovind hailed the CAA in his speech amidst thunderous applause from ruling party MPs, Opposition members were heard shouting “shame, shame” in the Central Hall at the same time.

Opposition parties may also move a motion against the President’s address, when both the Houses discuss it next week.

‘Despite massive protests’

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Ghulam Nabi Azad, said that it was “shameful” the Union government had included the CAA in President Ram Nath Kovind’s speech as an achievement of the government despite massive protests against the bill.

Deputy leader of the Congress Anand Sharma accused the government of “lowering the dignity” of the President’s office as the validity of the CAA has been challenged in the Supreme Court. He described Mr. Kovind’s speech as a “laundry list of wrong laws”.

Mr. Azad said the speech did not have any concrete steps on tackling “real” issues like unemployment, rise in prices of essential commodities, fall in the value of the rupee, or the GDP (gross domestic product).

He said the government’s claim of development in Jammu and Kashmir, after “downgrading” the State to a Union Territory, was a “cruel joke” on the people.

‘Inaccurate statements’

“This government should be ashamed for writing such lies. The honourable President is a dignified person and the government should apologise for making him read out such inaccurate statements. They should also apologise to the people of J&K and the entire country,” Mr. Azad said

“When we have questioned the Constitutional morality of some of the steps taken by the Government, which we have said are discriminatory and divisive, they should not have found any reference in the President’s address. ….Rashtrapatiji’s address did not even have platitudes. It was a laundry list of wrong laws,” Mr. Sharma said, referring to the CAA.

“The President’s address has become a platform to legitimise the government’s blunders. The Father of the Nation cannot be used as a brand ambassador for their divisive policies,” tweeted senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel.

In a series of tweets, former finance minister P. Chidambaram said Mr. Kovind’s speech had “tiresome old slogans and clichés”.

“Sadly, there was not a word on the macro-economic situation. Not a word on lost jobs, increasing unemployment and rising consumer price inflation. Not a word on the closure of thousands of industries, especially in the SME [small and medium-sized enterprises] sector,” he said on Twitter.

Protest near statue

Earlier in the morning, top Congress leaders led by Sonia Gandhi staged a protest near Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in the Parliament complex to express solidarity with those protesting against the CAA-NRC-NPR.

The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Nationalist Congress Party were a part of these protests. Party leaders were seen holding “Save Constitution” banners and shouting anti-government slogans.

Ms. Gandhi was accompanied by party leaders Rahul Gandhi, Mr. Azad, Mr. Sharma, Mr. Patel, Mr. Chidambaram, senior leaders Motilal Vohra, Adhir Ranjan Choudhury, A.K. Antony and other MPs from both houses.

Shirts under coats

Trinamool Congress (TMC) members also held a silent protest, with many of them wearing shirts that said “NO CAA”, “NO NRC” and “NO NPR”, while others held afloat handkerchiefs with these slogans.

Since MPs are not allowed to carry placards in the Central Hall during the President’s address, the TMC MPs wore the shirts under coats and sweaters.

The leaders of Opposition parties who wore black bands in the Central Hall included those from the NCP, the DMK, the Rashtriya Janata Dal, the Communist Party of India-Marxist, the Communist Party of India, the Shiv Sena, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the Janata Dal (Secular), the Revolutionary Socialist Party, the Kerala Congress (M), the Indian Union Muslim League, the National Conference, and the Congress.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/owrlty/article30703757.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Congressprotest,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/budget-session-2020-congress-says-presidents-speech-used-to-legitimise-governments-errors/article30703736.ece

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana passed the order on plea by the convicts seeking a stay on their execution on February 1.

During the hearing, Tihar Jail authorities challenged the application to stay the hanging of three convicts — Pawan Kumar Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar — saying that only one convict’s plea is pending and the others can be hanged.

Advocate A.P. Singh, representing the convicts, argued that rules dictate that when one convict’s plea is pending the others cannot be hanged.

The fourth person sentenced to death in the case is Mukesh Kumar, whose mercy plea was dismissed by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 17. The Supreme Court had on Wednesday dismissed Mukesh’s plea against the President’s decision.

The court had on January 20 issued death warrants for February 1 against the four convicts — Vinay Sharma (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan (26) — in the case. The order now stands stayed till further orders.

'Hopes dashed but will fight till convicts are hanged'

Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi on Friday said she would continue her fight till the convicts in the 2012 gangrape and murder case were hanged. She said this shortly after a Delhi court postponed the execution of death warrants till further order.

“These convicts have no right to live. We keep getting disappointed by the system. I will continue my fight till the convicts are hanged,” she said.

Additional sessions judge Dharmender Rana passed the order on a plea by the convicts seeking a stay on their execution on Saturday, February 1.

Ms. Devi said because of the loopholes in law, the “criminals’ lawyers had the audacity to challenge me in court that they will not be hanged.”

The black warrants for execution of the death sentence against Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma, Akshay Kumar and Mukesh Kumar Singh were issued on January 17.

62,2020/01/31,Army establishes coronavirus quarantine facility for students returning from China,"Indian Army has created a Coronavirus quarantine facility near Manesar for monitoring around 300 students coming from Wuhan in China.

“Responding to an emergency requirement to create and manage a facility for quarantine of approximately 300 Indian students arriving from Wuhan, China the Indian Army has acted swiftly and created a facility near Manesar where the students can be monitored for a duration of two weeks by a qualified team of doctors and staff members, to watch for any signs of infection,” Army sources said on Friday.

The procedure of screening and quarantine will comprise two steps, the first one being screening at airport followed by quarantine at Manesar and if any individual is suspected to be infected, he/she will be shifted to the isolation ward at Base Hospital Delhi Cantonment (BHDC), an Army source said.

On arrival at the airport, the students will be screened at the airport by a joint team of Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) and Airport Health Authority (APHO). During the screening they will be classified into three groups, suspect case, close contact and non contact case.

In suspect cases, individuals with any signs of fever and/or cough and/or respiratory distress will be directly transferred to BHDC, the source stated. In close contact, any individual without symptoms but having visited a seafood/animal market or a health facility or having come into contact with a Chinese person with symptoms in the last 14 days will be escorted in an earmarked vehicle directly to the quarantine facility. In non-contact case, any individual without any symptoms or fit either of two earlier criteria will also be clubbed along with the close contact category and sent to the quarantine facility.

The quarantine facility consists of accommodation barracks for the students, administrative areas and medical facility area. To prevent mass outbreak, the facility has been divided into sectors, each with a maximum capacity of 50 students. Each barrack has been further subdivided into barracks. “The population of sectors will not be allowed to intermingle with each other,” sources said.

Daily medical examination of all students will be done at the medical facility area and all the staff, health care workers and housekeeping staff must wear their personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times. “After 14 days, persons with no symptoms will be allowed to go home with their detailed documentation sent to the District/ State surveillance units for further surveillance,” the source stated adding those found infected will be shifted to BHDC's isolation ward for further medical exams and recovery.

“Samples for viral confirmation will be sent to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Delhi and patients will be discharged only after clinical recovery and two successive negative samples tested for n-COV,” sources explained.

The facility will be administered by a nominated Officer In Charge (OIC) who will have under his command a Community Medicine Specialist, two Nursing Officers, a Lady Medical Officer and one Nursing Assistant. “No civilian or serving personnel detailed to work inside the facility will be allowed to go outside unless compelled by extreme emergency situation,” sources added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3dmoqh/article30702492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Indian-Army-Quarantine-facility,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/army-establishes-coronavirus-quarantine-facility-for-students-returning-from-china/article30702493.ece

64,2020/01/31,"Citizenship Amendment Act fulfils wish of Mahatma Gandhi, President Ram Nath Kovind tells Parliament","President Ram Nath Kovind on Friday kick-started the Budget session of Parliament with an address to both Houses. He lauded the enactment of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) that, he said, fulfilled the wish of Mahatma Gandhi who had said that Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan who didn’t want to stay there could come to India.

In an hour-long address, he spoke at length on the importance of the Constitution, adding that “in a democracy, nothing is more sacred than the mandate of the people. The people of the country have given this mandate to my government for the making of New India.”

He said India had always believed in the principle of equal respect for all faiths, but at the time of partition in 1947, “this very belief of India and of its people came under the most severe attack”.

In the environment prevailing in the aftermath of Partition, Mahatma Gandhi had said, “Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan, who do not wish to live there, can come to India. It is the duty of the government of India to ensure a normal life for them”.

‘Procedure unchanged’

“It is our responsibility to honour this wish of the founding fathers of our nation. I am happy that both Houses have fulfilled this wish by enacting the Citizenship (Amendment) Act,” Mr. Kovind said.

He clarified that “the procedures which have existed for people from all faiths of the world who believe in India and who wish to obtain Indian citizenship remain unchanged. A person of any faith can follow these processes and become a citizen of India.” He made a specific mention to the incidents of anti-Sikh violence at Nankana Sahib in Pakistan and said it was the duty of “all of us” to bring such atrocities to the attention of the global community.

He also expressed the view — without a direct reference to the CAA — that mutual discussions and debates strengthened democracy, while asserting that “any kind of violence in the name of protests weakens society and the nation”.

The President dwelt on the developments in Kashmir following the dilution of Article 370, saying the government had taken Jan Sangh founder and Commerce Minister in the Nehru government Syama Prasad Mukherjee’s words to the heart that Jammu and Kashmir, too, should benefit from India’s Constitution and federal structure. He lauded the government for the conduct of the local body elections and accelerating development there.

Mr. Kovind also highlighted the work done by various Ministries, including those that had enhanced India’s ranking on international indices. “On the Tourism Index, India has risen from 52nd to the 34th rank, while on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking, the country has jumped 79 ranks to stand at the 63rd.”

“Eight crore people were given free gas connections, two crore free houses and 38 crore people have been helped with bank accounts,” he said. Lauding the contributions of farmers, the President said that bringing about a change in their lives is the government’s priority. He said the government would spend ₹25 lakh crore in the coming years to strengthen the rural economy.

Under the Prime Minister’s Kisan Samman Nidhi, he said over ₹43,000 crore had been deposited in the bank accounts of over eight crore farmers.

66,2020/01/31,"Nirbhaya convict Pawan moves SC, seeks review of order dismissing juvenility claim","One of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, Pawan Gupta, on Friday approached the Supreme Court seeking review of its verdict which dismissed his plea claiming to be a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence.

On January 20, the apex court had rejected the plea by Pawan who had challenged the Delhi High Court’s order dismissing his juvenility claim.

Advocate A.P. Singh, who is representing Pawan in the case, said he has filed a petition on his behalf seeking review of the top court’s January 20 order on Friday.

While dismissing the plea, the top court had said there was no ground to interfere with the high court order that rejected Pawan’s plea and his claim was rightly rejected by the trial court as also the high court.

It had said the matter was raised earlier in the review petition before the apex court which rejected plea of juvenility taken by Pawan and another co-accused Vinay Kumar Sharma and that order has attained finality.

Mr. Singh had argued that as per his school leaving certificate, he was a minor at the time of the offence and none of the courts, including trial court and high court, ever considered his documents.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi Police, had said Pawan’s claim of juvenility was considered at each and every judicial forum and it will be a travesty of justice if the convict is allowed to raise the claim of juvenility repeatedly and at this point of time.

The trial court on January 17 issued black warrants for the second time for the execution of all the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan (25), Vinay (26) and Akshay (31) — in Tihar jail at 6 a.m. on February 1. Earlier, on January 7, the court had fixed January 22 as the hanging date.

As of now, only Mukesh has exhausted all his legal remedies including the clemency plea which was dismissed by President Ram Nath Kovind on January 17 and the appeal against the rejection was thrown out by the Supreme Court on January 29.

Convict Akshay’s curative petition was dismissed by the top court on January 30. Another death row convict Vinay moved mercy plea before President on January 29, which is pending.

Mr. Singh has also approached the trial court seeking stay on the execution scheduled on February 1, saying the legal remedies of some of the convicts are yet to be availed.

67,2020/01/31,Death penalty | Supreme Court admits government plea seeking ‘victim and society centric’ guidelines,"The Supreme Court on Friday admitted the government’s plea to issue some “victim and society centric” guidelines to prevent delay in execution of condemned people in death penalty cases, but added the rider that it would not consider any plea to alter past judgments or existing rights of death row prisoners.

The government’s application delves on the point that the legal process leading finally to the actual execution of the condemned man is labyrinthine and susceptible to be misused by the convict to prolong the day of execution. Delay is a ground for commutation of death penalty. The long-winded process and consequent delay renders stale the expectation of the victim’s family and society for justice.

Shatrughan Chauhan case

The government claimed that the reason for this delay is a series of guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in its judgment in the Shatrughan Chauhan case in 2014. These guidelines had primarily held that unexplained delay in carrying out an execution would lead to commutation of death penalty to life imprisonment. The government called the 2014 verdict “accused-centric” and called for a change to appease the victims and society.

“We (Supreme Court) have always rendered judgments with the victims in our mind. Our decisions are for the victims. It is the law of the land,” Chief Justice S.A. Bobde reacted to Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, for the government.

The three-judge Bench led by Chief Justice Bobde questioned the government’s locus standi in filing the application. The CJI said both the review and curative petitions against the Chauhan verdict already stood dismissed.

The court asked how the government could file an application now, seeking to modify or add to the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 2014 as part of a judgment.

Undaunted, Mr. Mehta repeatedly expressed the government’s concern for victims awaiting justice. He said the government was merely seeking some “additional” guidelines to the ones in the Chauhan verdict to balance the scale.

Finally, the court agreed to issue formal notice, but the CJI clarified in its written order that the court would not entertain any alteration in the conviction or sentence in the Chauhan case.

The Supreme Court had commuted the death penalty of 15 convicts to life sentence in the Chauhan case.

In its application, the government has asked the court to set short deadlines for death row convicts to seek legal remedies. It wants the court to limit the time for filing curative petition. Mercy plea should be filed within a week of issuance of death warrant. If mercy plea has already been rejected, death warrant should be issued within the next seven days and execution carried out a week thereafter. The pendency of review or curative petitions of his co-convicts would be of no consequence for a man whose mercy plea has been rejected.

The application came in the aftermath of the four Nirbhaya convicts separately and repeatedly approaching the courts for one relief or the other.

Their execution dates were extended from January 22 to February 1.

The aircraft will later leave for Wuhan on the afternoon of January 31 and is expected to return to Delhi late in the night with 325 passengers, most of whom are students.

Upon its return, the aircraft will be taken to a remote bay and later fumigated.

Another evacuation flight has been planned for Saturday to depart from Delhi or Mumbai and return to the national capital by night.

“Air India will board only those passengers who do not show symptoms of the infection,” said a senior Health Ministry official.

He added that 16 crew members will be on board for the evacuation process. The crew is travelling with masks, gloves and disinfectant sprays and will not get off the aircraft in Wuhan.

There will be minimal contact with the passengers during the flight.

There are five doctors from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital and one paramedical staff onboard, they said, adding that around 400 Indians are expected to be evacuated and the plane is likely to return between 1 a.m to 2 a.m on Saturday.

“The plane did a pushback towards the runway at around 12.50 pm. It took off at around 1.20 pm on Friday. The departure got delayed a little from 12.30 pm scheduled time because of some pending clearances,” said a senior airline official.

After takeoff, an Air India spokesperson stated that another special flight may take off from Delhi airport on Saturday to evacuate Indians from Wuhan.

About Friday’s flight, the spokesperson said, “A team of five doctors from RML hospital, one paramedical staff from Air India, with prescribed medicines from doctors, masks, overcoats, packed food are in the aircraft. A team of engineers, security personnel are also there in this special aircraft. Whole rescue mission is being lead by Captain Amitabh Singh, Director (Operations), Air India.”

The spokesperson added that there are five cockpit crew members and 15 cabin crew members on Friday’s flight.

Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani said on Friday morning, “No service will take place in the plane. Whatever food is there will be kept in seat pockets. As there will be no service, there will be no interaction (between cabin crew and passengers).”

“Masks have been arranged for the crew and passengers. For our crew, we have also arranged a complete protective gear,” he added.

“Total five doctors from the Health Ministry are also going... The plane will be there (at Wuhan airport) for 2-3 hours,” said Lohani.

Air India has done such evacuations earlier also from countries such as Libya, Iraq, Yemen, Kuwait and Nepal.

The government has reached out to over 600 Indians living in China’s Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak, to ascertain their willingness to be brought back to India.

73,2020/01/31,PNB fraud case: Nirav Modi remanded until February 27,"Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, was produced for a regular remand hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Thursday and further remanded in custody until February 27.

The 48-year-old, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London, appeared via videolink from prison before District Judge David Robinson.

“I am told that your case is proceeding in accordance with the directions for a final hearing on 11 May,” the judge told Modi, as he set the next 28-day remand hearing via videolink for February 27.

Modi’s extradition trial is scheduled for five days starting May 11, with the case management hearings in the case set to begin once all the evidence has been handed in to the court for the trial.

He had made a last-ditch bail application in November last year with an unprecedented house arrest guarantee, akin to those imposed on terrorist suspects, as well as citing mental health issues from being behind bars at Wandsworth since his arrest in March 2019.

But the bail plea was turned down by Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot over continued fears of witness intimidation and failure to surrender before the court for his extradition trial this year.

The UK’s Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which represents the Indian government in the extradition proceedings, said there is no further prospect of an appeal for bail in a higher court as the UK High Court had already turned down Modi’s plea earlier last year.

Modi is meanwhile expected to appear for call-over hearings every 28 days at Westminster Magistrates’ Court until the case management hearings for his extradition trial kick in.

The diamond merchant denies the charges of fraud and money laundering and his defence team, led by barrister Hugo Keith, has claimed that the Indian government has wrongly blackened Modi’s name as a world-class schemer.

As part of the change in circumstances required for a fresh bail application, Modi’s lawyers had offered to double the bail bond security offered to the court, from the previous GBP 2 million to GBP 4 million. They had also informed the court of attacks on their client from fellow inmates at one of England’s most overcrowded prisons.

Modi has been behind bars at Wandsworth since his arrest on March 19 on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard on charges brought by the Indian government. During subsequent hearings, the UK court has been told that Modi was the “principal beneficiary” of the fraudulent issuance of letters of undertaking (LoUs) as part of a conspiracy to defraud PNB and then laundering the proceeds of crime.

His extradition trial is scheduled between May 11 and 15 this year.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/i3vww0/article30687801.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NIRAVMODI039jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pnb-fraud-case-nirav-modi-remanded-until-february-27/article30699226.ece
74,2020/01/31,CDS should be given capital procurements: ex-Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra,"The newly created Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) should be given control over capital procurements of the three Services which remains with the Defence Secretary, said recently retired Defence Secretary Sanjay Mitra on Thursday.

Talking of integration in the Defence Ministry, Mr. Mitra said he saw it closely in the run-up to the Balakot air strike in February last year. “When we are in a crisis we do well. It is the peacetime conversations that lead to tensions,” he said speaking at a book launch on civil-military relations in India, The Absent Dialogue, by Dr. Anit Mukherjee, Non Resident Fellow at Brookings India.

“I think capital procurements should go to CDS as military capabilities are the core of the discussions that take place,” Mr. Mitra stated. He added that the CDS had powers over promotions, transfer and awards of all three Services which “is the ultimate power,” and capital acquisition should go to him too.

Former Army Chief Gen. V.P. Malik agreed to this, stating that peace time “we have a lot of problem,” giving the 1999 Kargil conflict as an example. “I had no problem during Kargil. It was the discussion which resulted in the joint strategy,” he added.

On the CDS, he said the CDS had been given a huge task but was “not empowered enough.”

Adverse impact

Speaking about the book, Dr. Mukherjee said India’s civil-military relations had an adverse impact on its military effectiveness. “Defence Ministry is among the least transformed bureaucracies, but the military also requires reform,” he stated.

Bipin Rawat took over as the country’s first CDS, heading the newly created Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functioning as Secretary in the Defence Ministry.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cds-should-be-given-capital-procurements-ex-defence-secretary-sanjay-mitra/article30695611.ece
75,2020/01/31,Four hydro projects violate Ganga flow norms: Central Water Commission,"Over a year after the government made it mandatory for hydro power projects on the upper reaches of the river Ganga’s tributaries to release minimum quantities of water through the year, 4 of the 11 projects are flouting norms, says a report by the Central Water Commission (CWC).

The ecological flow, or e-flow notification as it is called, specifies that the upper stretches of the Ganga — from its origins in the glaciers and until Haridwar — would have to maintain: 20% of the monthly average flow of the preceding 10-days between November and March, which is the dry season; 25% of the average during the ‘lean season’ of October, April and May; and 30% of monthly average during the monsoon months of June-September.

The CWC is tasked with measuring the flow and ensuring that plants comply with the law. The non-compliant ones are: Maneri Bhali Phase 2 ,Vishnuprayag Hydroelectric project, Srinagar Hydroelectric project and the Pashulok barrage project. The Vishnuprayag and Srinagar projects are on the Alaknanda river, the Maneri Bhali on the Bhagirathi and the Pashulok is on the Ganga main stream.

Moves court

Power company GVK, which runs the Srinagar project, has challenged the e-flow notification in the Uttarakhand High court.

“After monsoon period many of the projects are not meeting the mandated e-flows,” the CWC report says.

The Centre’s e-flow notification came into effect last October and gave companies three years to modify their design plans, if required, to ensure that a minimum amount of water flowed during all seasons. Power producers generally hoard water to create reserves to increase power production.

Deadline advanced

In September 2019, the government advanced this deadline, from October 2021 to December 2019. This was after the CWC undertook field visits to hydro power sites and reported that most of the power projects could begin implementing the norms right away and didn’t need three years.

D.P. Mathuria, a senior official in the National Mission for Clean Ganga, said the government would be sending notices to the offending companies. Violating the e-flow norms can mean closure of the project or a hefty fine but the government isn’t contemplating such action yet.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/usc5i3/article30696988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CWCjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/four-hydro-projects-violate-ganga-flow-norms-cwc/article30695064.ece
76,2020/01/31,West Bengal Governor chides senior police official,"West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar on Thursday publicly rebuked Biddhannagar’s Commissioner of Police Manoj Verma when the Governor visited Gandhi Ghat in Barrackpore on the occasion of Martyrs’ Day.

“You were sitting in the first row and reading newspapers, such casual, farcical and improper approach,” Mr. Dhankhar was shown remarking in a televised news clip broadcast by multiple news channels. “The Governor is here. It is Martyrs’ Day, the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Shame on us,” the Governor was heard telling the senior police officer.

Mr. Dhankhar, who has in the past expressed his disappointment over the deployment of police at events attended by him, expressed surprise at “how men in uniform can indulge in such behaviour”.

“I am worried at such a serious lapse, how can it happen on this day. Are we living in a State where there is rule of law?” he remarked. The Governor asked the Commissioner to make a list of police officers present at the event and send it to him either directly or route it through the State Secretariat.

Later, speaking to journalists Mr. Dhankhar asserted that rule of law had completely broken down in the State. “We are having total breakdown of law and order, total lawlessness. There is no rule of law. Let us resolve on this day to do some serious soul searching,” he said. The development comes just days after the the Governor was unable to attend the convocation at the University of Calcutta, owing to protests by students.

“What I saw at Calcutta University, where was the Kolkata Police. Did you see a single uniformed man,” he said. The Governor also remarked that when he wanted to meet the Home Secretary, the officer was not available.

Senior TMC leader and Minister for Power Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, who was present at the event in Barrackpore, claimed that the Governor had turned his face when he greeted him and ignored his gesture. “I will not respond to what he said. I think that he is representing a political party and not behaving like a Governor,” Mr. Chattopadhyay said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/v4pufr/article30619952.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE22DHANKHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/west-bengal-governor-chides-senior-police-official/article30695584.ece
77,2020/01/31,Include Muslims in Citizenship Amendment Act: Shiromani Akali Dal,"Key National Democratic Alliance member Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Thursday slammed the Modi government at an all-party meeting called ahead of the budget session, saying legislation drafted on religious lines was not acceptable and reasserted its line that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) should not exclude Muslims. Akali Dal Rajya Sabha member Balwinder Singh Bhunder raised the issue during the meeting. His comments come at a time when BJP national president J.P. Nadda met SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal to resolve the differences between the two parties over seat-sharing in the Delhi Assembly elections.

‘Demand from day one’

“We have been saying this from day one. The government should have replaced the names of religions with just the phrase “religious minorities” in the Citizenship [Amendment] Act,” Mr. Bhunder told The Hindu.

The Akali Dal had supported the CAA and during the debate in Parliament it said that Muslims should also have been included in the Act. Mr. Bhunder criticised the anti-Muslim narrative in the Delhi election campaign. “The slogans being raised against minorities with phrases like “goli maar do” is very unfortunate. At one point such slogans were raised against Sikhs too and those in Opposition today were the once who used to raise slogans,” he noted.

The other allies, the AIADMK and the JD(U), spoke in support of the government at the meeting.

Broadly, the Opposition parties collectively raised four issues – the ‘arrogance’ of the government in failing to reach out to those protesting against the CAA and related confusion on the National Register of Citizens (NRC); the growing rate of unemployment, release of Kashmir leaders Dr. Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti from detention; and lastly, the assertion of many parties, including the Biju Janata Dal, that federal values were being undermined.

The meeting was attended by 26 political parties. The Shiv Sena skipped the meeting.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for a “greater focus” on economic issues in the session and how India could gain in the prevailing global situation, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi told reporters after the meeting.

Only a ritual: Azad

Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha and Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, who opened the discussion, said the meeting was merely a photo-opportunity and a ritual. The number of days that Parliament sat had been deliberately reduced. “The government is focused only on getting bills passed but we also drew their attention towards sinking economy, rising unemployment and Kashmir. We told them Farooq Abdullah be released so that he can attend Parliament, others be released too,” Mr. Azad told reporters after the meeting.

The government, he alleged, was least bothered about the people protesting on the streets over CAA-NRC. “This shows their arrogance. They are not bothered about farmers too. The Opposition wanted these issues to be discussed too,” he said.

Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandhopadhyay said the government should have reached out to CAA protesters and the arrogance would be their undoing. “You must remember that the Congress was reduced from 412 to 44. If you remain arrogant, you will be reduced from 303 to 33,” he said, according to sources.

Biju Janata Dal spokesperson and Lok Sabha member Pinaki Misra, according to the sources, said the federal values were being undermined. He raised the issue of inordinate delay in paying the State's share of the Goods and Services Tax.

During the meeting, the sources said, the Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress exchanged sharp words over the three-capital issue, nearly disrupting the meeting. The other parties had to intervene to cool their temper.

79,2020/01/31,Durga temple suspends sanitary inspector for ‘proselytisation’,"Authorities of the Sri Kanaka Durga Mallesewara Swamyvarla Devasthanam have suspended a sanitary inspector for allegedly resorting to proselytisation.

Sources said that Kiran, the sanitary inspector, was allegedly forcing women workers to visit church and embrace Christianity.

Unable to put up with the pressure allegedly being mounted by Mr. Kiran, the women workers reportedly approached leaders of the BJP and the Hindu Yuva Sakthi (HYS).

When the leaders accosted Mr. Kiran on Friday, he reportedly claimed that he was a Hindu despite having a ring of the alien faith on his person.

The leaders then recorded his statements and presented them before the temple authorities.

Later, based on the complaint lodged by the women workers, the temple authorities suspended Mr. Kiran.

Earlier instance

In a similar incident in 2015, two youths had been taken into custody by the police on the charge of proselytisation at Arandal Satram (choultry) maintained by the temple management.

The police registered a case after the temple authorities lodged a complaint in this regard.

The accused, P. Raju and Sandeep, who belong to an alien faith, were engaged by a contractor at the ‘kesakhandanasala’.

On receiving an anonymous call that the youths were propagating another religion at the choultry, the authorities had searched the room of the accused in the presence of the police and found scriptures belonging to the alien faith.

Subsequently, the temple authorities had asked the staff members to file an affidavit on their religion.

In a circular, Ch. Narsing Rao, who was then the Executive Officer, had said that every employee, including temporary, daily wage, and NMR, should declare their faith.

Following the circular, an employee, who was reluctant to give the declaration, had submitted his resignation.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/durga-temple-suspends-sanitary-inspector-for-proselytisation/article30706414.ece

Their joy knew no bounds when they found the names of all 58 trainee engineers working in Panel Opto-Display Technology Private Limited (POTPL) in the updated list of passengers released by the government. It is learnt that about 35 are from north Andhra.

“We are happy to learn that our children will be returning safely. My son called me in the evening and informed that both the Chinese and Indian governments were conducting tests at the airport ahead of their departure,” said AVL Rao, parent of a trainee engineer from Vizag.

According to the parents, the flight was likely to reach Delhi at around 2 a.m. on Saturday. After screening at the airport, they will be sent a quarantine facility set up by the Army at Manesar in Haryana. The engineers and students are likely to be kept under observation for about two weeks.

It may be recalled that 96 engineers from Andhra Pradesh working with POTPL had been sent to Wuhan city in China in August last for training.

81,2020/01/31,Scientist bats for technology domination through IPR,"Technology is power and will continue to be so in the foreseeable future, R. Chidambaram, Nuclear Scientist and former Principal Scientific Adviser to Government of India, has said.

“Technology domination is sought in the fields as diverse as human genomics and nuclear weapons through mechanisms of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) and technology control regimes,” said Dr. Chidambaram during a seminar on ‘The Many Dimensions of Scientific Research’, organised at SRM University coinciding with the first Research Day it observed here on Friday.

Dr. Chidambaram, who held major portfolios such as Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet, Director of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) and Chairman of Atomic Energy Commission, further said that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning were omnipresent concepts.

In this context, Dr. Chidambaram said he had not agreed to what Stephen Hawking said a few years ago that development of AI could spell the end of human race.

The lecture covered a wide gamut of issues ranging from the nuclear path of India, research by IITs, which included the machine tool project by IIT- Madras, and the many dimensions of research and possible linkages.

Beginning his address with the quote, “Always work on important problems important to science or important to society,” Dr. Chidambaram narrated a few innovations by BARC such as building bridges in the mountainous regions of Rajasthan.

Development indices

He, however, added that real development of a country could only be gauged by factors such as Human Development Index, high female literacy, scientific advancement, knowledge economy, and R&D ecosystem.

“Path-breaking research is also going on in the areas such as tumuor knee prosthetics, resecting the malignant bone in bone cancer,” he observed.

The YSRCP MP’s visit has created a buzz as it is the fist by any elected representative of the ruling party.

The visit also raised interest as it comes a day after the young MP along with former Supreme Court Judge Justice Jasti Chalameswar and AP Official Language Commission Chairman Yarlagadda Lakhmi Prasad meeting Chief Minister Y.S Jagan Mohan Reddy at the latter’s residence. Tension has been building up in a cluster of villages in the region with the TDP, the BJP and the Jana Sena Party throwing their weight behind the agitating landowners.

The MP told The Hindu that he had visited the region to assuage the feelings of farmers who had parted with land for the construction of the capital city.

“I told those who have been undertaking fast that the government is willing to talk to them. I also sought to convey the message that the government is not against the development of Amaravati.” The landowners were urged not to spoil their health by thinking about these issues throughout the day, he added.

84,2020/01/31,Coronavirus shadow over seafood exports to China,"The dreaded coronavirus (nCoV) has started showing its impact on the seafood trade in the international market. Marine exports to China in which some thousands of people were tested positive have fallen.

Andhra Pradesh is the largest seafood-producing State with 34 % of the total production of 13.92 lakh tonnes, followed by Kerala (12%), Tamil Nadu (11%) and Gujarat (10%). A.P. is producing shrimp in about 51,776 hectares and is making efforts to increase the potential area.

Major consumers of marine products from India are Japan, the U.S., the European Union, China, South East Asia and the Middle East. Products such as frozen shrimp, frozen fin fish, cuttle fish, squid, dried and live items worth more than ₹46,000 crore have been exported through major ports such as Chennai, Kochi, JNP, Visakhapatnam Mumbai, Kakinada, and Krishnapatnam in the last two years.

“China is a major consumer after Japan and the U.S. Exports to China have come down slightly due to the coronavirus,” said an aqua farmer.

“There is huge demand for Indian shrimp and other products in China, but the virus is likely to have an impact on exports and the price of marine products in the international market,” said V. Satyanarayana, a farmer of West Godavari district.

“The impact of coronavirus on seafood exports is minimal. There is no need for farmers or exporters to panic. The demand for shrimp and other varieties remains unchanged at the global level,” Mr. Srinivas said.

“We are exporting shrimp and fish from all major ports across the country. Exporters need not fear the spread of virus as the produce is being exported through containers, and India is not importing any product,” the MPEDA Chairman said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/coronavirus-shadow-overseafood-exports-to-china/article30706245.ece

102,2020/01/31,Andhra Pradesh flags off country’s first ‘fruit train’,"A ‘fruit train’, said to be the first of its kind in the country, was flagged off from Tadipatri Railway Station in Anantapur district on Thursday afternoon, carrying a load of 980 metric tonnes of locally grown bananas to the Jawaharlal Nehru Port in Mumbai, from where the consignment will be exported to Iran.

Container Corporation of India Ltd. (CONCOR) Chief General Manager D. Satyanarayana, A.P. Horticulture Commissioner Chiranjiv Chaudhary, Desai Fruits Venture Founder Ajit Desai and Guntakal Divisional Railway Manager Alok Tiwari formally flagged off the exclusive air-conditioned container rake in the presence of Agriculture Minister Kurasala Kannababu.

“This is the first time in India that an entire train is being sent to the gateway port (JNPT) for export. This helps save both time and fuel as 150 trucks would have been required to send a consignment of this size by road to JNPT, which is over 900 km away, before the temperature-controlled containers are loaded on ships,” Mr. Satyanarayana said.

The Horticulture Commissioner said there was a potential to send 10,000 MT of fruits from Tadipatri after sourcing them from Anantapur and Kadapa districts. The government was targeting exports of 30,000 MT of fruits from all over Andhra Pradesh, and had roped in six major corporate companies to collaborate with the local farmers to enhance the productivity, quality of produce, post-harvest treatment and packing, providing market linkage and ensuring higher prices with a regular increase in income year-on-year.

The bananas are being exported under the brand name ‘Happy Bananas’. Farmers from Putlur region in Anantapur and Pulivendula in Kadapa district are exporting ‘Green Cavendish’ bananas to many international markets.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/bwoice/article30697229.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VJFRUITTRAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/andhra-pradesh-flags-off-countrys-first-fruit-train/article30697230.ece

Mr. Vijaya Sai Reddy said pressing issues such as the Special Category Status to the State, industrial incentives and tax rebates were also raised at the meeting.

Regarding the Bill on the scrapping of the Legislative Council, he said the YSRC parliamentary party would follow it up in Parliament.

His party would stand in support of the minorities and sought a debate on the issue in Parliament.

Mr. Midhun Reddy said the CAA Bill was introduced as an issue related to three other countries and added that the way in which it was introduced and the way it was going to be implemented appeared to be very different.

On the occasion of World Leprosy Day, the Mission for Elimination of Poverty in Municipal Areas took up the drive.

Mr. Imtiaz said that leprosy could be cured if detected at an early stage and awareness on the diseases played a key role in its eradication.

He said the drive was not only aimed at eradicating the disease but also reaching out to the victims and ensure they were not discriminated. Awareness programme ‘Sparsa’ will be organised up to February 13 in the district, he said.

Quoting Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Imtiaz said that leprosy was not a contagious or hereditary disease.

There were proper medicines available to cure the disease and identifying it played a key role and for the same Asha workers had been prepared to carry out awareness activities, he said.

Mr. Lakshminarayana had unsuccessfully contested as JSP candidate from Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha constituency in the 2019 elections.

He stood in the third position in the polls after M.V.V. Satyanarayana (YSR Congress Party) and M. Bharat (TDP) as YSR Congress wave decimated its rivals.

In his resignation letter, Mr. Lakshminarayana said Mr. Kalyan had committed himself to full-time politics and vowed not to act in films again, but he changed his stand and signed up for a movie recently. This showed his (Mr Kalyan’s) lack of stability. He was, therefore, resigning to the party.

Mr. Lakshminarayana said he was thankful to every person who voted for him and the JSP activists for their support to him during his brief stint in the party, which began in March 2019.

106,2020/01/31,Naidu behind attempts to dent brand image of Vizag: Minister,"Taking exception to the criticism that targeted Visakhapatnam’s brand image, Tourism Minister Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao said on Thursday that former Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu seemed to believe in political ends rather than development of the all the three regions of the State.

Referring to the talk about Visakhapatnam being prone to cyclones or sensitive zone, Mr. Srinivasa Rao alleged that it was the scheme of Mr. Naidu to stop Visakhapatnam from becoming the Executive capital.

If the city’s image was tarnished because of political differences, history would not forgive, he said at a press conference here.

Those who had burnt the copies of the reports of the G.N. Rao Committee and Boston Consulting Group (BCG) were now quoting them, he said, and accused Mr. Naidu of being double-tongued while YSRCP was consistent in its stand.

TDP leaders in Visakhapatnam talked about sending a resolution welcoming the Executive capital and those in Kurnool welcomed High Court there, he pointed out.

People of North Andhra and Rayalaseema were not against Amaravati, but want their regions to be developed along with Amaravati. On the other hand, Mr. Naidu confined himself to the villages where the agitation was going on, he said.

Either in the combined State or after its bifurcation, the ‘City of Destiny’ had been the hope because of its natural advantages and cosmopolitan culture, the Minister said.

Land pooling

Referring to the criticism against land pooling, Mr. Srinivasa Rao said it was not aimed at benefiting a few influential people as in the previous regime, but would be implemented in a transparent manner with the participation of those willing.

He said the objective was to provide house-sites to the poor, and the Chief Minister himself was supervising the process.

Problem arose when 1.8 lakh applications for house-sites were received in the city, and there was not sufficient land in Gajuwaka, Bheemunipatnam, Anakapalle and Pendurti.

Similarly, the other important demands also remain unsettled and unresolved. Hence, the UFBU had given the call for agitation programmes.

108,2020/01/31,Gandhi’s non-violence principle followed even today: Governor,"Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan highlighted the way Mahatma Gandhi’s weapon of non-violence that brought India freedom influenced several freedom fighters across the globe and revolutionised how people fight for freedom which is followed even today.

Mr. Harichandan took part in the meeting observing Mahatma Gandhi 72nd death anniversary organised by the Andhra Pradesh Gandhi Smarak Nidhi (APGSN) at Andhra Loyola College on Thursday. The day also marks Martyrs’ Day.

Addressing students, Mr. Harichandan said the magnitude of Gandhiji’s role in social and political reforms was such that his ideals were followed by top leaders across the globe.

“There were many leaders in the freedom movement, but Gandhiji was the topmost who got us freedom by asking the entire nation to come to the streets and fight against the British. The weapon used to fight them was non-violence and the entire world was surprised when Gandhiji talked about it,” he said,

“Mahatma Gandhi asked students to come to the streets and fight against slavery. Then so-called intellectuals asked Gandhiji what will happen to students’ future if the fight on the streets?. Gandhiji replied asking what will be the future of slaves?” Mr. Harichandan said.

Now, several countries worship Gandhiji, we know that Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and others followed Gandhi’s non-violence way to fight against slavery, he added.

“Gandhiji also warned the governments of the adversaries of liquor on society, particularly the poor. He asked them not to see liquor as a source of income and not use such income for education,” he said.

Freedom of speech

“Now the situation has come to a point where people in the name of freedom of speech and expression say whatever they want. They feel compelled to say Bharath Matha Ki Jai because they have the freedom of speech. It is the question of sentiment. By saying Bharath Matha Ki *Jai Gandhiji steered the entire country against the British,” Mr. Harichandan said.

109,2020/01/31,Executive capital in Vizag a disastrous plan: Kanna,"BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana has called the proposed shifting of the administrative capital to Visakhapatnam as a disastrous idea.

The government seemed to have taken the decision keeping other considerations in mind and not on the basis of the G.N. Rao Committee report, Mr. Lakshminarayana said in a letter to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy on Thursday.

He demanded that both the Legislative and Executive capitals be retained in Amaravati.

Mr. Lakshminarayana said the government had apparently set aside the important comments and words of caution by the G.N. Rao Committee on the conditions in Visakhapatnam such as threat of cyclones, decreasing air quality due to industrial pollution, leakages of crude oil in the port area, security threat to the Eastern Naval Command, and non-availability of government land.

He alleged that the State government had suppressed the committee’s observations and comments on the unsuitability of Visakhapatnam as the administrative capital.

Mr. Lakshminarayana expressed regret that the government was going ahead with decentralisation in spite of protests and agitations from all sections of people, political parties and several civil society organisations.

The BJP had been demanding decentralisation of development and not administration, which would be highly inconvenient to the people of the State.

‘Huge burden’

Also, the whole idea would impose a huge financial burden on the already debt-trapped State, he said.

The government should respect the opinion of the people and the political parties, and give up its “ill-conceived proposal’ to have three capitals on the pretext of decentralisation, he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/executive-capital-in-vizag-a-disastrous-plan-kanna/article30696347.ece

In its recent meeting, the Commission underscored the need to create awareness among children on ‘punishment if found to be guilty of committing offences against women.’

Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Commission Chairman and former Judge R. Kantha Rao said that crime against women continuing despite many Acts and laws, including Nirbhaya.

Crime against women

The Commission, therefore, felt the need to include chapters on laws and punishment relating to crime against women, in the curriculum. In addition, moral lessons and Indian culture need to be taught in schools, he said.

Referring to the corruption, former Judge said the child might be bright and meritorious during his or her school and college days. Soon after securing a job, they tend to become corrupt. The Commission felt that it was necessary to make some changes in the curriculum and include lessons on honesty and integrity. The students need to be taught about the fruits of honesty, he said, adding the success stories of honest officers and leaders can be included in the syllabi.

Inspections

Stating that there was a shortage of staff, Kantha Rao said they would ask the government to spare at least 20 non-teaching staff from the Education Department to the Commission. Members of the Commission and the non-teaching staff such as MEOs and DEOs would conduct inspections in schools. About 200 schools would be selected randomly across the State and the inspections would be completed by March.

The Commission was contemplating categorising the schools based on facilities, salaries being paid to teachers and staff, city/town/village etc., for fixing the fee. The schools would be asked to upload the information on the portal. The Commission would randomly check the details provided by the schools. Stringent action would be taken on schools furnishing inaccurate and false data, he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/take-steps-to-inculcate-moralvalues-in-schoolchildren-panel/article30696319.ece

“There is the possibility of it happening. If the government makes such an announcement, LIC employees will go on a flash strike,” AIIEA national president Amanullah Khan and vice-president K. Venugopal told reporters on Thursday.

Speaking on the resolutions adopted at the three-day conference that ended at AU Convention Centre, they said 84% employees of LIC are members of AIIEA.

Mr. Khan said that LIC enjoyed a 72% market share in terms of premium collection with 1.15 lakh employees, and the four public sector general insurance have an employee strength of 60,000 with close to 50% market share. He said AIIEA was in favour of maintaining the status quo for LIC and amalgamation of four public sector GI companies.

However, he pointed out that there was an attempt to merge only three GI firms leaving New India to continue as an independent entity as its financial position was better than the other three companies. He said that they would not oppose the decision if all the four were to be merged.

Inheritance tax

Commenting on the Union Budget to be submitted on February 1, Mr. Khan said that the government should introduce inheritance tax as a separate category in addition to discounts allowed for savings made up to ₹1.5 lakh under 80C of the Income Tax Act. He said as LIC funds were being used for developmental purpose, the government should encourage investment in LIC and exempt 18% GST in insurance premium.

On raising revenues, he said that the government should introduce 0.5% inheritance tax on properties which go to the legal heir of parents. The government should encourage investments in policies as the amounts collected from them were spent mostly on health and education.

Mr. Khan said that they are opposed to the move to increase FDI in insurance sector from 49% to 74%.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/r1vc3k/article30699445.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31VZ3LIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lic-staff-warn-flash-strike-if-centre-decides-to-list-it/article30696185.ece

115,2020/01/31,CBI probe sought into Hathiramji Mutt affairs,"The sacking of Mahant Arjun Das by the State Government has brought several mutts and religious institutions in Tirupati under the scanner.

Given Tirupati’s significance, there are several mutts and religious institutions in the city. However, the Hathiramji Mutt enjoyed a great deal of prestige as it used to maintain the Sri Venkateswara temple atop Tirumala till the formation of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in 1933. There were occassional reports of financial impropriety and nepotism at the mutt over the years, with the government choosing to wield the stick this time.

Meanwhile, the sacking of the Mahant has raised dust in political circles. Congress leader P. Naveen Kumar Reddy has alleged foul play in the matter. “By virtue of once being a controlling authority of the Lord’s coffers, the Mutt would have housed rich jewels and priceless ornaments offered by various kings and governments, including Sri Krishna Devaraya, over the years. The government should get the Mutt’s lockers opened in the presence of the Collector, as it involves not just ornaments worth thousands of crores of rupees, but also the temple’s honour,” Mr. Naveen told the media on Thursday.

Mr. Naveen sought a CBI probe into the affairs of the mutt. Citing the example of the Sri Ananta Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram which was found to house antique treasures worth billions of dollars, Mr. Naveen said there was a possibility that the centuries-old Hathiramji Mutt also has a similar vault.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cbi-probe-sought-into-hathiramji-mutt-affairs/article30696144.ece

“On the whole, we expect a reduction in taxes and an increase in spending,” RHI Clasil director and former chairman of CII’s A.P. chapter R.V.S. Rudra Raju told The Hindu.

Symbiosys Technologies CEO Naresh Kumar said that he is expecting a cut in taxes on the personal taxation front, additional incentives to boost exports, additional spending by the government on infrastructure projects for money circulation in economy and a growth in job creation.

“More incentives for green power are needed. Focus should be on doubling farm income by outlining specific steps with timelines, simplification of paperwork and compliance procedures for MSMEs,” Mr. Naresh Kumar said, calling for a special emphasis on dispute resolution mechanisms.

“The measures announced by the government to arrest the downslide in growth and improve sentiments have given rise to expectations that the forthcoming Union Budget will provide a strong directional policy focus and address some of the concerns,” Sravan Shipping Services managing director G. Sambasiva Rao said.

Mr. Sambasiva Rao said that he is also expecting the proposed National Logistics Policy (NLP) to promote seamless movement of goods across the country by reducing the high transaction costs of traders, and provide impetus to trade, enhance export competitiveness and improve India’s ranking in logistics performance.

More liquidity

Startup mentor and serial investor Vipul Agarwal said, “Given the current market scenario, there is an urgent need for policies and initiatives that can bring liquidity to the market and to the masses. This can help businesses to create better job opportunities and eventually help leverage the talent pool.”

Nikesh Patadia, finance consultant and director (foreign investments) at Business Bug India, said that it is important to boost consumption. “In the current scenario, with the declining GDP growth rate, it is important for the budget to introduce measures that will boost consumption and thus drive growth. While it is predicted that the government is likely to modify the individual income tax rate for salaried personnel, creating a scenario that boosts ease of doing business for SMEs and startups is equally important,” Mr. Patadia said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/entrepreneurs-pin-high-hopes-on-union-budget/article30696139.ece

119,2020/01/31,Allocate funds to tackle elephant menace: JD(S) State president,"JD(S) State president H.K. Kumaraswamy has demanded that the Union government allocate funds to tackle the elephant menace in Hassan in its budget presentation on Saturday.

Speaking to presspersons here on Friday, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the people of Alur and Sakleshpur taluks have been suffering because of the menace and many have lost their lives and vast tracts of land damaged because of frequent pachyderm movement. The State government had submitted a proposal for an elephant corridor for ₹272 crore to the Centre about six years ago. The people of both taluks have been demanding a permanent solution to the problem for the past decade. However, there has been no relief still, he said.

Besides this, Mr. Kumaraswamy said, coffee growers have been facing many problems. Both the elephant menace and heavy rains that lashed these taluks last year impacted production, and the price of coffee beans has fallen. “The Centre should consider the demands of the coffee-growing community and announce a support price for coffee,” he said.

Mr. Kumaraswamy, who is also MLA of Sakleshpur, said the Centre had not responded positively to a proposal on a railway line connecting Hassan and Sringeri via Belur. The railway station in Alur has not been utilised despite having staff, he said. The Railway Ministry should take note of the projects required to improve its services in Karnataka, he opined.

He also criticised the Union government over the economic slowdown and the increasing rate of unemployment. “Youngsters are apprehensive about their future as the government has failed to create the jobs that it had promised. More than 90,000 employees of BSNL had applied for voluntary retirement, and that alone shows how bad the administration has been,” he said.

To a question, Mr. Kumaraswamy said the government should not ban organisations such as the Popular Front of India in a hurry.

120,2020/01/31,"Child’s statement led to the arrest of her mother, teacher in Bidar sedition case","A day after the arrest of two women in connection with the sedition case slapped against Shaheen School in Bidar, it has emerged that the confession of the girl student who was part of the play prompted the police to arrest her mother and the teacher.

On Thursday evening, the police arrested the mother of the girl student who played a role in the controversial play and allegedly delivered lines insulting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Fareeda Begum, the woman teacher who was involved in the staging of the play. According to school authorities and relatives of the child, the police arrived in the school at about 4 p.m. on Thursday and began interrogating the staff and students.

During the interrogation, police officers asked the child as to who taught her the specific dialogues that were “insulting” to the Prime Minister. The child is said to have pointed to her mother, prompting the police to question the mother and arrest her. The mother, in her response, stated that she did not specifically teach the dialogues. However, the police arrested her.

Bail petition

Meanwhile, anticipatory bail petitions of the five other accused — Allauddin, Abudl Qadir, and three others from the Shaeen School management — were admitted by the court.

Keshava Rao, defense counsel, told The Hindu that the interim bail pleas would be moved for the arrested accused on Saturday after obtaining certified copies of the order on their remand.

The case was filed last Sunday following a complaint lodged by Neelesh Rakshyala, an activist, based on a video clip of the play staged by schoolchildren as part of the annual day celebrations held on January 21. The play was on the theme of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. Some of the characters were heard opposing the NRC by asserting that they would not show the documents to prove their citizenship.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/childs-statement-led-to-the-arrest-of-her-mother-teacher-in-bidar-sedition-case/article30706458.ece

At a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) event here on Friday, he said, “We are keen to make ease of doing business a reality and we would to gather feedback and suggestions from the industry on their experience with Karnataka.”

Job creation challenge

Terming job creation as the single greatest challenge facing the nation today, Mr. Bhaskar called on the CII to work closely with the State to boost the MSME (micro, small and medium enterprises) sector as it was the real job creator.

According to him, at the recently concluded World Economic Forum in Davos, a high-powered State delegation led by the Chief Minister met over 40 senior heads of multinationals, all of whom showed keen interest in investing in Karnataka.

“We will work closely with the CII for the Global Investors Meet to be held in November to attract more investors to Karnataka,” he said.

122,2020/01/31,Will Yediyurappa’s Ministry expansion exercise follow 10+3 formula?,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, armed with BJP central leadership’s clearance to expand his Cabinet, is said to be keen on inducting 13 Ministers — 10 likely from among those party-hoppers who won in the recent byelections and three old-timers.

Presently, there are 16 vacancies in the Cabinet, of which 13 will be filled, sources said. The expansion is likely to happen on Sunday or Monday.

Amid speculation that some Ministers may be dropped from the Cabinet, sources in the party said it was unlikely immediately. “The Chief Minister clearly said expansion and not reshuffle. He is unlikely to drop any Ministers. Even after accommodating 13 new Ministers, there will be berths vacant and there is no need for dropping anyone,” a senior Minister said.

Who from Belagavi?

Of the 11 party-hoppers who won in the recent bypolls, only 10 are likely to be inducted. Sources in the party speculated that Mahesh Kumathalli, a key aide of Ramesh Jarkiholi and Athani MLA, may be the one to be left out.

Laxman Savadi, who is also from Athani, is already Deputy Chief Minister and the party is not keen on another Minister from the same constituency. The Chief Minister has been tasked with pacifying Mr. Kumathalli and his mentor Mr. Jarkiholi, sources said. Mr. Kumathalli is likely to be given the charge of a key corporation, sources add.

Interestingly, Mr. Yediyurappa, during his recent visit to Belagavi, had said all the three MLAs who had won the bypolls from the district would be made Ministers. Mr. Jarkiholi on Friday said, “All 11 of us who have won the recent bypolls will be made Ministers. We will request that those who were defeated too to be made Ministers, but the decision is left to the high command.”

Meanwhile, sources in the party said there was no clarity yet on the three other leaders from the party to be inducted into the Cabinet. Multiple sources in the party said Umesh Katti was almost certain to make the cut. The Chief Minister had also said so during his recent Belagavi trip. There is intense lobbying for the two other berths among Aravind Limbavali from Mahadevapura, Bengaluru, S. Angara from Sullia, Halappa Achar from Yelburga, and S.A. Ramdas from Mysuru district. While the Chief Minister is said to be keen on inducting Mr. Limbavali and Mr. Angara, the other faction in the party has reportedly propped up Mr. Achar, who led the recent membership drive of the party in the State.

Mr. Yediyurappa, after his meeting with BJP central leadership, told reporters in Delhi on Friday that he would hold meetings with aspirants in Bengaluru on Saturday and take everyone into confidence before the expansion.

Son by his side

The Chief Minister, during his talks with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J.P. Nadda, was accompanied by his son B.Y. Vijayendra and not by any of his Cabinet colleagues.

124,2020/01/31,"Processes of exports, imports at KIA have improved vastly: Economic Survey","Although processes at sea ports remained largely “inefficient” in the country, the processes of export and import of goods at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) has dramatically improved for authorised economic operators (AEOs), according to the Economic Survey tabled in Parliament by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday.

Quoting a case study of an electronics company based in Bengaluru, which is currently AEO-T2 certified, the Economic Survey in its sixth chapter ‘Targeting Ease of Doing Business in India’ stated that the business environment had changed for some segments after the implementation of the AEO policy in 2016 and compared the time taken for exporting electronics from Bengaluru to Hong Kong, with and without AEO registration.

An AEO is a party involved in import and export of goods and approved by the Customs administration.

“Once the shipment is ready at the factory in Bengaluru, it takes three hours to transport it to the KIA. At the airport, it takes one hour to enter the exports terminal. So far, there is no difference between an AEO and a non-AEO. However, total time spent at the airport for Customs and examination process is just two hours for AEO-T2 operators. Non-AEO operators take six hours,” it stated.

In fact, after AEO implementation, the total time spent in India (six hours) is less than that spent in Hong Kong (seven hours). “This shows, with the help of right policies, India can achieve international standards, or even better them,” the survey stated.

The process flow was also studied in reverse and compared with the time taken in importing electronics from China to Bengaluru, with and without AEO. The number of hours taken for a consignment to reach the warehouse in Bengaluru is much less for an AEO when compared with a non-AEO, it stated.

The case study suggested that the processes in Indian airports was vastly superior to those at sea ports for both imports and exports; and AEO did significantly improve the process but it is reasonably smooth even for non-AEO operators importing/ exporting electronics, the Economic Survey stated.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/3fg9m5/article30706366.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGKEMPEGOWDAINTERNATIONALAIRPORT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/processes-of-exports-imports-at-kia-have-improved-vastly-economic-survey/article30706367.ece
125,2020/01/31,Prajwal Revanna gets relief from legal battle against his election,"Hassan Lok Sabha member Prajwal Revanna got a relief from the legal battle against his election with the High Court of Karnataka on Friday dismissing another petition on technical grounds that the petitioner had not complied with a mandatory procedure prescribed in law while filing the petition challenging the legality of election of a returned candidate.

Justice John Michael Cunha passed the order while allowing Mr. Prajwal’s application for dismissal of the petition filed by G. Devaraje Gowda, a voter from Hassan.

The court found that the petitioner had failed to comply with the Section 81(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 as the petitioner had not attested annexures appended to the petition. The court said non-attested annexure cannot be relied upon by the court while framing issues and hence cannot proceed further as Section 86 mandates that the court dismiss a petition that does not comply with the provisions of the Section 81 of the Act.

Though the petitioner had rectified the omissions after filing the petition, the court found that the mandatory procedures were required to be rectified within 45 days from the date of election of the returned candidate. The petition cannot be considered to be filed as per Section 81(3) of the Act as the defects were not rectified within 45 days, the deadline fixed in Section 81 of the Act for filling petition challenging election of a returned candidate, and in this case, the defects were rectified after 45 days, the court observed.

Section 81(3) of the Act states that every election petition shall be accompanied by as many copies thereof as there are respondents mentioned in the petition, and every such copy shall be attested by the petitioner under his own signature to be a true copy of the petition.

With this order, two petitions questioning Mr. Prajwal’s election on various grounds, including allegation of indulging in corrupt practices and non-disclosure of information in his nomination paper, were put to rest on technical grounds.

Another petition, filed by defeated candidate A. Manju was dismissed by the court on January 17 as he had not filed the mandatory affidavit in the prescribed format enumerating the instances of corrupt practices that he had alleged that Mr. Prajwal committed during the election process.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mkv6y8/article30706349.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGPRAJWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/prajwal-revanna-gets-relief-from-legal-battle-against-his-election/article30706350.ece
126,2020/01/31,Toddler falls off moving van in Agumbe Ghat,"A three-year-old child, who fell off a moving van in one of the hairpin curves of Agumbe Ghat Road on Thursday night, was rescued and handed back to her parents, thanks to an advocate who found the child in time.

Anwi, daughter of Binu who runs a hotel at Kottigehara in Chikkamagaluru district, escaped unhurt. The family had visited Kerala and the incident took place when they were returning to their native place via Agumbe Ghat.

The police said that when the vehicle reached the seventh hairpin curve at 8.30 p.m., the back door unlocked owing to a technical problem in the sensor system and the child slipped down. The parents were asleep and did not realise.

The child was found standing and weeping on the roadside by Vinay, an advocate who was heading towards Udupi from Tirthahalli. He took the child in his car and handed her over to the Agumbe police station. The personnel there took care of the child until the family could be traced.

Around 9.30 p.m., the family realised that Anwi was not in the vehicle. They then returned to Agumbe. The personnel at the check-post of the Department of Forest and Wildlife informed them that the child was at Agumbe police station. After receiving a written undertaking from the parents regarding the incident, the police handed over the child to them.

As Agumbe Ghat Road is part of Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary that is frequented by predatory animals, including leopards, at night, local residents have said that it was a miraculous escape for the child.

In a similar incident in Kerala last year, a one-year-old baby had a miraculous escape after she accidentally fell off a moving vehicle in a dense forest area.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/toddler-falls-off-moving-van-in-agumbe-ghat/article30705983.ece
127,2020/01/31,85th sahitya sammelana sees surge in registrations,"The 85th Kannada Sahitya Sammelana in Kalaburagi from February 5 to 7 has so far seen 21,130 delegate registrations, a sharp increase from 13,500 in Dharwad last year.

As many as 13,000 delegates had registered for the 83rd sammelana in Mysuru and 12,500 for the 82nd sammelana in Raichur, indicating a steady increase in the interest to participate in the annual event.

Veerabhadra Simpi, president of the district unit of Kannada Sahitya Parishat, told The Hindu that considering the non-registered participants, local people and students, the actual number of people taking part in the literary event could reach 40,000, excluding around 2,000 VIPs and special guests, artistes, and speakers.

This would mean a tough crowd management challenge to the district administration, particularly in critical areas such as providing food and accommodation.

Sub-committees formed

Deputy Commissioner Sharat B. has formed 15 sub-committees with people’s representatives, civil servants and civil society organisations and entrusted them with specific responsibilities such as accommodation, food, publicity, guest management, stage management, and so on. He himself is chairing meetings with the sub-committees.

Priyank Kharge, MLA for Chittapur and former Minister who heads the accommodation and transport committee, said: “We are trying our best to ensure that all the registered delegates and VIPs get proper accommodation. All hotel rooms in the city would be taken over by the Deputy Commissioner for accommodating the VIPs and special guests. The delegates would be put up in government hostels. The artists who are normally in groups would be put up in wedding halls. We have also requested NEKRTC to run additional services between the major points and the venue for free. Autorickshaw operators are asked to be reasonable in charging the fare.”

A 34-acre space on the campus of Gulbarga University on the outskirts of Kalaburagi city has been designated for the event.

Three venues

The event would be conducted in three venues — the main venue where the important events, including the inaugural and valedictory functions, would be held and two parallel venues where the literary deliberations would be held.

A huge pandal being erected for accommodating over 30,000 people would serve as the main venue and the Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Auditorium and Mahatma Gandhi Auditorium located on the Gulbarga University campus would serve as parallel venues. An open auditorium is also being erected for cultural performances. As many as 556 stalls are being built, of which 379 are for books.

Funds awaited

The total expenditure of the Kannada Sahitya Sammelan is estimated at around ₹14 crore and a proposal has already been sent to the government. However, the government has not yet released any amount. The organisers are hopeful that they would get at least ₹10 crore from the government.

“Food committee alone estimated a requirement of around ₹5 crore for providing five lakh meals for three days. We are currently managing with the money we got from the registrations of delegates and contributions from local people. I’m hopeful that the government would release the funds shortly,” Deputy Commissioner Sharat B. said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/jjjs8t/article30705966.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BGSAMMELAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/85th-sahitya-sammelana-sees-surge-in-registrations/article30705967.ece

129,2020/01/31,Two given IV fluids after health declines during hunger strike,"As the indefinite hunger strike by farmers entered the third day on Friday, the health condition of two protesters deteriorated forcing doctors to give them intravenous (IV) fluids at the protest venue.

Under the aegis of the Raitha Sena Karnataka, the farmers, led by Veeresh Sobaradmath Swami, have begun the indefinite fast seeking the fulfilment of various demands pertaining to farmers.

The main demands are scientific price for nine crops, procurement centres round-the-year, apart from additional support price to the MSP announced by the Centre by the State government.

The farmers, who had launched the indefinite protest from Monday, converted it into a indefinite hunger strike from Wednesday after the State government failed to respond positively to their demands.

The district administration has deployed an ambulance at the protest venue and a team of doctors is regularly monitoring the health condition of the farmers.

On Friday, as the the health condition of Basavaraj Lakkannavar and Ravigouda Patil deteriorated, the doctors advised them to get admitted to the hospital. But as they refused to discontinue their hunger strike, they were administered IV fluids at the site itself.

The doctors said their health condition was stable.

Meanwhile, Veeresh Sobaradmath Swami has sought the help of the district administration to get an appointment for the farmers to meet Vice-President, M. Venkaiah Naidu who is visiting Hubballi on Saturday.

He told reporters that he had requested Deputy Commissioner of Dharwad Deepa Cholan to help them meet Mr. Naidu as he would be on a two-day visit to Hubballi.

133,2020/01/31,Vijayapura women make their own mini Shaheen Bagh,"Inspired by the women of New Delhi who have been protesting at Shaheen Bagh, hundreds of women of Vijayapura city have made their own mini Shaheen Bagh at the garden of the historic Asar Mahal.

Holding a protest for about a fortnight now, hundreds of women gather under the tamarind tree daily for over six hours to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

“When lakhs of women are staging a peaceful protest across the country, it becomes our moral responsibility to extend our solidarity with them. At the same time, being a citizen of India, it is also our right to protest against any decision which is against the Constitution,” said Habiba Mulla, a class 9student.

Ms. Habiba has been participating in the protest for over 10 days now. “The Constitution makes it clear that religion cannot become the base for giving citizenship to anybody. The CAA is formulated in violation of this basic principal,” she said.

Countering the allegations that women from minorities are opposing the Act only because they are against the BJP, Ms. Habiba said that they are protesting to protect the Constitution and not oppose the BJP.

“Creating this narrative that opposing the government policy is equal to opposing the country, is grossly wrong and misleading. When the people have the right to vote for any party to form the government, the same citizens also have the right to oppose any move which is against the citizens or against the Constitution,” she said.

Sufiya Wati, 65, who is also one of the protestors, said that they have been holding a peaceful protest without even raising slogans against anybody.

Nusrat Kazi, 27, who is coming to the place with her four-month-old son, says that her husband and in-laws are supporting her.

“Without the support of the family members, it is not possible to venture out everyday for over six hours for a protest. Our family members too have realized the importance of agitation, therefore, they are supporting us in the protest,” Ms. Kazi said.

When asked how long they would continue the protest, they answered unanimously: “Till CAA is withdrawn”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vijayapura-women-make-their-own-mini-shaheen-bagh/article30704298.ece
134,2020/01/31,BJP MLA raises pitch for Cabinet Berth for all defectors,"As Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa camps in Delhi for discussions with the BJP leadership on Cabinet expansion, a key leader among the 11 disqualified Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) MLAs who won bypolls on the ruling Party ticket on January 31 made it clear all of them should be made Ministers.

Gokak legislator Ramesh Jarkiholi, who had played a key role in bringing down the Congress-JDS coalition government paving the way for the BJP to come to power in July last year, also demanded Cabinet Berth for two other defectors, who lost in the bypolls held in December.

The former Congress leader, however, added the final call will be taken by the Party’s Central leadership.

“All the eleven should be given Minister post, we continue to stress on it. Regarding those who lost, it will not be decided today, but we urge that they should also be given,” Mr. Jarkiholi said replying to a question from reporters here.

“Our demand is that all eleven of us should be made Ministers, as we have sacrificed by resigning as MLAs and have taken risk. Those lost should also be made Ministers, but we leave it to the high command,” he said.

Mr. Jarkiholi said BJP was not behind their resignation as legislators from Congress-JD(S) and the J.P. Nadda-led Party were treating them well.

Shortly after Mr. Jarkiholi’s media interaction, Yediyurappa got the green signal for the Cabinet expansion from the Central BJP leadership.

Except for one or two, most of the disqualified JDS- Congress MLAs who got re-elected in the bypolls on BJP tickets will be made Ministers, he said, adding there won’t be any additional Deputy Chief Ministers.

In all 17 Congress and JD(S) legislators were disqualified by the Assembly Speaker last year after they revolted against the coalition government leading to its fall on July 13.

Of them, as many as 13 had contested the bypolls held for 15 Assembly Seats and barring A.H. Vishwanath (Hunsur) and M.T.B Nagaraj (Hoskote) all others emerged triumphant as the BJP candidates.

Though Yediyurappa has made it clear that 11 who got re-elected in the bypolls on the BJP ticket will be made Ministers, according to sources, the Central leadership is not keen on inducting all of them and wants to give opportunity to Party loyalists also.

Vishwanath and Nagaraj have been openly demanding Cabinet Berth for them stating that Yediyurappa had given a word to them.

Currently there are 18 Ministers, including the Chief Minister in the Cabinet that has a sanctioned strength of 34.

Sixteen Berths are still vacant.

The Cabinet expansion will not be an easy task for the Chief Minister as he will have to strike a balance by accommodating the victorious disqualified legislators as promised and also make place for the old guard, upset at being “neglected” in the first round of the induction exercise.

He also has to give adequate representation to various castes and regions in his Cabinet and also deal with allocation of key portfolios.

Responding to a question about the delay in the Ministry expansion, Mr. Jarkiholi said, “let it be, even if it is delayed for a month, we are ready to wait. May be you (media) are upset.”

He said they had not put any condition or given any deadline while joining the BJP. “I request the media don’t [not to] spread false news,” he added.

Also making it clear that he had never staked claim for Deputy Chief Minister post, Mr. Jarkiholi termed it as media creation.

“I’m making it clear I have never asked for it. We will abide by high command decision and give full cooperation. We will move ahead under the Chief Ministership of Yediyurappa,” he added.

Yediyurappa, who already has three deputies, had recently ruled out creation of any more Deputy Chief Minister’s post.

135,2020/01/31,"Karnataka CM gets approval for Cabinet expansion, may induct 11 Ministers","Karnataka Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Friday got the green signal from the BJP Central leadership for the much-awaited Cabinet expansion in the State and he is mostly likely to induct 11 Ministers.

Yediyurappa said the date of swearing-in will be decided in a day or two, although he indicated that it would most likely be held on February 3.

Currently, there are 18 Ministers, including the Chief Minister, in the Cabinet that has a sanctioned strength of 34. Sixteen Berths are vacant.

“Many of our suggestions have been accepted by Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP national president J P Nadda. If there are differences, we will discuss in Bengaluru and finalise it,” Yediyurappa told reporters after meeting Mr. Shah in the Parliament Complex in New Delhi.

Except for one or two, most of the disqualified JDS-Congress MLAs who got re-elected in the bypolls on BJP tickets will be made Ministers, he said, adding there won’t be any additional Deputy Chief Ministers.

However, sources said, a total of 11 Ministers would be inducted into the Cabinet.

“We discussed yesterday and now also. Mr. Shah has agreed to almost everything,” Yediyurappa said, adding he is returning back “happy” after getting the nod for the Cabinet expansion.

“I am going happy,” he said.

Yediyurappa had been anxiously waiting for the Party high command’s approval to expand his Ministry amid intense lobbying by the aspirants.

136,2020/01/31,Two women arrested in Bidar sedition case,"The Bidar police on Thursday arrested Anuja Minsa, mother of a girl student who played a role in a controversial play in a private school and allegedly delivered dialogues “insulting” Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Fareeda Begum, the woman teacher who was involved in the staging of the play.

As per school sources, the police came to the institution in the evening and interrogated the staff and children for a couple of hours before taking the women with them. The police said the accused would be produced before the magistrate on Thursday night itself.Following a complaint by Neelesh Rakshyala and based on the video clip that went viral, the New Town police had booked a sedition case.

The play, staged by primary students on the school campus on January 21, allegedly “showed Mr. Modi in a bad light”. Neelesh Rakshyal, a social worker, lodged a complaint against the school president and others for attempting to “tarnish the Prime Minister’s image” and against a man named Mohammad Yusuf Raheem for uploading a video clip of the performance on social media.

The institute has been booked under Sections 504, 505(2), 124A, 153A, and 34 of the IPC. In his complaint, Mr. Rakshyal claimed that the dialogue in the play was against CAA and NRC and even “abused” Mr. Modi for implementing the Act.

Institute chairman Abdul Khadeer told The Hindu that there was no room for anti-social activities on campus. He said the teachers had not inquired about the theme and details of the play that was being enacted. He added that action would be taken against the teachers for their “negligence”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/two-women-arrested-in-bidar-sedition-case/article30697246.ece
137,2020/01/31,Loan recovery agent shot at over EMI row in Karnataka,"A 30-year-old man was shot on his chest by a businessman’s family member when a group of loan recovery agents came to seize a high-end motorcycle bought on a bank loan.

The incident occurred outside a residential apartment at Hennur in Bengaluru on Wednesday night.

The victim, Syed Saleem, was taken to a private hospital and he is in the ICU, police said.

₹18 lakh loan

The accused have been identified as Amarinder, who opened fire with a licensed pistol, and Mayuresh, who had taken the loan.

“Both the accused are businessmen. Mayuresh had taken a loan of ₹18 lakh from a bank to buy the motorcycle. He was paying his EMIs regularly, but the cheque he issued this month bounced due to insufficient funds. The bank then engaged one Syed Farhad to recover the money,” the police said.

More time sought

When Mr. Farhad called him up asking for the EMI amount, Mayuresh asked for more time.

The agent threatened to come to his house and seize the motorcycle.

“Enraged, the accused dared him to come and take the bike. On Wednesday night, Mr. Farhad along with his brother-in-law Syed Saleem and two others reached the apartment near Hennur junction and asked Mayuresh to come out,” said a senior police officer.

Mayuresh, accompanied by Amarinder and other relatives, confronted the group. Amarinder opened two rounds of fire with his licensed pistol, and fired at the group when they tried to stop him. Mr. Saleem was hit on the chest. Residents heard the commotion and alerted the police.

Charged under Arms Act

Both Mayuresh and Amarinder were arrested and charged under the Arms Act and for attempt to murder. The police also arrested Mr. Farhad for rioting.

“They have been remanded in judicial custody.

139,2020/01/31,Most former Ministers lose security cover,"The State government on Thursday withdrew security cover for leaders who were Ministers in the erstwhile Janata Dal (Secular)–Congress coalition government and the earlier Congress government based on threat perception.

The Z category security with a pilot provided for the former Home Ministers G. Parameshwara and the former Home Minister M.B Patil has been withdrawn. The other former Ministers whose security cover has been withdrawn include H.D. Ravenna, D.K. Shivakumar and K.J. George.

Considering the threat perception, security cover for the former Ministers P.T. Parameshwar was withdrawn except a bodyguard. Similarly, the government decided to extend three bodyguards and two escort staff for the former Minister B.Z. Zameer Ahmed Khan.

The order directed the Bengaluru Police Commissioner to withdraw the security cover and submit a report in this regard. A panel headed by the State intelligence chief, having senior police officials on board, scrutinises the security perception and the level of security cover needed to be provided to each VIP/VVIP.

140,2020/01/31,Manual scavenging: 17 deaths in four years,"The recent deaths of a labourer and a contractor who inhaled toxic fumes while allegedly cleaning a pit at the SBBS Jain Trust in Shivajinagar here has once again highlighted the problem of unchecked manual scavenging.

Data from the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment shows that 17 people lost their lives in incidents related to manual scavenging, including cleaning septic tanks and sewers, in the State between 2016 and 2019. Karnataka recorded nine deaths in 2016, four in 2017, one in 2018, and three deaths in 2019.

“We were aiming that no deaths would occur in such heinous incidents in the State. However, unfortunately, two deaths have occurred this year. Lack of public awareness is one of the causes for it,” said Jagadish Hiremani, member of the National Commission for Safai Karamcharis (NCSK).

He added that an awareness campaign against manual scavenging would be conducted across the State in February. “We will reach out to students and make them pledge not to avail of the services of manual scavengers,” he said.

‘Under-reported’

Activists claim manual scavenging remains under-reported and that the figures do not reflect the extent of the problem. Clifton Rosario, advocate and national secretary of the All-India Central Council of Trade Unions, said any sanitation worker who handles untreated waste and human excreta should be considered a manual scavenger as per law.

A national survey by the NCSK, in a pilot project, has identified 1,721 manual scavengers in six districts for compensation. In Mysuru district alone, 1,226 safai karamcharis were identified.

“A one-time cash assistance of ₹50,000 has already been provided to 956 safai karamcharis. The rest will receive it soon,” Mr. Hiremani said. He added that loans would also be provided to safai karamcharis for self-employment projects.

The NCSK has expanded the pilot project to survey on the prevalence of manual scavenging in the State to five districts — Raichur, Belagavi, Bagalkot, Davangere, and Vijayapura.

Compensation

Yellamma, wife of Muniyanna, 50, one of the two labourers who died after entering a pit to clean it in Shivajinagar, was given a compensation of ₹4.15 lakh by the Social Welfare Department. Mr. Hiremani, said the department would give ₹4.15 lakh more once the charge sheet is filed. He directed the BBMP to award a compensation of ₹10 lakh each to the families of the victims Siddappa and Muniyanna.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s13nkp/article30696511.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30bgSafai-karamchariscol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/manual-scavenging-17-deaths-in-four-years/article30696512.ece

142,2020/01/31,"Citing Savadi case, Vishwanath presses for Cabinet berth","While Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is away in Delhi to hold talks with BJP’s national leadership on Cabinet expansion, the former Minister A.H. Vishwanath stepped up pressure on his inclusion in the Ministry by citing the case of Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi.

In the light of speculation over new entrants to the BJP who lost the Assembly bypolls not getting ministerial berths, Mr. Vishwanath pointed out that Mr. Savadi too had lost the Assembly elections, yet he was included in Ministry.

“When you made Mr. Savadi, who lost the polls, a Deputy Chief Minister, why can’t you make me a Minister?” said Mr. Vishwanath, who lost the bypolls from Hunsur.

Speaking to reporters in Mysuru on Thursday, Mr Vishwanath even referred to the inclusion of late Arun Jaitley in the Union Cabinet after his loss in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls.

Mr. Yediyurappa should include him in the Ministry and make use of his experience, he said and promised to bring a good name to the government.

He also sought to remind Mr. Yediyurappa about the role he had played in his becoming Chief Minister and Mr. Savadi, Deputy Chief Minister.

‘Goal achieved’

He said his goal was to bring down the coalition government and that he had succeeded in it. Contending that he had no regrets about his political actions, Mr. Vishwanath said he had faith in Mr. Yediyurappa. But, added that he would not discuss the issue of ministerial berth with the Chief Minister. He said he would not change his stance even if he was denied a ministerial berth, but Mr. Yediyurappa would have to give an answer for his exclusion.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/citing-savadi-case-vishwanath-presses-for-cabinet-berth/article30696480.ece
143,2020/01/31,Cabinet expansion: Yediyurappa to meet with Shah on Friday to finalise list,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa who is in New Delhi to consult the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) central leadership over Cabinet expansion, said on Thursday night that the list of leaders to be inducted into the Ministry would be finalised at a meeting with Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday morning.

On Thursday night he met both BJP national president J.P. Nadda and Mr. Shah. The two meetings, however, lasted only a few minutes.

After the meeting with Mr. Shah, Mr. Yediyurappa told reporters, “Mr. Shah asked me to meet him around 10 a.m. tomorrow [Friday] to finalise the list. I will meet him tomorrow again.” He did not reply to a question on whether the Cabinet expansion will happen on Friday. Though he had also sought time to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi, that meeting is unlikely to happen, sources said.

The Chief Minister has reportedly given both Mr. Nadda and Mr. Shah a list of MLAs he wants to induct into the Cabinet after dropping at least two Ministers. However, the list is not final and will have to accommodate changes suggested by the party leadership, a senior leader said.

Amid rumours of some of the new entrants to the BJP who got elected from Belagavi district not making it to the Ministry, he announced on Wednesday that all the 11 leaders who won the bypolls would be inducted into the Cabinet. At the same press interaction in Belagavi, he announced that senior MLA Umesh Katti would also be made a Minister, and there would be no new Deputy Chief Minister and the three leaders in the post would continue.

Intense lobbying

This is the first time since the Assembly bypoll results that the Chief Minister has been to Delhi, stating that the trip was to consult the party leadership over the Cabinet expansion. This has set off intense lobbying among ministerial aspirants. Even before the Chief Minister could reach Delhi, three leaders had already reached the national capital to lobby for ministerial berths. Yelburga MLA Halappa Achar, Virajpet MLA K.G. Bopaiah, and C.P. Yogeshwar, who played a key role in wooing MLAs from the Congress and the JD(S), have been camping in Delhi, sources said. The name of Mr. Achar, who led the BJP membership campaign in the State, has suddenly cropped up in the list of ministerial probables.

Senior Lingayat MLA Murugesh Nirani, who was recently recommended for the Ministry by a seer publicly, embarrassing the Chief Minister, met Mr. Yediyurappa at his residence in here on Thursday morning. He reportedly apologised for the seer’s remarks and sought to be inducted into the Cabinet. However, Mr. Yediyurappa reportedly did not give him any assurance.

CM calls on Union Ministers

Ahead of the Union Budget, scheduled to be presented on Saturday, Mr. Yediyurappa met Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday. It was a courtesy call and the duo discussed development issues related to the State, sources in the CMO said.

The Chief Minister also met Union Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan and requested him to drop the proposal of disinvestment in Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel Plant, Bhadravati, and sought capital investment by the Union government to revitalise the industry. The plant is in the Chief Minister’s home district, Shivamogga, which is represented by his son B.Y. Raghavendra in the Lok Sabha.

144,2020/01/31,Milk price up by ₹2 a litre from tomorrow,"From Saturday, the price of Nandini milk will go up by ₹2 a litre. The price of a litre of curd will also increase by ₹2. After nearly a fortnight of talks with the State government, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) on Thursday announced the increase.

KMF chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi defended the hike, calling it inevitable given the increasing input costs for farmers.

The current price of milk ranges from ₹35 to ₹37 a litre in south Karnataka and north Karnataka for regular milk, while the special milk with higher fat content is sold at ₹42 a litre. The current cost of curd is ₹42 a litre.

While the district milk unions, citing rising input costs in milk production, had demanded a hike in the range of ₹2 to ₹4, the KMF had sought the government’s approval for an increase of ₹3 a litre. The government approved an increase of ₹2. According to KMF sources, ₹1 of the additional amount per litre will be passed on to the farmer.

In the last four years, this is the third hike by KMF. After effecting a hike of ₹4 a litre in January 2016, KMF increased the price of milk by ₹2 and ₹1 per litre in South and North Karnataka respectively in April 2017. Currently, a litre of milk costs in the range of ₹35 to ₹37 in the State.

A senior KMF official said: “Despite the increase, the price of Nandini brand of milk will still be far cheaper than the rest. It will be cheaper by a minimum of ₹8 per litre when compared to the price of private milk dairies in the State or in comparison with prevailing milk price in neighbouring States.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/milk-price-up-by-2-a-litre-from-tomorrow/article30696442.ece
145,2020/01/31,‘Digitalisation of 172 public libraries on in State’,"Satish Kumar Hosamani, Director of Public Libraries, said on Thursday that digitalisation of 172 public libraries was on in the State, while 100 public libraries had already been digitalised.

Speaking to presspersons on the sidelines of the inauguration of a digital library at the District Central Library here, Mr. Hosamani said that there were 30 district central libraries, 26 city central libraries, and 176 libraries in taluks, gram panchayats and slum areas. The digitalisation of libraries had been taken up in phases, he said.

The libraries, which were digitalised, were being provided with two desktops, two tabs, and an Internet router. The digitalisation of public libraries had been taken up on November 20, 2019. The intention was to improve the reading habits of people at a time when many are hooked up to social media, he said.

Besides about 17,800 Kannada, English, Tamil and other books, even periodicals, and NCERT, CBSE, ICSE books of classes one to 12 would be available in digital format in the digital libraries, he said.

As many as four desktops and eight tabs would be provided to the Udupi District Central Library. A proposal of ₹1.76 crore had been submitted to provide equipment and other facilities at the central library here, Mr. Hosamani said.

Earlier, G. Jagadeesha, Deputy Commissioner inaugurated the digital library at the District Central Library. Later, inaugurating the Constitution Day and three-day training workshop on library staff on digital libraries, Mr. Jagadeesha said that libraries helped in attaining knowledge.

He had studied the Constitution at a library in Bengaluru, when he was attempting the KAS examinations. Smart phones should be used for gaining knowledge, he said.

K. Raghupati Bhat, MLA, said that Constitution was a holy book for every Indian. People should know about their rights and duties. People should understand the Constitution properly. The Constitution Day celebrations were bigger than the celebrations of other days, he said.

146,2020/01/31,"Caste calculations, faction feuds make selection of KPCC president tough","The State Congress cadre has continued to mount pressure on the party central leadership on the appointment of a new chief for the Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) and not a single day has passed over the last few weeks without statements on the matter by senior leaders.

The selection of the successor to Dinesh Gundu Rao, MLA and former Minister who had resigned from the post after the party’s debacle in the recent Assembly bypolls, has become complicated as the party central leadership and the State Congress have failed to arrive at a consensus over a name. The former KPCC president G. Parameshwara, who was tasked by the leadership to arrive at a consensus, also seems to have failed in this mission.

Further delay

Upset with the lack of unity among the State leaders, it is learnt that the central leadership has decided to temporarily suspend the process, at least for the next two to three weeks. Meanwhile, Mr. Rao appears to have become more active in the last few days and has started coming to the party office here.

Sources said the State Congress leaders expect some clarity on the matter during the budget session of the State legislature which would be commencing on February 17. Central leaders are also busy with the Delhi Legislative Assembly elections, scheduled for February 8, as well as preparing a strategy to put the NDA government on the mat over issues such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, slowdown in the economy, and unemployment, in the upcoming budget session of Parliament.

Which of the 2 castes?

Though a few leaders are aspiring to the posts of KPCC chief and Leader of the Opposition in the Legislative Assembly, the party is apparently split along caste lines on making the final pick — Lingayats and Vokkaligas — and the central leadership is not sure as to from which of the two dominant castes to choose the next KPCC chief.

S.M. Krishna, ex-CM was the last Vokkaliga to head the State Congress 20 years ago (1999–2000). Allum Veerabhadrappa was the last Lingayat to head the KPCC during 2001–03. D.K. Shivakumar, a Vokkaliga, was working president during 2008–10.

The party has been riddled with multiple factions, led by the former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, Mr. Shivakumar, the former Union Minister K.H. Muniyappa, MP B.K. Hariprasad, and Dr. Parameshwara.

Unable to swallow their egos, party sources said, these leaders were pulling the party in different directions and apparently “imposing conditions” on the central leadership on the selection of the State unit president.

This has made some leaders to urge veteran leader M. Mallikarjun Kharge to head the State unit.

‘Original’ vs. ‘migrant’

The delay was also largely owing to the long-standing stand-off between “original” Congressmen and “migrants” in the party. Supporters of Mr. Shivakumar, who has been an aspirant for the post, have been resisting the appointment of Mr. Siddaramaiah’s nominee M.B. Patil, apparently over the former Chief Minister’s alleged dictatorial style of functioning and the way dissent is being snubbed within the organisation.

The “original” Congressmen believe that “migrant” Mr. Siddaramaiah’s dominance would once again prevail in the party affairs if Mr. Patil becomes the State unit president. Party sources said Mr. Siddaramaiah has been opposing Mr. Shivakumar’s candidature believing that a large chunk of Vokkaligas have been rallying behind H.D. Deve Gowda’s Janata Dal (Secular) and the party would benefit little from a Vokkaliga leader’s appointment.

Sharp differences

Sharp differences have surfaced among party leaders not only on the appointment of a new chief, but also on the proposal to appoint a number of working presidents, and two leaders for the posts of the Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and the Congress Legislature Party leader.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/j7oa3g/article30696251.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGDGR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/caste-calculations-faction-feuds-make-selection-of-kpcc-president-tough/article30696252.ece
147,2020/01/31,SHSR may not figure in Union Budget,"The ₹66,079-crore 531.45-km semi-high speed rail corridor (SHSR) from Kochuveli to Kasaragod is unlikely to figure in the 2020-2021 Union Budget. The provision of fund towards equity of the government is also unlikely.

The corridor, named Silver Line, could not be included in the budget as the detailed project report (DPR) has not been completed and the mandatory Central approval not got, official sources say. The project will be executed on a cost-sharing basis by Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd. (KRDCL), the joint venture company between the State and Railways.

Funding

Close on the heels of the steps initiated to secure funds from international funding agencies such as German Bank, Asian Infra Investment Bank and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the State has sought permission from the Centre to take loan. The request to take external funding tops the half-a-dozen prioritised items of the State submitted to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The Centre and the Department of Economic Affairs have a key role in providing loan from these international funding agencies.

Though Railways have sought ₹500 crore for completing the doubling work through Kottayam and to Kanyakumary from Thiruvananthapuram Central and Nemom coaching terminal, it is to be seen how much allocation is provided.

Funds are likely to be allocated for completing the doubling work and improving passenger facilities. The Palakkad Coach Factory, upgrade of eight stations into world-class, and the Angamaly-Sabarimala line will continue to be confined to paper.

Kozhikode has the maximum number of people under surveillance at 214. There are 125 patients under surveillance in Thrissur.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja asked private hospitals to report cases of suspected infection to the control room or the Health Department without delay.

In case of infection, patients should be shifted to isolation wards and body fluid samples sent for test. In emergency situations, patients could be shifted to the Government Medical College Hospital (MCH), Thrissur.

She said Thrissur was prepared to face the challenge of the infection. In all, 11 persons had reached Thrissur from China and nine of them were in isolation wards at the MCH and the rest under home surveillance.

An entire building with 20 rooms had been set up as isolation section at the Thrissur MCH.

For 28 days

Ms. Shylaja urged the people who arrived from China to report voluntarily at the Health Department. They should strictly remain under home quarantine for 28 days and avoid public places and functions.

There should be no close contact with other family members too.

“People should take the instructions for house quarantine seriously. They may not exhibit symptoms of the infection but we need to take precautionary measures. Coronavirus has an incubation period of 28 days.”

She said volunteers had been deployed for supporting people under quarantine. Health workers would visit them. The department had arranged special vehicles for people under house quarantine to reach hospitals.

“At present, body fluid samples are being sent to the National Virology Institute, Pune. It is taking two days for getting the results. We have sent a request to make arrangements for testing the samples at the Virology Institute, Alappuzha,” the Minister said.

Health staff ready

149,2020/01/31,State customises nCoV guidelines,"Travellers from countries where novel coronavirus infection has been reported have to follow a set of guidelines framed by health authorities.

Amar S. Fettle, State nodal officer for H1N1, told The Hindu on Friday that the State had evolved a customised guideline that had been put on the website of the Directorate of Health Services dhs.kerala.gov.in.

“The outbreak is at the global level, hence, it will be modified accordingly,” said Dr. Fettle.

Certain steps of the protocol may change as and when a situation arises, hence it is important that the public contact the 24x7 Health Department helpline Disha at 0471 2552056 or the toll-free number 1056 for any information or help, he said.

Regarding the treatment, there is no specific drug as such. Management of the disease includes supportive measures to ensure that the patient’s health is controlled in case of other bacterial co-infections or other multi-organ problems.

Efforts are on to trace the people who may have come in contact with the confirmed infection reported from the State.

Besides, the department is also checking the itinerary of tourists who had come here earlier in the month from the regions reporting the infection.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-customises-ncov-guidelines/article30706308.ece
150,2020/01/31,"After mass retirement of staff, BSNL to outsource jobs","Going through the biggest mass retirement of its staff till date, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is planning to tide over the staff shortage by outsourcing much of the external work. An outsourcing policy sent by the corporate office to all centres acknowledges that many of the line staff involved in provisioning and maintenance of the copper cable network have opted for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).

Out of 1.63 lakh employees across the country, 78,569 retired on Friday. In Kerala, 4,596 out of 9,381 employees opted for the VRS. This will seriously affect the external maintenance work and internal work.

A communique sent by the corporate office last month says the staff required for internal work shall be rationalised by merging the duties of some of the existing posts.

New policy

The new policy allows all telecom circles to outsource maintenance work and provision of landline and broadband connections.

The outsourcing model can be implemented on need basis for selected exchanges due to post-VRS reduction in staff.

A private company can be chosen to carry out the work for a period of two years, after which the contract can be extended based on performance.

Among the services to be outsourced are attending to all types of network faults, provision of new landline and broadband connections and shifting of connections. Some of the customer service counters are also to be outsourced. Union leaders see these moves as the management’s way of testing the waters for the eventual privatisation of the organisation.

“The Central government announced the revival package for BSNL in October last year. However, barring the VRS scheme, none of the other promises in the package have been implemented. These include the provision of financial assistance and 4G spectrum to BSNL. All the private players have been providing 4G services for years now, but only the public sector telecom company has not been allowed to provide 4G services till date, which had led to erosion of customers. That seems to be the aim of the government too, as private players like Reliance Jio have gained immensely from this,” said a union leader.

The All India BSNL DoT Pensioner’s Association has demanded that pension be provided immediately to the retired employees. Salary for two months is already pending for the employees.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/mww84w/article30706302.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvkoBSNLVRS1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/after-mass-retirement-of-staff-bsnl-to-outsource-jobs/article30706294.ece
151,2020/01/31,Trees being ‘killed’ on Idukki cardamom estates,"When the huge trees in a cardamom plantation at Thondimala, near Poopara, close to the ecologically sensitive Mathikettan shola began to dry up last week, the officials of the Forest Department took note.

A close scrutiny found that small holes were drilled on the tree trunks and filled with chemicals. For trying to chemically kill trees, a case was filed against the estate owner and workers, leading to their arrest.

The Forest Department officials are now trying hard to revive at least a few of the trees by pumping water. An official of the Forest Department at Mathikettan shola told The Hindu on Friday that the estate owner tried to destroy the trees since he was under the impression that cardamom plants were decaying because of lack of sunlight in the area.

Misconception

He confessed that the hole in the trees were filled with glycel in a bid to destroy them.

Nearly two years ago, tree branches were cut in the cardamom plantation in Nedumkandam and Kumily since it was thought that better sunlight would result in increased production. The large tree cover in the Cardamom Hill Reserve (CHR) was lost and plantations sported green nets to prevent sunlight from directly falling on the plants.

A senior official of the Forest Department said the trees were chemically destroyed with the aim of selling the timber and reducing the sunshade there. Farmers drying up trees in cardamom plantations at Nedumkandam and Kumily were reported a few years ago.

Stipulations

In CHR, the rights over trees are vested with the Forest Department and that over land, with the Revenue Department. The permission of the Forest Department is required even for cutting tree branches.

Dual ownership

Only the dead trees are allowed to be sold in the CHR. Sometimes the trees are also felled citing permission from the Revenue Department to cut its branches. The dual ownership in the CHR often creates confusion and makes it difficult to take timely action, he added.

When prices rise, farmers engage in unscrupulous methods to increase production. The incident at Mathikettan shola is a pointer in this direction, he said. However, the large scale loss of green cover would only result in the plants drying up as it needed shade for natural growth.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/twlsd6/article30706119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvidukki,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/trees-being-killed-on-idukki-cardamom-estates/article30706120.ece
152,2020/01/31,Steps to curb illegal fishing activities in Kannur,"Steps will be taken to strengthen backwater patrols to curb illegal fishing activities in the district, C.K. Shiny, Deputy Director, Fisheries Department, has said.

Officials had on Wednesday removed illegal fishing grounds in the Kattampally area after traditional fishermen lodged complaints against fishing using small nets.

Acting on the directive of District Collector T.V. Subhash, fisheries, revenue and police officials removed 38 small nets near Kattampally dam. The police had taken seven people into preventive custody and they were later released.

The proceedings were based on the orders issued by the High Court and the Human Rights Commission.

The District Collector had also suggested that those who lose their jobs due to the removal of small nets could join various fisheries projects under the Fisheries Department.

Last month, the Directorate of Fisheries had rejected applications from 32 locals for permission to use fishing trawlers based on the Kerala Inland Fisheries and Aquaculture Act.

Ms. Shiny said that as per latest norms, no registration or licence was being issued for fishing using small nets in the State. However, applications for renewing licence can be submitted before February 28.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/steps-to-curb-illegal-fishing-activities-in-kannur/article30706078.ece

157,2020/01/31,Join hands to battle virus: expert,"Experts have called for interdisciplinary research and strategies to control the spread of novel coronavirus in Kerala. The first case in the State was confirmed on Thursday.

Of the several strains of coronavirus, around six are pathogenic, including the viruses that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) during 2012. Compared to SARS and MERS infection, mortality is less than 3% for coronavirus though its morbidity rate is very high.

“It may be due to sudden genetic variation of the strain, which transformed the virus into a virulent highly pathogenic form,” says T.P. Sethumadhavan, former Director of Entrepreneurship of Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University. Viruses are transmitted between animals and people.

From snakes?

“Even though coronavirus infection will come under zoonotic diseases the real animal source of the disease is not yet ascertained. Researchers of Alabama University, U.S., suggest that genomics of both novel coronavirus is similar to snakes, thus suggesting a chance of infection from snakes.”

“Coronavirus was discovered six decades ago. Though a lot of epidemiological studies on the virus in animals have been held, studies in humans are comparatively fewer,” says Mr. Sethumadhavan.

Developing vaccines

No vaccine is available for humans against this infection, but there are vaccines for dogs. But it will take at least six months to develop a potent vaccine. The current crisis is the fast pace in the human-to-human transmission. The World Health Organisation has declared a global health emergency. Taking into account the scarcity of epidemiological studies on coronavirus infection, an interdisciplinary research programme, incorporating medical and veterinary science researchers along with public health experts, including allied health care systems, is needed. Initially it can be in the form of rapid appraisal studies, Mr. Sethumadhavan said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/join-hands-to-battle-virus-expert/article30706022.ece

The condition of the medical student who was tested positive for infection on Thursday is satisfactory, according to Health Minister K.K. Shylaja. The patient, a girl student of Wuhan University in China, was admitted with symptoms of coronavirus in Thrissur General Hospital on January 27.

She was shifted to an isolation ward of the Thrissur Government Medical College by 3 a.m. on Friday. Expert doctors are monitoring her condition. Her relatives and friends have been kept under home quarantine.

Isolation wards will be set up in all private hospitals to face the challenge of novel coronavirus infection, the Minister said after a meeting of managements of private hospitals here on Friday.

160,2020/01/31,BAC rejects Opposition motion to recall Governor,"The Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Assembly on Friday denied leave to Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala to introduce a legislative motion to urge the President to recall Governor Mohammed Arif Khan.

Mr. Chennithala had sought to censure Mr. Khan for his “disparaging public remarks against the Assembly” for the passage of the unanimous resolution demanding the abrogation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) enacted by Parliament.

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) members, who are the majority in the BAC, felt the Opposition’s proposal lacked legislative precedent. The Assembly had already fixed its agenda and could ill afford to allow time to debate and vote on the Governor's conduct.

The LDF saw an Opposition plot to precipitate a rift between the government and the Governor. It felt the proposal was not in legal order. Four United Democratic Front (UDF) members who attended the BAC meeting dissented from the majority view of LDF members.

They UDF members are Mr. Chennithala, Kerala Congress (M) leader P.J. Joseph, Congress leader K.C. Joseph and M. Ummer of the Indian Union Muslim League.

The leaders registered their protest in writing against the government’s decision to disallow the motion. Later, preparing the field for a protracted political confrontation with the government in the Assembly and outside, Mr. Chennithala said the LDF had capitulated to the Governor.

The government had frittered away a historical opportunity for the House to send an unequivocal message to the Centre, which repeatedly subverted the Governor's office to assail politically opposed State governments.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's words against the CAA and other trespasses of the Centre against the federal spirit were mere tokenism. “He is afraid of the Centre and has surrendered to the Governor in the interest of self-preservation,” he said.

Mr. Chennithala said he saw a rift between the Speaker and Parliamentary Affairs A.K. Balan. Mr. Balan had contradicted the Speaker by stating the UDF's motion lacked legal grounding.

He said that West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry had set legal precedents by passing resolutions against overreaching Governors. But, the LDF was afraid to follow suit, Mr. Chennithala said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/bac-rejects-opposition-motion-to-recall-governor/article30704854.ece
161,2020/01/31,"Make engineers accountable for bad roads, HC tells govt.","The Kerala High Court on Friday observed that the government needs to make respective senior PWD engineers accountable for the bad shape of roads.

Justice Devan Ramachandran made the oral observation when a petition relating to the bad condition of roads came up for hearing.

The court orally observed that the PWD engineers should be held responsible for the bad condition of roads and that they should be made to pay for their lapses if any accident took places due to bad condition of roads.

The judge said the engineers at the highest echelon should be on the field and should keep a tab on the condition of the roads under their control on a regular basis. They should ensure that whenever potholes developed, they were filled on time. Had the respective engineers be made accountable, the deaths of two young persons in road accidents in the State could have been averted.

The engineers job was not to sit in offices and clear bills of contractors. The government should issue an order making them responsible for the bad condition of roads. The government pleader submitted that the government was in the process of taking a policy decision in this regard.

The court observed that the right to good and safe road was a fundamental right of every citizen. The judge also noted that most of the roads did not have footpath for pedestrians. The pedestrian equally had a right to have a footpath along roads. In fact, the pedestrian were forced to walk on the roads because of the absence of footpath.

The court pointed out that there was hardly any lighting along some of the highways and roads. The court said the government organised night walk for women to send out a message that women could walk fearlessly on the streets at night. The judge wondered how many women dared come out at night on the roads after the event. No one could walk on these roads because there was no lighting at all.

The court asked the government pleader to address these issues and inform the court about the lack of funds at the disposal of the local bodies to repair damaged and potholed roads under the control of local bodies.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/make-engineers-accountable-for-bad-roads-hc-tells-govt/article30704059.ece
162,2020/01/31,State kick-starts Census ops sans NPR,"After dropping the references to National Population Register (NPR) from its communication, the Directorate of Census Operations, Kerala, has started assigning responsibilities of national Census operations to various government officials.

While the Tahasildars will coordinate and monitor the operations related to Census of India 2021 in the rural areas, the secretaries of Corporations and municipalities will take care of the activities in the urban areas.

“The field operations for the first phase of Census 2021 will be conducted during April-May 2020 throughout Kerala,” said a communication sent out by T. Mitra, Director of Census Operations, Kerala, on January 24.

The obliteration of the references to the updation of the register from its communication is seen as a marked deviation from the procedure followed by the directorate till recently. The removal of the references to the updation of the register was construed as an indication of dropping the process in the State.

There has not been any official word about the deletion of the reference to NPR.

Updation of register

Interestingly, the directorate, in a communication send out on January 14, had mentioned that the updation of the population register will be carried out along with the Houselisting and Housing Census in the State. The Census and the updation of the register was to be held in the State from April 15 to May 29.

The proposal to update the document had kicked up a socio-political storm in the State. The State government had decided to dissociate with the process following the widespread apprehensions that it would lead to the preparation of the National Register of Citizens.

The Hindu had on Thursday reported that the directorate had dropped all the references to the controversial process of updation of NPR from its communication and restricted itself to the Census operations in its official messages.

Training programme

The Census authorities may shortly restructure the five-day training programme for the field officers after dropping out the NPR component. The original scheme was to reserve a day in the five-day training module for NPR. The official communication in this regard is expected shortly, sources indicated.

Meanwhile, the District Collectors have written to all the tahasildars and the secretaries of the Corporations and municipalities “not to mention NPR operations while sending out communications connected with Census Operations-2021” as all the “activities connected with the NPR operations in the State proposed to be conducted along wit the first phase of the Census operations 2021 have been stayed.”

The Collectors also requested the officials to “personally ensure the directives are obeyed failing which disciplinary action shall be initiated against the delinquent officers.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/state-kick-starts-census-ops-sans-npr/article30704045.ece

A sum of ₹15.5 crore has been sought for developing the Chengannur station.

Besides, funds have been sought for an additional platform line at Kochuveli, extension of the MEMU shed in Kollam to handle 12-car MEMU rakes, modernisation of the coaching depot in Ernakulam to handle LHB rakes, and yard modification in Vallathol Nagar station to enable more trains to bypass Shoranur Junction.

Railways expect allocation for splitting the intermediate block sections of Alappuzha-Ambalapuzha (12 km) and Thurvavur-Kumbalam (17 km) into small sections for handling more trains and funds for replacing the obsolete interlocking facilities in 14 stations.

“Priority has been given for completing doubling and improving passenger amenities. Foot overbridges, lifts, escalators, signalling and telecommunication facilities, and safety-related works are expected to get allocation ,” a top railway official said.

A sum of ₹300 crore has been sought for doubling of the rail line to Kanyakumari, ₹100 core for doubling via Kottayam, and ₹116 crore for the Nemom coaching terminal.

Land acquisition

The government has sought ₹207 crore from Railways for acquiring 14.80 ha for doubling 7 km from Thiruvananthapuram Central to Nemom and for the coaching terminal.

The Thiruvananthapuram Central-Kanyakumari doubling is estimated to cost ₹1,431.90 crore. The double line will help Railways operate more trains via Nagercoil and Madurai Junctions. The doubling is also needed for laying the rail connectivity to the Vizhinjam seaport.

The doubling of the much-delayed 620-km line to Mangaluru Junction via Kottayam is set to be completed by December 2021.

166,2020/01/31,Government releases 31 queries for Census,"The State government has notified 31 questions for eliciting information from the public as part of Census 2021.

According to a notification issued by the government, five questions are about building particulars, two about household details, and three about the head of the family.

Questionnaire

The questionnaire covers almost all details starting from building number, material used for flooring, wall and roof, use of the house, its condition, total number of members of the household, and such others.

The questionnaire does not touch upon any controversial areas but has queries about the drinking water source, availability of water at the source, lighting, access to latrine, and the type of latrine.

Kerala being declared open-defecation free, those are not of much significance to the State.

Queries about availability of kitchen and gas connection, radio, television, laptop, and mobile phone too are there. Almost all households have LPG connection, television sets and cable connection too.

167,2020/01/31,Former Minister M. Kamalam dead,"Former Minister and veteran Congress leader M. Kamalam passed away at her residence near Nadakkavu in Kozhikode on Thursday. She was 93.

Ms. Kamalam, one of the most respected women leaders in Kerala, had played a major role in mobilising women activists for strengthening the Congress in the State. She had held the portfolio of Minister for Cooperation in the 1982-87 K. Karunakaran Ministry. She was chairperson of the State Women’s Commission.

Born to Keloth Krishnan and Keloth Janaki on August 14, 1926, Ms. Kamalam made her entry into active politics by contesting the local body election in Kozhikode at a young age.

Political career

She had been elected to the Kerala Assembly twice. Ms. Kamalam was known for her close political associations with top women national leaders of the party.

A former general secretary and vice president of the Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee, Ms. Kamalam was part of the Congress (O) after the split in the party in 1969 and had become its working committee member. When the Janata Party was formed in the late 1970s, she was the chairperson of the Kozhikode district committee. Ms. Kamalam had taken part in a number of agitations and undergone imprisonment in connection with the Vimochana Samaram and later in the agitations related to the Emergency.

Ms. Kamalam was married to Mambatta Samikutty. She is survived by sons Yatheendradas, M. Murali, M. Rajagopal, and M. Vijayakrishnan, and daughter Padmaja Charudathan. The cremation took place at the Mavoor Road crematorium at 5.30 p.m.

CM’s condolence

Expressing his condolences, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said, “Condolences on the death of former Minister and senior Congress leader M. Kamalam. Kamalam was a prominent leader when the Congress was split. She was in the forefront in the movements against the Emergency”.

168,2020/01/31,"1,053 under observation","As many as 1,053 people, including 247 people who were added on Thursday, are under observation in the State in view of the coronavirus alert, the Health Department said.

Among them, only 15 people — including seven on Thursday — are admitted to hospitals. The remaining 1,038 people have been confined to their homes. Till Thursday, the State government has despatched 24 samples to the National Institute of Virology, Pune.

Of these, 15 samples have tested negative, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said. The remaining results are awaited, she said. The Minister urged the public to maintain personal hygiene and keep the surroundings clean in view of the coronavirus alert. When coughing, the nose and mouth should be covered with a handkerchief. The hands should be kept clean using soap and water, she said.

Ms. Shylaja convened an urgent meeting of the Rapid Response Team (RRT) here on Thursday to discuss strategies to combat the coronavirus threat. It was decided to identify and place under observation people who have come into contact with the coronavirus-infected student in Thrissur. This will be done even if they do not exhibit any symptoms of the disease. An attempt will be made to compile a list of people who may have come into contact with the student after her return from Wuhan, China.

Safety protocol

The meeting concluded that her infection was not severe. Further, the meeting decided to ensure that Health Department staff follow safety protocols. Medicines and safety equipment will be made available through the Kerala State Medical Services Corporation. The meeting also decided to equip the Government Medical College, Thrissur, for treating the patient.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/1053-under-observation/article30696743.ece
169,2020/01/31,Nipah protocol comes in handy,"Do not panic, but be alert. This seems to be the message the Health Department is sending across as it is battling yet another public health emergency in the form of the novel coronavirus infection.

Sources in the department said the number of deaths owing to the infection was much lesser compared to the Nipah infection, which the State successfully contained earlier. With the first case being reported in Thrissur, the effort now is to ensure that the infection does not spread to more people.

Tracing mechanism

To do so, the department is learnt to have put in place a tracing mechanism to identify people who may have been in contact with the patient. The protocol developed during the Nipah outbreak in 2018 is reported to have come in handy.

Anybody with a travel history to China and countries such as Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, Cambodia, Thailand, Nepal, Sri Lanka, the U.S., Canada, France, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates, from where subsequent cases were reported, has to contact the health authorities. If they have fever, cold, cough, sore throat, and breathing problems, they may have to be under observation.

Surveillance at home

Even if they do not have these symptoms, such people will have to be under surveillance at home as a precautionary measure, officials said. Ground-level health staff have been asked to be in touch with these people over the phone daily for at least 28 days. They will be transported by specially designated ambulances to the hospitals identified by the department for coronavirus treatment if they develop symptoms.

Special isolation wards have been set up at government general hospitals and medical college hospitals and a few private hospitals in each district.

P.S. Jinesh, co-founder and admin of Infoclinic, a group of doctors active on social media, meanwhile, refuted the claim that homoeopathy and AYUSH streams of medicines could cure coronavirus infection. He pointed out that such claims had not been scientifically proven as yet.

Doctors’ advice

Doctors, however, said that anyone with fever and cold need not seek medical treatment. According to them, only those with a travel history to the above-mentioned countries or those who may have been in contact with them need to be careful. But, it will be better for those with fever and other diseases to avoid attending public events.

Such people also need to avoid courtesy visits to hospitals to thwart chances of hospital-acquired infection. They need to also stop travelling by public transport. Senior officials are also urging people not to fall for false information on the infection being spread through social media.

Some people have also begun a campaign to boycott Chinese products, which has no scientific base.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/hib5m7/article30696715.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tv-China-map-REVISEDcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nipah-protocol-comes-in-handy/article30696709.ece
170,2020/01/31,"nCoV: District medical offices, MCHs told to keep vigil","The Kerala government has stepped up vigil in the State with the first novel coronavirus case in the country reported in Thrissur district on Thursday.

The patient, a female student who returned homr from Wuhan, China via Kolkata and Kochi has been placed in an isolation ward at the General Hospital, Thrissur, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said.

“There is no immediate cause for alarm. The patient is stable. She has sought medical attention for sore throat. We are planning to shift her to the Thrissur Government Medical College Hospital (MCH),” Ms. Shylaja said. An isolation ward has been kept ready at the MCH and a decision on shifting her to it will be taken after a high-level meeting at Thrissur late in the night.

“The Health Department has stepped up vigil following the outbreak in China. The new development means we have to be more careful,” she said, adding that an alert has been sounded to all district medical offices and medical college hospitals (MCHs) in the State.

Contact tracing

The department has also launched ‘contact tracing’ — the process of identifying people who may have come into contact with suspected/confirmed infection.

The Union Health Ministry has sounded an alert to Kerala on the basis of preliminary results of tests performed on samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune. Health officials here are awaiting the results of a gene sequencing for the final confirmation, Rajan Khobragade, Principal Secretary (Health), said.

Kerala has so far sent 20 samples to the NIV, Pune, of which ten tested negative. One of the remaining samples has tested positive while the rest of the results are awaited.

The Health Department has repeated its request to people returning from China to report to medical authorities via the helpline number 1056 and the District Medical Officers concerned. “The infection can spread without any outward sign of the symptoms. Several people have reported voluntarily. But many have not yet done so. They should do so immediately,” Ms. Shylaja said.

12 testing centres

The Centre has informed the State government that testing facilities will be established in 12 centres across the country, including the NIV, Alappuzha.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged the people to be on guard against the infection. “There is no cause for concern at the moment. The Health Department has adopted precautionary measures,” he said.

The government has warned of stern action against persons who spread fabricated information regarding the infection on social media.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/q1v60v/article30696677.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31tvtrcocona,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncov-district-medical-offices-mchs-told-to-keep-vigil/article30696652.ece
171,2020/01/31,Turf war on amongst MVD employees,"An intense turf war is under way in the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) between the executive and ministerial staff over promotion to the Joint Regional Transport Officer (RTO) cadre, which is now shared in the ratio of 2:1 between the two categories respectively, as per the ‘Special Rules’ called the Kerala Transport Service Rules. Motor Vehicle Inspectors from the executive wing and senior superintendents from the ministerial side are being promoted as Joint RTOs.

The rift has now reached almost a tipping point with the Kerala Motor Vehicles Department Staff Association (KMVDSA), the sole organisation of the 1,500-odd ministerial staff, calling for an indefinite stir from February 25 after the Transport Department entrusted the Personnel and Administrative Reforms Department to study whether the Special Rules needed to be amended, which the association perceives as an attempt to usurp their limited opportunities for promotion in favour of their executive counterparts.

As a prelude to the indefinite strike, the ministerial staff boycotted their work for two days from Monday and held a day-night strike in front of the Secretariat.

KMVDSA general secretary S. Gopakumar said a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had in 1994 upheld the validity of the Special Rules and that the Kerala Administrative Tribunal had, among other things, cited that verdict while turning down a petition challenging the Special Rules last July. He cited a verdict in 1982 when the High Court had found the functions of Joint RTOs as purely administrative with no need for technical knowledge.

Proposal sabotaged

“Though the implementation of the Safe Kerala project for bringing down fatalities in accidents through better enforcement had envisaged creation of ministerial staff, that proposal was sabotaged limiting it to creation of around 262 Motor Vehicle Inspectors’ posts, burdening the existing ministerial staff with the work under Safe Kerala project as well,” said Mr. Gopakumar.

Incidentally, the Transport Commissionerate in July last year shot down a representation from the Kerala Motor Vehicles Department Gazetted Officers Association (KMVDGOA), an organisation of MVIs, requesting the revise of the existing ratio of promotion to the cadre of Joint RTO. In the letter, the Transport Commissioner had noted that a ministerial wing clerk gets promoted as Joint RTO after 25-30 years whereas an Assistant MVI (AMVI) gets promoted to the same cadre much earlier. “If any change is brought in the present system, the meagre promotion chance enjoyed by the ministerial staff will be completely lost,” the letter said.

KMVDGOA general secretary A.S. Vinod, however, claimed that there was an unfair disparity in promoting verifying-level staff with little technical know-how from the ministerial wing much faster over the superior issuing-level executive staff with technical expertise owing to the numerical disadvantage that played out in favour of the former.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/turf-war-on-amongst-mvd-employees/article30696602.ece

173,2020/01/31,Insurance cover for schools’ ICT equipment,"The Kerala Infrastructure and Technology for Education (KITE) has facilitated insurance protection for 4,40,976 ICT (information and communications technology) equipment at 14,693 government and aided schools where the Hi-Tech School and Hi-Tech Lab project are being implemented as part of the Public Education Rejuvenation Mission. This is the highest insurance coverage of IT equipment in the country.

ICT equipment, including 1,14,858 laptops, 66,592 projectors, 4,714 DSLR cameras, 4,545 LED TVs, 4,720 full HD webcams, 23,104 projection screens, 41,878 HDMI cables, 40,614 faceplates, 41,789 ceiling mounting kits, 97,825 USB speakers, and 337 desktops benefited from the coverage.

For all equipment

Earlier, insurance protection was provided from February 24 last year for equipment arranged in classes 8 to 12 as part of the Hi-Tech School project.

With the latest initiative of KITE, all equipment deployed as part of the Hi-Tech Lab project in 9,941 primary schools in the State also get insurance protection, sources said.

KITE has roped in the United India Insurance Corporation for providing the insurance coverage for the equipment, which cost over ₹547 crore.

The equipment is covered against theft, fire, natural calamities (flood, earthquake, and so on). In the event of damage or loss of an equipment, a school has to inform the insurance company. In case of theft or burglary, a school has to report the matter to the insurance company along with the FIR received from the nearest police station.

Five-year warranty

Only damage or loss of equipment on the school premises is covered under the insurance package. Teachers have to be careful while carrying equipment, including laptops, outside the school premises.

They should obtain permission from the school authorities and abide by the prescribed rules, KITE chief executive officer K. Anvar Sadath said.

KITE has facilitated a five-year warranty for all equipment provided to schools, besides putting up a web portal for complaint redressal. There is also a condition for levying penalty from suppliers of equipment if they fail to resolve complaints within the stipulated time.

With the introduction of insurance protection, schools now have the opportunity of utilising the ICT equipment to the optimum. The guidelines on the insurance protection are available on the KITE website www.kite.kerala.gov.in",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/insurance-cover-for-schools-ict-equipment/article30696527.ece

176,2020/01/31,‘Gauthamante Radham’ — the story of a car and its family,"Film director Anand Menon is nervous and excited as his first feature film, Gauthamante Radham, is all set to reach cinemas today.

This film is a dream that he has been carrying around for a while, for almost two years. This is Neeraj Madhav’s first film after his hugely successful outing in Amazon Prime web series The Family Man. Anand says he wrote the script with Neeraj in mind.

“The film shows the three stages of Gauthaman’s (Neeraj) life. Neeraj has a youthful innocence about him, he is the boy next door who, I felt, could communicate what I had in mind,” the 25-year-old says. The movie pans in on what a family’s first car means to them — “the emotional attachment they feel for the vehicle.”

This Anand’s first feature, but not his first film. He has been making shorts since he was in Class 10. The Eureka moment about how he felt about entertaining others happened when he was on stage as a student in class eight. “My job, I understood, is to entertain. I was acting, but I was more interested in the scripting part of it.” He made short films, and even acted in some including the viral Magneto.

Anand had to wait for close to two years to fulfill this dream because it took time to meet Neeraj who was filming The Family Man and then it was about finding a producer.

“The floods of 2018 also delayed the project as we were busy volunteering. When I had gone to drop off some material at a camp in Kochi, I saw Neerajettan there. I asked him if I could narrate the story but he said he’d listen another time.”

In between, the actor had to go to Ladakh for a shoot, and Anand was in Dehradun for some time. He was tempted to go to Ladakh, “just 400-odd kilometres from Dehradun to meet him, but he said we would meet back home since he was busy with the shoot.” The wait paid off, Neeraj heard the story and he was in.

By mid-2019, they started shooting the film. Some of the creative team members — Basil Joseph (art direction), Appu Bhattathiri (editing), and Vishnu Sarma (cinematography) — had worked in Kunjiramayanam. The music is by Ankit Menon.

Two elements of his life, that he is crazy about — driving and films — come together in this film. “I am car-crazy and love to drive. Gauthamante Radham is a family film, it has autobiographical elements, a healthy dash of humour and would be relatable to most people,” he says. Of course he is nervous about the release, but he is pragmatic, “I am not expecting too much, cinema is unpredictable...let’s see what happens.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dg2r0j/article30703182.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kimpfilm2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/debutant-director-anand-menon-on-making-gauthamante-radham-starring-neeraj-madhav/article30703184.ece
177,2020/01/31,Neeta Pillai on packing a punch in ‘The Kung Fu Master’ with her martial art moves,"She is still nursing a dislocated right shoulder and has had a spate of other injuries before as well. But Neeta Pillai wouldn’t mind any of that. The lithesome actor is enjoying the adulation coming her way for her high-voltage action in Abrid Shine’s martial arts movie, The Kung Fu Master.

“This is a new genre for Malayalam cinema and I am elated that the hard work we put in is getting appreciated,” says Neeta, who made her début with Abrid’s campus flick, Poomaram, as the dynamic college union chairman, Irene. In The Kung Fu Master, she is Rithu Ram, who, along with her brother, Rishi, avenges the death of her father, pregnant sister-in-law and her nephew. Both of them are Kung Fu practitioners and are up against a gang of dangerous criminals, all of them trained in martial arts.

Neeta Pillai | Photo Credit: Special arrangement

Neeta says she had no idea about the character and the storyline when Abrid offered her the role while shooting for Poomaram. “I said yes because he said it is an action film. I am a big fan of such movies — I love watching such films back-to-back. Having seen his work, I knew that it would have something new for the audience. But I had no clue that it was an out-and-out martial arts movie!” she says.

So, Neeta started her training before Poomaram released — first in kick-boxing, followed by taekwondo, judo, karate and Krav Maga. The style she showcases in the film is Wushu, a form of Kung Fu. “I love sports and I work out as often as possible. So I was mentally prepared to learn the styles and wanted to learn it at any cost. However, when it came to practising it, it was not easy. Had I been younger I would have been more flexible. Wushu is powerful as well as graceful and watching master practitioners in action was inspiring,” she says.

All the kicks and punches involved full-body contact and it was not easy for Neeta since she was pitted against many real-life martial artistes who were part of the cast.

Fact file A native of Thodupuzha, Neeta has a masters in Petroleum Engineering. A trained classical musician and dancer, she has had no experience in acting before Poomaram happened. “I didn’t have the courage to act even in a skit. But while pursuing my post graduation in the US, I watched a lot of movies. I was so moved by certain films and characters that I wanted to give a try,” she says. When she was home for her vacation, she came across a casting call for Poomaram and auditioned for the same. “Although both characters are bold, in The Kung Fu Master I had to be emotionally expressive as well. Whereas in Poomaram, my character was expected to shut her feelings off so as to keep the morale of my team high,” she explains.

“Jiji [debutant Jiji Scaria who plays Rishi] has international accreditation in Wing Chun, a form of Kung Fu; Sanoop D, the villain Louis Antony, is a theatre artiste and has a black belt in karate. Those who are part of his gang are masters of different martial art forms. Some of my trainers have also acted in the film. Rajan sir, who trained me in judo, has acted as our family friend, with his family, all of them martial artistes,” Neeta says.

The toughest part was shooting in the snow-covered regions in Uttarakhand, especially the climax scene that involved all the fights. “We usually train on a hard surface with grip. But that is not possible on snow. The surface hardens to form ice and each time we executed a move, we slipped and fell. It was not possible to shoot in another location. So we had to change the moves we had learnt,” she recollects.

She eventually ended up having frostbite due to the shoe she was wearing. “Initially, I didn’t tell the team because that would have affected the schedule. But it became so painful that I couldn’t sleep and finally one night I had to wake up my trainer. Although I was advised to take rest, I somehow managed to finish the work,” she recollects.

Challenging terrain

The inclement weather was a challenge for the crew as well because they had to walk through the snow carrying their equipment. “Our cinematographer, Arjun Ravi, and others had a tough time shooting the fight sequences with hand-held devices. They also slipped and fell several times,” Neeta adds.

The actor says that the director had taken “a huge risk” by choosing her for the role. “He was there everyday at the training session. In the initial days, I was completely at a loss. My body language wasn’t right, punches were not powerful, kicks were not proper... Still he trusted me and said, ‘Take your time, but ensure that you get it right’. That kept me motivated,” she says.

However, Neeta feels that the experience has changed her as a person, mentally and physically. “I plan to practice Wushu regularly as soon as my shoulder is healed. The training has conditioned my body; it was like meditation. It became a part of my life since I trained for at least five hours daily. I didn’t learn the moves for the sake of the movie. One can never train in martial arts that way. I wanted to meet the expectations of the director and match the standard of real fighters in the cast,” Neeta avers.

Equally exciting were the dubbing sessions. “I was thrilled to do that because I always wanted to go through that experience. I am glad that I could dub for both my movies,” she says with a chuckle.

A huge fan of “good old comedy movies in Malayalam”, Neeta plans to stick in the industry for a while. “Although there were no plans to do a second movie, I said yes to The Kung Fu Master because I enjoyed the process of acting. I don’t have any dream roles as such. It should be something that connects with the audience,” she says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/tr7y8m/article30702016.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/01tvmneeta,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/neeta-pillai-about-her-martial-arts-moves-in-the-kungu-master/article30702019.ece
178,2020/01/31,And the Padma Shri goes to...,"Last year, among the many deserving Padma Shri awardees was Prabhu Deva. And all the literal-minded intellectuals incapable of any subtlety whatsoever found it funny. ‘Hyuk hyuk,’ they tittered. ‘Who’ll they think of next, Super Subbarayan?’

To me, Prabhu Deva has always been a worthy candidate. Because no mainstream personality has so clearly and singularly focused his attention on an all-pervasive problem our country faces that no one is willing to talk about: fungal infection.

Prabhu Deva’s entire dance repertoire, from his first film to the current Salman Khan epic he must be working on, is a lament about fungal infections.

Pulling at his collar, yanking his fly, moving shirt tails left to right, lifting his tee and covering his head, employing the angavastram as a back-scratcher, using a towel on his groin, rubbing himself against furniture... what in heaven’s name do you think this selfless man has been trying to say for more than a quarter century?

And it took this government to finally pay heed and give him the award he deserves. I think his song from a few years ago, ‘Gandi baat, gandi-gandi-gandi baat,’ where he talks about the travails of going incognito to a local dermatologist, was the tipping point.

Similarly, this year, too, I find the same highbrows — who do nothing for society — sniggering about the eligibility of some of the awardees at their little cocktail soirées.

Let’s start with Kangana Ranaut. Why? Because Rangoli Chandel.

‘I’m humbled and I’m honoured,’ said Ms Ranaut, addressing her petrified fans. ‘I thank my country and I dedicate this to every woman who dares to dream.’

Whatever anyone says, no one in recent times has fought harder against the evil Mughal, British and Italian governments, and Hrithik Roshan — all at the same time — mounted on a wooden horse, screaming incoherently, with fake blood spattered all over her face, than Ms Ranaut. No one, other than Karan Johar, another deserving awardee, has made us reach for the dictionary to check the meaning of ‘nepotism’ than this true modern-day shero. No one has taught us so much about such diverse things as tax slabs, Agent Provocateur bodysuits, the Mahabharata, Tapsee Pannu, gang wars in colleges, and why Rakesh Roshan should not make Krrish 23, than this future Nobel laureate.

But, above all, Rangoli Chandel. The only woman in the world who can invite you-know-who for a morning walk.

Let’s come to K-Jo next.

‘It’s not very often that I’m at a loss for words, but this is one such occasion,’ said Johar. ‘I am humbled, elated and also thankful for the opportunity to live my dream every day.’

Give me one reason why this man shouldn’t be given an award?

Can you name one other person who has done as much for education-related dancing by students clad in cutting-edge attire as Johar through Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and SOTY 1 & 2? Not enough? What about his selfless role in delinking Sasha and Bebo, then? Had he not done that, would we have Taimur? Imagine how much poorer our lives would be without him! How about how close K-Jo regularly brought us to Jaya Auntie, Amit Uncle, Gauri bhabhi, Fawad machan et al’s bowel movements? Let’s not forget his contribution to Indian cricket, too. And how he arranged for Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul’s much-needed rest. Above all, name one entertainer who has propagated the benefits of the remote-control vibrator better than K-Jo?

Ekta Kapoor, you say?

I have one word: she gave us Smritiji. Case closed.

179,2020/01/31,'Baby Driver' and 'Yesterday' star Lily James on playing literary characters and what 2020 has in store for her,"Celebrityhood can often be a study in contrast. I can’t help compare Lily James’ aura to that of the French diva Juliette Binoche, both of whom I encounter at the International Film Festival and Awards Macao (IFFAM). Unlike the larger than life and intimidating Binoche, the persona of the much younger, new kid on the block is real world and welcoming. At a reception she doesn’t just mingle easily with the hoi polloi but floors a journalist by suggesting that he take a selfie with her than just clicking her alone. Earlier, dressed in simple black trousers and cream blouse and jacket, she disarmed the hard-nosed audience with her unpracticed candidness in a Masterclass.

The geniality, however, can’t obscure the fact that the 30-year-old, often called the next Keira Knightley, has amassed an enviable body of work in a short period. In less than a decade, her performances straddle across mediums — stage, television, independent films and big Hollywood cinema. Her oeuvre encompasses various genres — from a waitress in a musical actioner like Baby Driver (2017) to a war drama like Darkest Hour (2017), where she played Winston Churchill’s war time secretary Elizabeth Clayton; from the ABBA-inspired Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (2018) to the recent Beatles homage, Yesterday (2019). She also played Elizabeth Bennet in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the action-horror interpretation of the Jane Austen classic.

Forever Downton Abbey

“It feels like a long time ago,” she says, referring to her breakthrough cinematic performance in the lead role in Kenneth Branagh’s retelling of the age-old fairytale, Cinderella (2015). But, for the graduate of London’s Guildhall School of Music and Drama, even before Cinderella there was Downtown Abbey, the uber popular series. Auditioning for, and bagging the role of “wild, rebellious and often petulant and annoying” Lady Rose, is one of those moments that she can’t forget. “It was overwhelming because I knew how successful the show was… I have always loved period dramas… I worked hard [for the audition] and it felt right. Sometimes things just feel right,” she tells the small, select audience she is interacting with at IFFAM.

Working with the cast of great actors may have seemed daunting, but they were all more than welcoming. “The first day they all hid and then jumped from behind the furniture, including Maggie Smith,” she recollects. She couldn’t have asked for a better training ground. “On the one hand it felt terrifying, on the other it was the best opportunity one could have had because it was such an ensemble piece and I was learning from the best straightaway.”

James auditioned for Cinderella during the making of Downtown Abbey. “I auditioned some 7,000 times for Cinderella,” she laughs. Was there pressure in working with a big name like Branagh? She would insist on retakes, not being sure of what she had delivered while he would refuse. “I didn’t believe in myself. I couldn’t see what he could see… I still struggle with it… I think it’s to do with control and, as an actor, you have to let go of that control… Being self-critical is almost like vanity,” she says.

People in books James likes playing literary characters, like Natasha Rostova in the TV series, War and Peace. This year she plays the second Mrs de Winter in the upcoming adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier classic, Rebecca. Describing that she found it hard to shake off the role, she says, “She lives in a very difficult headspace, really anxious and self-conscious. I was having panic attacks for weeks after finishing it.” Directed by Ben Wheatley with Armie Hammer as her co-star, it will unspool on Netflix later this year. James’ début as executive producer also involves a book, but she isn’t giving away the title yet.

Soon, the historical drama The Dig, co-starring Ralph Fiennes and Cary Mulligan, will keep her busy, as will actor Emily Mortimer’s directorial début, where James plays the lead in her adaptation of Nancy Mitford’s 1945 novel, The Pursuit of Love, for BBC One.

James is not averse to introspection. At the 40-minute-long Masterclass, there is a transparency in answering the many queries thrown at her unrelentingly. She comes across as good humoured and self aware. There is also a curiosity about people and about cinema rooted in other cultures. Despite the jet lag, she has managed to see Takeshi Miike’s First Love and can’t stop raving about it.

But the conversation veers back to her. About performing arts having also been a kind of family inheritance. Her grandmother, Helen Horton, was an American actress and her father, James Thomson, was a musician and actor. “He never spoke in the same accent each day. He was always doing impersonations, pretending to be different people,” she says.

Taking on Meryl Streep

Baby Driver, and especially Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again!! took her back to her love for singing. As for playing a younger Meryl Streep… “Everything you do has to be a challenge and has to frighten you… It felt like there was room to reinvent, embrace and discover this amazing, cool part”. Another such film was Billie Piper’s anti romcom, Rare Beasts, which she describes as a “brave expression of what it is to be a woman”.

Acting is often seen as an individual pursuit, stardom as vanity. Yet James also regards it as a “social job” and loves the collaborative spirit in an ensemble of actors or a company of dancers. For her the primary requirement of an actor is to be thin-skinned. “You have to reveal yourself, let your emotions out and understand things from people but you have to have a really thick skin when it comes to dealing with failure or success or just what it means to be an actor,” she says.

Director special Danny Boyle [Yesterday]: has total respect for everyone on the set. He loves filming, the day-to-day of it. Together with [writer] “naughty, cheeky, full of life” Richard Curtis there was so much energy. It was the most fun, playful atmosphere to work in.

Edgar Wright [Baby Driver]: “He is a crazy film genius. He knows every film ever made… He is like ‘one freeze frame of that film will help you with character’. For my character Deborah, he gave a list of 250 favourite films. I think a good way to get into a role, character, vibe of film is by watching references which have the same tone and feel that the director wants to create.

There is a touch of sangfroid when it comes to the roles that have come her way and others that haven’t. Advice from friends in the industry has helped. Helena Bonham Carter, for instance, told her it’s okay to cry and break down and show people that you are human and not some robot. “It can get relentless at times, filming every day, getting up at 5, coming home at 9 and doing that month after month,” she says. Cinderella producer, late Allison Shearmur, also gave her life lessons. “She told me to stop apologising…she toughened me up a bit,” says James, who is also at a curious stage where she doesn’t want to see her own movies. “The process of making it is what our job is,” she points out. Fortunately, she is doing that quite well.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/auwrrg/article30701735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25WKLilly,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/actor-lily-james-gears-up-for-literary-character-for-2020-rebecca/article30701742.ece
180,2020/01/31,"‘Dagaalty’ movie review: Misogyny, sexism and mediocrity defines Santhanam's latest","Can Tamil cinema really survive without some of the unprincipled stereotypes it has helped cultivate? The short answer is no, if Dagaalty is to be used as a yardstick.

A feature length advertisement for how smoking gives fresh ideas — and, of course, of the 'loosu ponnu' stereotype — Dagaalty looks like it takes place in the alternate reality called Cinemapatti, conceptualised by C.S. Amudhan in his seminal work named Thamizh Padam.

The railway station found in Jayam, Winner and in Thamizh Padam finds presence. A fight sequence with Stunt Silva unfolds in the same location as where Singam's climax was shot. The woman's family goes in search of her in white SUVs. There is a market fight scene. Manobala appears for exactly two shots. Oh, and there is also the item song!

Dagaalty Director: Vijay Anand

Cast: Santhanam, Rittika Sen, Radha Ravi, Yogi Babu, Tarun Arora

Story line: A conman lures a naive girl to Mumbai under the pretext of helping her make a film with Shah Rukh Khan. He hands her over to the antagonists in exchange for huge money, but later develops a soft corner and wins her back.

The plot follows the lives of Guru (Santhanam) and Malli (Rittika Sen); the former is a conman, the other is a 'loosu ponnu'. Guru has a task: lure Malli to Mumbai, so he can complete his end of the bargain in order for a goonda (Radha Ravi, playing Bhaiya) to spare his life. This charade is kicked off by the main antagonist's (played by Tarun Arora) fetish to sleep with the women he draws in a portrait. Though he appears to breathe testosterone, Arora's Vijay Samrat character is nothing more than a glorified wimp who eventually submits to the most basic of happily ever-afters.

Casual misogyny and sexism

Basic is what Dagaalty is. The film fails to elicit even the most basic of smiles despite combining two of the best known funny men in Tamil cinema — Santhanam and Yogi Babu. It makes use of basic plot points, with some casual misogyny and sexism thrown in for good measure; it also has super basic scenes (like when Yogi Babu steals the camera from a foreigner, or when the fire of love is lit by the hero touching the heroine's 'iduppu' in what can only be described as a numb scene) and the most basic of climaxes.

Watching Dagaalty, it is hard to figure out the ecosystem in which Santhanam's films thrive. They are always made on a relatively low budget (the lead characters use a maximum of three costumes for the entire film), and hence present little to nil financial risk for him as its producer. But such films present a big risk... for us, the viewing public.

As the antagonist snorts cocaine in the climax to prepare for a forced consummation with the heroine — who has also been drugged, and yet she still remains the 'loosu ponnu' — we wonder if Arora could pass a bit off that white stuff to us as well so as to save us from the inordinate trip that Santhanam's films appear to be these days.

Despite the wafer thin plot, Dagaalty could have been a passable action film. Stunt Silva's action choreography is believably menacing to buy Santhanam as an action hero. But the problem is with Vijay Anand also wanting Dagaalty to be a screwball comedy at some level. Brahmanandam's addition as China Madhan is an example. Consequently, the film goes for a toss.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/sqge4y/article30701258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dagaalty-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dagaalty-movie-review-misogyny-sexism-and-mediocrity-defines-santhanams-latest/article30701231.ece
181,2020/01/31,"‘Jawaani Jaaneman’ movie review: Fun, but reinforces the age-old cliches associated with singledom","It’s good to see actors being their age on screen, rather, as in Jawaani Jaaneman, playing characters who don’t want to be their true age. Which is what Jazz is all about, played with characteristic aplomb, swag and a casual, throwaway sense of humour by Saif Ali Khan. Replace love with lust and Jazz is the philanderer that the once-romantic Sameer Mulchandani of Dil Chahta Hai might have become in his middle age. Drinking, clubbing, womanising and getting his hair coloured is all he does when not making money in the real estate business. Then one fine day, a hitherto-unknown daughter Tia (doe-eyed charmer Alaya Furniturewala plain-sailing fluently for a newcomer) comes calling and all hell breaks loose.

Jawaani Jaaneman Director: Nitin Kakkar

Starring: Saif Ali Khan, Alaya Furniturewala, Kubbra Sait, Tabu, Kumud Mishra, Farida Jalal

Storyline: A single, middle-aged philanderer finds life turning upside down when his hitherto unknown young daughter comes calling

Run time: 119 minutes

Jawaani Jaaneman is a fun ride up to a point with actors working well in tandem and spewing some smart and sharp lines. The best of these are reserved for Tabu, in the brief role of Ananya, the hippie past of Jazz. This “hashish (hash), meditation, inner peace” lover and “punarjanam (rebirth) calendar” believer is a hoot and Tabu brings the house down with her on point poker-faced turn.

For a brief while, it also appears that the film is walking rather bravely on the tightrope of impiety. It’s also rather nice to see a hero with a seemingly minor, but such a central signifier of advancing age — sporting glasses to read or reading distinctly uncomfortably without them. However, on the flip side, you have Jazz’s friendly neighbourhood hairdresser Rhea (Kubbra Sait) telling him that he is her age. But then how old is she? Did I miss that vital bit of information or was it deliberately kept obscure? All that I heard was that both for Jazz and her, the past that they have left behind stretches longer than the future they have ahead of them. Pretty depressing!

The film goes on to reinforce the most hackneyed of cliches about singledom. It wears the garb of a modern, Hollywoodian, set-in-London comedy but lives up to the sentimental “it’s all about loving your family” adage. So the singles have no moral compass and they are selfish and irresponsible in their chase for freedom. But, not all is lost. Some kind of a primordial parental instinct and the overwhelming urge to belong to a family would ultimately help tame them and redeem them of their trespasses.

The most cringing is throwing the “who will look after you when you are old and ill?” question at Jazz and, in turn, the audience. I took that personally and wanted to tell the makers that children are no guarantee for being looked after in old age and that in the changing social fabric and relationship dynamics, you could be left to fend for yourself even within institutions like marriage and family. In times of medical emergencies, people in general — singles included — need health insurance policies to fall back on than kids of their own. So states practical wisdom, explicitly and accurately.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/oan9wa/article30522341.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jawania,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jawaani-jaaneman-movie-review-fun-but-reinforces-the-age-old-cliches-associated-with-singledom/article30701164.ece
182,2020/01/31,"‘Psycho’ has the Mysskin touch, but not the feel","The first few frames in a film can convey if the director has a flair for the medium. That’s what Mysskin’s ‘Anjathe’ did to me though I watched it only because the producer was a friend.

I caught up with ‘Chithiram Pesudhadi’ later, but the craft and the content was first rate in ‘Anjathe’. Mysskin later confessed it was written in a rage because he could not find a producer for ‘Nandalala’. He shut himself in a room and wrote a tale of friendship, jealousy, love and guilt that made you want to reach out to the characters and put an arm around them reassuringly. That’s what cinema is all about. The director’s triumph is when he locks you up in a dark hall and makes you empathise with characters you’ve never met. ‘Anjathe’ did that to me like very few other movies. The emotions and reactions are raw and real with characters mostly in a moral dilemma making their decisions fascinating.

Mysskin worships Akira Kurosawa and venerates Jean Paul Melville whose ‘La Samurai’ and ‘Army Of Shadows’ he recommends. Then there’s ‘The Return’ by Andrey Zvyagintsev. Mysskin is a loner even in a crowd mostly lost in thought. He narrated how he once bumped into somebody on the road who kept saying hello till he realised it was his father.

His office has bookshelves for walls and is a voracious reader irrespective of genre. ‘Wolf Totem’ is one of his favourite books. It happens to be Vetrimaran’s too.Mysskins oeuvre is sketchy by his standards and talent. ‘Psycho’ is his ninth directorial in 14 years. Very few films have worked as a whole after ‘Anjathe’. They all have his trademark, but in stutters. ‘Pisasu’ was first rate.

Directors like Mani Ratnam and Mysskin like superstars have cultivated a claque, more polished and passionate. That’s fine till intolerance creeps in when there’s criticism. An admirer turns fan when he accepts unquestioningly and this seems to happen unconsciously. It happened with Mani’s ‘Katru Veliyidai’ and now Mysskin’s ‘Psycho’. Some have loved it, but many have not and the curious are watching it to figure out why. Of course fans will say: ‘You did not get it, just like you could not appreciate ‘Katru Veliyidai’.’ Well so be it. I watch films to feel rather than wrack my brains about intentions (some unintended), symbolism, references and metaphors. I don’t expect to be spoon fed nor do I like to be stuffed.

‘Psycho’ left me cold like no other Mysskin film. He seems to have been distracted while writing or was too engulfed in the emotions to worry about logic. It’s only when the former overwhelms you that you don’t worry about the latter. The plot is formulaeic. You don’t really know what the blind hero really does other than stalking a girl but lives in a bungalow, has a male help and an expensive car. Humiliation and a song later, the heroine falls for him strong enough to taunt the psychopath that he will come to save her. Villain is a suave industrialist who kidnaps girls, straps them to a cold board and decapitates them keeping the head as a trophy and displaying the carcass in public triumphantly.

This is not a whodunit. It’s a whydunnit that turns into a ‘catch me if you can’. The film claims that no bird or animal was harmed. It’s humans who’re butchered in cold blood. Cops are portrayed as kind but inept while the press comes across as a pack of impertinent pests. ‘The cops are only searching with their eyes. Use your brain,’ is the advise a shrink gives our blind hero. The trail for the cops is cold and they’re so clueless that they don’t question kids playing near the place of a victims disappearance though one of them knows her. Of course the hero later does. They’re so dumb they have to follow the hero’s clues. Let’s not even talk about the blind hero driving his car at breakneck speed. The denouement in Mysskin’s films is usually well thought out and powerful. Here it just doesn’t work because you’re expected to sympathise with the perpetrator. I found the heroine more cold-blooded especially after witnessing heads of hapless girls rolling at her. She’s simply doesn’t seem traumatised enough by the inhuman acts.

Santhanam in a film says: ‘How could I expect an appropriate expression from you?’ to Udayanidhi Stalin. Mysskin must have cast him because he’s big on friendship and needed someone stiff, mostly in the shadows and donning dark glasses. Of course, he covers his face when he has to weep in one scene. The rest of the cast consists of competent performers. Directors praise and approach Ilaiyaraja at their convenience and for all his so-called arrogance the maestro knows, but accepts and never lets them down. I’ve always said the only magic I’ve witnessed is Raja watching a reel, writing the score and when you watch it later you realize he’s added soul, enhancing the emotions even if he doesn’t like the content. The director will get an earful later. I’m curious about what Raja thought about ‘Psycho’ especially since he doesn’t mince words.

Some of the characters are brilliantly written, especially Nitya Menon with her acid tongue. The craft is intact with carefully choreographed and composed shots but the content just doesn’t match. There is the protagonist named Gautam and the baddie Angulimala, while one character is called Kamla Das, a victim is Sylvia Plath. You don’t relate to or empathise with most of the characters even when they’re in dire situations because there’s no mystery. It’s definitely not a fitting tribute to Hitchcock whose films were more about sleuthing than slaughtering. It’s more like Na Hong-jin’s 2008 thriller ‘The Chaser’ sans the chills and thrills but with as much blood and gore.

'Psycho' has the Mysskin touch but not the feel. We’ll watch a classic when the twain meet.

183,2020/01/31,"Role of IR professionals more challenging, says N. Srinivasan","The role of Industrial Relations (IR) professionals is more challenging in manufacturing industries where they have to deal with unions, demanding workforce, automation and multi skilling of workforce, N Srinivasan, vice chairman and managing director, The India Cements said.

Addressing a conference on 'Industry 4.0 and Design Thinking in IR' organised by The Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he shared his personal experience in dealing with unions and IR related issues in the last three decades.

“You cannot avoid trade unions; soon they will get together. Ultimately, they want more wages, better compensation. Meeting them and dealing with them will make your life simple,” he said adding that unions are not a ‘big bad wolf’. “Dealing with them directly makes your life much simpler.” he said.

Advising IR managers in the manufacturing sector to discuss the issues across the table with the unions, he said: “You should have empathy, be fair and transparent in your approach and must earn the trust and confidence of unions and workforce.”

Stating that he directly holds talks with unions on bonus payment, he said that the top management should not hesitate to directly talk to unions. Since 1992, Mr.Srinivasan has negotiated and concluded seven out of eightwage settlements in the cement industry.

He pointed out that the share of permanent workers are decreasing and contract workers are increasing due to automation and cost pressure. “You still can’t avoid unions who will come to represent the contract labourers.”",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/snj9v7/article30704474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/role-of-ir-professionals-more-challenging-says-n-srinivasan/article30704475.ece
184,2020/01/31,Banking services affected as employees strike,"Banking services in the city were affected as employees participated in the nationwide strike on Friday called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), pressing for a 20% wage hike and presenting a charter of demands.

Employees of around 300 branches of public sector banks in the city participated in the strike. Around 500 members affiliated to UFBU, an umbrella organisation of nine trade unions, staged a demonstration and raised slogans in front of the State Bank of India on Dr. Ambedkar Road.

The protesters said the wage revision of employees has been pending since November 2017. “Despite submitting a charter of demands regarding wage revisions, the Indian Bank Association (IBA) has not paid heed to our demands. Multiple discussions were held in the last 20 months and recently IBA had announced that wages will be increased by only 12.25%,” said M. Sundararajan, convenor of the protest.

He also charged that IBA has been writing off non-performing assets (NPA) using profits of public sector banks. “Rather than collecting the bad loans from corporate giants, the IBA has been using profits to write off NPAs,” he alleged.

The employees have also been protesting, demanding five-day banking, merger of special allowance with basic pay, scrapping of the new pension scheme and other welfare measures.

Hence, the unions have called for this nation-wide strike, he added. “We are also planning to hold strike on March 11, 12 and 13. If our demands are not attended, then we will call for an indefinite strike from April 1,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/au6e8m/article30702852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31JANTH-BANK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/banking-services-affected-as-employees-strike/article30702812.ece
185,2020/01/31,Three companies to process seaweed produced by farmers of Palk Bay region,"The Fisheries Department on Thursday signed Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with three companies to process seaweed produced by farmers of the Palk Bay region -- between Ramanathapuram and Pudukkottai. The State produces an average of 4,000 tonnes annually and 1,500 tonnes of natural seaweed is collected every year.

The MoUs, totalling over ₹21 crore, are meant for investments to set up factories/processing units/value addition units so that farmers get an assured price and the seaweed has regular demand. They would also help reduce post-harvest loss and ensure quality. Seaweed is used in confectionery, cosmetics, food, medicine, and neutra-chemicals.

Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar said that natural collection of seaweed for commercial purpose in the State dated back to 1966 in Ramanathapuram district. “Natural seaweed resources exist in Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Pudukkottai districts where around 2,100 families from 18 villages are actively involved in it. Nearly 1,500 families are engaged in natural collection and around 600 families undertake seaweed farming of indigenous Gracillaria edulis and Kapphaphycus alverizi,” he said.

Though adequate fishers have shown interest in seaweed farming, its development has been restricted by several factors including lack of adequate buyers and monopoly of the marketing system; and lack of sufficient seaweed processing industries, he added.

Secretary of Fisheries department K. Gopal, Director of Fisheries G.S.

186,2020/01/31,Man killed in country bomb attack in Puducherry,"A 33-year-old man was killed in a country bomb attack on Friday morning near Kirumampakkam Primary School. Shortly after the incident, the victim’s relatives and friends staged a road blockade, choking traffic for hours on the busy Puducherry-Cuddalore road.

Sambu alias Sambasivam, a resident of Pilliarkuppam, was travelling in his car to invite a relative for his sister’s wedding slated to be held next week, when assailants hurled country bombs at the vehicle. The victim was a staunch supporter of Minister for Social Welfare M. Kandasamy.

After hurling the bomb, the gang, who had arrived on three motorcycles, attacked the victim with lethal weapons as he tried to escape from the car, killing him on the spot. Children who were on their way to school panicked and started screaming. Some parents who rushed to the school took their children back home, fearing violence, police said quoting eye witnesses.

Tension prevailed near the school premises after relatives refused to take Sambasivam’s body in an ambulance to the Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital for further procedures.

Though they finally allowed police to shift the body, relatives and friends of the victim staged a protest at Kirumampakkam junction throwing traffic out of gear for almost an hour. Vehicular movement came to a standstill for hours on the busy stretch. They with drew the protest only after a team headed by Senior Superintendent of Police (Crime and Intelligence) Akanksha Yadav promised to nab the culprits.

A team headed by Superintendent of Police, South, Jintha Kothandaraman has been constituted to investigate the case, Senior Superintendent of Police, Law and Order Rahul told The Hindu.

Palaniswami has announced a new scheme, the ‘Direct CTO scheme for Green Industries’ to relax the process for pre-establishment clearances for green category industries. Under the new scheme, the green industries just need to apply for consent to establish, and don’t have to wait till obtaining final approvals to commence construction work.

“This would benefit over 63 types of green industries,” the Chief Minister said while addressing industry captains at the 125thyear celebrations of the Confederation of Indian Industry that was held in Chennai on Thursday. He also announced an initiative for land use re-classification in non-plan areas. “Land use re-classification for non-plan areas will be given deemed approval, if the applications in full shape, cross the timeline,” he said. Earlier, approvals used to take six months to two years. Now it will be possible to get it in 50 days. Mr. Palaniswami also highlighted CII’s role during the global investors meet that was held in 2015 and 2019.

Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, said, “I am extremely delighted to note that the Southern States have consistently scored high in the country on key economic and social indicators with the help of the government’s policy initiatives.” The Southern States contribute about 30% to India’s GDP. Especially, Tamil Nadu ranks first among the States in terms of number of factories and industrial workers. The governor requested industrialists to take initiatives and have more MoUs with government universities in Tamil Nadu. “You need skilled and well-trained people and if the Universities modify their curriculum accordingly, the effort will enhance the employability of students and accelerate industry growth,” he said.

Shobana Kamineni, past president, CII and executive vice chairperson of Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Ltd, spoke about gender inequalities and said that it was time for the industry and government to act now. “Indian economy could get 27% richer if we could bridge those inequalities,” she said.

The journey (CII) began in 1895 when 5 engineering firms, all members of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, joined hands to form the Engineering and Iron Trades Association (EITA). Till 1942, IEA was the only all-India association of engineering industries and represented mainly big engineering companies, particularly the British firms. This led to a situation where the interests of the Indian firms (mainly medium and small scale) were not sufficiently represented. Thus the Engineering Association of India (EAI) was established in 1942 as an affiliate of the Indian Chamber of Commerce. EAI represented small and medium engineering firms mostly owned and promoted by Indians.

In 1912, there was a change in name from EITA to IEA. In April 1974, the two associations -- IEA and EAI -- merged to form the Association of Indian Engineering Industry (AIEI). In 1991, industrial licensing was abolished and economic reforms on a wide scale started taking shape. With effect from January 1, 1992, in keeping with the government's decision to opt for the liberalisation of the Indian economy, the name of CEI was changed to Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/xzqt3n/article30700407.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31JANTH-GOVERNOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/edappadi-announces-direct-cto-scheme-for-green-industries/article30700408.ece

On a given day, the poultry waste dumped roadside and in dumpyards account for two tons during weekdays and doubles on Sundays and other holidays. The waste not only poses a threat to motorists but is also a health hazard for the workers handling it.

Arrangements have been made to collect the waste from shops and other sources in Kalasapakkkam, Tiruvannamalai, Naidumangalam, Polur, Chetpet, Arni and Kannamangalam for now.

Depending on the success of the scheme, it would be extended to other municipalities and town panchayats, said an official from Tiruvannamalai municipality.

The scheme would be implemented from next Monday (Feb.3), and in order to protect the environment, people are requested to co-operate with their respective localbodies, said Mr. Kandasamy.

192,2020/01/31,CITU calls for women’s jail bharo on March 6,"The 16th All India Conference of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) held in Chennai recently called for women’s ‘jail bharo’ agitation on March 6 to further the struggle for women’s equality in all respects and against social oppression.

Though it was planned to organise the struggle on March 8, the International Women’s Day, it was advanced since March 8 falls on a Sunday.

Expressing deep sense of anger and concern at the increasing violence and atrocities committed on women and children in the country, a resolution adopted in the conference in Chennai alleged that violence against women and children had seen a sharp rise since the BJP government-led by Modi came to power at the centre.

“On the one hand, discrimination against women in all spheres continues unabated, on the other, their economic exploitation and social oppression utilising the prevalent social attitude of treating them as second class citizens, had reached extreme proportions under neoliberalism,” the resolution said.

“On the other hand, discrimination against women in all spheres continues unabated on the other their economic exploitation and social oppression utilising the prevalent social attitude of treating them as second class citizens, had reached extreme proportions under neoliberalism,” the resolution said.

The conference pointed out that as per the Periodic Labour Force Survey, women’s work participation rate had fallen from 41.6% in 2004 to 22% in 2017-18.

“Women who seek jobs mostly get precarious jobs, which are recognised neither by the society nor by the government as ‘work’; nor are they reflected in statistics. It is estimated by a high level panel of UN that over 51% of work done by women in India is unpaid and not counted in national statistics,” the resolution further said.

Lower wages

The conference said it was estimated that women’s wages are 34% less than that of men doing the same job in rural areas, and 19% less in urban areas in our country. “India has the highest gender wage gap. Contrary to popular belief, this increases with high qualification and seniority,” the resolution added.

Another resolution demanded the immediate repeal of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and rejection of NRC and NPR.

The conference elected K. Hemalatha as the president of the CITU and Tapan Sen as the general secretary. The treasurer is M.L. Malkotia.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/citu-calls-for-womens-jail-bharo-on-march-6/article30696738.ece

Other programmes, such as an essay competition, were also held to create awareness among the medical fraternity and encourage them to eliminate leprosy from our society.

District Collector A. Shanmuga Sundaram administered a pledge to the participants and launched a signature campaign.

In his address, Mr. Sundaram said that in the past, people lived close to the riverbanks but now, scared by the amount of pollutants, they seek residence elsewhere. Polluted water is the major cause for all diseases, and people should desist from polluting the waterbodies to save the environment for future, he said.

195,2020/01/31,Set up special cells to tackle social media abusers: HC,"The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the Director General of Police (DGP) to create special cells in every police station in the State to crack down on those who post derogatory and unsubstantiated allegations on the social media against constitutional functionaries as well as those who hold high posts in the Central as well as State governments.

Justice M. Dhandapani ordered the special cells to be established within two months and police personnel deputed in them to be imparted necessary knowledge to track down and nab people who take to the social media to hound judges, ministers and government officials.

A further direction was also issued to the DGP to constitute the special cells and report compliance by March 30.

The orders were passed while granting bail to A. Maruthachalam, 59, a resident of Coimbatore, who was arrested on November 20 for posting a video containing defamatory allegations against a sitting judge of the Madras High Court and a lawyer.

The judge granted him bail after the petitioner tendered an unconditional apology and an assurance to not repeat such activities. He was also ordered to comply with the usual conditions imposed while granting bail to the accused.

At the same breath, expressing concern over the growing trend of derogatory messages and baseless allegations against people holding high posts, the judge said: “Right to a dignified life is guaranteed under the Constitution and the same cannot be allowed to be breached for the pleasure of certain unscrupulous elements.”

‘Nip them in the bud’

He went on to state: “These types of cheap publicity and scandalous acts should be nipped in the bud failing which it will start mushrooming and rise to gigantic proportions. Therefore, it is high time that the judicial power be wielded in order to curb the social menace and to maintain decorum and harmony in the society.”

The observations were made and the directions were issued after being dissatisfied with a report filed by the Superintendent of Police, Cyber Cell, Crime Branch-Criminal Investigation Department (CB-CID).

The report did not contain any concrete details regarding a plan to put in place an effective mechanism to tackle social media canards, the judge said.

“Unless the menace is curbed with iron hands, it will creep, spread its tentacles far and wide and eat away not only the healthy and peaceful life of the individuals but also put in jeopardy the whole nation and persons manning the helm of affairs of the society would be left to the mercy of these individuals,” the judge added.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gdkkc/article30443675.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THSOCIALMEDIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/set-up-special-cells-to-tackle-social-media-abusers-hc/article30696656.ece
196,2020/01/31,A memorial to honour war heroes from Salem,"Since the time of World War I, many from Salem have taken part in various war operations.

The district administration has offered respects to the brave souls by constructing a memorial for the war heroes, on the District Collectorate premises.

The war memorial was constructed with support from Naachi Granites, a firm run by an Indian Air Force veteran, Laxman Vairavan.

The memorial has plaques in memory of a former ICS officer, who served in Salem during the pre-independence era; a plaque in memory of soldiers from Salem who took part in World War I; and a plaque in memory of martyrs who sacrificed their lives, serving the nation after independence.

Major T. Prabhakar, assistant director, Ex-Servicemen Welfare Department, said that the plaques of the ICS officer and the World War heroes were there at the old collectorate building.

Collectorate rebuilt

“In the old collectorate building, memory stones in honour of T.L.R.Chandran, an Indian Civil Services officer who died during service here, and 196 men who took part in World War I, from Salem, were present. When the collectorate building was reconstructed, this stones were preserved. A plaque, in honour of 19 men from Salem, who served in the army and sacrificed their lives for the nation, has also been placed in the memorial,” he said.

J. Barnabas, general secretary of the Salem Historical Society, said: “T.L.R. Chandran was the first special officer for prohibition appointed here during C. Rajagopalachari’s regime, before Independence, and he died during service, on Decemeber 22, 1937.”

He said: “When the collectorate building was reconstructed, we requested the district administration to reinstall the plaques in the new building. However, technical reasons were cited.” “We requested the district administration to construct a memorial for the brave souls and it has come out well,” he added.

197,2020/01/31,"Public examinations for classes V, VIII challenged","The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday sought a response from the State to a public interest litigation petition that challenged the government’s decision to conduct public examinations for classes V and VIII.

A Division Bench of Justices M. Duraiswamy and T. Ravindran asked the Centre and the State government to file counters to the petition filed by advocate S. Louis of Madurai, who sought a direction to restrain the State from conducting public examinations for classes V and VIII.

In his petition, Mr. Louis said the State government’s decision to conduct the public examination was unwarranted. Children below the age of 14 years would be psychologically affected and failure in the examinations could result in dropouts, he added.

The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 was enacted with the intention of providing free and compulsory education to children up to the age of 14 years. An amendment was brought to Section 16 of the Act by the Centre. Regular examinations to classes V and VIII at the end of every academic year were made mandatory and re-examination after two months for students who failed was also brought in. Following the amendment, no other State government had come forward to conduct public examinations for classes V and VIII except the Tamil Nadu government, the petitioner pointed out.

198,2020/01/31,Indirect polls to rural local bodies held amid tight security,"In the southern districts, indirect elections were held in Virudhunagar and Thoothukudi districts, while it was deferred, for the second time, in Sivaganga, Madurai and Theni districts.

In Thoothukudi district, an AIADMK candidate became the chairperson of the Kovilpatti panchayat union. Accusing officials of manipulating the indirect elections, DMK functionaries, led by Thoothukudi MP Kanimozhi, staged a road roko.

Ms. Kanimozhi claimed that the DMK was enjoying the support of 10 of the 19 councillors, while the AIADMK had the backing of only 9. When the Returning Officer was firm in his decision that he had conducted the election in a “fair manner” and that his declaration was final, the DMK MP, along with the party cadre and the councillor, blocked vehicular traffic for more than three hours on the Kovilpatti–Pasuvanthanai Road.

In Virudhunagar district, the DMK won the post of the panchayat chairperson in two unions of Sattur and Rajapalayam. The ruling AIADMK won the post of the panchayat chairperson in Watrap union near Srivilliputtur. An independent councillor, who was backed by the AIADMK, won the post of chairperson of the Narikudi panchayat union, through a draw of lots. On January 11, indirect elections in these four panchayat unions were stopped due to violence and other law and order issues.

Indirect elections for the posts of chairman and vice-chairman for the district panchayat council of Sivaganga district were deferred for the second time, as only eight of the 16 candidates were present. The remaining eight from the ruling AIADMK kept away from the elections.

200,2020/01/31,Flowers for Valentine’s Day come to harvest a week too early,"The flower production for Valentine’s Day has come to harvest, a week too early, putting farmers in a fix. The early rise in temperatures has forced farms to harvest their flowers starting this week, running the risk of them wilting ahead of exports for Valentine’s Day.

The Taj Mahal variety of roses, produced specially for Valentine’s Day, needs a production period of 52-55 days. Farmers plan the production in December, and harvest by the first week of February.

But this year, a premature rise in temperatures has forced farms to harvest the stems from January 25th. “Usually, the harvest is done between February 4 and 6, and export packing takes place between February 7 and 9. When the buds reach the market before Valentine’s Day, they would have flowered fresh,” said Bala Siva Prasad, president, Hosur Small Farmers’ Federation.

The ideal temperature is 18-28 degrees Celsius, but the day-time temperature was 32 degrees Celsius, leaving no choice for the farmers but to harvest the flowers, said Mr. Prasad.

Cold storage facilities are not seen as a remedy for such an early harvest. Small farmers, who sell their flowers to exporters, prefer cold storage of flowers only for two days or less, from fear of disease transmission in common cold storage.

There is also anxiety about the flower quality, owing to climate change. Short and not-so-cold winter, nil rainfall, and early spike in temperatures have come to affect the quality of flowers, said Bala Siva Prasad. “There was also a brief spell of extreme cold for a week in December, when blind shoots developed,” said Mr. Prasad.

For now, the brief boom in domestic demand, due to Muhurtam season, is helping farmers. The domestic price for a stem is between ₹12 and ₹15 today, which is equal to premium packing (export price).

If the early harvest is expected to impact the freshness of the flowers, affecting the export quality at the time of packaging, 10 days from now, it is possible that the farmers may fall back, solely on the domestic demand, and skip exports.

“I told my buyers in Malaysia not to commit to their customers as of now, and wait till February 6 to gauge the status. If the quality of the harvested flowers fall, then the prices will slump. In this event, we may do well to stay with the domestic market price, which is high due to demand,” said Mr. Prasad.

Against this, the halt to imports of fresh produce from China into Malaysia, the main export market for Hosur’s roses, in the wake of the Coronavirus, just may swing in favour of Indian flower growers, believe farmers here. “But that too hinges on flower quality. Any understanding of the market will be known only after February 6, when we decide on the orders and there is place to gamble,” said the president of the Hosur Small Farmers’ Federation.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a535em/article30696598.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31THROSE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/flowers-for-valentines-day-come-to-harvest-a-week-too-early/article30696599.ece

Mr. Balakrishnan said as the present inquiry into the irregularities was unlikely to bring out the truth, a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was necessary.

203,2020/01/31,Centre’s conditional support may affect power projects,"Execution of many power generation projects in the State, estimated to cost around ₹49,000 crore, may suffer a setback if the Central government sticks to its stand of making conditional the provision of financial support by its entities for the projects.

At present, six projects, having a total installed capacity of 6,200 megawatt (MW), are being funded by the Power Finance Corporation (PFC) and Rural Electrification Corporation (REC). All the projects, which are in different stages of execution, are expected to be commissioned in the next three years.

Broadly in three areas, the Centre has asked the State government to show progress in ensuring that the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (Tangedco) quickly settles outstanding dues to its suppliers; collect dues from government departments and local bodies and energy accounting.

Till the end of December, Tangedco owed around ₹14,000 crore. At the same time, it is yet to realise ₹1,500 crore from local bodies and the State government’s departments for energy consumption. A foolproof energy accounting may not be possible in the State, given lakhs of agricultural connections get unmetered free supply.

Considering the seriousness of the Centre’s directive, State Electricity Minister P. Thangamani and Tangedco’s chairman, Vikram Kapur, met Union Minister of State (independent charge) for Power R.K. Singh a few weeks ago and briefed him on the State’s position. “We are still pursuing the matter with the Centre,” a senior official points out.

Special package

The State government has been seeking a special package of assistance from the Centre to clear dues to generators. It made this demand at a meeting of State Power Ministers’ conference in October.

When Mr. Thangamani met Mr. Singh, he also requested the latter to provide around ₹1,200 crore for purchasing and installing four lakh transformer digital meters, which would help the State bring down transmission losses.

Another official explains that these meters are expected to address the problem of unmetered power supply to agriculturists.

Regardless of the outcome of the State government’s requests for assistance, senior policymakers are of the view that the government may not be able to postpone the issue of tariff revision, in view of the “precarious” financial health of the Corporation.

As per an agreement signed at the time of joining the UDAY scheme three years ago, the government committed itself to a hike of 6% in power tariff to be effected in 2019.

So far, it has not yet been implemented due to obvious political reasons.

205,2020/01/31,Fertilizer firms told to deliver urea by Feb. 15,"The State government has asked fertilizer companies to ensure transportation of soil nutrients for February to their allotted district by the end of the first fortnight itself.

At a meeting with representatives of fertilizer companies and officials of the Telangana State Cooperative Marketing Federation (TS-Markfed) and Agriculture Department here on Friday, Principal Secretary C. Parthasarathi and Commissioner Rahul Bojja said that against the allotment of 7.5 lakh tonnes of urea for the ongoing rabi season, the companies had supplied 5.85 lakh tonnes till January-end.

Of the urea supplied by companies, Markfed had a stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACS) and dealers had 0.5 lakh tonnes of stock. Against the initial allotment of 1 lakh tonnes of urea to Telangana for February, the Centre had agreed to allot 2.09 lakh tonnes for the month, keeping in view the increased extent of rabi cultivation this year. Accordingly, the 2.09 lakh tonnes of fertilizer was allotted to various companies, including their own manufacturing and imports (at plant and port). Mr. Parthasarathi told the companies’ representatives to ensure that the allotted stock reached the districts by the end of first fortnight of February so that there was no shortage of urea.

On the problem of railway wagons pointed out by the companies’ representatives, the officials assured them of resolving the issue by talking to railways and to the Centre, if necessary. Mr. Parathasarathi asked the Markfed and agriculture officials to monitor the movement of fertilizers closely and take stock reports every day from the dealers. Any irregularities in urea supply to farmers, sale of the soil nutrient without using point-of-sale gadgets or at prices in excess of maximum retail price, would be deal with sternly, he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/fertilizer-firms-told-to-deliver-urea-by-feb-15/article30706502.ece
206,2020/01/31,Half of BSNL TS staff opts out,"There were handshakes, bear hugs and tears. The mood was festive yet sombre at BSNL (Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited) offices across the city on Friday. It was an emotional moment for hundreds of men and women - from officer to clerical to field staff, as they were ending decades of service to the public sector telecom giant and were being felicitated by their colleagues and bosses.

January 31 was the last day for nearly 5,000 employees above 50 years across Telangana - 2,670 in the capital alone, having opted for an ‘attractive’ Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) as part of Centre’s “revival package” of investing up to ₹29,937 crore, raising ₹15,000 crore through sovereign bonds and realising thousands of crores by monetising assets.

“Happy as well as sad because I spent more than three decades working here. But the way things are moving, I thought it is better to take the package on offer though I am due for a promotion. Many of us think we are in a way contributing towards the revival of this great organisation which is a like family to me,” says M. Padma Sharma, with moist eyes.

She and scores of other staffers were being felicitated in batches of 50-60 in offices spread across the twin cities throughout the day with flowers, shawls and sweets. Many came with their family members in tow for the last day in office amid selfies, group photographs and mobiles being exchanged.

“I had put in 38 years and seen the best years and lows. We have all been pushed into this direction, what can we do? We are hoping the reduced work force will bring in efficiency,” says an official, just retired. “There is despondency and no future here though I have more than seven years left. Those staying are, however, hopeful,” says Latha Ravi.

“When was BSNL given mobile licence or 4G spectrum? Telecom is a sunrise sector so leaner organisation could work,” says another. “Such large number of employees opting out in one go is unprecedented. We have not been receiving salaries properly for the last three months. So, this VRS package was a big clincher. Hope the government sticks to the promise,” says another wistfully.

“Existing staff will look after new functions and there will be third party teams,” says Mr. Vittal, another official. Empty offices and unmanned desks are likely to greet customers tomorrow onwards considering that the total number of employees is estimated to be about 9,000 in TS and half of them have opted out.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wu73l4/article30706548.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY31BSNL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/half-of-bsnl-staff-in-telangana-opts-out/article30706332.ece
207,2020/01/31,TS plans S-Hub with ₹25 cr. seed fund,"An S-Hub or the sanitation hub, on the lines of popular T-Hub incubator, for promoting start-ups and innovations in water, sanitation, solid waste management and waste water recycling is to be set up by the Telangana government in Hyderabad.

Announcing this here on Friday, Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development K.T.Rama Rao said a seed fund of ₹ 25 crore is being earmarked for the initiative. He also urged MA&UD Principal Secretary Arvind Kumar to “make sure the incubator is started immediately.”

Addressing the valedictory of INK@WASH summit in which a few senior officials, including Mr. Kumar participated, the Minister said the objective behind handholding the start-ups and promoting innovations in the space is to make cities and towns livable as well as healthy.

“S-Hub will be the go-to place, a lighthouse for Telangana and for India that would undertake incubation of ideas and build an ecosystem for innovations, knowledge dissemination, capacity building in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector,” he said.

The State government proposes to house S-Hub at the Administrative Staff College of India (ASCI) for two years and then establish a dedicated facility at the proposed Centre for Urban Excellence. The centre, he said, is coming up on 15-20 acres and expected to be up and running next year.

Mr. Rao also announced that the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board is also planning a hackathon shortly on waste water and sensor technology.

Listing out several measures initiated by the government in the areas of WASH, the Minister said urban local bodies (ULBs) in Telangana have achieved ODF (open defecation-free) status and are forging ahead to meet ODF++ protocols through safe management of faecal sludge and septage at 71 ULBs under the PPP format. There are also plans to set up 3,000 new public toilets in the next two months.

INK@WASH, an initiative of the Telangana government with the support of ASCI and other organisations, is aimed at promoting collaboration and partnerships among the start-ups/innovators and cities, funding agencies, CSR units of companies in the identified areas. ASCI chairman K.Padmanabhaiah highlighted the role of the government in handholding the start-ups working in WASH areas.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/ts-plans-s-hub-with-25-cr-seed-fund/article30705907.ece

The meeting also discussed various government orders on the cooperative society elections and under what conditions the government plans to hold the elections. There is a fear that they might bring in ex-officio members in the cooperative societies elections as well, Mr. Reddy said.

Later, the meeting decided to take to the people the unfulfilled promises of the Chief Minister like waiver of farm loans, truncated Rythu Bandhu scheme and no bonus announced for any crop in Telangana.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/congress-plans-for-pacs-polls/article30705790.ece
209,2020/01/31,Appeal for Navodaya schools in all districts,"Telangana State Planning Board Vice-Chairman B. Vinod Kumar has urged NIT Aayog to recommend to the Central government to sanction and construct a Navodaya School in each of the 33 districts in the State.

This would enable students to access the best schools without their socio-economic status impeding their growth. Construction of the Navodaya schools, at least one in each district, was also in line with the policy of nurturing students with accessible and quality education.

Mr. Vinod Kumar, in a letter addressed to NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar, recalled that Navodaya schools were important institutions run by the Central government supplementing the State governments’ efforts in spreading education to talented under-privileged students. The State had taken a progressive step by increasing the number of districts from 10 to 33 and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allocation of Navodaya schools for all the districts across the State.

It was disturbing to note the skewed distribution of these schools in favour of north and central India with Telangana getting only nine schools for its 33 districts with a population of 3.52 crore. “It (Telangana) has been grossly neglected in the allocation of these new schools. States with similar or lesser population such as Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jharkhand and Assam have twice or thrice the number of Navodaya schools than Telangana,” he lamented.

Since Telangana is the youngest State, there is a need for increasing such Navodaya schools in each district. He recalled that Telangana MPs in the previous Lok Sabha raised the issue in the House as Telangana lagged behind other States in education parameters due to historical injustice.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/appeal-for-navodaya-schools-in-all-districts/article30705407.ece
210,2020/01/31,"BJP, CPI question government hurry to conduct PACS polls","Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Telangana unit has requested the State Cooperative Election Authority, who is also the Additional Registrar of Cooperative Societies, to take up reorganisation of primary agricultural cooperative credit societies (PACS) in tune with the increased number of mandals, keeping in view the interests of the farming community.

In a letter addressed to the election authority on Friday, BJP State vice president S. Malla Reddy said the elections to cooperative societies were announced in a hurry without implementing reforms in the cooperative sector. The term of the 906 PACS was completed in 2018 itself and instead of completing reorganisation of the societies after reorganisation of mandals, the government had announced the elections.

He questioned the rationale behind the State government decision to go for the cooperative elections in a hurry without reorganising the PACS, when it had been repeatedly requesting the Centre to increase the number of Navodaya and Kasturba Gandhi residential schools. Similarly, reorganisation of district cooperative central banks (DCCBs) was also necessary in tune with the increased number of districts.

‘Cover up of irregularities’

Alleging that the government had gone back on the plans to reorganise the societies, Mr. Malla Reddy said no action had been taken against the ruling party leaders who were allegedly involved in the irregularities and misuse of funds in several societies. An exercise was taken to have at least two societies in every mandal, but in vain. As a result, a large number of new mandals would be left with no PACS, he pointed out.

Further, he demanded that election of chairman and vice-chairman of the PACS be conducted on the day of the directors’ election results itself to prevent irregularities in the office-bearers’ election. Similarly, the election of DCCB directors be held on the next day of PACS polls and the elections to Telangana State Cooperative Apex Bank the following day.

Meanwhile, State secretary of Communist Party of India (CPI) Chada Venkat Reddy too faulted the announcement of PACS elections in a hurry to prevent the Opposition parties getting breather from the recent urban local bodies’ elections.

217,2020/01/31,Medical camps in Nagoba jatara reveal a worrying trend in tribal health,"The two medical camps operated at the just concluded Keslapur Nagoba jatara - the tribal fair in Indervelli mandal of Adilabad district - is giving sufficient reason for worry as far as tribal health is concerned. Doctors who had manned the camps disclosed that at least 80 per cent of the out patients had complained of bodyaches, headache or fever and seeking pain killers like Diclofenac or Paracetamol.

For example, of the 80 out patients treated at the medical camp run by the District Medical and Health (DM&H) Department on the first day of the jatara on January 24, as many as 63 complained of cold or headache, or both. Same was the situation at the camp run by the Vanavasi Kalyan Parishad (VKP), an organisation working among tribals. But maintenance of records here was not as meticulous as the former’s.

Symptoms and addiction

Doctors did not find anything amiss even when such a high incidence of ailments necessitating prescribing pain killers was witnessed. They had assumed that the dust at the jatara venue was the cause of bodyaches, cold or fever, or all of these.

The high incidence in question conforms with the trend that has been observed in recent years in tribal villages. Adivasis in almost all villages in the former composite Adilabad district, especially in Adilabad and Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, are addicted to pain killers eventually leading to kidney damage and other ailments.

Rising renal failures

In the last two years, several deaths due to kidney failure have been reported from villages in Lingapur mandal of Kumram Bheem Asifabad district, and those from Narnoor, Gadiguda, Indervelli, Ichoda and Sirikonda mandals of Adilabad district. The common thread in all these deaths was the heavy consumption of pain killers by the deceased.

“Yes, the patients come asking for more number of pain killer or paracetamol pills, sometimes even an injection of it. We, however, limit the number to two tablets fearing that unchecked consumption of these medicines could lead to other complications,” asserted Danthanpally Medical Officer Dr. K. Santosh.

Monitor and check

The DM&H Department, or for that matter the VKP does not have a system whereby outpatients who came seeking pain killers could be monitored. “It needs to be done in case any major tragedy in the longer run is to be prevented,” opined a doctor, also working in the camp.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nagoba-jatara-medical-camps-reveal-a-worrying-trend-in-tribal-health/article30701117.ece

219,2020/01/31,Around the clock,"In 1999, with the encouragement of late historian Sharada Dwivedi, photographer Chirodeep Chaudhuri put together his debut show featuring 20-odd shots of clocks scattered around South Bombay. The passion project has continued for more than two decades, crowdsourced via email, text, Instagram, and Whatsapp. Chaudhuri has also come across clocks rather serendipitously: whether stuck in a traffic jam, overhearing conversations in public places, flipping through novels about the city, or dropping off a co-passenger in an Uber Pool. “Some of the stories are rather bizarre,” says the photographer and city chronicler. “I remember travelling in a cab with my student and coincidentally stopping outside the Anand Niwas building. Lost in conversation, she asked me how I usually find these clocks, and I told her, ‘You never know, you might look up and just find one’. Sure enough, there stood the clock at Anand Niwas!”

Time and again

After a span of two decades years since his debut, Chaudhuri returns to clocks with an ongoing show at the Max Mueller Bhavan (part of the ‘Women In Design 2020+’ conference organised by the HECAR Foundation and Somaya and Kalappa Consultants). Seeing Time: Public Clocks of Bombay is birthed through obsessive observation, featuring 81 public clocks. “By now, I can say with surety that there must be only two-three existing clocks that I still haven’t found,” says Chaudhuri.

In his photographs, we see popular working timepieces at the Victoria Terminus booking counter, Crawford market, Mumbai Central Railway Station, and the David Sassoon Library, among unnoticed clocks dotting the edifices of the Christ church School at Clare road, Byculla, the Indian Sailors’ Home in Masjid Bunder, the sundial at Kamala Nehru park, and the eighteenth Portuguese sundial at Manor House, Bombay Castle.

While time barely stands still in this metropolis, Chaudhuri, looks past the city’s circadian time, and instead, documents it. The photographer’s documentation is as an allegory of how time means money, physically representing an era dependent on public edifices for time. “But I’m not interested in mushy nostalgia about a time long gone,” asserts the photographer. “For me, the larger story is about technology and its redundancy.”

Like public clocks of the eighteen and nineteen hundreds, that are often abandoned because of rusty gears, the difficulty in replacing broken parts, delicate mechanics, and daily/weekly need for winding. In fact, this is why the series is photographed only in daylight, since the clocks wouldn’t illuminate at night, merging in with the shadows. So who then, are the custodians of the dials that still move with the times? Chaudhuri documents them in a few stories on Instagram.

Being labelled

In a photograph posted in early January this year, the time chronicler features Mr. Rajkumar, an employee at the Western Railway's Lower Parel workshop who is in charge of maintaining the ‘heritage ghadi’ on the premises. The 1889 vintage model is carefully oiled and wound by Rajkumar, and his colleague, Norbert D'Mello, as the former casually informs Chaudhuri how the clock loses three minutes every week. Many of the photographs in the show are labelled ‘clock working,’ or ‘clock missing,’ with the assumption that the unlabelled entities are either not working or unserviced. Intentionally or otherwise, Chaudhuri’s frames capture the contrasting days in various parts of the city, from North to South. How does a day in Vile Parle look in comparison to an afternoon in Sikanagar? The clocks are central protagonists in a much-larger story, conspicuous in their presence and even absence, characterised by empty spaces on walls. My eye is drawn to photograph the Indian Mercantile Building (Dadar), which dons the frame of a clock, now making way to cascading plants. Similarly, the circular ring of the clock at the Shanti Sadan Apartment (Sion) acts like a window, welcoming the trees that flank it.

As our conversation shifts from Chaudhuri’s existing photographs, to the next phase of his project, he shares stories of ancient Bombay archives that documented clocks on buildings that no longer exist. “For example, a friend, Rajan Jayakar, has a picture of the Khada Parsi that was originally placed in Nagpada, with the backdrop of a building embedded with a clock. The façade doesn’t exist any more,” says the curious photographer. Interestingly, these are the clocks that Chaudhuri is now in search of — seeking time that literally stands still.

220,2020/01/31,‘I insist we approach Warhol in a fresh and contemporary way’: Jose Carlos Diaz,"The star name that stood out before the 12th edition of the India Art Fair officially kicked off yesterday, was that of Andy Warhol’s. The American popartist — he is best known for a 32-canvas installation of paintings of Campbell’s Soup Cans and the silkscreens of Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe — is somewhat of a headliner at the IAF, over 30 years after his death.

That’s because BMW, one of the IAF’s biggest partners over the years, is bringing to Delhi the M1 race car that Warhol painted in 1979. This was part of the carmaker’s now 45-year-old ongoing series called the Art Car Project, which has also collaborated with other eminent contemporary and pop artists like David Hockney and Jenny Holzer. This was the fourth in the series of a still growing collection of 19 cars, and it took him less than 30 minutes to finish it.

In an earlier interview to The Hindu, fair director Jagdip Jagpal had underlined the fact that unlike many other artists on the Art Car Project who had painted their designs on miniature models, Warhol painted this car himself. In the same year, it was even used to race, “for the first and last time” according to BMW, in the 24-hour race at Le Mans in France, one of the oldest race car tracks in the world.

Given the showing of this collaboration, this year’s inaugural session of Auditorium Talks at IAF will have Jose Carlos Diaz, the chief curator at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in conversation with Thomas Girst, the global Head of Cultural Engagement at the BMW Group.

Ahead of their talk on Warhol’s life and work, Diaz highlights what it is like to curate a museum that is driven by a single-artist focus, Warhol’s sustained relevance, and more. Edited excerpts.

It’s going to be over three decades since Andy Warhol’s passing. What makes him still so relevant, continents away in India, in 2020?

Andy started his career in New York City as a commercial illustrator. His signature style of the period, using what we refer to as the blotted line technique, resulted in multiple versions of the same image, often made for clients incorporating them in advertisements for newspapers and magazines. Warhol understood the power of images and how to disseminate them to the masses. He would later do this through his pop art and perhaps, if he were alive today, he would be doing the same through social media.

You joined The Andy Warhol Museum in 2016. What was your brief when you came on board, and how has your role has evolved?

Once I joined the team I knew that I would eat, breathe, sleep Warhol. However, I understood that our mission is to engage and inspire through Warhol's life and legacy. Through that approach, the curatorial team and I have been creating original performances utilizing Warhol film, remastering rare films and screening them at the museum and across the country, as well as continuing to organise original Andy Warhol exhibitions.

Jose Carlos Diaz, Chief Curator, The Andy Warhol Museum | Photo Credit: Abby Warhola

Since I have joined I have a real passion for these Warhol-related shows to offer new scholarship and takes on the artists, such as Andy Warhol: Revelation, but also dedicate part of our schedule to contemporary artists, many who are having their first museum breakthrough at our museum, such as Farhad Moshiri [Tehran-based pop-artist], Devan Shimoyama [Philadelphia-born painter and professor at Carnegie Mellon University], and Kim Gordon [rock musician and visual artist]. I insist that we approach Warhol in a fresh and contemporary way and not in a nostalgic way.

How has your own relationship with Andy Warhol changed since you started working closely with his art?

Almost everyone has some collective understanding about Andy Warhol. This usually comes in the form of Campbell's soup cans, Coke bottles, and Marilyn Monroe. My own relationship has developed and changed because I have access to over four decades of artwork and his personal archive, made up of endless ephemera and strange objects. Today when I work on Warhol projects I feel as if I am sharing a visual story about a personal friend who helped shape the 20th century in America.

Can you talk about some important works in your collections that need better recognition?

In my opinion audiences tend not to be aware of Warhol's early commercial illustrations from the 1950s, and prior to his pop career, as well as the final body of work, before [his] passing in 1987. [This] was related to The Last Supper, which cleverly balances sacred and secular culture. Our museum covers his entire life, and one would need to travel to Pittsburgh to see these works, however, there seems to be several major Warhol exhibitions at the moment that cover these areas so that makes be happy.

How do you keep from slipping into glorifying Warhol, especially since the museum is driven by his persona? How do you explore facets of his practice that may perhaps disappoint an observer?

Absolutely. Warhol is hard to pin down because he contradicts himself and constantly evolved. Warhol tends to be celebrated more than criticized so it is important for our exhibitions to offer new perspectives and information, such as in Revelation, which surveys his career and faith, but makes no claim [of whether] he was sinner or saint.

In April we will open Femme Touch, a museum-wide exhibition that is centered around the women and femmes who were intertwined with Andy Warhol’s life and career, including his devoted mother and Valerie Solanas, the woman who shot him in 1968. It will tell the narratives of mesmerizing individuals around his orbit who shaped his own career.

In his famous pieces, Warhol engaged with symbols that were specific to being popular in the United Statsduring his time. Can you talk about what has made these stand the test of decades?

I believe Andy had a gift of choosing the right subjects and depicting them as modern day martyrs and icons. He chose heartthrobs and young movie stars to immortalize on canvas. When I see our Liz Taylor and Elvis paintings in the galleries it is important to realise that when they were made, the subjects were very relevant, and not seen in a nostalgic way, the way you might [currently] think about Elvis Presley.

These were the Taylor Swifts of the time, if that makes sense, which would have made people smile or infuriate them. Warhol continued to depict rising stars, especially through magazine interviews but he also created them within his entourage of Superstars. He gravitated towards individuals who led layered and complicated lives, and I think this helps his prints and paintings stand the test of time.

221,2020/01/31,Hooda slams Haryana govt.,"Former Haryana Chief Minister and Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh Hooda has hit out the ruling BJP-JJP alliance government, saying that governance has come to a complete halt in the State as both the partners were busy in settling their internal crises.

“It's been over 100 days since they [BJP-JJP] came to power but not even a single decision in public interest has been taken. This government is not just non-performing but a non-functional one,” said Mr. Hooda talking to The Hindu here.

“It’s a direction-less government,” he added.

Mr. Hooda said corruption was at it peak in Haryana yet the government was not keen to investigate the allegations.

“Paddy scam is an example. We have been demanding a CBI probe but why the government is reluctant? The allegations of corruption levelled by the ruling party legislature Devender Babli against his own government is a serious matter. Why is the government afraid of probing these allegations,” asked Mr. Hooda.

The Congress leader said the alliance government was formed by the BJP and the JJP by securing the numbers, but they do not have similar ideological views, which is a key reason behind “non-functioning” of the State government.

“My experience is wherever such kind of governments are formed which do not have ideological similarities or any common minimum programme to work on, they eventually fall under their weight,” said Mr. Hooda.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hooda-slams-haryana-govt/article30706401.ece
222,2020/01/31,195 kg heroin seized in Punjab; 6 held,"The Special Task Force of Punjab Police seized 195 kg of heroin along with other chemicals from a house in Sultanwind village in Amritsar. Six persons, including an Afghan national, were arrested.

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh said on Friday that the house in Sultanwind, from which the police seized the contraband on Thursday night, allegedly belonged to Anwar Masih, who was a member of the Subordinate Services Board (SSB) – an appointee of the previous SAD-BJP government.

Investigations were in progress to ascertain Mr. Masih’s involvement, who claims to have rented the house to the arrested accused, said Capt. Amarinder.

The Chief Minister said initial investigations suggested that the drug network was linked to Simranjit Singh Sandhu, one of the biggest drug mafiosi of the country, who has recently been detained in Italy.

The heroin seizure, said Capt. Amarinder, appeared to be part of a consignment of 300 kg that arrived at Mandavi in Gujarat last year and of which 200 kg was smuggled into Punjab.

“Six persons, including an Afghanistan national identified as Armaan Basharmal, have so far been arrested with 194.15 kg of heroin and chemicals. A lot of equipment used for refining of heroin and mixing it with other products has also been seized from Armaan, who had come to Punjab a week ago.” he told reporters here.

Major crackdown

Mr. Shoaib and Mr. Kabir were jailed for the violence that took place in Lucknow on December 19 and recently released from jail on bail.

The candle march was held at the sit-in being held by women at the foot of the clock tower against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act since January 17.

While 13 persons were named in the FIR, hundreds of unidentified others were also charged.

The FIR invoked Sections 147 (rioting), 145 (joining or continuing in unlawful assembly, knowing it has been commanded to disperse), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapon), 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code. Section 7 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act was also included.

‘Altercation with police’

As per the FIR, hundreds of protesters tried to take out a candle march near the clock tower and allegedly got into an altercation with the police on the question of raising a tent at the site.

Police said despite warning the protesters that prohibitory Section 144 was imposed, they continued to lead the march.

225,2020/01/31,M.P. BJP goes for damage control as 700 minority members quit,"Stunned by a string of resignations from its Madhya Pradesh minority cell, including 700 members in Jabalpur on Wednesday, over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC), the Bharatiya Janata Party will hold workshops to hear out the cell members on the law in a bid to ward off “bad influence” triggering resignations.

In January, more than a 1,000 members of the cell quit the party in Indore, Bhopal, Khargone, Guna and Satna districts, with former State secretary Akram Khan and State cell media chief Javed Baig setting the ball rolling.

While party leaders, including State president and Jabalpur MP Rakesh Singh, have blamed the resignations on the “misinformation” being spread over the contentious law, and claimed in any case that they didn’t turn sour the party’s image, Nasir Shah, the cell’s State vice-president told The Hindu, “If we don’t understand the law ourselves, how will we make others aware? The NRC hasn’t been implemented yet, and the CAA doesn’t threaten Muslims.”

Beginning Monday, the workshops, aimed at arresting simmering dissent within the party, across the 10 administrative divisions will listen out the cell members’ feedback on the law from the grassroots and help make them understand it better, added Mr. Shah.

“The senior leadership for too long took the resignations lightly,” said a senior leader of the cell, requesting anonymity. “It’s high time now. If the resignations continue, the cell may collapse and the party will end up hurting its prospects in the upcoming panchayat elections in February.”

After bearing 165 resignations in Khargone and 67 in Indore recently, the 700 resignations en masse, by members miffed over derogatory remarks made at a BJP-led pro-CAA rally in Jabalpur district on January 26, the Republic Day, swung the party into action. With this the cell in Jabalpur stands virtually dissolved, with just 50 members left.

“Party members, including State yuva morcha president Abhilash Pandey, hurled derogatory abuses against Muslims, who were part of another rally. Didn’t they even think for a second Muslims are there in their party too, and how they’d feel?” asked Shafeek Hira, former Jabalpur’s cell president, after resigning from the party.

‘Muslims targeted’

Stating that the party was singling out just one community, he said, “People of all religions are opposing the law, not just Muslims. They say sabka saath, sabka vikas, but things came to a head on Republic Day when only Muslims were targeted.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Shah asserted that making offensive remarks against any community was against the country’s interest. “Sentiments of any community must not be hurt,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aovd2y/article30706272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE31-MINORITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/mp-bjp-goes-for-damage-control-as-700-minority-members-quit/article30706273.ece

227,2020/01/31,Main accused in ₹900-crore heroin smuggling case held in Italy,"The main accused in a ₹900 crore heroin smuggling racket has been nabbed by Interpol in Italy earlier this week, an official of the Gujarat Anti- Terrorism Squad (ATS) said on Friday.

The ATS had seized 5kg of heroin in August 2018 and arrested two people.

Probe revealed that it was part of a 300kg consignment which had entered Gujarat from Pakistan through the Mandvi coast.

Simranjit Singh Sandhu, a resident of Amritsar, was the brain behind the smuggling racket, the senior ATS official said.

“Sandhu has been held by Interpol in Italy after a Red Corner Notice (RCN) was issued by the ATS. We will seek his custody after he is deported to India as we need to know where the remaining 295kg heroin is,” the official said.

228,2020/01/31,"Hostage drama was planned, murder accused wanted cases dropped: Uttar Pradesh villagers","Local residents claim that there was a method to the madness of Subhash Batham, the man who held 23 children hostage for hours before the episode ended with police shooting him down and a mob lynching his wife.

Villagers said the hostage-taking appeared to have been planned. Batham, who was out on bail for a year and a half in a 2001 murder case, had invited the children for his daughter’s birthday party.

Kanpur Inspector General Mohit Agarwal, who led the police team in the rescue operation, said Batham had accumulated some weapons and country-made bombs and may have planned to blow up the house.

The hostage drama started before 6 p.m. on Thursday and ended well past midnight.

Batham apparently kept the children confined to the basement of his home till police and local residents barged in.

As local people and policemen laid siege to the house in Kasaria village, the 40-year-old initially demanded that the cases against him be dropped.

“Batham was demanding withdrawal of a murder case and we assured that we will talk about it. When we told him that he would be provided a government house, his wife Ruby shouted back,”give ₹1 crore for each child and only then they will be released,” Mr. Agarwal said.

During the siege, Batham also sent out a letter addressed to the district magistrate, local people said.

In the letter, he reportedly complained that he was not allowed to make use of government schemes for housing and building toilets at home. He also alleged that he was being troubled by the Special Operation Group of police.

In 2001, he had allegedly stabbed another villager, Meghnad, to death in a dispute over a drain. He was also accused in three robbery cases.

According to local people, Batham had sold off his four-bigha piece of land and had no regular income.

Though they accepted the invitation to the birthday party for their children, the villagers described Batham as mentally unstable and claimed that people generally kept away from him.

Around 1 a.m., police barged into Batham’s house. Villagers claimed that they too went in around the same time.

While Batham was shot dead by police, local people caught hold of his wife, thrashing her and pelting stones at her, police said.

Superintendent of Police Anil Kumar Misra said she was initially rushed to a local hospital and later referred to Lohia hospital. She succumbed to her injuries there. All children were rescued safely from the basement, police said.

229,2020/01/31,FIR lodged against Bengal BJP president,"The Kolkata Police on Friday lodged a First Information Report (FIR) against West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Dilip Ghosh for allegedly making derogatory remarks towards a woman anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protester at a public rally on Thursday.

The FIR comes after the woman, a second year post graduate student of a city college, gave a written complaint at the Patuli Police Station. In her complaint, the woman has referred to remarks made by Mr. Ghosh to the media, and said she felt traumatised and feared for her life. In the complaint letter, the student has accused the BJP MP of “murderous intent along with sexual remarks”.

‘She was lucky’

The Bengal BJP president had told journalists on Thursday that the girl was lucky that “nothing more was done to her”.

“If they [the protesters] come close to our rally, then I’ll say it’s a good fortune of their fourteen generations that nothing more was done to her. There are lot of baghs [a reference to CAA protest ground Shaheen Bagh in Delhi], circus[es] where they can protest,” Mr. Ghosh said.

The State BJP president also said, “Why do such people have to come before our workers — to be in the news or become martyrs? This is very unfortunate. Nobody should do this. We have withstood a lot. We won’t withstand this kind of childish pranks.”

The police has pressed charges under Sections 354A (sexual harassment) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the Indian Penal Code against Mr. Ghosh.

Poster torn

According to eye witnesses, the woman was protesting against the CAA and also the possible countrywide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), when BJP activists led by Mr. Ghosh began a rally in support of the CAA in the Patuli area of the city.

The student was also carrying a poster that read: “No NRC, No NPR, No CAA”. When BJP supporters spotted her, they tore up the poster; some of them shouted ‘Jai Sri Ram’.

230,2020/01/31,"3 truck-borne militants killed, Pulwama attacker’s kin held","Three truck-borne Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) militants were killed at a toll plaza in Jammu’s Nagrota on Friday morning.

One of two persons arrested from the truck is a cousin of suicide bomber Adil Dar, who carried out a deadly attack in Pulwama last year and killed 40 CRPF jawans, the police said.

“The militants opened fire when a truck was stopped by a police team near the toll plaza, in which one policeman suffered bullet injuries, and is stable now. One terrorist was shot dead in the initial firing. Two others were killed in the combing operation launched in the nearby area, as they made an attempt to escape,” J&K Director General of Police (DGP) Dilbagh Singh said.

The incident took place at the Bann Toll Plaza on the Srinagar-Jammu Highwayaround 5 a.m., and the militants were hiding behind urea bags in the truck. “They were heading for Srinagar. The six weapons seized show that another group was waiting for them,” said DGP Singh.

Preliminary questioning of the two arrested persons, including the driver and the conductor, suggest that these militants belonged to the JeM. “They (slain militants) all appear to be Pakistani terrorists and had crossed the International Border (IB) from Dayalachak area on Thursday evening in Hira Nagar. They were picked up by the truck on Friday,” Mr. Singh added. “We were alert about their modus operandi and acted swiftly,” he added.

The arrested persons were identified as Maqbool Ahmad and Sameer Dar, both residents of Kashmir’s Pulwama. “One is a cousin of slain Adil Dar,” Inspector General of Police, Jammu, Mukesh Singh told The Hindu.

Dar rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF convoy in Pulwama on the Srinagar-Jammu highway on February 14 last year and killed 40 CRPF jawans, resulting in India’s air strikes inside Pakistan on terror camps. “Yes, the killing of these terrorists has averted a major attack,” said DGP Singh.

All parties except the Biju Janata Dal and the BJP extended their support to the protest.

More than 50 different organisations and political parties had joined hands for the massive protest.

They questioned why Muslims were deliberately kept out of the list of religious minorities, who have been allowed to go through a smooth process of securing Indian citizenship under CAA.

“The Narendra Modi government has announced the NPR exercise for preparing the NRC. The Naveen Patnaik government has extended its support to implementation of NPR in the State. It is unfortunate that BJD MPs supported the CAA Bill in Parliament,” said Suresh Panigrahi, a CPI(M) leader.

Similarly, Prafulla Samantra, a prominent mass movement leader, said, “The growth in rate of unemployment is disturbing. The economic growth has been consistently going downward. Farmer suicides are taking place every day. While the country is in the midst of a crisis, the Modi government is trying to establish a Hindu Rashtra.”

Mr. Samantra said the ‘agenda’ is to “annihilate minority communities, divide people on religious grounds and increase attacks on tribal and other downtrodden people.”

Mohammed Karim, who hails from Bhadrak district, said, “The policies of the Modi government have threatened the very existence of minority communities in the country.

A Sukhoi-30 MKI cockpit simulator upgraded by HAL will be unveiled.

“HAL is instrumental in organising major defence expos in the last couple of years. HAL’s indigenously designed and developed fixed and rotary wing [helicopter] platforms will steal the show,” a HAL release said quoting Chairman and Managing Director R. Madhavan.

Flying displays

Flying displays will also mainly feature HAL’s fighter planes and helicopters: the LCA; Rudra, which is ALH Mk IV; the LCH; the LUH and Do-228. Flying displays are part of a DefExpo for the second time this year — a trend started with the previous edition of 2018.

235,2020/01/31,Heavy police deployment for anti-CAA meeting in Pune,"Two major public meetings involving politicians and noted civil society activists protesting the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) were held in the city on Thursday evening under the shadow of heavy police deployment and protests from right wing outfits.

The police had sent notices under Section 149 [police to prevent cognisable offences] of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) to organisers of an anti-CAA meeting held at Kothrud’s Gandhi Bhavan on Martyr’s Day, which witnessed the participation of activist Teesta Setalvad, actress Urmila Matondkar and Bishop Thomas Dabre and was chaired by activist Dr. Kumar Saptarshi.

Calling CAA as a piece of “black legislation”, Ms. Matondkar said that the only way out of the pervasive instability in the country caused by the Modi government’s steamrolling of the CAA and the proposed implementation of the NRC was to take refuge in the ideals of peace and unity laid down by Mahatma Gandhi.

“It is all the more important to remember Gandhiji’s principles today in the midst of this chaos. It is not the Parliament or politicians who are the only representatives of this country, but the people…the CAA is not merely anti-Muslim, but anti-poor as well. Remember, Gandhiji was killed by a Hindu [Nathuram Godse],” she said, comparing the CAA with the draconian Rowlatt Act of 1919.

Ms. Setalvad said the only intention of the Modi government behind passing this contentious piece of legislation was to create instability in the country.

“Had Mahatma Gandhi been alive today, he would have fought tooth-and-nail against the socially divisive policies of the Modi government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),” she said.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr. Saptarshi said that this was not merely a fight of the minority community, but that of the whole country and one which should be fought in a spirit of amity.

Earlier, members of the fringe rightwing Hindu Rashtra Sena (HRS) and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had threatened to disrupt proceedings, prompting heavy police deployment at the venue.

Likewise, a robust security shield was in place for the second anti-CAA-NRC public meet at Sarasbaug which was addressed by NCP leader and Minister Jitendra Awhad and saw the participation of Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani and Congress MLA and Minister Vishwajeet Kadam, among others.

“The CAA and NRC is an attack on the Constitution. Do not let the country be taken over by the forces of fascism represented by the Modi-Shah government. If anyone comes at your doors demanding your papers and proof of citizenship, answer them by brandishing a copy of the Constitution,” said Mr. Awhad, addressing the packed audience.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/3d00j5/article30697086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BMPUNEPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/heavy-police-deployment-for-anti-caa-meeting-in-pune/article30697087.ece
236,2020/01/31,NIA moves Pune court for transfer of Elgaar Parishad case,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has filed an application before a special court in Pune seeking transfer of the Elgaar Parishad case records to the special NIA court in Mumbai.

According to sources, the agency filed the criminal miscellaneous application before Additional Sessions Judge (special) S.R. Navandar late on Wednesday.

The Pune court has posted the hearing on the matter for February 3.

Earlier this week, a three-member team from the NIA had met personnel of the Pune Police involved in the Elgaar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon case and held a review meeting.

The Pune Police reportedly told the NIA team that as documents pertaining to the case were being presented as evidence in court, they would be handed over to the agency after an order from the Maharashtra Director General of Police.

Pune Police had earlier denied that they did not provide the NIA team access to the Elgaar Parishad case documents, saying they would be given to the agency once due procedures were completed.

The Centre had announced the transfer of the probe into the Elgaar Parishad case, in which nine activists and intellectuals have been arrested so far for alleged Maoist links, from the Pune Police to the NIA prompting a tussle over control of the case with the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in the State.

Meanwhile, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh said on Thursday that his department was in the process of receiving the Centre’s communication regarding transfer of the case and the government would take a call on the matter in the next couple of days.

“The letter [from the Centre] is with the Law and Judiciary Department. It will come to the Home department by today evening. We will seek legal opinion on how to proceed and then consult with the Chief Minister [Uddhav Thackeray],” Mr. Deshmukh said.

Calling entire the Elgaar Parishad probe conducted by the Pune police as “phoney”, Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar said it was strange that the NIA now had to take recourse to courts in order to secure documents pertaining to the case.

Among those arrested in the case are poet-activist P. Varavara Rao, noted trade unionist Sudha Bharadwaj, activists Vernon Gonsalves, Arun Ferreira, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, advocate Surendra Gadling, Prof. Shoma Sen and writer-publisher Sudhir Dhawale – all of whom are lodged in Pune’s Yerwada prison.

The Pune City police’s case rests on an FIR registered at the city’s Vishrambaug police station (in January 2018) in connection with the Elgaar Parishad held at Pune’s Shaniwarwada Fort on December 31, 2017 as part of the bicentenary celebrations of the 1818 battle of Koregaon-Bhima.

The FIR, based on a complaint by one Tushar Damgude in the immediate aftermath of the Bhima-Koregaon clashes of January 1, was initially lodged against six participants, including Mr. Dhawale. Those named in the FIR were members of the Kabir Kala Manch – a radical Dalit cultural troupe.

The complainant had accused the KKM activists of making a number of “inflammatory” speeches and delivering “socially divisive” presentations during the course of the troupe’s performance and recitals at the Elgaar Parishad, which lasted nearly eight hours and witnessed the participation of thousands of persons from more than 250 progressive social outfits including several left-leaning and Ambedkarite groups across the State.

The raids and subsequent arrests of these prominent activists and academics were based on this FIR, with the Pune Police claiming to have extended the scope of investigations to unearth their alleged “Maoist links”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gnnnku/article30697058.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BMPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/nia-moves-pune-court-for-transfer-of-elgaar-parishad-case/article30697059.ece
237,2020/01/31,Dr. Kafeel Khan granted transit remand,"Dr. Kafeel Khan, who was arrested from the Mumbai international airport on Wednesday evening by the Special Task Force (STF) of the Uttar Pradesh Police, was produced before a metropolitan magistrate court in Bandra on Thursday afternoon amid heavy security.

As he was being led inside the court Dr. Khan told the media, “I was given a clean chit in the Gorakhpur [hospital deaths] case, now they are trying to frame me again. I would request the Maharashtra government to let me stay here as I do not trust U.P. police.”

Dr Khan was arrested under Section 153 (A) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) of the Indian Penal Code for allegedly delivering an inflammatory speech during a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at the Aligarh Muslim University in December last year.

Dr. Khan told the magistrate that he was not being given a lawyer and appealed to those in the courtroom, but no lawyer came forward.

However, after sometime, lawyers Md Shaukat Khan and Alka Sharma agreed to represent him. Dr. Khan then told the court, “U.P. police will kill me. The U.P. government is trying to falsely frame me. The court can watch the entire video (of the speech). I have not said anything provocative. But still, if the case against me has to be pursued, please keep me in Mumbai.”

Dr. Khan’s lawyer said that sedition charges were not applicable as he had only given his opinion on how CAA will impact Muslims.

“We fear that U.P. Police will kill him in an encounter. He got a clean chit in the Gorakhpur childrens death case. But because he is putting pressure on U.P. government to nab the actual culprits, he is being framed,” said the lawyer.

After the hearing, Mr. Shaukat Khan told the media, “There is an apprehension of an encounter but we were told he will be given complete protection by the Aligarh police. The court has granted a transit remand and he will be safely produced within three days before the Lucknow Chief Judicial Magistrate.”

Advocate Sharma also said, “According to Dr. Khan, he has been implicated by the UP Police as he was selected as the best paediatrician and was going to be given an award so all of this has been done to tarnish his image.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/9sdjao/article30697018.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31BMDRKAFEELKHAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dr-kafeel-khan-granted-transit-remand/article30697019.ece
238,2020/01/31,Guwahati gets more efficient airport system,"Guwahati has become the eighth Indian airport to implement an Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) system that improves the performance of airport operations and ensures a smooth arrival and departure sequence for airlines.

The A-CDM system, which was implemented in Guwahati on January 29, uses aircraft expected time of arrival, runway-in-use and runway handling capacity among other factors to determine the aircraft arrival and departure sequence. This aids in managing aircraft delays to helping reduce carbon emissions. Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Thiruvananthpuram have successfully used this system.

“The benefits of A-CDM are widely recognised in the aviation industry, notably its ability to improve efficiency of airport operations and reduce aircraft holding delays on the runway, consequently saving fuel and reducing carbon emissions,” a senior Airports Authority of India (AAI) official said.

Studies by AAI and other private airport operators have showed that A-CDM had resulted in higher coordination between all operational partners, improved ground handling processes and improved programmability due to increased stability for all operational processes (between airlines, airport operators and Air Traffic Control) based on reliable target times.

ICAO Asia Pacific Office has assigned AAI the task of drafting the Regional A-CDM implementation plan to India, with the support of International Air Transport Association, Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation and Singapore.

“A-CDM is a change of mindset and working methods involving the main stakeholders of an airport. This includes, at a minimum, the Air Navigation Service Provider, airport operator, ground handlers, and the airlines. The objective is to improve the performance of airport operations and provide overall better predictability, by enabling the stakeholders to work together as a team for mutual benefit,” the AAI official said.

The first successful adoption of A-CDM was done in 2015 at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, where software development, network design, hardware planning, live testing, implementation and software maintenance were all completed in-house by AAI.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/guwahati-gets-more-efficient-airport-system/article30696973.ece
239,2020/01/31,"‘Khadi not only a cloth, it’s a symbol of our identity’","Laying emphasis on the Gandhian principles of truth, simplicity and non-violence, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Thursday called for connecting the youths with khadi to instil self-respect and confidence among them. Adoption of khadi products would help end differentiation between the rich and poor, he said.

Mr. Gehlot, known as a votary of Gandhian philosophy, inaugurated an international conference on globalisation of khadi here. Gandhian thinkers, academicians, experts and fashion designers will deliberate on various aspects of Mahatma Gandhi's life, production capacity of khadi and export potential of khadi products during two days of the conference.

Women’s empowerment

Mr. Gehlot said khadi should be promoted in all sections of society, as it was not only a source of employment in the rural areas, but was also a major factor contributing to women’s empowerment. “Khadi is not only a piece of cloth. It is a symbol of our identity, which connects us with our history and traditions.”

The conference was organised jointly by the State Khadi & Village Industries Board and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Mr. Gehlot said the State government's recent decision to give 50% rebate in the prices of khadi clothes had led to an increase in their sale and immensely helped the khadi institutions.

The Chief Minister said the State government would formulate policies for promoting employment in the khadi sector and help establish khadi looms in the villages. This would also attract the younger generation to the khadi sector for livelihood opportunities, he added.

Industries Minister Parsadilal Meena, Chief Secretary D.B. Gupta, Gram Bharati Samiti chairman Bhawani Shankar Kusum, CII-Rajasthan chairman Anand Mishra, Additional Chief Secretary (Industries) Subodh Agarwal, designer-activist Shalini Sheth Amin and fashion designer Ritu Beri were among those who attended the inaugural session.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/atntsv/article30696913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30-KHADI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/khadi-not-only-a-cloth-its-a-symbol-of-our-identity/article30696914.ece
240,2020/01/31,"Kanhaiya kicks off protest march against CAA, NRC","Former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president and CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar on Thursday kicked off his month-long protest 0march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens from Bhitiharwa in West Champaran.

Mr. Kumar, along with his supporters and local party workers, were, however, prevented from addressing the meeting outside the Bhitiharwa Gandhi Ashram for some time as permission had been cancelled by the district administration because of Saraswati Puja. However, he was later allowed to address the meeting and begin his protest march.

“He [Kanhaiya Kumar] was neither detained not arrested… since his meeting was cancelled by the district administration last night to maintain law and orderon the occasion of Saraswati Puja, he was stopped from addressing the meeting for sometime,” said West Champaran District Magistrate Nilesh Ramchandra Deore.

Earlier, in a post on social media Mr. Kumar had said that he was being detained by the West Champaran police and was not being allowed to address the meeting and begin his protest march from Gandhi Ashram at Bhitiharwa. Speaking to local journalists he said, “The administration wants all Indians to show documentary proof of being citizens but the police is not showing him papers for his detention order.”

‘Deep-rooted conspiracy’

“They [the BJP government at the Centre] have used official machinery as a part of a deep-rooted conspiracy to gag the voice of the common people and derail my scheduled programme which is aimed at spreading awareness about CAA, NRC and NPR to the common people,” he said.

241,2020/01/31,Dream of promised land shattered for M.P. tribals,"Displaced from his village nestled inside the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri district two decades ago, Jadon Adivasi, 80, still nurses the hope of the promised two-hectare land that he could till, call his own, in another village.

“They can’t go back on the promise now. We survived on the hope of owning land for years; what other alternative do we have?” asks Mr. Adivasi, belonging to the particularly vulnerable Saharia tribe, trailing off.

Plan endorsed in 1999

The plan to allot agricultural land to 100 relocated tribal families of Balarpur village under the rehabilitation policy, endorsed in 1999 by the Congress government in the State of former Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh, approved by the Centre in 2000 and recognised by the Park’s authorities and the Madhya Pradesh Human Rights Commission in 2016, has been upended by the State’s Congress government now.

While back then 61 families, picked randomly first, got two acre agricultural land each, the remaining 39 awaited the allotment for 20 years only to be told they were ineligible. All the families were allotted a house and extended electricity and water supply though. “We depended on gathering forest produce inside the Park for years. But after relocation, we worked in stone mines and are now forced to migrate seasonally for agricultural labour,” said Mr. Adivasi.

In 2016, the Commission sought a report from the Park and district authorities on the delay in the allotment, to which the Director, recognising the pending allotment to the 39 families, replied the families meanwhile worked on fields of those with lands “of their own accord”, and would be allotted land on the Centre’s approval.

The allotment process was stalled when authorities belatedly noticed they had relocated families mistakenly on protected forest land instead of revenue. And diverting forest land for non-forests purposes violated the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. The State government then sought the land’s denotifcation from the Centre, pending clearance till date.

Admitting the allotment was pending, V.K. Sharma, draftsman at the Park, on authorisation from the Director, said, “We’d sent the proposal to the Centre in 2002. Once denotified, the land would be allotted to the remaining families.”

District Collector Anugraha P., however, deviating from the policy, which considered every adult a separate family, claimed the 39 families were ineligible, and there was no question of land allotment. “Revenue officials have inquired into the claims and come up with a list of ineligible claimants. Either they were not residing in the relocated village at the time or were minors. We have videographed contestations to the list, and heard their claim and perused documents too. Even five years years ago, they were considered ineligible.”

Bhupendra Kushwah, Tehsildar, went further to say the families were declared ineligible in 2001-2002 itself when others were allotted land in Budi Barod village. “In November this year we organised two camps to look into claims, and it attested to this,” he said.

In 2017, the Commission directed the district administration to speedily complete the rehabilitation process, including those of the remaining 39 families, that the administration considers ineligible, and reiterate its request to the Centre to denotify the land. Sighting the delay, it ordered Rs. 3 lakh as compensation to each family.

Pointing to the impact of working in hazardous conditions in the absence of promised land and alternative occupations, it noted several male members were forced to work in stone mines. “Male breadwinners like this have died due to tuberculosis and other diseases because of working in mines,” it said, directing the government to pay a compensation of Rs. 2 lakh to each such affected family.

‘Right to livelihood’

“If the government considers them ineligible, why did the Park misinform the Commission they would get the land? And how did the district authorities inexplicably upturn a policy approved by the Centre?” asked Abhay Jain, of Zenith Legal Aid Clinic, supporting the families. “It has been 14 years since the Forest Rights Act was passed. The families have all the documents and can easily be allotted land. It’s a question of their right to livelihood and life.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/59gevd/article30696887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30-DHARNA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/dream-of-promised-land-shattered-for-mp-tribals/article30696888.ece
242,2020/01/31,Amarinder slams Akali Dal for supporting BJP in Delhi polls,"A day after the Shiromani Akali Dal announced that it will support the BJP in the upcoming Delhi Assembly polls, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Thursday accused the party of bartering away Constitutional principles to promote its political interest.

Reacting to SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal’s remark that the party had thrown its weight behind the BJP in Delhi, the Chief Minister said these flip-flops had nailed the Akali lies on its stand on the ‘unconstitutional and divisive’ Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Referring to Mr. Sukhbir’s explanation for the “U-turn”, that the ‘miscommunication’ between the two parties had been sorted out, Capt. Amarinder demanded to know whether the BJP had agreed to amend the CAA in line with SAD’s earlier stand or the Akalis had once again surrendered themselves to the BJP at the cost of the nation’s interest.

“You owe an explanation to the people,” he said.

“SAD’s decision to backtrack on its earlier stand to extend its support to the BJP in Delhi just a week before the scheduled polls, indicated that they had used the CAA as a bargaining chip to secure some political gains,” said the Chief Minister. This development, he said, clearly exposed the selfish intentions of the Akalis and the Badal family’s desperation to hold on to power as part of the ruling alliance at the Centre.

“Rather than quit the ruling NDA, which would have been the right thing to do after claiming not to support the CAA without inclusion of Muslims, Mr. Sukhbir had chosen to stay with the BJP, whatever the cost for the people of India,” said the Chief Minister.

‘Akalis divided’

“SAD’s U-turn in Delhi had also further accentuated the divide within the Akalis, which appeared to be on the verge of another split,” said Capt. Amarinder, adding that the party was clearly a divided house and no longer capable of giving a political fight on its own and they need the BJP to hand-hold them on the political ladder.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/enwsxl/article30696879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30-AMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-slams-akali-dal-for-supporting-bjp-in-delhi-polls/article30696880.ece
243,2020/01/31,"After over month-long deadlock, finally signs of thaw in AMU","After more than a month-long deadlock between students and the Aligarh Muslim University administration, an atmosphere of dialogue emerged on Thursday.

Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor once again appealed to the students to return to classes through a video in which he pointedly addressed the issues. Prof. Mansoor “regretted” the events of December 15 when the administration called the police inside the campus and said “sorry” to the students who suffered injuries during police action.

“We have always depended on our proctorial team and on pro-proctors and members of the teaching staff to sort out any issue and we will keep depending on them in future too,” said the V-C.

On the number of FIRs registered against the students, he assured that the university would take up those cases and “no innocent person and student” would be “harassed or targeted”.

Prof. Mansoor further assured, “As far as other grievances of students are concerned, all things will be discussed once normalcy is restored.”

He stated that as an academic institution, AMU believed in democratic functioning. “Academic institutions have all the rights to argue, discuss and dissent, if necessary,” said the V-C.

Later, Deans of the faculties of arts, social sciences, and life sciences signed on letters of demands of the students. They were countersigned by the V-C.

However, some engineering students continued their protest. Students of Abdullah Girls College also boycotted classes on Thursday.

“It seems the university is limping back to normalcy. A large section of students returned to classes on Thursday. Exams were conducted in Unani and Ayurvedic Tibbia College. In some faculties, the university administration is considering rescheduling the exams as students have asked for time for preparation,” said university spokesperson Shafey Kidwai.

Sources said the “threat of sine die” worked and compelled students to return to classes. “Not just our careers, our protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would have suffered in case of sine die,” said a student, requesting anonymity. “See, even if the V-C resigned, the new incumbent would have asked them to return to classes and asked for some time to look into their demands,” said a teacher who was involved in breaking the deadlock.

Candlelight march

In a related development, students took out a candlelight march to condemn the incident of firing near Jamia Millia Islamia on Thursday in which a student was hurt.The Aligarh Muslim University Teachers’ Association also released a statement describing the incident as “barbaric and cowardly”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ci6sup/article30696859.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE30-MANSOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/after-over-month-long-deadlock-finally-signs-of-thaw-in-amu/article30696860.ece
244,2020/01/31,Massive protest against CAA-NPR-NRC in Odisha,"Thousands of protesters took to the streets here on Thursday opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

People under the banner of ‘We the people of India-Odisha’ took out a massive rally from Exhibition Ground to Mahatma Gandhi Marg, a two-km-long stretch. All political parties except Biju Janata Dal and BJP extended their support to the protest.

More than 50 organisations and parties had joined hands for the massive protest. They questioned why Muslims were deliberately kept out of the list of religious minorities who have been allowed to go through a smooth process to secure Indian citizenship under the CAA.

“The Narendra Modi government has announced the NPR exercise for preparing the NRC. The Naveen Patnaik government has extended its support to implementation of NPR in the State. It is unfortunate that BJD MPs supported the CAA Bill in Parliament,” said Suresh Panigrahi, a CPI(M) leader.

Prafulla Samantra, a prominent mass movement leader, said, “The growth in rate of unemployment is disturbing. The economic growth has been consistently going downward. Farmer are dying every day. While the country is in the midst of a crisis, the [Narendra] Modi government is trying to establish a Hindu Rashtra.”

Mr. Samantra said the “agenda is to annihilate minority communities, divide people on religious grounds and increase attacks on tribal and other downtrodden people”.

Mohammed Karim, who hails from Bhadrak district, said, “The policies of the Modi government have threatened the very existence of minority communities in the country. Now, Muslims are being treated as if they are not citizens of the country and the turn of other minority communities will come in future.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wz8cbd/article30696404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE31BHUBANEWARPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/massive-protest-against-caa-npr-nrc-in-odisha/article30696405.ece

After Will Young (54) completed his half-century, the host suffered a mini-collapse, losing three wickets cheaply but Cleaver (111 off 194 balls) and Mark Chapman (85 off 187 balls) resurrected the innings, adding an unbeaten 209 runs for the sixth wicket.

Cleaver sent the ball across the fence 16 times, while Chapman smashed eight boundaries in his innings.

At stumps, the duo was at the crease with New Zealand taking an overall lead of 169 runs.

On day one, India-A was all out for 216 in its first innings.

Resuming at 105 for two, overnight batsmen Young (54) and Ajaz Patel (38) added 66 runs before the former was sent back in the 49th over by S Sandeep Warrier.

Young’s 50 was laced with six boundaries, while Patel hit four fours and three sixes in his 66-ball innings.

In the 50th over, Glenn Phillips (4) was trapped in front of the wicket by Shahbaz Nadeem, while one over later Patel was dismissed by Warrier as the Kiwis slipped to 176 for five.

246,2020/01/31,"NZ vs IND T20I series | It shows character of the team, says Kohli","India captain Virat Kohli, on Friday, said he has learnt an important lesson in the back-to-back Super Over finishes against New Zealand.

“There’s something new I’ve learnt in the last couple of games: when the opposition is playing well, you stay calm till the end and try to come back,” Kohli said.

The India skipper said, having come out victorious in two consecutive Super Overs for the first time proves the character of the team.

Two in two

“We couldn’t have asked for more exciting games, we’ve never played Super Overs before and now we’ve won two. It shows the character of the team,” Kohli said.

Although Sanju Samson didn’t make any significant contribution in the match, Kohli said he initially thought of sending the Kerala batsman in the Super Over along side K.L. Rahul but eventually changed his mind. “Initially we thought of opening with Samson and KL in the Super Over, but then KL told me I should bat because of the experience and the options I’ll bring,” he said.

“His (Rahul’s) two strikes were crucial and then you knock the ball into the gap and take your team over the line. Sanju was fearless at the top of the order. He tried to take the momentum away, he should back himself.”

Praise for Saini

Kohli also lavished praise on young pacer Navdeep Saini, who went wicketless on Friday.

“Saini was impressive with his pace again. We were very proud with the way we went about it,” he said.

247,2020/01/31,"Under-19 World Cup: Pakistan beats Afghanistan, meets India in semifinals","A half-century from opener Muhammad Huraira on debut and a fine bowling performance powered Pakistan to a six-wicket win over Afghanistan in the ICC U-19 World Cup here on Friday, setting up an exciting semifinal against arch-rivals India.

Afghanistan fought hard after posting 189 but just did not have enough runs on the board. Huraira, playing his first game of the tournament, struck a match-winning knock in the fourth quarterfinal.

Qasim Akram (25 not out off 41 balls)and Mohammad Haris (29 not out off 43) saw the team through in just 41.1 overs.

Tahir Hussain (1/28 in 10 overs), Fahad Munir (2/29 in 7) and Mohammad Amir Khan (3/58 in 10) were the pick of the Pakistan bowlers.

Defending champions India and Pakistan play their semifinal in Potchefstroom on February 4. India had beaten Australia in their quarterfinal match.

Talking about the team’s performance, Pakistan captain Rohail Nazir said: “We dropped 2-3 early catches and had we held on, we could have restricted them to a lesser total. The spinners bowled really well in the middle overs and bowled them out for 190. The wicket was turning a bit and our plan was to rotate strike. The opening partnership was good and we played sensibly in the middle overs.”

On the India game, he added: “It is another game. India is a good side and we need to play good cricket. The crowd really motivated us, appreciated us and I hope they turn up for the semifinal and cheer for us.”

Afghanistan captain Farhan Zakhil said 189 was defendable.

“The wicket was good and our batsmen did not take responsibility. They bowled well and created the chances. 190 was a par score for our bowlers.

248,2020/01/31,"NZ vs IND T20I series | We will go for 5-0 series whitewash, says Manish Pandey","Crediting India’s second successive Super Over win against New Zealand on January 31 to the team’s never-say-die attitude, middle order batsman Manish Pandey said they will push for an unprecedented 5-0 series whitewash in the fifth T20 International.

A nervous New Zealand threw it away yet again as a perseverant India prevailed in the Super Over for the second successive time to take a 4-0 lead in the T20I series. The two sides meet for the final match at Mt. Maunganui on Sunday.

“It has been our motto, not only for these two matches, that till the time the last ball is bowled, we won’t give up any match. If you play with that intent you will get matches like these where you might get a Super Over, and you win from there,” Pandey said at the post-match conference.

“And now we have an opportunity to make it 5-0 and it will be really amazing to do that. Come the fifth match, we will look to go 5-0 up, that is our plan. Nobody has done it before and especially India has not done it before. So, I think it will be a great start to do that.”

Asked if the players believed they could pull off a Super Over win yet again as they did on Friday, Pandey said, “In the middle, it looked like we were a little easy on ourselves. But since it had happened the last game, we thought we had to bowl good balls and it is possible we push it to a Super Over. And then, as the balls went by and we reached the last two balls, we were certain that this would go to Super Over.

“We were ready for it in the back of our mind. We have very good bowlers and Shardul (Thakur) bowled a very good last over. For his effort, he deserved it that the game went into a Super Over,” said Pandey who made 50 not out off 36 balls.

India’s fielding once again came under focus, as windy conditions in Wellington did not aid them. Pandey said preparation was vital in such scenarios as it helps get the basics right.

“It becomes difficult to take high catches when there is stiff breeze or wind as the ball starts moving when coming down. Even if you set yourself nicely, the ball still moves around. We need to practice more so that it becomes easier in matches. It’s up to the individual how he prepares himself and sets himself,” he said.

Throughout the home season, the 30-year-old Pandey has been batting lower down the order, particularly at numbers five and six. Against Sri Lanka, West Indies and Bangladesh at home, and in New Zealand now, he seems to have settled for the finisher’s role.

“I have no choice. I have to be good with it. I have to start preparing my mind as a no. 6 batsman because normally I bat up the order, no. 3 or no.4. Here with the competition up the top, you just have to wait for your chances,” the right-handed batsman said.

“Today was the opportunity and I’ve been preparing myself as to how to bat at no. 6 and what kind of shots I can play, what kind of bowlers, and how many overs are left. It’s not an easy position to bat at no. 6, where you know you are the last main batsman and you have to play with the bowlers if anything happens up the top. That’s what happened today. I was pretty clear about my role.”

He said he was prepared to play percentage cricket, curb down on his shots and not be too expressive early in his innings.

“I just have to play those twos, look to rotate the strike. I’ve been working on that and today I thought it came off really well. If you want to bat at six, then you have to be pre-ready. The game is already set for you at no. 6 and you just have to sometimes go and perform at the speed that the previous batsmen have set for you,” Pandey said.

“Today, I had opportunity to bat a little early. Not too much to contribute the last couple of games, but today was my opportunity and I thought if I could use it to my advantage, that will be great for me and my side. Quite happy to be there in this position.”

Pandey, however, said he still relishes batting higher up at No. 3, like in the IPL. He also said that head coach Ravi Shastri has been helping him prepare to play the finisher’s role.

Luck went against us, says Munro

Colin Munro instead gave credit to the visitors, saying they “always” find a way to bounce back. Munro and Tim Seifert scored half-centuries to tie the scores at 165 runs each for both sides, but India held their nerves to end up victors in thrilling fashion for the second game running.

“That’s cricket isn’t it? We put ourselves in positions to win both of those games I thought. But India, with the roll they’re on at the moment and the cricket that they’re playing, they always just find a way. And then Super Over is a bit of luck each way. It can go either way I reckon,” he said.

“We’re all sitting in the sheds now and talking about it and hurting that we have let two games like that slip. And, I put my hand up too. We talk about running quickly between the wickets and then I was dawdling with that second one, and Kohli picks up and does some magical work and that’s it.

“There are a few guys that are hurting. But we are tight in our group and we will bounce back, come Sunday hopefully, he added.

Munro said New Zealand were happy with the target they had set for themselves. At one stage they were coasting through it, when Seifert and himself put on 74 runs for the second wicket. Regular wickets thereafter put paid to any chances of victory.

“I thought I should come out a bit harder and play some shots early. To be brutally honest, they’ve bowled really well to me after that first game in Eden Park. They’ve come straighter at me and put two guys out on the leg-side and sort of attacked my body a lot more.

“And the nature of the new-ball on this wicket and it was sticky and holding a bit every now and again. It probably was nice for me to show that maturity and getting through that tough phase against the new-ball and getting myself in and very disappointed with the way I got out but it’s nice to sort of contribute to a team total.”

However, it is not all doom and gloom for his team, feels Munro.

“It’s not like we’re being blown off the park. 202 in the first game and they chased it down. The only game where we probably didn’t step up to our standards was the second one at Eden Park, where we fell 15-20 runs short. I think we’ve been playing some good cricket. India have just been 1 or 2 per cent better than us, he said.

The turning point came when Virat Kohli’s speedy turn and throw ran Munro out. The batsman admitted he was caught unawares by the speedy fielding effort.

“I just saw Shardul throw towards the wicket-keeper’s end or the bowler’s end, whichever one it was, and I saw it going over and I thought oh well it’s going to the non-danger end for me, and when I saw Kohli catch the ball and spin around, then I thought crap I’m in a bit of trouble here. And then he hit like he usually does.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/l75jw2/article30704454.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MANISHPANDEY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-fourth-t20-international-in-wellington/article30704455.ece

250,2020/01/31,From 2008 to 2020: New Zealand’s sorry run in Super Overs,"New Zealand’s morale-crushing loss to India in the fourth T20 International here on Friday was their seventh in eight Super Over finishes and in most of those defeats, they had only themselves to blame.

New Zealand have lost six Super Over T20I matches out of seven while the sole defeat in ODIs came in the 2019 World Cup final against hosts England when they did not deserve to lose but were denied a maiden crown by a boundary count rule.

While the cricketing fraternity empathised with New Zealand following a heart-breaking result in the World Cup final, the last two T20Is against India have exposed their mental fragility in high-pressure situations.

On Wednesday, the Black Caps needed only two runs off four balls for a win with six wickets in hand during the regulation time. On Friday, they committed suicide after needing 11 runs off 12 balls with seven wickets to spare.

New Zealand have let the pressure get the better of them as their last Super Over win came way back in 2010, against Australia in Christchurch.

New Zealand’s record in Super Over finishes:

T20I v WI Auckland 2008 (Lost)

T20I v Aus Christchurch 2010 (Won)

251,2020/01/31,NZ vs IND fourth T20I: India beats Kiwis again via Super Over to take 4-0 lead,"A nervous New Zealand threw it away yet again as a perseverant India prevailed in the Super Over for the second successive time to take a 4-0 lead in the T20 International series in Wellington on Friday.

Needing just 11 runs off the last two overs with seven wickets in hand, New Zealand dug a hole for themselves yet again, taking the game to a Super Over two nights after doing the same in Hamilton.

New Zealand managed 13 runs in six balls and India got there effortlessly.

KL Rahul smashed 10 runs off the first two balls before he was caught. Then, a fired-up Virat Kohli and Sanju Samson finished the game in style.

Earlier, Manish Pandey proved his value to the team with an unbeaten 50 off 35 balls, taking India to 165 for eight from 88 for six in the 12th over.

India’s total wasn’t enough considering the batting-friendly conditions but the hosts made life a lot tougher for themselves from a commanding position before succumbing to pressure.

The entertaining knocks from Colin Munro (64 off 47) and Time Seifert went in vain (57 off 39).

Mohammed Shami, who was rested on Friday, had bowled a brilliant 20th over on Wednesday and man of the match Shardul Thakur was up to the task this time, conceding just six runs when the opposition needed seven for victory.

With the series already in the bag, India gave opportunity to Sanju Samson, Washington Sundar and Navdeep Saini for the first time in the five-match series, resting Rohit Sharma, Ravindra Jadeja and Shami. However, none of them was able to make an impact in the game.

Chasing 165, New Zealand lost Martin Guptill early. But Munro and Seifert put on 74 runs for the second wicket to put themselves on track.

Munro scored a half-century of 38 deliveries, inclusive of six fours and three sixes. He was out against the run of play as Kohli’s direct hit surprisingly found the target after a relay throw from the deep.

It was the turning point as New Zealand lost regular wickets. Yuzvendra Chahal bowled Tom Bruce (0), but Seifert found a partner in Ross Taylor as they pushed the score past 150 in the 18th over.

Seifert scored a half-century off 32 balls, including four fours and three sixes. But the great choke was yet to come again. Needing 18 off 18, the Black Caps lost four wickets in the last over bowled by Thakur.

Taylor holed out of the first ball, while Seifert was run out two balls later. Daryl Mitchell (4) was caught next and Mitchell Santner (2) couldn’t steal two runs off the last ball as the sides engaged in a tie-breaker for the second game running.

This was after New Zealand won a fourth consecutive toss and opted to field. Kane Williamson didn’t take part in the match owing to a shoulder niggle.

Tim Southee was the stand-in skipper, with the Black Caps making two changes.

Put in to bat, the visitors were struggling at 88-6 at one stage before Pandey’s lonesome rescue act took them to a respectable total. KL Rahul contributed 39 runs off 26 balls, inclusive of three sixes and two fours.

Leg spinner Ish Sodhi got into the act and ran through India’s batting order. First to go was Shreyas Iyer (1) and then Shivam Dube (12) was caught at mid-wicket.

Sodhi finished with 3-26 while Santner dismissed Sundar for nought as the New Zealand spinners rounded up a good outing with 4-54 in eight overs.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wye5wr/article30702943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIANTEAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/india-tour-of-new-zealand-new-zealand-vs-india-fourth-t20-international-in-wellington/article30702944.ece
252,2020/01/31,Australia U-19 cricketers face sanctions for mocking fans,"Cricket Australia is considering sanctions and “cultural sensitivity training” for members of its men’s Under-19 squad over social media comments seen as mocking non-English speakers.

The governing body said it was “extremely disappointed” by the incident during the ongoing World Cup in South Africa, which it reported to the International Cricket Council.

The fallout followed batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk posting “Quarter-final here we come” on Instagram ahead of their clash with India on Tuesday, with several teammates including Oliver Davies and Liam Scott replying in language interpreted as mocking non-native English speakers.

Cricket Australia’s head of integrity and security Sean Carroll said the “inappropriate language” was not acceptable.

“Some of that language could be interpreted as ridiculing non-native English language speakers,” he said in a statement late on Thursday.

“I have spoken to the players and expressed in no uncertain terms that such language has no place in society and falls well short of the standards we expect as Australian cricketers,” he added.

“The players have apologised for the language and have taken down the posts.” Sanctions were being considered, including education and cultural sensitivity training.

“Most of the players do not have their parents present with them in South Africa and some of them are minors,” he said.

“Accordingly, we believe it is appropriate to consider sanctions upon their return home.” The U-19 World Cup began on January 17 and runs until February 9.

253,2020/01/31,"Harmanpreet, bowlers star as India women beat England by 5 wickets","Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur struck an unbeaten 42 following a fine bowling performance to set up India’s five-wicket win over England in the first match of the women’s triangular T20 series here on Friday.

Indian spinners Rajeshwari Gayakwad (2/19), Deepti Sharma (2/30)and left armer Radha Yadav (1/33) restricted England to 147 for seven in stipulated 20 overs, while right-arm medium pacer Shikha Pandey (2/33) accounted for two at the Manuka Oval.

Harmanpreet took the run chase deep after the Indian top order, including the 15-year-old Shafali Verma (30), Smriti Mandhana(15) and Jemimah Rodrigues (26) squandered good starts.

Veda Krishnamurthy (7) and Taniya Bhatia (11) also failed to stay on the crease as England bowlers struck at regular intervals.

With six needed off the last over, Harmanpreet, whose innings was studded with five boundaries until then, hit a towering six to take India to 150 for five and end the match in style with three balls to spare.

Earlier, put in to bat, England suffered a top order batting collapse as openers Amy Jones (1) and Danni Wyatt (4) were dismissed cheaply.

Natalie Sciver (20) and Fran Wilson (7) soon followed, leaving England reeling at 59 for four in 10 overs.

Skipper Heather Knight then took charge, hitting a brisk 44-ball 67. Her innings was laced with eight boundaries and two sixes.

Wicketkeeper Tammy Beaumont supported her captain with a 27-ball 37. The duo helped England post a fighting total.

254,2020/01/31,Ranji Trophy | Karnataka pulls off an emphatic win,"Towards the fag end of play on day three, Karnataka was fighting to take the first-innings lead. Less than two sessions later, the visitors walked away with an emphatic 10-wicket win on Thursday, and a bonus point to boot. Host Railways was left wondering what it needs to do in the next four days, ahead of its final Elite Group B game.

Turning point

Throughout this season, Karnataka has fallen back on its bowling unit to avoid defeats. Through this period, Ronit More had played second-fiddle to the other quicks. That changed an hour after lunch, the 28th over of Railways’ second innings being the turning point.

Dinesh Mor skied a bouncer to Devdutt Padikkal at gully off the first ball; Avinash Yadav saw his off stump go cartwheeling and Pradeep Poojar found the ball hitting his pads in front off the last ball.

Roar

And Railways became 63 for eight from 63 for five. The roar that accompanied each of those wickets was testimony to how much it meant to More and his team.

A ball later opener Mrunal Devdhar — top-scorer with 38 in a lonely battle — edged to K.V. Siddharth at first slip. Railways lost its last five wickets for 16 runs to be bowled out for 79 but the rot began much before.

On a day when the sun shone bright, the slight nip in the morning helped the ball move through air and Abhimanyu Mithun and Prateek Jain kept Railways on the backfoot.

“We were not really sure (of a win) but we had a plan to make the batsmen play and executed it well. Mithun and Prateek got early wickets which was crucial and then we kept the momentum going,” More said later.

Too defensive

Railways coach Yousuf Ali Khan blamed his batsmen for being too defensive. “Our batting has repeatedly collapsed. Losing by 10 wickets and playing two innings in just over two sessions of play is not acceptable,” he said.

The day began with Karnataka trying to build on its slender 17-run first-innings lead and managed to extend it to 29 before the innings wrapped up.

The hara-kiri by Railways batsmen meant the lead was more than enough and with just 51 to win, makeshift opener Rohan Kadam and Padikkal cantered past the total in 8.2 overs, just before tea.

255,2020/01/31,Richa — the most complete package,"Richa Ghosh is the surprise package in the Indian team for the women’s T20 World Cup. She is also one of the most complete packages.

The 16-year-old can bat, keep wickets and bowl medium-pace. “I know it is unusual for a player to be both a ’keeper and bowler, but I don’t want to stop doing either,” Richa told The Hindu in a chat.

Richa, who hails from Siliguri, said there were occasions when she was both a wicketkeeper and a bowler in the same match. “There have also been tournaments where I had to keep wickets in one match and bowl in the next,” she said. “I know my role is primarily that of a batter. And I like to play aggressively.”

Heroes

An admirer of Sachin Tendulkar and M.S. Dhoni, she has high respect for Harmanpreet Kaur, India’s captain at the T20 World Cup. “I also like the batting of Shafali Verma who, too, is very young like me,” she said. “It’s great that the team has a few other teenagers in the World Cup team like Jemimah Rodrigues and Radha Yadav.”

With plenty of experience in the form of Harmanpreet, Smriti Mandhana, Deepti Sharma and Poonam Yadav, she feels India — which begins its campaign in the triangular series against England (Australia is the third team) at Canberra on Friday in the build-up to the T20 World Cup — has the team to win the trophy Down Under. “But, of course you never can say what is going to happen in T20s,” she said. “My dream is for India to win the World Cup and to make my own contribution.”

Shocked!

She, however, wasn’t quite expecting to be on the flight to Australia. “Though I had done well at the Challenger Trophy at Cuttack recently, I was shocked when I came to know that I had made it to the team,” said Richa. “Playing for India has always been my goal ever since I became serious about cricket after I was introduced to the sport by my father.”

She used to be the only girl in the local club at Siliguri then. “That has changed,” she said. “Now so many girls are playing cricket. The live telecast of women’s matches and the extensive coverage in newspapers and online have all helped.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/8rz67h/article30695641.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31RICHA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/richa-the-most-complete-package/article30695642.ece
256,2020/01/31,Ranji Trophy | Match drawn as weather has final say,"Bad light followed by 10 minutes of heavy shower disrupted play on the final day as the Ranji Trophy Elite Group-A match between Bengal and Delhi ended in a draw at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday.

Delhi added 25 runs, punctuated by a break due to foggy and overcast conditions, to its overnight total to reach 242 for seven.

The unbeaten pair of Jonty Sidhu (49 overnight), and Subodh Bhati, resuming from seven, put up a fight to gather 24 runs off six overs in 25 minutes before the first stoppage.

Raising hopes

Sidhu reached a deserving half-century and Bhati picked up some boundaries to raise Delhi's hope of overhauling Bengal’s first innings total of 318.

They returned after 33 minutes to add a run in one over before returning to the pavilion again due to bad light.

Heavy rains made the Eden look like a pool of water, but the groundsmen worked hard for two-and-a-half hours to dry it up.

Wet patches

However, the umpires decided to call off the match as they spotted some wet patches in the outfield during inspection around 3.30 p.m.

Only 16.3 overs could be bowled in the last two days due to rain and bad light. As the first innings remained unfinished, both teams got one point each.

“We are playing well and have to win the remaining matches (in Jaipur and Patiala) to reach the knockout stage,” said Bengal’s stand-in skipper Manoj Tiwary.

“We wanted to go for three points, our boys put up a fight,” said Delhi coach K.P. Bhaskar. Delhi will play its next two matches at home.

Bengal, which played three rain-affected matches at the Eden this season, slipped to fifth and Delhi to ninth in the Group A and B combined standings.

The scores:

257,2020/01/31,Ranji Trophy | What ails Kerala cricket?,"Who knows, Jalaj Saxena’s men may prove everybody wrong in that match against Vidarbha: they may take it to the third day, or the fourth even, may avoid a defeat or even stave off relegation.

But even if they do, the fact will remain that they have underperformed greatly. There is an even more worrying fact: the future isn't looking all that bright.

Urgent need

If the administration doesn’t get its act together, Kerala’s show in the last two editions of the Ranji Trophy could soon seem like a fond, distant memory. Last season, it had reached the semifinals and before that, the quarterfinals, for the first time in history.

To do so well for two years in a row was a fantastic feat, no doubt. From those great heights, Kerala has fallen with a deafening thud. It has lost five of its seven games this season.

Only the defeat against Hyderabad took four days, and that too because much of the opening day was lost to bad weather. The Rajasthan match was over in two days, while the others barely lasted three.

Several factors have contributed to Kerala’s dismal show, such as the decision to play all its home matches on the turning track at Thumba (Thiruvananthapuram), some strange moves by the sacked captain Sachin Baby (like choosing to bat first in Hyderabad when the conditions were ideal for bowling), the unavailability of key men like Sandeep Warrier and Sanju Samson for a few matches and a total lack of application by the top-order.

Then there was the issue of selection, like that of Abhishek Mohan, a 27-year-old seamer. Five years after his forgettable debut in 2014, he was recalled for the match against Rajasthan, that too, when he hardly looked fit enough to play at the First Class level.

Surely a bowler from the junior squads should have been given an opportunity. Batsmen from those teams, like Vatsal Govind, have to be groomed too.

KCA’s folly

As for bowling, pace remains Kerala’s strength. Warrier, Basil Thampi, K.M. Asif and M.D. Nidheesh are all fine bowlers, but the question is whether the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) is doing enough to spot new talents and nourish them.

Some of the decisions the KCA took, like the one to close down the district-level academies, is likely to impact the game negatively in the long run.

Strangely, the association seems to be more interested in spending money on building cricket stadia all over Kerala. Why do you need so many quality grounds in a small State, at the expense of academies?

The KCA should also take a closer look at its domestic competitions. It is high time the Jacob Trophy – which used to be the selection tournament for the Ranji — is revived.

Not only would that give fringe players an opportunity, it would make the process of selection transparent.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/tr5hrk/article30695313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH31KERALA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ranji-trophy-what-ails-kerala-cricket/article30695314.ece

He said that 20% wage hike would cost only ₹ 11,200 crore to the government, which it is refusing for the last three years. “But the Centre is keen on waiving loans given to corporate”, he said.

Mr. Swaminathan said that transaction worth ₹ 1,000 crore were affected on Friday and their strike on Saturday would further affect banking operations.

It also levied the fine of ₹1 crore on the firm, for failing to register the project as an ongoing project under RERA.

Sahara Housing Investors Association had moved TNRERA seeking a slew of relief measures for non-delivery of the project, stating that its members have invested nearly ₹100 crore. The proposed project was on 112.14 acres in Saravanampatti village, Coimbatore District.

TNRERA noted that the project was promoted from 2003-2004 onwards and had collected ₹91.31 crore from the buyers. The project came to an standstill at the end of 2013, after the Supreme Court verdict on the Sahara Group.

“The multi-storeyed flats, row houses etc. which were booked by the buyers have not been completed along with various common amenities promised by the developer till date and the project is very much an ongoing project,” the Authority said.

It also noted that the project is badly delayed and noted that Sahara is not in a position to complete the project.

TNRERA directed the Association to apply for registration of the project after obtaining renewal/planning permission from the concerned Planning Authorities. It also directed Director of Town and Country Planning to accord renewal/revised planning permission, as per statutory requirements.

It also restrained Sahara Group from proceeding further in any manner in respect of the project and directed Sahara Prime City Ltd to execute the sale deed for undivided share/plots in respect of the allottees as well as execute the sale deed conveying the common areas in favour of the Association, within three months of the order dated 30.1.2020.

274,2020/01/31,Lack of regulations persists for omni buses,"The recent special drive conducted by the Transport Department officials here where 325 omni buses were fined and 11 buses were impounded, has brought to light once again the persistent lack of regulations for omni buses.

Between January 11 and 21, 10 teams under the various Regional Transport Offices (RTO) in Coimbatore, Tiruppur and Nilgiris districts inspected over 2,000 omni buses. The total fine amount collected during the special drive was ₹ 6.87 lakh, according to officials. The violations included charging of excess fare, lack of renewal of fitness certificates (FC) and defaulting on payment of road tax.

Consumer activist K. Kathirmathiyon said that the Transport Department has not fixed any specific fares for omni buses. “When the fare is not fixed, where is the question of excess fare?” he asked.

A transport official from one of the RTOs said that it is difficult to detect excess fares and that the officials crack down on those omni buses that charges exorbitant fares. As the fares are not fixed, the omni buses across the State run on contract carriage basis, where the passenger agrees to pay the bus operator the fare amount for travel. “Even if the omni bus associations come forward and fix fares, it might be regulated,” the official said, further accusing the omni buses of misusing the lack of regulations in fares.

Any passenger may observe the number plates on omni buses bear NL (for Nagaland) or PY (Puducherry) as opposed to TN (Tamil Nadu). Most of the omni buses prefer to be registered in northeastern States or Union Territories as the road taxes and vehicle registration fees are less when compared to Tamil Nadu. “The State government has not introduced bus body codes for omni buses yet,” the official said, pointing to yet another lacuna in the State government’s regulation mechanism for omni buses. Due to this, the Transport Department does not possess adequate data on the number of omni buses plying in Coimbatore and other cities, the official claimed. On this, Mr. Kathirmathiyon said that registering outside the State is legal as long the omni bus duly pay the road taxes.

Special drives are being held only during festival seasons such as Pongal, Deepavali and puja holidays and during weekends, during which more omni buses ply more frequently. “Nearly 80% of the omni buses ply during the weekends and only about 60% buses during weekdays,” the transport official said. In Coimbatore, the checks for omni buses are being conducted at locations such as Kaniyur toll plaza, Pollachi Road and Omni Bus Stand at Gandhipuram.

However, Mr. Kathirmathiyon urged that the Transport Department must conduct sustained checks throughout the year to ensure that the omni buses comply to the rules. “Conducting checks only during festival seasons cannot be adequate,” he opined.

R. Baskaran, president of Tamil Nadu Omni Bus Owners’ Association, Coimbatore, said that omni buses charge excess fares during weekends and festival seasons to compensate for the losses incurred during the weekdays, where the omni buses see less patronage. “None of the omni bus owners are happy,” he remarked, claiming that omni buses charge less than ₹ 1 per km in the weekdays. “We cannot drive at this fare every day,” he said, further accusing the transport officials of imposing heavy fine on omni buses. The State government must come forward to fix the fares for omni buses at the earliest, Mr. Baskaran said, who estimated that around 200 omni buses are being operated in Coimbatore city and over 4,000 buses across the State.

The transport official said that the department is currently considering to fix fares for omni buses in the State and that relevant discussions are on.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/4us7ic/article30697917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB31OMNIBUSSTAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lack-of-regulations-persists-for-omni-buses/article30696290.ece
275,2020/01/31,Aspirants throng The Hindu’s education fair,"The second and final day of the 17th edition of The Hindu Education Plus International Education Fair here on Thursday saw a good turnout of students looking for various overseas educational opportunities.

The fair was held at Mahatma Gandhi Central Library at Kumaraguru College of Technology. Shankar Vanavarayar, Joint Correspondent, Kumaraguru College of Technology, lit the traditional lamp to begin the second day of the fair.

Aspirants must not look at overseas education from only a job-seeking perspective but as a way to bring back ideas and partnerships, Mr. Vanavarayar told The Hindu. “The new Indian must be a transitory person,” he said, asserting that students from India needed the exposure that came with overseas education.

Representatives from premier foreign universities in countries including the Netherlands and Italy, visa counsellors and education loan providers were present at the fair. They interacted with students on the available opportunities. Seminars on higher education opportunities were also held.

Archana Surendran, representing Istituto Marangoni Mumbai (originally started in Milan, Italy in 1935), said students from Coimbatore expressed more interest in courses on interior designing than courses on fashion. The Mumbai branch offered both undergraduate and postgraduate courses and provided multiple overseas opportunities.

Though Indian students generally preferred English-speaking countries such as the U.S., U.K. and Australia, they might not face any language barrier in the Netherlands, said Hub Nijssen, Senior Internationalisation Officer of Radboud University. With the tuition fees regulated by the European Union, Indian students could pursue higher education at a lower cost than in the usual destinations, he said.

Immanuel Rup Kumar from Kings Cornerstone International College, Chennai, commended the footfall and quality of students who turned up on the first day of the fair. The institution provided two-year courses based on curricula followed in the UK, after which students could pursue higher education at universities in Ireland and Australia, he said.

B. Krithika, a third-year undergraduate student specialising in biotechnology at KCT, said she visited the fair looking for postgraduate courses in the field of biotechnology in countries such as Canada, New Zealand and the UK. S. Vishnu Ram, a fourth-year mechanical engineering student from another private college, said he visited the fair looking for opportunities in Canada to specialise in industrial engineering.

276,2020/01/31,Consul General calls for stronger ties between industries in Coimbatore and Thailand,"The trade and industry in Tamil Nadu and Thailand have immense opportunities to tap by strengthening their co-operation, said Nitirooge Phoneprasert, Consul General of Royal Thai Consulate General - Chennai, here on Wednesday.

Giving away the G.K. Sundaram awards, he said the bilateral trade between India and Thailand was $ 12.46 billion in 2018. It is expected to touch new heights this year.

Trade missions organised in September last year and January this year are expected to generate $ 400 million business.

Last March, some of the industrial associations here had signed agreement with the industry associations in Thailand. Governments of India and Thailand have recognised each other as a strategic partner and Thailand is the gateway to south Asia.

The industries and trade in Tamil Nadu should foster ties with those in Thailand, he said.

B.K. Krishnaraj Vanavarayar, chairman of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Coimbatore, said the society should recognise the deserving people at the right time. Coimbatore has made it to the top because of entrepreneurship. The Chamber, which focuses on promotion of trade and industry, has instituted the awards to recognise entrepreneurs who excel and sustain and give a meaning to their work.

V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of the Chamber, said the awards were given away every alternate year under three categories - industry, trade, and service.

A.V. Varadarajan, former president of the Chamber, spoke about the contributions of G.K. Sundaram for the development of the industry here.

G.K. Sundaram Award is instituted by the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore.

The recipients of the award this year are KPR Mill in the industry category, Maheshwary Marbles in trade category, and KGiSL in the service category.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/edmtrp/article30696270.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB31SUNDARAMAWARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/consul-general-calls-for-stronger-ties-between-industries-in-coimbatore-and-thailand/article30696271.ece
277,2020/01/31,Ode to Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra,"The ninth edition of the Kelucharan Guna Keertanam festival curated and convened by Dr. Aparupa Chatterjee, artistic director of Odissi Dance Company, and ODC in association with Nalanda Dance Research Centre, was presented at Kanakasabha.

“Guruji has left behind vibrant memories that will stay with us for a lifetime. It is the duty of disciples to carry forward his priceless legacy, in performing, teaching and in recognizing artistic merit in our environment,” adds Aparupa.

ODC aims at an international cultural exchange and a global arts initiative through encouraging America born Odissi students to bring Odissi dance in the Srjan style back to the Indian community.

Preetisha Mohapatra, daughter and disciple of Sujata Mohapatra, began with a Vinayaka stotram. She also performed a pallavi in ‘Purnanga baradi’ with neat body lines.

Aleena Acharya’s Yahi Madhava was an emotive journey bringing out the pangs of Radha. The ashtapadi choreographed by Kelucharan Mohapatra was set in Sindhubhairavi, Taal Triputa.

Jhelum Paranjape presented ‘Bhakti,’ an abhinaya, based on Chokha Mela’s abhangs, transporting viewers to a spiritual plane. Chokha was 14th Century Saint of Maharashtra.

Music composed by Manoj Desai, choreographed and presented by Jhelum, the piece was steeped in sensitivity.

Aruna Mohanty clarified through her recital that the hero is not relevant without the anti-hero. Pratinayaka is a concept based on Indian aesthetics where he is a prototype of the Nayaka. Researched material rendered with creative methodology by Aruna added to visual delight.

“I am therefore you are,” this existential monologue of Pratinayaka in every age in Indian mythology, was echoed by Aruna. In Satya yuga it was Narasimha and Hiranyakashipu, in Treta yuga — Rama and Ravana, in Dwapara it was Krishna and Kamsa and in Kali yuga, Kali itself is Pratinayaka. Devil and divinity represented by both nayaka and pratinayaka can be discovered in every soul, in every human being.

Text from Bhagavata Mahapurana, lyrics and linking by Kedar Mishra, music composition by Ramhari Das, rhythm composition by Dhaneswar Swain and Bijaya Kumar Barik, dance choreography by Aruna Mohanty enabled a comprehensive and convincing production.

Aparupa Chatterjee, senior disciple of Ratikant Mohapatra and a former repertory dancer of Srjan, chose Brajaku chora asichi, an Oriya abhinaya piece in Ananda Bhairavi and was convincing in her portrayal. An appealing composition by Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra, reflecting the timeless maternal instincts, the love and patience of mother Yashoda in her endless efforts to put Krishna to sleep was presented by Aparupa, with endearing vatsalya rasa.

Aparupa and disciples presented an intelligently choreographed ‘Vande Mataram’. Set in raag Desh, the well-choreographed and well-coordinated group presentation led by Aparupa Chatterjee included Yashaswini Rraghuram, Divya Srinivasa, Divya Chowdhary, Tanvi Prasad and Pritika Sen.

Stories of Rama and Krishna

Perfect technique and polished grace were the hallmarks of Sujata Mohapatra’s presentation of select excerpts from the Ramayana.

Donning multiple roles with quick changes in stance, Sujata conveyed the essence of the epic with dexterity and dramatic delineation.

After a series of Odissi pieces, Sukanya Kumar presented a tillana in Brindavana Saranga, followed by a Sammohana Krishna stotram in Bharatanatyam format. Her presentation was fast-paced interlaced with sculpted stances and suitable bhava conveying a sense of soothing sobriety.

It was home ground for Deepak Mazumdar, senior performer, alumni and faculty of Nalanda. As customary he impacted with his prowess in abhinaya.

Krishna prevails upon Yashoda to tell him a bed time story. As she relates the story of Rama, Krishna finds a connect and orders Lakshmana to give him his weapons. Yashoda, innocent mother attributes this behavior to some black magic and evil eye spell. The lyrics from Krishna Karnamrutam was explicitly expressed through communicative facial expressions.

Vaidehi Rele, granddaughter of Kanak Rele, presented Sundara Gopalam, from Krishnashtakam, with involvement.

Mera Shyam by Utsav Music, produced and conceptualised by Churchill Pandian, music scored by Praveen D Rao, was an interesting synthesis of poetry, music, movement and moods, a compact capsule that highlighted Krishna cognizance.

Presented in well-knit segments of Kuchipudi by Prateeksha Kashi, Kathak by Rujuta Soman, Bharatanatyam by Vaidehi Rele, Odissi by group from ODC, Mera Shyam celebrated Krishna as the Divine Lover. It was a symbiotic, symbolical sequencing, suggesting how the jeevatma is ever in pursuit of the Paramatma.

After a brief introductory ensemble by the group, Prateeksha opened with Pravesha Dharuvu of Satyabhama.

Shakunalu Dharuvu was set in Mohanam and Chaturashra Ekam.

Rujuta Soman showcased Mira. Through agile movements she brought out the independence of Mira’s love and devotion.

Vaidehi Rele presented the Krishna ashtakam of vallabhacharya in Ragamalika, talam Adi. Interwoven with slokam Kasturi tilakam and nritta jatis describing the apparent and inner qualities of Krishna, the piece was presented with elegance and élan.

In conclusion, ODC presented Chandana Charchita, ashtapadi choreographed by Aparupa. Set in abhang style, with music by O.S Arun it was all about the Krishna’s pranks with the gopis in the Brindavan, as described to Radha by her Sakhi. The gopis beaming and rejoicing was the perfect finale to Mera Shyam.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/kkyw41/article30703210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/31frKelucharan2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/ode-to-guru-kelucharan-mohapatra/article30703212.ece
278,2020/01/31,Court seeks police reply on plea seeking ‘fair’ probe into Jamia violence in December,"A Delhi court on Friday sought a response from the city police on a plea claiming that the agency was not conducting a fair probe into the violence during an anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest near Jamia Millia Islamia University last month.

The petitioner also sought a court-monitored investigation into the incident. Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gurmohina Kaur directed the Delhi Police to file its reply by February 5.

The plea was filed by All India Students’ Association (AISA) secretary Chandan Kumar who was booked in connection with the violence on December 15 last year.

Advocate Adit S Pujari, appearing for Mr. Kumar, had earlier claimed before the court that police were not carrying out a “fair” probe in the case.

Mr. Pujari had also said that the Delhi Police’s Crime Branch should investigate personnel of the Jamia Nagar police station who allegedly entered the varsity’s campus without permission on December 15 and attacked students.

“Police cannot enter a library on a university campus and start hitting people. Let the Crime Branch also investigate the police personnel of Jamia Nagar Police Station. Police are not conducting a fair investigation. They are only seeing one side of the coin, not the other,” Mr. Kumar’s counsel had said.

He had said that, according to media reports, 102 arrests have been made so far in the case and police should be directed to produce footage from at least one CCTV camera that shows the arrested were involved in the violence.

Mr. Pujari also claimed that the seizing of Mr. Kumar’s mobile phone by police violated his fundamental rights.

He claimed that Mr. Kumar was not allowed to consult his lawyer when he was called for questioning by police.

Mr. Kumar’s plea, filed through advocates Mr. Pujari and Kriti Awasthi, sought monitoring of the investigation “as the investigating agency, while shielding its own policemen who wreaked havoc on the premises of Jamia Millia Islamia University, has proceeded to name the applicant [Kumar], who is a peace-loving citizen/student leader”.

Protests in Jamia Nagar against the CAA had turned violent on December 15 last year. Four DTC buses, 100 private vehicles and 10 police bikes were damaged in the violence. Police had also entered the university’s campus and had allegedly attacked students.

The petitioner also sought directions to police to return Mr. Kumar’s mobile phone.

The plea claimed that Mr. Kumar had to unlock his mobile phone due to pressure from the members of the investigating agency.

“The continued possession of the mobile phone with the investigating agency is a direct and immediate violation of the right to privacy of the applicant,” it said.

It further alleged that Mr. Kumar’s lawyer was not allowed to meet him during his interrogation by the police.

The plea also sought directions to police to ensure that a fair investigation be conducted, and appropriate material be made available before any decision to take coercive action is taken.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/a0tcs3/article30704836.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jamiajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/court-seeks-police-reply-on-plea-seeking-fair-probe-into-jamia-violence-in-december/article30704814.ece
279,2020/01/31,Juvenile Justice Board sends Jamia shooter to 28-day protective custody,"The young man who ﬁred at a Jamia Millia Islamia student during a protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Thursday was sent to 28-day protective custody in a correction home by the Juvenile Justice Board a day later.

Purportedly 17 years old, a bone ossiﬁcation test would be conducted to ascertain if he is indeed a little over two months shy of being an adult. Police said they have approached Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to form a board of doctors for the test.

Rajesh Deo, DCP (Crime), conﬁrmed that the young man was presented before a magistrate at the JJB on Friday and sent to a correction home. A police oﬃcer who interrogated the young man after the Thursday incident said he displayed no remorse for his act. The shooter told the police that he bought the countrymade handgun from a man in his town for ₹10,000 on January 29, a day before using it.

While sending the shooter to the correction home, the JJB asked him if he needed a tutor inside to help him prepare for his upcoming Class XII exams. He asked for books, which the JJB allowed. The board also recommended psychiatric sessions.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/v5sonj/article30703547.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-JAMIA-FIRING-REUTERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/juvenile-justice-board-sends-jamia-shooter-to-28-day-protective-custody/article30703537.ece
280,2020/01/31,Plea for permission to contest in Delhi Assembly elections: 11 move HC,"Eleven persons moved the Delhi High Court on Friday challenging an order that had dismissed their pleas against rejection of their nominations for contesting the upcoming Assembly elections.

They filed their appeal challenging the single judge’s January 28 order, alleging that it was passed erroneously and disregarding the facts and material placed on record by them.

The plea alleged that the court had declined to entertain their petition and wrongly denied restoration, protection and enforcement of their constitutional and legal rights to contest elections from the New Delhi Seat.

It sought setting aside of the January 28 order and that the matter be remanded back to the single judge bench for its adjudication and disposal on merits.

As an interim relief, they sought to stay the single judge’s order and also the January 24 list of validly nominated candidates.

They also sought direction to the Centre, Election Commission and Chief Election Officer to inquire into the January 20 incident when their nominations were allegedly rejected.

The 11 persons, in their earlier plea, had sought to contest the upcoming Assembly elections from the New Delhi Seat, whose nomination forms were allegedly not accepted by the returning officer despite them arriving at the election office within the stipulated time.

On January 28, the single judge had dismissed the plea saying it was not maintainable and that under the Representation of People Act, only an election petition was permissible and it would have to be filed after results were declared.

The petition contended that the petitioners had arrived at the election office at Jamnagar House in New Delhi early in the morning on January 20 with their duly-filled forms and required documents.

Since there were several candidates already waiting at the office, the returning officer (RO) issued them tokens and based on their respective token numbers the forms were to be accepted and scrutinised.

However, due to paucity of time, all the people who were issued tokens could not be attended to, the plea said, adding that the returning officer asked the petitioners to come the next day.

The returning officer also told them their tokens were valid for the next day and their turn would come before that of others, the petition claims.

When the petitioners reached the election office the next day, they found that instead of tokens, the names of the applicants were being recorded on a sheet, the petition said, claiming that once Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal arrived there to file his nomination, he was directly taken inside to allegedly facilitate his filing.

Their plea claimed that due to the “wrongful, illegal, arbitrary, unconstitutional and malafide actions/inactions of Respondent 5 (RO), the petitioners were illegally and unconstitutionally deprived of exercising their constitutional right of participating in the democratic process of government formation”.

The petitioners have sought directions to the Centre, Election Commission, Chief Electoral Officer and returning officer to initiate measures which would help them file their nomination forms for contesting election from the New Delhi Seat against Mr. Kejriwal.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/t91kq2/article30703408.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thvli-Delhi-high-court,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/plea-for-permission-to-contest-in-delhi-assembly-elections-11-move-hc/article30703407.ece

“I was on the way to somewhere when I got to know about Home Minister Amit Shah’s public meeting. I went to the rally and raised anti-CAA slogans just to shatter Mr. Shah’s arrogance because by implementing the CAA he has done a wrong thing. He is ignoring dissent voices. Someone has to stand up against what is wrong and I did,” said Mr. Singh.

He added that he was held at a police station for 20 hours and was only allowed to go after he signed a letter that he was “mentally unstable”. “In the name of medical treatment, they just took me to a hospital and got me injected. Though I was telling them that I had sustained an injury on the head, a policeman said he could not spot any blood,” said Mr. Singh.

He said that he would register a complaint against the illegal detention and the people who attacked him.

During the meeting, when he started raising anti-CAA slogans, he was beaten up. On seeing there was a commotion, Mr. Shah asked security personnel to rescue the man. He then resumed his speech.

285,2020/01/31,Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga’s campaign revolves around nationalism,"BJP’s Hari Nagar candidate Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga shot into prominence in 2011 when he physically attacked noted lawyer Prashant Bhushan in the latter’s chamber over his statement on holding of a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Since then, Mr. Bagga has been getting steady prominence being at the forefront of several social media campaigns run by the BJP, something that made the party choose him as the candidate for the Assembly polls.

On Wednesday, Mr. Bagga held a foot march in Nangla village in Hari Nagar where he touched the feet of elders and requested them to vote for him. His ‘election convoy’, include a BJP campaign van, dhol and around one hundred BJP workers marching with him shouting ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’. A group of young volunteers holding placards were heard shouting slogans like ‘Bagga is like Modi’s shadow, he is our brother’.

A group of BJP supporters, including women, were also seen offering ladoos to locals and asking them to vote for the BJP if they want to keep the nation safe from middlemen of infiltrators.

Mr. Bagga’s election campaign is solely on nationalism. He is asking votes in the name of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah whom he claimed can only give them security from infiltrators.

Poll promises

“For the first time any candidate has released manifesto for Hari Nagar Assembly constituency. In the manifesto, I have promised to install smog tower in Hari Nagar Vidhanasabha in the first 60 days of my victory. Segregation of waste will also be done and waste compost will be installed,” said Mr. Bagga.

The manifesto was prepared after he reached out to locals in Hari Nagar constituency and discussed their problems. “People are not happy with the current AAP MLA from the area because he had not performed and for that reason he was not given ticket again. The area needs development and it had not seen any in the last five years,” said the BJP candidate.

Meanwhile, a group of BJP supporters were offering party sashes and caps to motorists and locals.

“I have never seen him before but I got to know that he is the BJP candidate. I am still unclear as to whom I will vote for. But it is wrong to ask votes in the name of Shaheen Bagh and Jamia,” said Keshav Singh, a shop owner.

Anti-CAA protests

During the public meeting at Subhash Nagar, Mr. Bagga had promised to clear Shaheen Bagh within 24-hours of his party coming to power in Delhi. He asked his supporters who had come to attend the rally to shout ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ so loud that their voice could reach Jamia Millia Islamia and Shaheen Bagh.

“Shaheen Bagh has turned into a hub of anti-nationals and we won’t allow it. It will get clear on February 11, the moment we come to power,” Mr. Bagga said.

When he was asked why the BJP is polarising the election campaign, he said that it is AAP who is polarising the election by constantly referring about Shaheen Bagh in their election campaigns. BJP has just replied to them. “I want to ask AAP where are the colleges, hospitals and WiFi that was promised by them. Not a single teacher has been appointed by the Kejriwal government and there is a shortfall of teachers. I challenge Mr. Kejriwal to come to Hari Nagar and debate with me on health and education,"" said Mr. Bagga.

On January 24, Election Commission had served notice to Mr. Bagga after the Media Certification and Monitoring Committee (MCMC) raised the issue of his song amounting to “suspected paid news”.

BJP president J.P. Nadda also conducted a pubic meeting in his support in Hari Nagar. His team claimed that many other BJP star campaigners will hold pubic meetings in Hari Nagar in support of Mr. Bagga.

As per the election affidavit, Mr. Bagga is a school dropout. He has a diploma in National Development Course from National Defence University in China.

286,2020/01/31,‘Campaign speeches clearly show divisive agenda’,"The recent campaign speeches by the BJP Ministers and leaders in Delhi ahead of the Assembly elections has once again brought to the focus the government’s divisive agenda with a greater clarity, former NDA Minister Yashwant Sinha said at the conclusion of 22-day Gandhi Shanti Yatra from Gateway of India in Mumbai to Rajghat in Delhi.

The yatra, organised by his organisation Rashtra Manch, covered 5,000 km crossing five States. Mr Sinha said that the situation in the country is grave today than when the yatra had started on January 9. The campaign speeches in Delhi by BJP leaders has further deteriorated the discourse in the country.

“Is this the language of a democratic discourse? The agenda of this government is very clear. And if there were any doubts left, the Delhi elections has put it forth with greater clarity that the government will work on religious lines and will divide India in the name of religion,” Mr. Sinha said.

He said that there is sustained effort to silence the voice of Opposition. Citing an example, he said that in Gujarat, Section 144 is imposed on the whims of the State administration. While permission to anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act rallies and public meetings are denied, 62 pro-CAA events were held in the State.

He said that the yatra also crossed Uttar Pradesh, a State which has witnessed “State terrorism”. Mr Sinha said the U.P. police has slapped cases against those who lost their lives in police firing during CAA protests for allegedly damaging the public property.

The BJP said the protests in Delhi were being held on behalf of the AAP.

“The leaders of AAP are openly supporting as well as encouraging such protests,” the representation read, citing Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s remarks to a television channel that he stood with the protesters at Shaheen Bagh.

The “general notice” outside read “Due to security reasons, Gandhi Smriti, 5, Tees January Marg, New Delhi 110001 will remain closed from January 29 noon to January 30, 5.30 p.m.” It added that the museum will be open to the general public from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. on January 30.

Several visitors to the museum were left disappointed on Thursday morning as they were asked to leave. Satya Pal, an octogenarian, who comes to Gandhi Smriti every year on Martyr’s Day went home disappointed as he was not allowed to enter.

“They are preparing for some government programme where you can enter only with a pass. They should not close it for the public. I come every year. This has not happened ever,” Mr. Pal said.

Tourist buses, some full of foreign visitors, were also asked to leave and come back at 5.30 p.m. after the event was over.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/gandhi-smriti-shut-for-public-on-martyrs-day/article30697175.ece
289,2020/01/31,"Delhi elections 2020 | Don’t count Congress out yet, says P.C. Chacko","As campaigning for the Delhi Assembly election enters the crucial last week, the Congress denied that it had thrown in the towel by not being visible on the campaign trail.

“No, it's not true. Our candidates and workers are very much there in the field and going door to door,” said All India Congress Committee in-charge for Delhi P.C. Chacko.

Star campaigners

He said the party's star campaigners, including party chief Sonia Gandhi, will join the action from February 1. “We want our campaigning to climax on the last day... that's how we have planned it,” he said.

“Both the BJP and AAP are good at marketing and have the resources to do so. The Delhi government had budgeted ₹500 crore for publicity. But I believe voters are intelligent and choose wisely,” Congress' Delhi in-charge said, adding, “I am sure we will be an important player in Delhi.”

Mr. Chacko said the schedule for star campaigners, including Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States, would be finalised over the weekend.

While former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will address public meetings and are likely to hold roadshows, Ms. Gandhi may address a public rally.

According to the list submitted to the Election Commission of India, the party's star campaigners include not only Chief Ministers of Congress-ruled States like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan but also former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Crowd-pullers such as Shatrughan Sinha, Navjot Singh Sidhu, Sachin Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia are also part of the list.

However, the Congress has not held a single big public meeting until now. Once the ruling party for an uninterrupted 15 years, the party has faced flak for not trying to aggressively reclaim lost ground.

Missing in action

Though the party has showcased the development work done during late Sheila Dikshit's 15-year tenure as Delhi Chief Minister, her son and former Congress Lok Sabha member Sandeep Dikshit is conspicuous by his absence.

He is neither part of star campaigners nor seen at any ground campaign though he has released a series of videos titled 'Kaam Ki Baat' attacking the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government on issues such as health and education.

Mr. Chacko, however, played down the absence of the former Chief Minister's son from the party's Delhi campaign.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/6rrie6/article30697167.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL31-CHACKO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dont-count-congress-out-yet-says-chacko/article30697168.ece
290,2020/01/31,Security beefed up ahead of elections,"In order to ensure that elections in Delhi go off smoothly, a high-level assessment of the ongoing sit-in protest at Shaheen Bagh was carried out. Additional security forces have been deployed and flag marches are being undertaken in sensitive areas, Special Commissioner (Intelligence) Praveen Ranjan said on Thursday.

Visits to the area for review have been undertaken by the Chief Electoral Officer, Election Commission officials as well as the area DCP and District Election Officer, Mr. Ranjan said.

Efforts are being made to create an environment that is conducive for polling so that there are no obstructions in transporting polling material, in travel of election officials and to ensure that voters are able to reach polling stations with ease, he said. Keeping this objective in view, alternative routes have been planned which will be kept clear, he added.

Apart from this, police is in regular dialogue with the people at the site to ensure that the demonstrations are peaceful and limited, Mr. Ranjan said. So far, he said, protesters have been co-operating and that no incidents of violence had taken place. With regard to the gun-wielding man who appeared at Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Ranjan said that the district police is likely to recommend cancellation of his license.

‘Four-fold increase’

He also said that this time there has been nearly four-fold increase in deployment of security personnel. Additional forces have been deployed especially where protests are taking place and there are regular checkings. As a form of confidence-building measure, DCPs are carrying out flag marches in selected areas to assure that no troublemaking will be tolerated. “Police is confident that the elections will go off peacefully and steps will be taken whenever necessary,” he said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/security-beefed-up-ahead-of-elections/article30697149.ece
291,2020/01/31,At least 300 protesters detained while trying to form human chain,"Hundreds of people, who attempted to form a human chain between Raj Ghat, Delhi Gate, Lal Quila and Shanti Van to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi’s death anniversary, were detained by police personnel on Thursday.

Police had earlier denied permission for the demonstration. Despite this, several people made their way to these spots to observe a minute of silence at 5.17 p.m., the time Gandhi was shot, after which they sang the national anthem.

Large number of security personnel were deployed at these sites and on the road leading up to Raj Ghat, where individuals were being stopped and checked, while vehicles were being let through. Police personnel claimed that Raj Ghat had been shut.

Among those detained include those who tried to make their way to the protest site as well as those who made a human chain.

At Delhi gate, Swaraj India leader Yogendra Yadav and activist and lawyer Prashant Bhushan were reportedly picked up after singing the national anthem and ending their demonstration. CPI leader D. Raja was detained from Raj Ghat.

Police officials said that at least 300 people had been detained, but were released later.

While scores of people forming a human chain were picked up form Raj Ghat, police allowed certain political leaders such as Prashanth Karat, Sitram Yechury, Brinda Karat and others to remain, who stood in a line holding up a poster with a picture of Mahatma Gandhi stating “Nafrath chodo Bharath Jodo” and “No to CAA/NPR/NRC.”

The demonstrators observed a minute silence at 5.17 p.m. and sang the national anthem after which they dispersed.

293,2020/01/31,Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal asks people to decide if he is a son or a terrorist,"Aam Aadmi Party national convener Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the people of Delhi should decide whether he is their son, their brother, or a terrorist as alleged by West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh while speaking to a television channel on Wednesday. The Election Commission has issued a notice to Mr. Singh on a complaint filed by AAP against his controversial statement.

“Today I am leaving this decision to the people of Delhi, whether they consider me a son, consider me their brother or consider me a terrorist,” Mr. Kejriwal said at a press conference.

“When you go to vote on February 8, when you press the button, if you consider me your son then give the vote for jhadu [AAP symbol], if you consider me a terrorist, then vote for kamal [BJP symbol],” Mr. Kejriwal said while addressing a public meeting in Babarpur later in the evening.

The poll panel said it was prima facie of the view that Mr. Singh had violated the model code of conduct, in place for the Delhi Assembly elections, by making the “distorted statement” in question.

According to the model code, criticism of parties or workers on the basis of “unverified allegations or distortions” are to be avoided. The BJP MP has been given time till 5 p.m. on Friday to give an explanation.

In a separate complaint to the Chief Election Commissioner on Thursday, AAP said that Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari has also supported Mr. Singh’s statement and thus “committed the same offence”.

In a message to the students, Ms. Akhtar wrote that she was deeply aggrieved by the incident in which M.A. Mass Communication student Shadab Farooq was shot at by a miscreant.

“I am proud to say that you are committed to the ideals of the Indian Constitution and Gandhian principles of non-violence. Your wise avoidance of retaliation, as always, bears testimony to this fact,” the VC said.

“I, along with Jamia fraternity, condemn this murderous and brutal act. I also condemn the silence of the police who stood just at a stone’s throw from the miscreant. It speaks volumes about them,” she said.

She added that if the miscreant had been nabbed by the police on time, this deplorable incident could have been averted. “I am proud of you my dear students, for you acted very sensibly and resisted the natural urge of reaction and retaliation.

295,2020/01/31,Oppn. link Jamia firing to BJP’s polarising campaign,"Parties, including AAP, Congress, CPI (M) and CPI, hit out at the BJP over a Jamia Millia Islamia student being shot at in the city on Thursday, seeking to link the incident to the inflammatory campaign speeches being made by several BJP leaders in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly election on February 8.

AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Sanjay Singh said the BJP was attempting to vitiate the atmosphere in the Capital in a bid to postpone the election. While Mr. Kejriwal tweeted asking Amit Shah to “take care of Delhi’s law and order”, Mr. Singh was more blunt in laying the blame at the Union Home Minister’s door.

“Amit Shah is trying to deteriorate the atmosphere of Delhi, whether it be the language of hatred or today’s shooting incident,” the AAP MP said while addressing a press conference. He alleged that the shooting happened in front of the police because the Home Minister has given instructions to the force to not take any action.

“Today I have no doubt in saying that Amit Shah is the most incompetent Home Minister of India ever. The BJP has no face or issues to fight the Delhi elections, hence they are taking the path of violence. It is unfortunate that India now has a Home Minister who conspires and instructs his leaders to give inflammatory speeches across Delhi. Subsequently, today [Thursday] the violence took place at Jamia and the police stood there silently. I can’t imagine that a person holding guns can stand in front of silent police officers and starts firing at students,” Mr. Singh said.

He said that this is a “big conspiracy” of the BJP and that the party had tried to vitiate the atmosphere ahead of the Assembly election in 2015 too.

Congress hits out

The Congress, too, joined issue. “What happened in Jamia Millia Islamia is a live manifestation of the spectre of hate and terror which has been perpetrated across this country by the NDA-BJP government, especially since the end of the winter session of Parliament,” said former Union Minister Manish Tewari at a press conference.

“The kind of statements which have been emanating from the BJP leadership in the Delhi election campaign, it seems that they have even dropped the pretence of any civility,” he added.

“When Ministers in the BJP government and leaders provoke people to shoot and give provocative speeches, then such incidents are possible. The Prime Minister should answer what kind of Delhi he wants to build. Is he standing with violence or non-violence? Is he standing with development or anarchy,” asked Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in a tweet.

The firing is a fallout of “hate” speeches and inflammatory comments made by Union Ministers and BJP leaders during campaigning for the Delhi poll, Left parties alleged.

“The hate speech and call to violence by Union Ministers and BJP leaders, along with the silence of the PM, has led to this shameful outcome. This is the kind of India this government wants to create,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury tweeted.

CPI general secretary D. Raja said the incident is a “direct result” of the inflammatory comments made by BJP leaders. “The Jamia firing incident is a direct result of provocative statements made by BJP leaders during campaigning in Delhi. BJP leader Anurag Thakur should be arrested for his comments urging crowds to raise slogan of shoot the traitors,” Mr. Raja said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ni8iwx/article30697074.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL31-JAMIAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/oppn-link-jamia-firing-to-bjps-polarising-campaign/article30697076.ece

298,2020/01/31,‘Use of chemicals to ripen fruits amounts to poisoning consumers’,"The Delhi High Court has observed that use of pesticides and chemicals to ripen fruits amounts to poisoning the consumer, while noting that invoking penal provisions against the culprits would have a deterrent effect.

A Bench of Justices G.S. Sistani and A.J. Bhambani said, “Using chemicals like calcium carbide to ripen mangoes is like poisoning somebody. Why should the Indian Penal Code be not invoked against them?”

“Send such persons to jail, even if for two days and it would have a deterrent effect,” the Bench said while hearing a petition initiated by the court to monitor use of pesticides on fruits and vegetables.

The High Court asked the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India [FSSAI] if calcium carbide was still being used to ripen fruits, like mangoes and sought the presence of its Chief Executive Officer to assist it on the next date of hearing.

It also asked the Ministry of Agriculture if any kit was available for consumers to test for calcium carbide at home. The Ministry replied that no such kit was available as the presence of calcium carbide can only be tested in laboratories with the help of proper equipment and additional chemicals.

The Delhi government told the High Court that it has been picking up samples from the various markets in the Capital for tests and also carrying out awareness drives. It also told the court that some of the samples were tested and no chemicals were found and the results of other sample tests were awaited.

Apart from the petition initiated by the court on its own, the High Court was also hearing two other pleas by private individuals seeking directions to the authorities to curb the use of pesticides and other chemicals on food products, especially the agricultural produce, coming into the national capital.

A Bench headed by NGT chief Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said, “The State PCBs/PCCs [pollution control committees] may publish an appropriate notice on the subject within two weeks requiring furnishing of information and also adopting all necessary safeguards in the matter.”

The State pollution control boards and pollution control committees were also directed to furnish factual and action-taken reports to the apex pollution control body by April 2020.

“Private operators, including cooperative societies or other entities, not falling within the jurisdiction of local bodies, may also furnish the requisite information to the State PCBs within one month,” the Bench added.

While observing that dairy activities were categorised as “orange” category, the Bench said, “The guidelines prepared by the CPCB need to be revised by specifying that State boards or committees must enforce ‘consent mechanism’ and in particular, follow an appropriate sitting policy in the light of the carrying capacity of the area for commercial dairy activities, having potential for air and water pollution.”

Justice Najmi Waziri allotted the police time till March 31 to complete the probe and file a report.

The High Court was hearing a plea filed by the Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) through its chairperson Neelam Krishnamoorthy, seeking a CBI probe into the alleged criminal misconduct by passport and police officials in issuing the travel document to Ansal.

Earlier, the High Court had said that appropriate proceedings “would be warranted” against Ansal for misleading the government and misrepresenting on oath while applying for passport.

It also ordered lodging of an FIR against the police officers who in 2013 had given a favourable verification report to Ansal, despite his non-disclosure about his conviction in the Uphaar case, which led to issuance of the travel document to him.

The police had said that in 2013, three criminal cases, including the Uphaar fire tragedy, were pending against Ansal.

302,2020/01/31,20-year jail term to two for raping 5-yr-old in 2013,"A Delhi court on Thursday sentenced two men to 20 years in prison for raping a five-year-old girl saying she experienced “exceptional depravity and extreme brutality”.

Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra also granted compensation of ₹11 lakh to the survivor.

Advocate H.S. Phoolka, appearing for the survivor, said he would appeal against the order in the High Court and seek life imprisonment for the two convicts. The court had on January 18 convicted the two men.

In the gruesome incident which took place in Gandhi Nagar on April 15, 2013, the convicts had shoved objects in the victim’s private parts and abandoned her in a room, believing she was dead. The child was rescued on April 17.

In an over 100-page judgment, the court had said: “In our society, minor girls are worshipped as a goddess on certain occasions, but in the present case, the victim child, who was aged about five years at time of incident, had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality.”

“The crime against the victim was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,” the court had said.

The court had convicted the two men under Sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376 (2) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act.

The accused were arrested from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar on April 2013.

Multiple surgeries

The police had said some foreign objects were taken out from the body of the victim, which was also proved by doctors during recording of their statements in the court. The girl had undergone multiple surgeries at the AIIMS in Delhi.

Anger over the incident had spilled onto Delhi’s streets as outraged students and women staged demonstrations at the India Gate, Delhi Police Headquarters and near the residences of the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

Mr. Singh had said a collective effort was needed to root out such “depravity” from society.

In 2014, one of the accused moved the court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest.

The trial court took three years to decide his application of juvenility and transferred the case in April 2017 to the Juvenile Justice Board, which granted him bail in June.

Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved the Delhi High Court against the trial court’s order declaring the accused a juvenile. The High Court in 2018 declared that he was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/20-year-jail-term-to-two-for-raping-5-yr-old-in-2013/article30697027.ece

The girl had gone to relieve herself around 9 p.m. when the two accused allegedly dragged her to the fields and took turns to rape her.

The girl’s family, meanwhile, alleged that the police wanted to hush up the matter and were slow with the investigation.

The victim’s family said that there was a wedding in the family of the accused and the dinner was being served when the incident took place. The accused allegedly drugged the girl rendering her unconscious before they forced themselves on her, the family claimed.

The teenager was found unconscious in a street around 100 metres away from her house four hours after the family began to search for her. The family then reported the matter to the police.

Confirming his arrival, senior Tihar jail administration official said that as per schedule, Mr. Pawan reported to Tihar administration on Thursday afternoon, two days ahead of the hanging. He is a third-generation hangman.

“Pawan is in the staff quarters. He visited the jail where the convicts will be hanged and also performed dummy execution. He checked the strength of the rope and functioning of the gallows and found everything perfect,” said the official.

The four convicts in the gruesome gang rape and murder case are scheduled to be hanged on February 1, but their execution is unlikely to take place as one of them filed a mercy petition before the President on Wednesday, while another moved a curative plea before the Supreme Court.

Mr. Pawan said that he would be relieved after doing the job for which he has come to Tihar jail, adding: “It will give a message to all those who disrespect women. Those who were involved in this brutal incident must be hanged, and it will also bring great relief to Nirbhaya’s parents and everybody else.”

All convicts will he hanged together, another Tihar jail officer said.

305,2020/01/31,State government promises faster building clearances,"The State government will soon come out with a policy to ensure building permissions are obtained “without paying a single paisa of bribe” and it will become a model to the nation as TS-iPASS single window industrial policy has become, said Minister for Municipal Administraion & IT K.T. Rama Rao on Friday.

“We will the initiate a self-certification process for building permissions to be obtained in a time-bound fashion. For the next four years, the focus of the government will be on good governance,” he said after launching the three-day ‘CREDAI - Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India - Hyderabad Property Show’ at Hitex, Madhapur.

The government intends to infuse capital to strengthen civic infrastructure and maintain existing ones at a total cost of ₹8,000 crore but at the same time, real estate developers should imbibe “self-regulation” in terms of adhering to rules, regulations, safety standards, workers welfare, pollution control methods and so on.

“The government can regulate strongly by resorting to fines, blacklisting and holding up permissions but we do not want to do that. Just like you have professionalised your association functioning, do the same in construction methods too,” he advised.

Mr. Rao wanted CREDAI to issue guidelines to fellow members on environment-friendly measures of controlling dust, not compromising on workers safety, etc. There is also a need to put thought towards having “aesthetic elevations” rather than constructing drab building blocks.

Attesting that Hyderabad growth will continue for the next two decades or so, he pointed out that global real estate agency, JLL, has ranked it on top in comparison to 130 other cities in terms of socio-economic and growth factors.

The government is also determined to disperse the growth by going for IT parks in Petbasheerabad-Kompalli, electronics manufacturing clusters by prominent Chinese firms and pharma city in the south while three prominent firms have sought permission for building 20 lakh square feet commercial space in Uppal-Nagole area.

New metro route

The Minister disclosed that JBS-MGBS metro line will be launched in 10 days and the next phase will be grounded soon. A Nagole-Falaknuma-Shamshabad metro line is to be developed. He urged builders to look at Tier-2, Tier-3 cities too like Warangal, Nizamabad, Nalgonda, Khammam and others as IT/ITES firms are setting up campuses there. The government intends to pump in ₹2,500 crore for improving amenities. Mr. Rao called upon CREDAI to consider starting a skill institute in association with National Academy of Construction (NAC) for training youth in construction fields. It should also think of utilising treated sewage water for construction, once more treatment plants are in place. Allowing additional floors for neighbourhood parking and orientation programmes through the fire and disaster response force to deal with fire mishaps and escalator maintenance are under consideration.

Earlier, CREDAI Hyderabad president P. Rama Krishna Rao sought a government policy of living co-spaces in view of demand for housing for single working professionals and assured water supply as is given to the industry.

307,2020/01/31,Vulture sanctuary in cold storage,"The proposal for a vulture sanctuary in Kagaznagar and Asifabad divisions of the Kumram Bheem Asifabad district has been lying in cold storage, although clearance was obtained from the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL) three years ago.

Meanwhile, increased visits by transient tigers in the corridor area which falls into Kagaznagar division add urgency to the proposal, say officials.

Named tentatively ‘Jatayu Wildlife Sanctuary’, the safe haven was proposed for the critically endangered Long Billed Vulture species (Gyps indicus) after a committee of the birds was found nesting and breeding in Palarapu cliff habitat in Penchikalpet range of Bejjur reserve forest block in 2013.

The sanctuary was to be declared on about 398 square kilometres (39,800 hectares) of the area, covering Girelly, Bejjur and Gudem forest blocks with Rebbana, Karjelly, Bejjur and Penchikalpet ranges.

The proposal received a nod from the SBWL in February 2017, and was forwarded to the State government for approval, where it has been lying since.

“The proposal is very much alive, as the government has not rejected it. If approved, it will be a boost for conservation efforts, as the region is also home to other important species,” said a senior official of the Wildlife wing of the Forest department.

Apart from Long Billed Vultures, the region is home to raptor species such as eagles, owls, kites, falcons, and shikras, as its topography, rich in hillocks and cliffs, serves as ideal nesting space for the birds of prey.

“Other than these, Kagaznagar is home to four-horned Antelope, and a potential habitat for Gaur or Indian bison,” said the official.

The proposal for a sanctuary assumes significance also in the context of several instances of tiger sighting reported from the division. At least 10 big cats were seen rambling in the corridor to the Kawal Tiger Reserve in recent times, officials said. Though they are transient visitors from the neighbouring sanctuaries of Maharashtra, protection and conservation efforts could encourage them to make Kagaznagar their home, they say.

Declaration as sanctuary would mean better focus and Central funding for the area. Entry regulations may be imposed, cattle grazing can be regulated, forest fire may be controlled, and also, no developmental activities may be permitted without approval from the National Board for Wildlife, say officials.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/vulture-sanctuary-in-cold-storage/article30705654.ece

Mr. Jagan’s lawyer Ashok Reddy filed the exemption petition in the court under Section 317 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.PC).

The senior counsel said that the HC suggested to inform the special court about the matter being heard by it and secure exemption from appearance. Special court judge B.R. Madhusudhan Rao asked the CBI public prosecutor if the claim was verified.

The public prosecutor, having spoken to CBI special public prosecutor Surender over phone, later confirmed to the court that it was correct. Meanwhile, the senior counsel presented arguments on the discharge petition filed by Mr. Jagan to delete his name in one of the chargesheets.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/cbi-court-accepts-plea-for-jagans-dispensation-of-presence/article30705181.ece
