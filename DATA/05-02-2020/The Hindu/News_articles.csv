0,2020/02/05,Jeremy looks to give his best in Asian championships,"For Youth Olympics gold medallist weightlifter Jeremy Lalrinnunga, winning his maiden National title was an emotional moment. The 18-year-old quickly put on the traditional Mizoram attire, a black and white checked half-sleeved shirt and a matching bandana, for the medal ceremony.

It was a proud moment for Jeremy as he received the 67kg gold from his father Lalnnaihehtlua, a National level medal-winning boxer of the 1990s.

“My father had never seen me doing weightlifting in a competition,” said Jeremy, after exchanging kisses with his father and putting the gold medal around his neck.

Jeremy, third among Lalnnaihehtlua’s five sons, takes pride in his sport and his father’s sport. Two tattoos, depicting a lifter and a boxer with dates — July 7, 1988 (when his father began boxing) and November 11, 2011 (when he touched the barbell) — written in Roman numerals, adorn his left forearm.

Belief in hard work

His father underlines his family’s strong belief in hard work and God. “I tell Jeremy, ‘give your best, God is up there,’” said Lalnnaihehtlua, with a lot of passion.

With the Olympics around the corner, expectation has taken shape. After winning the Youth Olympics gold in Buenos Aires in October 2018, Jeremy, who increased his body weight a year ago, has successfully graduated from junior to elite level by taking part in some top events.

As he looks forward to give his best in the upcoming Asian championships, an Olympic qualifying event, Jeremy knows where he stands in terms of performance in the world level. “I am trying to improve two to five kg in every event. The target for April is to improve 10kg each in snatch and clean and jerk. That will help me qualify for Olympics.”

In the World championships in Pattaya in September last, Jeremy did a total of 296kg — 41kg away from gold medallist Chen Lijun of China — to finish 21st.

Here, he lifted a total of 299kg, including the National record of 167kg in clean and jerk, but was 8kg short of his own mark of 140kg in snatch.

“A shoulder issue troubled during snatch… My target is to do 320kg in the Asian championship.”

The Aizawl boy, who follows some techniques of his idol, London Olympics 77kg gold medallist Chinese lifter Lu Xiaojun in snatch, does not take pressure though. Whenever he feels low, he reads the Bible or listens to Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber to get back his composure.

National coach Vijay Sharma says Jeremy should use Tokyo to get a hang of the Olympics before approaching the 2024 Games as a full-grown experienced man.

“I never thought I would be part of Olympic qualifiers. The improvements have been rapid. My aim is not just to qualify for (Tokyo) Olympics, but to try for a medal. My training and diet plan will change. There is a 110% chance of improvement. If I fight for it, who knows what will happen?” Jeremy signed off with optimism.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/jeremy-looks-to-give-his-best-in-asian-championships/article30743921.ece
1,2020/02/05,Every person is an ambassador for India: Rijiju,"The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) may have invited the former captain of the Indian cricket team — Sourav Ganguly — to be the Goodwill Ambassador of the Indian contingent at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics but Union Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju counts every person representing India in the same role.

“For me, every Indian has to be an ambassador for the Olympics because it is a platform which determines which country stands where in sports,” he said here on Wednesday. “I’m not looking for one or two person. IOA is an independent body but as a government I look forward to every Indian as an ambassador.”

Speaking on various issues, the Union Sports Minister reassured the sports fraternity there was no slashing of funds. “If there are shortage of funds for the federations, these can always be taken up, that is why there is a provision for revision. If they need more money, they will get more money,” Rijiju said.

He insisted, “You are looking from a different angle. Whatever we got in the last budget allocation, we had a jump of more than 50 %. What you are comparing from the Revised Estimate (RE), if you see the original allocation in last budget, it is a historical jump. You have to see from the actual stand point, then you will get the complete picture.”

The Sports Minister also spoke on the inaugural Khelo India University Games, featuring 177 institutes and 3340 athletes, to be held at the KIIT University Campus in Bhubaneswar from February 22 to March 1.

“I am excited to see the huge shift in the way we organise sporting events in India. Now we are going to have Khelo India University Games. It would happen in a mega scale, it would not be like what we used to see, where each university used to host one discipline.

“World wide the standard of University Games is high, most of the stars of the Olympics come from here. Because the age bar is higher than Youth games, the standard will be higher and we will definitely see many champions from this.”",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/uuyhbs/article30744068.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th06Kiren,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/every-person-is-an-ambassador-for-india-rijiju/article30743841.ece
2,2020/02/05,PBL | Warriors beat Superstarz,"In an inconsequential match with both the teams having already made it to the semifinals, North-Eastern Warriors scored a 4-3 win over Chennai Superstarz in the Premier Badminton League championship at Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday.

It was evident Chennai decided to give the young talent like K. Sathish Kumar and S. Sankar Muthuswamy a feel of what it means to out there on the court in such a high-profile league.

In the first men’s singles match, Kaushal Dharmamer of Warriors got the better of Sathish.

The 23-year-old, trained by former National doubles champion Uday Pawar, scored an easy first-game win, but in the second game was surprised by his 18-year-old opponent’s tenacity.

Then, in the men’s doubles match, B. Sumeeth Reddy combined with Dhruv Kapila for Chennai to down Warriors’ Bodin Isara and G. Krishna Prasad, after the latter put up a terrific fight in the second game.

World No. 30 Kirsty Gilmour won the Trump match for Chennai against 20-year-old World No. 81 Asmita Chaliha, but not before the latter gave glimpses of her talent, having won the South Asian Games gold last year.

Youngest PBL player

For 16-year-old S. Sankar Muthuswamy of Chennai, the youngest ever to play in the PBL, it was a very satisfying outing against World No. 18 Lee Cheuk Yiu.

The young talent impressed many with his solid defence and the court movements too were very good.

With team scores tied three-all, Lee Yong Dae and Kim Ha Na combined well for Warriors to wrap things up 4-3 with an emphatic win over Dhruv Kapila and Sanjana Santosh, latter making her PBL debut.

After this match, both Chennai and Warriors have 22 points each.

The results: North-Eastern Warriors bt Chennai Superstarz 4-3 [Kaushal Dharmamer bt K. Sathish Kumar 15-3, 15-11; Bodin Isara & G. Krishna Prasad lost to B. Sumeeth Reddy & Dhruv Kapila 13-15, 14-15; Asmita Chaliha lost to Kirsty Gilmour (T) 12-15, 11-15; Lee Cheuk Yiu (T) bt S.

3,2020/02/05,Weightlifting | Commanding show by Mirabai,"Former World champion S. Mirabai Chanu broke three National records as she retained her women’s 49kg title in style in the National weightlifting championships at the Khudiram Anusilan Kendra here on Tuesday.

Mirabai, who bettered her own previous snatch record of 87kg and clean and jerk mark of 114kg by one kg each, made an overall improvement of two kg to achieve a new total of 203kg.

In the run-up to the Asian championships, which will serve as an Olympic qualifying event, Mirabai’s performance will stand her in good stead for a quota place in the Tokyo Games.

It has also enhanced her prospects for a podium finish in the Olympics.

The 25-year-old, who began with 85kg, achieved a new high in snatch by lifting 88kg in her second attempt. However, her effort to raise the bar to 90kg did not succeed.

In clean and jerk, Mirabai began with 111kg and added four kg in her second attempt to rewrite the mark amid loud cheers. She also got past her previous best total of 201kg.

Mirabai’s push for 205kg did not materialize as she could not lift 117kg in her concluding attempt.

K.Sanjita Chanu, the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medallist in 53kg who made a comeback to competitive lifting after a long layoff due to doping-related suspension, took the second place with 185kg.

In men’s 73kg, a lesser-known N. Ajith of Tamil Nadu stunned defending champion Achinta Sheuli to take the gold.

Ajith made new snatch and total records for an overall effort of 310kg and beat Sheuli by four kg.

The results:

In a similar tournament in the women’s section, at the same venue, Ankita Raina made the doubles quarterfinals with Bibiane Schoofs of the Netherlands.

The 27-year-old Ankita, who had won both the singles and doubles titles last week, could not enter the singles as she was scheduled to compete in the FedCup which was eventually got postponed by three weeks.

Riya Bhatia, another member of the Indian squad, could get into the qualifying event. Ankita chose to capitalise on the time by competing in the doubles event, before the WTA event next week in Hua Hin.

The results:

First round: $25,000 ITF men, Nonthaburi, Thailand: Sidharth Rawat bt Vaclav Safranek (Cze) 6-3, 7-6(5).

5,2020/02/05,Tata Open Maharashtra | Prajnesh brings cheer to Indian fans,"India No.1 Prajnesh Gunneswaran won his first ATP Tour level main draw match at home following a 7-6(4), 7-6(5) defeat of Germany’s Yannick Maden in the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium here on Tuesday.

Prajnesh’s one hour and 38 minute win over the World No. 131 brought some much-needed cheer to the home crowd which had earlier in the evening seen a third Indian crash out when Arjun Kadhe was beaten 6-2, 6-4 by Czech Jiri Vesely.

Prajnesh started the match with three quickfire holds, giving away just two points. Maden was less clinical but protected his serve equally well. But at 3-4, a bout of nervousness, saw Maden shank a routine forehand and double fault, thereby conceding the crucial break to make it 5-3.

But the home favourite handed the break right back, courtesy a poor service game that saw him double fault twice. Prajnesh continued to wobble and at 5-5 a string of unforced errors gifted Maden a break opportunity. The fans heaved a sigh of relief when Prajnesh saved it with a fine inside-out forehand.

The match, inevitably, slipped into a tie-break but two backhand errors by Prajnesh allowed Madden to go 3-0 ahead. But the Indian dragged himself back to restore parity and he was helped in no small measure by his opponent who dumped two forehands into the net. With a huge ace and a service winner Prajnesh went 6-3 up. The set was had two points later when a Maden forehand sailed long.

Little to separate the two

The first game of the second set stretched to deuce with the Maden serve coming under pressure. But for that, there was little to separate the two in the first 10 games. Prajnesh had a 30-30 on the Maden serve but two wide returns put paid to his hopes. The Indian held to love to stretch the match into another tiebreak.

Prajnesh appeared to have had the contest firmly in his grasp when he gained a 4-2 lead, but let it slip by giving away three points in a row. What he required at 4-5 were steely nerves and he showed he had them in plenty when he executed a tough overhead and followed it up with an ace.

He sealed the match on his first match point with a crunching forehand winner.

“I held up quite well” Prajnesh said. “I served well, used my forehand well. The wrist and the elbow felt fine. It was much closer to my regular style. I am happy.”

In doubles, Leander Paes and Mathew Ebden outplayed second seeds Divij Sharan and Artem Sitak 6-2, 7-6(5).

The results (first round):

Prajnesh Gunneswaran bt Yannick Maden (Ger) 7-6(4), 7-6(5); James Duckworth (Aus) bt Peter Gojowczyk (Ger) 7-6 (5), 6-4; Jiri Vesely (Cze) bt Arjun Kadhe 6-2, 6-4; Egor Gerasimov (Blr) bt Paolo Lorenzi (Ita) 6-2, 6-3; Ilya Ivashka (Blr) bt Evgeny Donskoy (Rus) 6-3, 6-2; Nikola Milojevic (Srb) bt Antoine Hoang (Fra) 7-6(5), 6-4; Roberto Marcora (Ita) bt Lukas Rosol (Cze) 6-3, 6-2.

Doubles: Leander Paes & Mathew Ebden (Aus) bt Divij Sharan & Artem Sitak (Nzl) 6-2, 7-6 (5).

6,2020/02/05,Can Benoit Paire get to career-high ranking of 18?,"Benoit Paire is in a happy place. The season gone by was his best in years, as he notched up a career-best 32 wins, clinched his first ATP title in four years in Marrakech, Morocco before adding another in Lyon.

The current campaign has started on a similarly strong note, with the Frenchman reaching the final in Auckland in the lead-up to the Australian Open. At the Tata Open Maharashtra where he is the title favourite, the 30-year-old will have a chance to scale another peak, his career-high ranking of 18, which he is just one shy of.

“It's very important for me to play good,” he said on Tuesday. “If I win the tournament, I will be 18 and there is a good chance to go better. I don't have any points to defend because my beginning was bad last year, losing eight or nine first rounds.”

“But there is no pressure. When I see in the newspaper, Twitter, Instagram, ‘you're top seed and you're gonna win the tournament’, no, it's not like that. Every player has the same chance. Maybe I have the better ranking so chances may be better. But it will be tough.”

The uptick in form has had a lot to do with the way he has managed to stay calm, he said. A mercurial figure on court, focussing for long periods has always been his bane.

Age and maturity

“I think I'm older and the maturity is coming,” he said with a smile. “I have been very calm since last year. Okay, sometimes I can break a racquet. But if you see over the year I was very calm and that's why my ranking is better, I won two titles and it was my best year.”

The sense of camaraderie he felt with his fellow French players in the recently held Davis Cup and ATP Cup has been crucial.

“Team matches representing my country are very important for me. I enjoyed the Davis Cup, and the ATP Cup at the start of the season. To play in front of the crowd with my friends Giles Simon, [Gael] Monfils, Nicolas Mahut…was great. We saw the results coming after that, I played a good tournament in Auckland. I lost to [Marin] Cilic in five sets at the Australian Open, but it has been good.”

Over his last seven visits to India, Paire has felt similar, if not greater, warmth. If he rides the wave until the coming Sunday, his numerous fans would have had their pennies worth.

7,2020/02/05,‘Nowhere close to machines replacing humans’: Tech author David Moschella,"Often we are forced to adopt new technologies. For instance, it would be tough to stick to a New Year’s resolution of staying away from WhatsApp. Even if we are ready to renounce its many benefits, our nature of work might not allow us its disuse. Due to the constant mutation in technology, it is near-impossible to always be aware of the implications of its use. When we put together the reports of thefts, manipulation and surveillance of data, and this compulsion of using and difficulty in understanding technology, an ominous prospect presents itself.

David Moschella, however, says, “The upsides of technology innovation far outweigh the downsides.” In his latest book, Seeing Digital: A Visual Guide to the Industries, Organizations, and Careers of the 2020s (SAGE India) — a product of a decade’s research — he allays unfounded alarms regarding technology and attempts to present an outlook, especially for the next 10 years.

Edited excerpts

Can you decode the title?

The reason I called the book Seeing Digital is because it uses a highly visual style. The most obvious aspect of this approach is the picture per page format. I also strove to make each chapter, and even each page a standalone source of value. It has been gratifying that so many people have noticed this, and that this visual and componentised way of writing has proved especially popular with readers for whom English is a second, or third, language. As one reader said: “It is great that I can open any chapter or page, look at it, and start using it.”

The phrase digital transformation is oft-repeated in the book. Can you describe it?

For more than a decade, large organisations have been migrating to cloud computing, software-as-a-service (SaaS), and other internet-based services. But the global technology community now anticipates a much more powerful wave of change, based upon various combinations of smart products, machine learning, industry-specific business platforms, algorithmic processes, robotics, self-service, data-driven operations, and new forms of value creation. Taken together, these capabilities provide a vision for transformed, 21st-century organisations that look much more like today’s digital giants than the traditional global firm. While such transformations are certainly not easy, it is hard to over-estimate the potential of these changes.

We saw the rise of social media in the last 10 years. How will it change in the next 10?

Looking back over previous technologies, such as word processing, email, e-commerce, and search, we see that they haven’t changed all that much over the years, and thus in 10 years, Facebook, for example, might not look all that different than it does today. If there is one area I would like to see change, it would be for specialised communities, especially in health care, to become much more powerful sources of research and actionable knowledge. This vast societal potential remains largely untapped.

As the changes in technology have become rapid, how can our educational institutions structure their programmes to make sure that the lessons they teach aren’t outdated?

While there is always room for improvement, I think our leading schools do a pretty good job teaching computer science. Where they must do better is in applying digital technology to every other educational field — be it science, math, history, literature, government, or the social sciences. Building digital into just about every form of training is the best way for societies to broadly prepare their students for the future.

Is it the case that technology is growing so fast that we aren’t quite sure of how to handle it? For example, we have invented self-driving cars. But have we worked out all the complications that might arise out of them? If there is a fatal accident, who do we hold accountable?

One of the key messages of the book is that, in many areas, the pace of technology change is not accelerating, and that many new technologies such as self-driving cars, blockchains, virtual reality, bots et al, are actually being adopted more slowly than personal computers, smartphones, and the internet itself. This relatively slow pace will give us more time to prepare for these important developments and the new ethical issues they create. Facial recognition is perhaps the big exception, as this technology has developed quickly, and is generating many complex challenges.

While today’s deep fake technologies clearly present similar new forms of risk, the impact of Cambridge Analytica in the US elections was actually much less than is often reported. It was not the decisive issue in the US elections.

What developments in AI do you predict for the 2020s?

In recent years, many people have talked about how software is “eating the world”, as software has often redefined the way markets and industries work. But looking ahead, data will increasingly eat software, as machine learning turns data into action without the need for specific software programming. It is a fundamental change and innovation.

Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook data to target US voters was among the important talking points last decade. Is there a risk of something like this happening on a much bigger scale in different parts of the world?

There are always risks with new technology, and at various times, newspapers, radio and television have all been used to shape public opinion, in sometimes undesirable ways. While today’s deep fake technologies clearly present similar new forms of risk, the impact of Cambridge Analytica in the US elections was actually much less than is often reported. It was not the decisive issue in the US elections.

Mass surveillance programmes have already started in some parts of the world. Is there a possibility of this transforming into some kind of a digital dictatorship?

Many nations are certainly looking at following China’s lead in imposing much stricter national controls over social media, and the era of a largely open, global internet is passing, at least for now. The US, Europe and China all seem to be moving in different directions. It would seem that the internet will increasingly resemble each nation’s overall culture.

Do you foresee any kind of resistance to technology because of the threat of machines replacing humans?

As I say in the book, the benefits of technology are real and here today, while the fears are almost entirely speculative. We are nowhere close to machines replacing humans in vast numbers; nor are we close to a generalised machine intelligence. Someday, we might well reach these points, but until we get much closer to it, I think it should be full speed ahead. As it has in the past, the upsides of technology innovation far outweigh the downsides, which is why Seeing Digital is basically a book of sustained optimism.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/6t1144/article30743474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04MP-ORIGINSELFDRIVINGCAR,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/we-are-nowhere-close-to-machines-replacing-humans-tech-author-david-moschella/article30743476.ece

The issue seems to be at least partially resolved and Microsoft shared the issue on the Microsoft 365 Status Twitter account.

“We are investigating an issue where users may be unable to access Microsoft Teams. We’re reviewing systems data to determine the cause of the issue. More information can be found in the Admin center under TM202916,” the company tweeted on Monday.

Recently, the company revealed that the platform had garnered more than 20 million daily active users.

Meanwhile, its rival “Slack” last month announced that it as 12 million active users.

9,2020/02/05,BlackBerry phones face uncertain future as TCL parts ways,"The future of the iconic BlackBerry smartphones has once again come under a cloud as Chinese electronics group TCL has announced that it will stop selling BlackBerry phones later this year.

In a note shared on Twitter on Monday, TCL Communication said it “will no longer be selling” BlackBerry-branded phones as of August 31, 2020.

“TCL Communication has no further rights to design, manufacture or sell any new BlackBerry mobile devices,” said the note which added that the company will continue to provide support for the existing portfolio of mobile devices including customer service and warranty service until August 31,2022 -- or for as long as required by local laws where the mobile device was purchased.

BlackBerry did not immediately reveal what the future holds for its phones in regions where TCL had rights to sell its phones.

After years of struggle, BlackBerry decided to stop making its own phones in 2016. TCL then entered the scene as one of the manufacturers of BlackBerry-branded phones.

According to a report in The Verge, TCL has done a decent job of it, pairing classically BlackBerry-style designs with the functions of modern Android phones, although none of the phones have been blockbuster hits.

However, recent devices have received poor reviews, it added.

The role of other manufacturers of BlackBerry phones has been limited as TCL received the biggest deal.

While Optiemus Infracom made some BlackBerry-branded devices for India, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh, BB Merah Putih launched a single phone in Indonesia in 2017.

For all other regions, TCL had the rights.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/hr0wn1/article30740276.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BLACKBERRY-RESULTS,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/blackberry-phones-face-uncertain-future-as-tcl-parts-ways/article30740317.ece
10,2020/02/05,TikTok users going blind with new eye colour phone flash trend,"A TikTok challenge that has been doing the rounds on social media has been discovered to have some potentially dangerous consequences for the eyes.

The challenge involves the use of the phone’s rear camera to shoot a video by keeping the flash on, pointing it at one’s eyes.

In the viral video, the girl who posted it said: “If you have brown eyes this filter turns them blue! S5 + back camera and flash.”

She then ended the video showing that her eyes were blue, despite having been brown at the start of the video.

The trend appears to have started after TikTok user Maliabroo posted a video, claiming that the platform has a new filter called ‘S5’ that changes your eye colour when used with flash, mirror.co.uk reported.

As the post went viral, several TikTok viewers attempted the challenge themselves, and unsurprisingly, it didn’t work. One user wrote: “I went blind and no blue eyes.”

11,2020/02/05,U.K. government moots changes in BBC funding,"U.K. government hinted on Wednesday that the annual BBC licence fee on Britain’s television-watching households could be scrapped after the next review of its royal charter, as crunch funding talks with the broadcaster near.

The possibility of losing guaranteed licence fee money comes at a time when the 100-year-old BBC is under attack on several fronts ranging from accusations of extravagant spending to political bias. “The licence fee will remain in place this charter period which ends in December 2027, however we must all be open-minded about the future of the licence fee beyond this point,” said Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan.

“These are not easy issues and they will require some honest and at times difficult conversations,” she added.

Anyone who installs or uses a television or watches the BBC’s streaming and catchup service iPlayer must pay the 154.50-pound ($198) charge or be guilty of a criminal offence, resulting in a fine of as much as 1,000 pounds. Failure to pay can lead to a criminal conviction.

12,2020/02/05,More Chinese cities shut down as virus toll rises,"Millions more people have been ordered to stay indoors as China battles to curb the spread of a new virus that authorities said on Wednesday has already killed nearly 500 people.

With more than 24,000 cases in China, a growing number of cities have been imposing a range of restrictions in recent days far from central Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak.

Global concerns have risen as cases continue to spread abroad, with 10 people testing positive for the virus on a ship quarantined off the coast of Japan.

In Hangzhou, some 175 km southwest of Shanghai, fences blocked streets near the headquarters of Chinese tech giant Alibaba as a fighter jet circled overhead.

The firm is based in one of three Hangzhou districts subject to new restrictions that allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities. “Please don’t go out, don’t go out, don’t go out!” blared a message on a loudspeaker urging people to wear masks, wash their hands regularly and report any people who are from Hubei — reflecting a common fear that people from the province might infect others.

At least three other cities in Zhejiang province — Taizhou, Wenzhou and parts of Ningbo — have imposed the same measures, affecting 18 million people.

Similar restrictions have been put in place in Heilongjiang province on the Russia border.

13,2020/02/05,Donald Trump vs Nancy Pelosi: State of the Union turns into a snub match,"A bitter feud between U.S. President Donald Trump and top Democrat Nancy Pelosi boiled over at his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, with Mr. Trump denying her a handshake and Ms. Pelosi ripping apart a copy of his remarks behind his back.

Trump avoided the subject of his impeachment drama in a pugnacious 80-minute speech, but the raw wounds from the battle were evident with fellow Republicans giving him standing ovations while rival Democrats for the most part remained seated.

The Republican-led Senate was expected to acquit him of charges he abused his powers and obstructed Congress during a vote beginning at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday (2.30 a.m. IST, Thursday).

Seeing Ms. Pelosi, the U.S. House of Representatives speaker, for the first time since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago, Mr. Trump declined to shake her outstretched hand as he gave her a paper copy of his remarks before starting to speak.

Taken aback

Despite having not spoken to Mr. Trump since their last meeting, Ms. Pelosi appeared to be taken aback. She avoided citing the customary “high privilege and distinct honour” that usually accompanies the Speaker’s introduction of the President to Congress.

“Members of Congress, the President of the United States” was all she said in introducing Mr. Trump.

When his speech ended, Ms. Pelosi stood and tore up her copy of the remarks he had handed her, later telling reporters it was ”the courteous thing to do, considering the alternative.”

Kayleigh McEnany, Mr. Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, said of Ms. Pelosi: “Her hatred for @realdonaldtrump has blinded her to the repulsive nature of her smug, elitist behaviour.”

After the event, Ms. Pelosi tweeted a photo of her with her hand reaching out to Mr. Trump and said, “Democrats will never stop extending the hand of friendship to get the job done #ForThePeople. We will work to find common ground where we can, but will stand our ground where we cannot. #SOTU”

The tension was a sign that little legislative progress should be expected with the presidential election nine months away.

Impeachment case

The impeachment case has intensified bitter feelings between Mr .Trump and Ms. Pelosi that have existed throughout his presidency. He routinely calls her “Crazy Nancy” at his rallies.

As he began the speech, Republicans from both houses of Congress chanted “four more years” while he stood at the lectern in the chamber of the House.

Democrats sat silently and some could be seen shaking their heads as Trump declared, “The state of our union is stronger than ever before.”

Ms. Pelosi, who dropped her opposition to impeachment and allowed Democratic lawmakers to seek the charges against him, sat stoically and grim-faced behind Mr. Trump and paged through a paper copy of his speech as he spoke.

14,2020/02/05,"In China, infant tests positive for coronavirus just 30 hours after birth","A baby in China's epidemic-hit Wuhan city has been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus just 30 hours after being born, Chinese state media reported Wednesday.

The infant is the youngest person recorded as being infected by the virus, which has killed nearly 500 people since emerging late last year.

CCTV quoted experts as saying it may be a case of “vertical transmission”, referring to infections passed from mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth or immediately after.

The mother had tested positive for the virus before she gave birth.

The official Xinhua news agency reported Monday that a baby born last week to an infected mother had tested negative.

The disease is believed to have emerged in December in a Wuhan market that sold wild animals, and spread rapidly as people travelled for the Lunar New Year holiday in January.

15,2020/02/05,"Analysis | For China’s Xi, the coronavirus challenge comes laden with economic costs and political risks","During a visit last September to the Central Party School, an elite institution in west Beijing that trains China’s future leaders, President Xi Jinping held forth on the major risks facing his country.

The slowing economy and the trade war with America would have been top of his mind as he warned of “complicated struggles” facing the country. Mr. Xi specifically mentioned the economy, China’s diplomatic environment, Hong Kong amid the unprecedented protests there, and Taiwan, where the prospect of reunification seemed slimmer than ever, as major risks.

Also read | In China, infant tests positive for coronavirus just 30 hours after birth

Mr. Xi was speaking on the eve of what the Communist Party of China (CPC) was billing as the first of four key anniversaries. In October, China would mark 70 years of the People’s Republic with a grand military parade. This year will mark the end of absolute poverty in China, a remarkable economic feat. In 2021, the CPC turns 100, while the following year, the 20th Party Congress will mark 10 years of Mr. Xi’s rule — for China, landmarks on what Mr. Xi like to call the country’s “road to rejuvenation” and achieving the “Chinese Dream”.

But just four months on after his speech, little would Mr. Xi have imagined that the biggest test of his 8-year rule would come not from far-away America but from Wuhan, a beautiful town of lakes and parks that is famous in Chinese history for launching the uprising that would bring down China’s last imperial dynasty.

As China grapples with the fallout of the novel coronavirus outbreak, which as of February 5 has killed more than 490 people and infected more than 24,000, Mr. Xi and the CPC are already counting the costs, both economic and political.

The 11 million people of Wuhan and more than 40 million others in Hubei Province have been in lockdown, after Mr. Xi ordered the unprecedented quarantining of an entire city on January 23.

On February 3, Mr. Xi admitted that the outbreak was “a major test of China’s system and capacity for governance”, as he chaired a special meeting of the party’s top Politburo Standing Committee (PBSC). This followed the extraordinary January 25 meeting of the PBSC, proceedings of which were televised for the first time ever, as the leadership scrambled to respond to growing public anger and to make up for days of inaction by the Hubei Provincial government that allowed the virus to spread for close to one month before they realised the severity of the situation.

Mr. Xi outlined a two-fold agenda: controlling the epidemic, which he warned “directly affects” economic and social stability, and “safeguarding economic and social order”.

That is going to be easier said than done. The country has come to a standstill because of the extraordinary measures deployed to contain the outbreak. Factories are shut down. Many workers who were due to return this week after the Lunar New Year holiday remained confined to their villages and towns that are in effective lock-down, even in far away Provinces. Those that manage to leave home and return to work are being confined on arrival for 14 days.

Consumer spending is on pause. Apple and Starbucks are among the many outlets that have shut shop in the mainland. Cities as far away as Hangzhou, home to e-commerce giant Alibaba is based, are in complete lockdown.

The economic costs will be enormous. The timing, during the New Year holiday, couldn’t have been worse, with the outbreak costing the economy more than 500 billion Yuan ($72 billion), according to economists who estimate this year’s spending won’t even match half of what the 2019 holiday saw. The holiday is a key period for industries ranging from tourism to films. Last year, box office sales during the holiday accounted for 10% of the annual total.

The costs will far exceed what the 2003 SARS outbreak cost China, reportedly knocking off one percentage point of GDP growth to the then $2 trillion economy. China grew 10.1% in 2004, up from 10% the previous year, before rebounding to 11.4% growth in 2005. In 2020, growth could fall to 5.6%, down from 6.1% last year, estimates Oxford Economics, the lowest since 1990.

Then there are the political risks. Mr. Xi’s comments on February 3 suggest he is certainly aware that that the Party’s credibility has been hit by its handling of the crisis. There is an outpouring of anger towards the provincial leadership, and people are asking if China has progressed or regressed since the botched handling of SARS 17 years ago. “Transparency does not cause panic, the only source of panic is an absence of truth,” the respected magazine Caixin said in an editorial. “That is the lesson SARS taught us 17 years ago, and this has proven it again at a terrible cost.”

At the same time, it’s simplistic to assume that every piece of bad news in China hurts Mr. Xi. If the country emerges quickly from the epidemic, an outcome the world will be hoping for, Mr. Xi may well frame it as a defence of the robustness of the Chinese system and further push the political tightening and centralisation that his two-terms have seen. The initial cover-ups, which have brought enormous costs to the people of Wuhan, will become a footnote on the road to rejuvenation.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/jm87hn/article30736585.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FearOverTheCity,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/analysis-for-chinas-xi-biggest-challenge-yet-comes-laden-with-risks/article30742980.ece

On Tuesday, the carrier said it planned to cut about 30% of capacity over the next two months, including about 90% of flights to mainland China.

“Today, we are appealing to all employees to participate in the special leave scheme, which will take effect from 1 March and last until 30 June,” Cathay said in a statement. “All employees will have the option to take three weeks of unpaid leave in this period.”

The leave is not mandatory, a spokeswoman said, but it is encouraged.

18,2020/02/05,Indo-U.S. trade deal likely during Trump’s India visit,"India and the U.S. are set to seal a trade deal during President Donald Trump’s planned visit to India in the last week of February, multiple sources said.

Trade officials of India and the U.S. are giving final touches to the deal expected to cover specific sectors, they said.

Trump is set to visit India on a two-day trip between February 23 and 26.

The main segment of the visit will take place in the national capital, though an option of having a short visit by Trump to another city is being explored.

The cities being considered include Agra and Ahmedabad.

A high-level logistics team from Washington handling Trump’s foreign trips visited India last week as part of preparations for his maiden tour of India as the U.S. president.

“The trade deal and a pact on further enhancing defence cooperation are likely to be sealed during the visit by the U.S. president,” said a source.

India is seeking exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products as well as resumption of benefits on tariff on certain products under their Generalised System of Preferences.

India is also pressing the U.S. to facilitate greater market access for its products in the U.S. in sectors such as agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand the U.S. wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices in India.

In 2018-19, India’s exports to the U.S. stood at $52.4 billion, while imports were $35.5 billion. Trade deficit dipped from $21.3 billion in 2017-18 to $16.9 billion in 2018-19.

India received FDI worth $3.13 billion from the U.S. in 2018-19, higher than $2 billion in 2017-18.

India had invited Trump to grace the Republic Day parade as the chief guest last year but the U.S. President could not come due to scheduling issues.

During his visit to the U.S. in September last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had reminded Trump of his invitation to him to visit India along with his family

19,2020/02/05,"State of the Union speech: Trump scorns Democrats, touts economy","U.S. President Donald Trump, emerging from the shadow of impeachment, faced Democratic lawmakers who seek to toss him from office on Tuesday at a State of the Union speech he used to belittle his opponents and tout the U.S. economy.

Trump avoided the subject of his impeachment in the early portion of his speech, but the scars from the battle were evident with fellow Republicans giving him standing ovations while rival Democrats for the most part remained seated.

The Republican-led Senate was expected to acquit him on Wednesday of charges he abused his powers and obstructed Congress.

Seeing U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the first time since she stormed out of a White House meeting four months ago, he declined to shake her outstretched hand as he gave her a copy of the speech. Pelosi appeared to be taken aback. She and Trump have not spoken since their October meeting, both sides said.

'Big improvement over Obama'

In the audience, Republicans from both houses of Congress chanted “four more years” as he stood at the lectern in the chamber of the House with a presidential election almost exactly nine months away. Democrats sat silently and some could be seen shaking their heads as Trump declared, “The state of our union is stronger than ever before.”

Pelosi, who dropped her opposition to impeachment and allowed Democratic lawmakers to seek impeachment charges against him, sat stoically and grim-faced behind Trump and paged through a written copy of his speech. Trump presented himself as a big improvement over Democratic President Barack Obama, whom he succeed three years ago.

“In just three short years we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,” he said. The House impeachment managers, who are acting as prosecutors in the Senate impeachment trial, were seated together at the front of the Democrats' section.

Many House Democratic women wore white for a second year in a row, a sign of the suffragist movement that won women the right to vote 100 years ago. Several Democratic lawmakers refused to attend the annual speech to protest Trump.

Attack on healthcare proposals

Trump, using the speech to lay out his vision for a second four-year term, attacked some of the healthcare proposals being debated among his Democratic rivals on the campaign trail. Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have proposed healthcare plans that would be entirely run by the government, a sharp departure from the current, private system in which millions of Americans get medical insurance from their employers.

While Trump has likened their plans to socialism, his lack of a healthcare plan has left him open to criticism that he has not put enough work into finding a way to reduce rising insurance costs that burden middle-class Americans. “We will never let socialism destroy American healthcare!” Trump said.

Trump offered an upbeat portrayal of his presidency in hopes of persuading Americans to give him another four-year term in the November 3 election. “In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American Decline and we have rejected the downsizing of Americas destiny. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!” Trump said.

Aides said Trump wanted to keep the speech upbeat despite his anger at being impeached by the House. He was expected to address the controversy after his almost certain acquittal in the Senate. Trump also revived his arguments that migrants should be stopped from crossing the southern U.S. border and that so-called “sanctuary cities” where migrants are protected are wrong.

After coming close to a broad conflict with Iran after he ordered the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, Trump said “we are working to end America's wars in the Middle East.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/9ho2pm/article30739930.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/STATEOFTHEUNION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/state-of-the-union-speech-trump-scorns-democrats-touts-economy/article30739931.ece
20,2020/02/05,"Coronavirus: deaths in China rise to 490, over 20 countries confirm positive cases","The number of people killed in China by the coronavirus outbreak jumped on February 5 to 490, after hardest-hit Hubei province reported 65 more people had died — the biggest single-day tally since the first fatalities emerged last month.

More than 20 countries have confirmed cases of the virus, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a global health emergency, several governments to institute travel restrictions, and airlines to suspend flights to and from China.

The WHO said Tuesday that the dramatic measures taken by China had provided a ""window of opportunity"" to halt transmission, while calling for more global solidarity to combat the virus. The novel coronavirus has continued to spread with Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand on Tuesday reporting new infections that were not imported from China.

In a sign of growing concern about a spread to other densely-populated Chinese metropolitan areas, authorities in three cities in eastern Zhejiang province — including one near Shanghai — limited the number of people allowed to leave their homes.

Three districts in Hangzhou — including the area where the main office of Chinese tech giant Alibaba is based — now allow only one person per household to go outside every two days to buy necessities, affecting some three million people. The city is only 175 kilometres southwest of the financial hub of Shanghai, which has reported more than 200 cases, including one death. Zhejiang has confirmed 829 cases — the highest number outside the central province of Hubei, whose capital Wuhan is the epicentre of the outbreak.

The WHO has said the outbreak does not yet constitute a ""pandemic"".

The head of the organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, accused wealthy countries of falling short on their duties in sharing data, stating that: ""Of the 176 cases reported outside China so far, WHO has received complete case report forms for only 38 percent.""

Hong Kong's first death

The death of the 39-year-old man in Hong Kong came as the semi-autonomous city closed all but two land crossings with the Chinese mainland.

Health officials noted that the mortality rate for the new coronavirus stood at 2.1%, with most victims either old or with underlying health problems. SARS killed nearly 10% of patients.

New foreign cases

Singapore confirmed the first four cases of people being infected locally, taking the total number of infections in the city-state to 24.

In another example of growing global anxiety, Japan has quarantined a cruise ship carrying 3,711 people and was testing those onboard for the virus after a former passenger was diagnosed with the illness in Hong Kong.

Macau, China's semi-autonomous gambling hub that is popular with mainland Chinese visitors, decided to temporarily close all of its casinos for at least two weeks.

And the UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Tuesday advised Britons to leave China, ""if they can"", to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus. The United States, meanwhile, acknowledged that the outbreak may delay Beijing's plans to purchase American goods under the terms of a deal meant to end the two countries' trade war.

Beijing admits 'shortcomings'

China made a rare admission of fallibility earlier this week, acknowledging ""shortcomings and difficulties exposed in the response to the epidemic"". The government also said it ""urgently"" needed medical equipment such as surgical masks, protective suits, and safety goggles as it battles the outbreak.

Most of the deaths have been in Wuhan and the rest of surrounding Hubei province, which has largely been under lockdown for almost two weeks.

A 1,000-bed field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch within two weeks to relieve overburdened medical facilities started receiving patients on Tuesday, with a second makeshift hospital due to open later this week. A cultural building, an exhibition centre and a gymnasium have also been converted into improvised clinics with 3,400 beds.

21,2020/02/05,Iran to execute man who ‘spied’ for CIA,"Iran said on Tuesday that its top court confirmed a death sentence for an Iranian man convicted of spying for the CIA, with State media alleging that he had shared details of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear program with the American spy agency.

Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili identified the purported spy as Amir Rahimpour and said he would be executed soon. Mr. Esmaili did not elaborate on what Rahimpour was accused of doing, nor on his age or background.

A report by the state-run IRNA news agency alleged that Rahimpour received money from the CIA to share details of Iran’s nuclear program.

“While being in touch with the spy agency, he earned a lot of money as wages as he tried to deliver some information from Iran’s nuclear program to the American agency,” the IRNA report said. Rahimpour “had been identified and prosecuted and sentenced to death and recently, the country’s National Supreme Court confirmed the sentence and, God willing, he will be punishşd soon.”

The CIA did not respond to a request for comment. Two other alleged spies for CIA each received 15-year prison sentences — 10 years for spying and five years for acting against national security.

Esmaili did not name those arrested, only saying they worked in the “charitable field,” without elaborating.

Iran in the past has sentenced alleged American and Israeli spies to death. The last such spy executed was Shahram Amiri, who defected to the U.S. at the height of Western efforts to thwart Iran’s nuclear program. When he returned in 2010, he was welcomed with flowers by government leaders and even went on the Iranian talk-show circuit. Then he mysteriously disappeared.

Tensions remain high between Iran and the U.S. since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran’s nuclear deal. A U.S. drone strike in January killed Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad, prompting Tehran to retaliate with a ballistic missile strike on Iraqi bases housing American troops.

Before the deal, a computer virus believed to be designed by the U.S. and Israel destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Meanwhile, Iranian nuclear scientists were targeted in a series of assassinations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iran-to-execute-man-who-spied-for-cia/article30736939.ece
22,2020/02/05,United Kingdom citizens told to return from China,"Britain on Tuesday urged all of its citizens in China to leave because of the virus outbreak, while Belgium became the latest nation to announce a confirmed case.

The U.K. Foreign Office said in an updated travel advisory that commercial airline options remain available throughout China, with the exception of Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak that includes the hard-hit city of Wuhan. The British government said it will still try to evacuate British citizens from Hubei, where some 50 million people are under travel restrictions.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab asked U.K. citizens in China to “leave the country if they can, to minimise their risk of exposure to the virus.”

France also issued an advisory, warning against any non-essential travel to China and suggesting that French citizens in China return home.

More than 20,400 people have been infected with the virus in China and 425 have died. Two other people have tested positive last week for the SARS-like virus in Britain. Both had travelled to China recently.

23,2020/02/05,"Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders lead in Iowa","As the Iowa Democratic Party began releasing partial results from Monday’s caucuses that kicked off the primary race of the party, Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old Mayor from Southbend, Indiana, led the candidates in State delegates, followed closely by progressive candidate Bernie Sanders. Former Vice-President Joseph R. Biden performed poorly as per polls prior to the caucuses.

The Iowa race is crucial to winning the nomination as it provides candidates with momentum to carry them through to July, when the Democratic Party will chooses its presidential nominee.

The party released results first around 4 pm and then later Tuesday night, with 71% of 1,765 precincts reporting. Mr. Buttigieg led with 26.8% of state delegate equivalents, followed Mr. Sanders, at 25.2%. Mr Sanders’s fellow progressive candidate Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, came in third with 18.4% of the vote followed by Mr. Biden at 15.4% and Senator Amy Klobuchar, from Iowa’s northern neighbour, Minnesota, in fifth place with 12.6%.

Lead in popular votes

Mr. Sanders, however, led Mr. Buttigieg narrowly in the first two popular vote statistics — the first and second alignment (the first round of voting and the second round of voting when supporters of non-viable candidates realign with a viable candidate). The Democratic party is reporting the first and second alignments as well as the State delegate equivalents this year as opposed to just the third number, which has been historically reported. The State delegate equivalents is used to calculate the number of ‘pledged delegates’ a candidate sends to the nominating convention in July (currently Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are equal on that count, with 10 pledged delegates). Mr. Buttigieg, who came out as gay a few years ago, addressed supporters in New Hampshire, where Democrats will compete against each other next week in a primary race.

“It validates for a kid somewhere in a community wondering if he belongs or she belongs or they belong in their community, if you believe in your country, there’s a lot backing up that belief,” Mr. Buttigieg said.

Mr. Biden, 77, who like Mr. Buttigieg, is making a play for moderate and independent voters, had relatively slim crowds at his events in the run-up to Monday’s caucuses, based on reports. The former Vice-President is banking on the South Carolina primary later in February, where he is expected to win, as per polls, with support from African Americans.

For now, candidates have begun canvassing in New Hampshire where Mr. Sanders has a sizeable advantage, as per the latest state poll , with Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg tied for second place.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/aob87p/article30739754.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THPETEBUTTIGIEG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/buttigieg-takes-lead-in-iowa-caucuses-sanders-second/article30739755.ece
24,2020/02/05,Coronavirus: China converts an exhibition hall into a makeshift hospital in Wuhan,"Hundreds of empty beds lined an exhibition centre converted into a makeshift hospital at the epicentre of China’s deadly virus epidemic on Tuesday, awaiting coronavirus patients.

Authorities are scrambling to provide facilities, beds and medical treatment for an influx of sick people in Wuhan in central Hubei province, the ground-zero of China’s fight against the virus. The disease has killed more than 400 people and infected a further 20,000 in China, nearly all of them in Hubei, and spread to two-dozen countries since it emerged in December.

Hong Kong and the Philippines have also reported deaths, and the World Health Organization has declared the crisis a global health emergency. State media said the converted exhibition centre, along with a nearby gymnasium, will house an extra 3,400 beds and provide “emergency treatment and clinical testing” for those infected with the virus in Wuhan.

In its daily update Tuesday, China’s National Health Commission said there had been 64 new deaths from the virus — all in hardest-hit Hubei province — bringing the national toll to 425. Other coronavirus patients began arriving Tuesday at a field hospital in Wuhan built from scratch in under two weeks, State media said, following a round-the-clock construction marathon that became a national social media sensation.

Fifty patients arrived at the military-run facility, the state-backed China Daily reported, with images showing workers in protective suits pushing people in wheelchairs up a ramp and into the pre-fabricated structure. As reports surfaced of bed shortages in hospitals in Wuhan, construction began on Huoshenshan — Fire God Mountain in Chinese — on Friday January 24.

Workers toiled day and night amid a forest of earthmovers and trucks carting materials around the site, southwest of the centre of the city of 11 million. On the side of one of the trucks, the isolated city's new rallying cry — “Let's go Wuhan!” — was written on a banner. Leishenshan (Thunder God Mountain), another hospital on an adjacent site, is set to start admitting patients on Thursday, with 1,600 beds.

Fire and thunder

Fire and thunder are traditionally associated in China with protection against illnesses. All workers wore masks, as mandated by the authorities for the entire population of Wuhan, and were checked for fevers during their breaks. By the following Friday, they had laid 400 prefabricated shipping-container-like rooms, after setting concrete foundations and routing the power supply to the complex.

The two-floor facility was handed over to the army on Sunday and will be staffed with 1,400 military medics, including some with experience dealing with SARS and Ebola. State media had initially reported that patients would begin arriving Monday -- inside the 10-day timeframe authorities had set out when construction began.

Authorities said the Wuhan facilities were modelled on the Xiaotangshan hospital in Beijing, which was built from prefabricated structures in barely a week to treat patients infected by SARS in 2003. That pathogen killed 349 people in China and hundreds more in Hong Kong and abroad.

However, with the death toll surging in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hubei province, it was not immediately clear what overall impact the hospitals would have on the virus spreading elsewhere. The city also plans to convert three existing venues, including a gymnasium and an exhibition centre, into hospitals, the Wuhan government said. The three buildings will be turned into healthcare facilities with a total of 3,400 beds to take in patients with mild symptoms.

Livestreamed

Footage of the mammoth construction effort was livestreamed continuously on social media and watched tens of millions of times. It has also been feted endlessly in State media as an example of the decisive response to the public health crisis after authorities in Hubei faced a torrent of public anger for perceived incompetence, including delays in announcing the public health emergency.

Local Communist Party secretary Ma Guoqiang acknowledged Friday that officials had worsened the spread of the virus by failing to restrict travel earlier. When a lockdown and blanket travel ban were finally introduced, they swept up more than 50 million people in Wuhan and nearby cities.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-china-converts-an-exhibition-hall-into-a-makeshift-hospital-in-wuhan/article30736894.ece
25,2020/02/05,"World is not facing a pandemic yet, says WHO","The World Health Organization said Tuesday that the outbreak of the deadly novel coronavirus, which has spread from China to two dozen countries, does not yet constitute a “pandemic”.

“Currently we are not in a pandemic,” Sylvie Briand, head of WHO’s Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness division, told reporters in Geneva. Instead, she said, “we are at the phase where it is an epidemic with multiple foci.”

The disease has killed more than 425 people and infected a further 20,000 in China, nearly all of them in central Hubei province — the epicentre of the outbreak — and spread to two-dozen countries since it emerged in December. Ms. Briand said that while there is rapid spread of transmission in Hubei, outside the province there are mainly “spillover cases” with sporadic clusters of transmission.

“In these other places in China, the strategy currently is to stop transmission,” she said, adding that the same was true for affected countries outside of China. “We would like to make sure that we don't have a second Hubei type of scenario,” she said. Authorities in China have taken dramatic measures to halt transmission, while other affected countries have put in place steps to rein in the spread.

‘Wearing mask not enough’

“Countries are implementing early case detection, early isolation and treatment of patients, contact tracing to make sure they identify very early contacts that become symptomatic,” Ms. Briand pointed out.

“We hope that based on ... measures in Hubei but also in other places where we have had spillover, we can stop transmission and get rid of this virus,” she said. Ms. Briand acknowledged that halting the spread of the new pneumonia-like virus would be “challenging”.

“I am not saying it is easy, but...we believe that it can be done,” she said.

The respiratory disease spreads through droplets, for instance when people sneeze or cough, or likely through direct contact with infected people or with objects they have touched. But Ms. Briand said it remained unclear how long the virus could linger on an object, stressing the need for frequent hand-washing to protect against transmission.

“To stop transmission of this virus, it is very important that sick people wear masks” to avoid infecting others, she said, adding though the benefits of healthy people wearing masks as a precautionary measure were less clear. People wearing masks but not taking other precautions like frequently washing their hands could have a “false sense of security”, she said.

“Masks alone are not enough. It is a package of measures that you have to put in place,” Ms. Briand said. “If people use the entire package, it is fine. If they just use masks, I think it is not enough.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world-is-not-facing-a-pandemic-yet-says-who/article30736795.ece
26,2020/02/05,U.N. takes no action on order against Myanmar on Rohingyas,"The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday discussed the International Court of Justice’s order that Myanmar must do all it can to prevent genocide against the Rohingya Muslims, but failed to agree on a statement.

Myanmar’s ally China as well as Vietnam, which is part of the regional Association of Southeast Nations along with Myanmar, objected, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the meeting was closed.

Instead, the European Union members of the council urged Myanmar in a joint statement to reporters afterward to comply with the measures ordered by the U.N.’s top court, stressing that they are “compulsory under international law.”

France, Germany, Belgium and Estonia along with former council member Poland also urged Myanmar “to take credible action to bring to justice those responsible for human rights violations.”

""Myanmar must address the root causes of its conflicts, in Rakhine State, but also in Kachin and Shan States,” the EU members said. “Accountability of perpetrators of human rights and humanitarian law violations is a necessary part of this process.”

More than 700,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after Myanmar security forces launched a crackdown on the Muslim minority in August 2017 in response to an attack by a Rohingya insurgent group. Bangladesh currently houses over 1 million Rohingya refugees.

Myanmar has long claimed the Rohingya are “Bengali” migrants from Bangladesh, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all Rohingya have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless, and they are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights.

The EU countries said “Myanmar must also create conditions for and facilitate a voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable return of the Rohingya to Myanmar.”

They also reiterated the Security Council’s call for Myanmar to implement the recommendations of the Annan commission which before the August 2017 attacks called for Myanmar to grant citizenship and ensure other rights to the Rohingya. It also urged the government to promote investment and community-directed growth to alleviate poverty in Rakhine.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/m8bptx/article30738384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THROHINGYAS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/un-takes-no-action-on-order-against-myanmar-on-rohingyas/article30738385.ece
27,2020/02/05,Flight of fantasy with Michael Sheen: 'I’d be happy being a part of anything Neil Gaiman creates',"Michael Sheen finds it ironic that working in a big-budget film entails reacting to the “most cheap-looking environments”. The Welsh actor, who played Aziraphale, a haute cuisine-loving angel on Earth, in Good Omens, has found himself navigating several fantasy worlds as an actor. Be it Tron: Legacy (2010) or the recently-released (and critically panned), Dolittle, where he plays the doctor’s long-time rival. “They use a lot of CGI, so usually it is someone holding a stick with bits of sticky tape on the end, or a tennis ball,” says Sheen, in an email interaction on the occasion of his 51st birthday (February 5). “It becomes a lot more like playing pretend as a child. It is a purer experience in some ways — just having to rely on your imagination, which can be strangely liberating.”

In the dark

Even though Sheen immerses his viewers in a fantasy world, the reactions he gathers are distinctly human. In several interviews after the première of Good Omens — the series adaptation of Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett’s hugely-popular novel — the actor said that the show resonated most with young people, especially those who don’t necessarily fit in. “I think the idea of two characters [Aziraphale and Crowley, the demon played by David Tennant] who are separate from humanity but also intrinsically connected to it, is appealing,” speculates Sheen. “They are bonded to each other because of their isolation. All the characters are outsiders in one way or another, and rendered with such compassion,” says Sheen, whose admiration for Gaiman’s works is evident as he gushes about the novelist. “I’d be happy being a part of anything Neil creates. Aside from his extraordinary imagination, I think his work is so full of warmth, wit and humanity.”

Staying grounded

Amusingly, the show also garnered flak from Christian hardliners in the US, who, among several things, criticised that the voice of God was a woman. “People are entitled to their opinion,” he says, adding, “When it comes to religion, I think people, too, can lose sight of principles and get distracted by appearances. A shaky connection to substance can often lead to an obsession with superficial detail.” To keep himself rooted in ground realities, the actor has been invested in political activism, even more since 2016, triggered by the rise of right-wing populism in the UK and the US. Last summer, he organised the Homeless World Cup soccer tournament in Wales. “I now have an organisation that works on issues around homelessness and social exclusion primarily in Wales. [My] work on ending exploitative high-cost credit practices continues and I’m looking at alternative funding models for local journalism,” he adds.

Even as an actor, Sheen has contributed to chronicling political realities. He famously played public figures like former British Prime Minister Tony Blair in The Queen (2006) and television host David Frost in Frost/Nixon (2008). “I enjoy being able to draw on real-life research for characters who are familiar to the audience,” he says, fondly remembering playing disabilities rights activist and poet Arthur Honeyman in The Music Within (2007).

On Prodigal Son

Currently, the actor is shooting for the Prodigal Son, where he plays a doctor who has committed at least 23 gruesome murders. Ask him if such a role impacts him, and he says, “All characters impact you, consciously and unconsciously. It is the combination that, used well, creates a work of note. But it also shows that what you work on, and give your focus to, can have effects on you beyond your control. This can be a great source of inspiration and creativity, but can also be harmful and destructive if you don’t take that fact on board properly,” says Sheen, who has been lauded for his performance as the villainous Dr Martin Whitly in the top-rated series. For him, darker the material, “the more careful you have to be about being aware of those effects expressing themselves in your life”.

In his three-decade-long career, Sheen has played numerous characters in cinema, onstage and television, but he singles out Thomas Vinterberg’s Far from the Madding Crowd (2015) as a film that deserved more attention than it received at the time. For me, it is Sheen’s recurring cameo in 30 Rock as Tina Fey’s misfit British soulmate, Wesley Snipes, that warranted more appreciation. “I really enjoyed how odd Wesley was, and that the more Tina got to know me the odder he became,” says Sheen, who looks forward to working with Fey again. In a few months, Quiz will be aired in the UK, where he plays TV host Chris Tarrant and his involvement in the cheating scandal on Britain’s Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. “If all goes well, I’ll be directing a three-part series for TV this summer,” he concludes.",entertainment,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/sstuv2/article30742536.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/US-ENTERTAINMENT-FILM-DOLITTLE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/micheal-sheen-on-his-51st-birthday/article30742537.ece
28,2020/02/05,"Nudge children to discover or self-learn concepts, says remedial therapist Seetha Anand Vaidyam","Do you give your child an oil massage? Do you play with him or her? Do you talk to him or her? Seetha Anand Vaidyam, in a workshop for parents and early educators at the Bhoomi Learning Community, spoke about the need to slow down and live life; not to run a race. “Parenting is not rocket science. It is a beautiful opportunity to become conscious of oneself and become better. How lovely is it to have someone living with you who can correct yourself?” she asks.

A holistic early childhood resource person, a remedial therapist and founder of Ananda Foundation, which works in education, health and environment, Seetha says the more quality time parents spend with their children, the better it would be for their overall development. The pressures of mainstream schooling puts a lot of stress on the child and it is the duty of the parents to not add to the stress, she says.

The workshop, which was on the Waldorf kindergarten system, discussed a holistic approach to education, which gave ample scope for the child to grow intellectually, emotionally as well as physically. The Waldorf system is based on the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner, which focusses on a child’s artistic and creative instincts rather than the conventional academic brilliance.

Seetha, a former Waldorf educator, works with schools that are open to more child-centred approaches. Based in Hyderabad, she conducts workshops across the country and has organised workshops in Dubai and Nepal as well. She, however, works with schools that follow a mainstream curriculum as well. She believes there needs to be a better nomenclature for different approaches to education. “Alternative education could suggest that it is a deviation from the “normal” education. This is why I prefer the term holistic.”

A holistic approach can make academic learning a joy and not a burden. It opens up possibilities of self-learning and can go miles in a child’s personal growth.

Mainstream schools, unfortunately, lay stress on rote learning, which can kill a child’s natural instincts to learn. “Before the fall of milk teeth, reading and writing are not what is expected of children. This system was practised in early India. Children went to school at a later age. This, however, changed since the British rule,” Seetha says. Children live in an extremely stressful environment today and even activities that are meant for relaxation tend to be competitive in nature.

The pluses of holistic learning is that it makes children learn through movement, music and play. The learning happening thus is subconscious and stays longer with the children. In the early years of education, teachers need to focus on sensory integration and development of the physical body and not just on academic learning, she says.

Concepts are introduced only according to the age of the children. “Fractions, for instance, are introduced only at age nine, when children can understand them better. Same with certain topics in history and science.”

Teaching in such a system, says Seetha, is guidance. “We merely nudge each child to discover, invent or self-learn concepts. Ready-made answers or imposition of existing knowledge is not done.”

Since children in Waldorf kindergartens do not read and write (the alphabet is introduced only in Class One), parents often are concerned about their integration in a mainstream school. “He or she could take a while to adjust and get used to the new system. But it is not impossible or it need not necessarily be stressful. It depends on how the parents prepare the child.”

The thrust therefore is on stress-free education and the need to protect children from early intellectual academic learning. “I find students from holistic schools to be creative, able to think for themselves and shaping into emotionally strong individuals.”",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/ecdgf4/article30742324.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KIMPCHILDREN,https://www.thehindu.com/society/how-learning-can-be-made-joyful/article30742329.ece
29,2020/02/05,Budget disappoints global financial majors,"The Union Budget presented last week has received a rather subdued response from global financial majors who feel that the it did not offer any major stimulus, as a result of which economic growth may remain muted longer than expected.

They also feel that execution would be the key challenge as the government has unveiled an ambitious privatisation plan, which faces many headwinds.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) said the markets will shift focus to earnings, among other things, as the Budget did not offer any major stimulus.

“We think the markets’ disappointment with the Budget will last a short while, post which MSCI India should continue to move with EM [emerging markets],” stated a report by BofAML, while highlighting the fact that the relatively modest cut in tax collections implied that the stimulatory impact of the measure on consumption or demand is likely to be small.

On February 1, when the Budget was presented, the benchmark Sensex lost nearly 1,100 points in intraday trading though it has recouped the losses in the sessions thereafter.

Credit Suisse’s view is that “growth may remain subdued for longer than market expectation, and that lower interest rates remain a necessary condition for growth revival.” It added the Budget had provided no stimulus to revive rural consumption — a key factor for the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector — as the total budgeted rural expenditure is largely flat year-on-year.

Thus, there is no stimulus for improving FMCG rural growth which is at a 15-year low, it said.

Goldman Sachs said execution would be key for the government due to an ‘ambitious privatisation plan.’

“The execution of privatisation plans was weak in FY20, and has historically been the case... The intent on privatisation is clear, and we think the plan to sell a part of its holding in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is a welcome move — what markets are looking for is greater progress in implementation,” stated the report by Goldman Sachs.

In a similar context, BofAML believes the government's divestment target implies full privatisation of several state-owned entities, which could face issues such as the limited capacity of the market and the government to manage such large offerings along with the complexity of each potential deal.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/bpmb74/article30745329.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BUBUDGET,https://www.thehindu.com/business/budget-disappoints-global-financial-majors/article30745330.ece

Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and CEO of U.S.-based research and consulting firm, Everest Group, said the challenge for the junior Mr. Premji is to find a strong operator who would work well with him and fit into Wipro’s working culture.

“This person, more importantly, should be able to drive growth as well by building further on the strong operations that Abid has put in place,” said Mr. Bendor-Samuel. Wipro’s outgoing CEO Abidali Neemuchwala did bring in necessary changes in the company in his four years at the helm.

“He took a hard decision to walk away from low-value deals and turned the company’s nose in the right direction. There is a lot more that needs to be done, for Wipro to catch up with icompetition,” said Hansa Iyengar, senior analyst at Ovum, a U.K.-based consulting firm.

Wipro was one of the first Indian IT companies to talk about ‘digital’ and pivot its business towards it. Mr. Neemuchwala is seen as having laid the foundation for the company’s digital business, according to analysts.

“However, [Wipro] was slow in making necessary investments and has lagged peers who are witnessing double-digit growth in their digital businesses. Slowing growth and declining margins mean less money to invest, which means lesser innovation, and that is a vicious cycle eating away at Wipro,” said Ms. Iyengar.

33,2020/02/05,"Govt. reviewing dividend tax rules for real estate, infra investment trusts","The government is reviewing the negative implications of the scrapping of the Dividend Distribution Tax, announced in the Union Budget 2020-21, for investors in real estate investment trusts and infrastructure investment trusts, also known as REITs and InvITs.

Dividend income was tax-free in the hands of REIT and InvIT investors so far, making it attractive for high-networth investors to put money in these trusts. Now, the dividend income will be rendered taxable in the hands of the investors.

“(REITs and InvITs) have been successful attempts at getting investments for real estate and other infrastructure,” Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a meeting with the CII National Council on late Tuesday evening. “We don’t intend to tax or burden InvITs,” she clarified in response to concerns raised by CII’s taxation committee chairman Rajeev Memani. “These are investors coming in for 15-20 years and a lot of those are domestic investors who are trying to build the retail InvITs market,” Mr. Memani, chairman of EY India pointed out, urging the government to retain the status quo as it would ensure a predictable and stable tax treatment for these instruments.

Industry officials have sought a meeting with Finance Ministry mandarins to impress upon them that the resultant double taxation burden could hit plans to raise around $100 billion in funds through InvITs and REITs. Moreover, existing investors in such trusts would also be liable to pay tax from the coming year.

This would detract from the government’s focus on spurring real estate and infrastructure projects to rev up the economy, according to the group of industry executives who have written to the Finance Ministry seeking a roll-back of this move.

Revenue Secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey said the government had received some representations on the taxability of REITs and InvITs on Monday. “So we are looking at that and if there are some anomalies, we will see how to address them,” he said.

Sources said senior Finance Ministry officials, including representatives from the Department of Economic Affairs, may also discuss the matter with industry executives over the Finance Minister’s three-day tour of Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata starting this Friday.Ms. Sitharaman said she was visiting the three cities to explain the provisions of the Budget and hear industry feedback on the same.

“The government’s REITs and InvITs policy framed with a great deal of detail had been very good and has led to $4-5 billion coming into the country in the last 12 months and is estimated to attract about ₹2 lakh crore more,” said Mr. Memani, stressing that income was taxed at only one level under InvITs till now.

While there was a special carve-out from DDT provisions for REITs and InvITs, the Budget provisions imply that the special purpose vehicle will pay tax on its income; dividends distributed by the SPV will not attract DDT, but the unit holders would be liable to pay tax on them (resulting in a second level of tax), industry executives have flagged.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/xfywo3/article30745287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06BUFLATS,https://www.thehindu.com/business/govt-reviewing-dividend-tax-rules-for-real-estate-infra-investment-trusts/article30745288.ece
34,2020/02/05,Cooperative banks to come under Reserve Bank regulation,"In the wake of the recent Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank crisis, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday approved amendments to the Banking Regulation Act to bring 1,540 cooperative banks under the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulation.

Cooperative banks have 8.6 lakh account holders, with a total deposit of about ₹5 lakh crore.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar told reporters that administrative matters would continue to be under the Registrar, Cooperative. However, cooperative banks would be regulated under the RBI’s banking guidelines. Their auditing would also be done as per its norms.

Qualifications would be laid down for appointments, including that of Chief Executive Officers. Prior permission from the RBI would be required for the appointment of key positions. The regulator would deal with issues such as loan waivers.

The RBI would also have powers to supersede the board of any cooperative bank in financial distress.

These measures would be implemented in a phased manner, said Mr. Javadekar.

The proposed amendments, along with the government’s decision to increase the insurance cover on bank deposits from ₹1 lakh to ₹5 lakh, have been brought to strengthen the financial stability of cooperative banks and boost public confidence in the banking system.

In the PMC Bank case, the RBI had to step in last year after massive irregularities in its loan accounts were detected. The regulator had to place a withdrawal limit for account holders, which led to a major public strife and protests by them.

37,2020/02/05,Parliament proceedings | Jairam slams govt. for not keeping promise to States,"The government has failed to deliver on its promise to give 42% of gross tax revenues to States, Congress member Jairam Ramesh said in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. He said the government needed to issue an explanation since it was a breach of promise.

“When this government announced that 42% of gross tax revenues will be devolved to the States, it was hailed as a game-changer by the Prime Minister and we all expected that this recommendation would actually be implemented in practice. In the year which will end on March 31, the fiscal year 2019-20, not 42 but 30% of gross tax revenues will be devolved to the States,” Mr. Ramesh said.

The government owed this House an explanation why a commitment made that 42% of tax revenues would go to States had actually become only 30%. “It is a breach of a commitment made in Budget speeches and by no less a person than the Prime Minister himself,” he added.

The Congress member also flagged that States which had been performing better than others were being “penalised” by the 15th Finance Commission. “I wish to point out that States where the per capita income is growing faster than the national average like Karnataka and Kerala are at a serious disadvantage because they find their shares falling. I would urge you to take this matter seriously,” he added.

Terms of reference

The Finance Commission’s terms of reference were also reworded by the government to saying that the Commission should now look at how expenditure for internal security and defence should be earmarked. “This would ultimately result in lowering of the amount of money that would be transferred from the Centre to the States,” Mr. Ramesh added.

He reiterated the stand of southern States which have been slamming the 15th Finance Commission for putting them in “great disadvantage.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bwvyt0/article29814398.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-JAIRAM-RAMESH-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jairam-slams-govt-for-not-keeping-promise-to-states/article30745181.ece

39,2020/02/05,VHP wants Trust to stick to original design of Ram temple,"The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) on Wednesday requested the newly announced Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust, which will oversee the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya following the Supreme Court verdict, to keep to the design finalised by the Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas, which had spearheaded the temple movement.

VHP working president Alok Kumar said at a press conference in New Delhi that they wanted adherence to the original design, as it had a large scale endorsement from the movement.

Mr. Kumar said every Hindu should have the privilege of contributing both monetarily and labour to the temple construction endeavour. Every individual could be asked to contribute a minimum of ₹11 to a public subscription model for raising funds. “Every Hindu, if he/she so wishes should also be allowed to contribute physically [haat lagaane ka mauka] in the temple construction”.

Public processions

Many villages that had contributed “Ram Shilas” or bricks at the height of the movement three decades ago should, between March 25 (the beginning of Chaitra Navaratri) and April 8 (Hanuman Jayanti), celebrate “Ramotsav” and take out ""shobha yatras"" (public processions) celebrating the temple construction, he said.

Mr. Kumar later said it would take around four years for constructing the temple, and that Ayodhya should have better infrastructure for pilgrims to visit, especially on their way to Prayagraj.

Mr. Naqvi was speaking during the discussion on the motion of thanks to the President for his address to Parliament on January 31 when he said the “bogus bashing brigade” was conspiring to “fool people” regarding the CAA. Since Parliament passed it on December 11, protests have sprung up against the law that fast-tracks citizenship for six religious groups, excluding Muslims, from three neighbouring countries.

The Minister said the BJP-led NDA government had stopped the “political exploitation” of minorities that he accused previous governments of doing. Mr. Naqvi said India was “heaven for minorities” while “Pakistan is hell” for them. He said political parties were trying to cause a “constitutional crisis” and ‘anarchy’, with several States coming out in opposition to it.

The Opposition, on the other hand, continued its attack on the government over the state of the economy and other issues left out of the President’s address, in what was day two of the discussion.

‘Crisis of confidence’

Congress MP Digvijaya Singh said there was a “crisis of confidence” and that the government was responding to the deteriorating condition of the economy by “selling the temples of modern India” — the public sector undertakings.

41,2020/02/05,Parliament proceedings | No foreign country has a right to interfere in India’s internal matters: Venkaiah Naidu,"Shiv Sena MP Anil Desai said on Wednesday that the Parliament should move a motion to counter the resolutions tabled against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in the European Union Parliament.

His comments, made during Zero Hour in the Rajya Sabha, were endorsed by Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu, who asked if the EU Parliament would like it if the Indian Parliament were to pass a resolution on Brexit.

So far four State Assemblies, including two Congress-ruled states of Punjab and Rajasthan, have passed resolutions against the CAA. There has been no commitment from the Maharashtra government, in which Congress is a partner, to move a similar motion.

Sena MP’s demand

Mr. Desai said, “Indian citizens, the Parliament and the government has the mandate to decide how to frame a law and how to implement it. The European Union, Pakistan, America or any other country has no right to interfere. This is our internal problem and together we will find a solution.”

Mr. Naidu said the Parliament is a sovereign authority to “discuss, debate and decide”.

“Other countries have no right to interfere in our internal affairs. I have already made it very clear and I am, once again, making it very clear. This is not a political issue. They have to take care of their own problems,” Mr. Naidu said. “This is a very clear message that the nation should send to all the international communities,” Mr. Naidu added.

Six political groups of members of the European Parliament had moved a joint resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, calling it discriminatory.

The European Parliament had, however, decided not to conduct a vote on the resolution during its new session beginning March 2.

The Trust is registered at the South Delhi residence of K. Parasaran, senior advocate who appeared in the Supreme Court on behalf of Mahant Suresh Das, a defendant in a law suit filed by the Sunni Waqf Board and others in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case.

The Centre appointed Mr. Parasaran to lead the Trust. The Board includes Kameshwar Chaupal, a Dalit leader from Bihar who was among the first to lay the foundation stone for Ram Mandir at Ayodhya in 1989; Bimlendra Mohan Pratap Mishra, erstwhile royal from Ayodhya; and Swami Vishwa Prasannateerth of Pejawar Math in Udupi.

The government took a conscious decision not to include any representative from the RSS or the VHP. Shankracharya Swami Saraswati Maharaj from Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, Anil Mishra, homoeopathic doctor from Ayodhya, and Paramanand Maharaj from Haridwar are among the members.

Contributions

The Trust deed says that the “trustees may accept donations, grants, subscriptions, aids or contribution from any person, government, local authorities or any other institution in cash or in kind, including immovable property/ properties without any conditions or terms inconsistent with this Trust or its objects.”

The deed said that all the other members of the Trust, which includes an IAS officer to be nominated by the Central and State government each, will have to be practising Hindus.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in a tweet, “There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirth Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society.”

The notification said that “taking into account past history of the communal disturbances” and large number of people who will be visiting the temple, the Central government decides to “effectuate the allotment of a suitable land measuring five acres to Sunni Central Waqf Board at a prominent place in Ayodhya, outside the land (67 acres) acquired under the said Act.”

The Ministry said: “In compliance with the directions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, possession of the inner and outer courtyards of the disputed site shall be handed over to the said Trust and the central government is at liberty to make suitable provisions in respect to the rest of the acquired land by handing it over to the said Trust for management and development in terms of the Scheme framed by the Central government.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/6lzn1c/article30069841.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25THRAMTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/mha-notifies-ram-temple-trust/article30744476.ece
44,2020/02/05,"Surrogate mother need not be a close relative, Rajya Sabha committee recommends","A surrogate mother need not be a “close relative” recommended the Rajya Sabha Select Committee on Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019, which also advocated omission of the five-year time limit before seeking surrogacy.

This is among the 15 major changes suggested by the 23-member committee that presented its report in the Upper House on Wednesday. The other major changes recommended by the Committee include — allowing single women (widow or a divorcee and Persons of Indian Origin) to avail of surrogacy, and increasing insurance cover for the surrogate mother from the 16 months proposed in the Bill to 36 months.

Stating that requiring the surrogate mother to be a “close relative” potentially restricts the availability of surrogate mothers, affecting genuinely needy persons, the Committee has recommended the removal of this requirement from the Bill. “A willing woman shall act as surrogate mother and be permitted to undergo surrogacy procedures as per the provisions of this Act,” it said.

Deleting definition

The other major recommendation concerns deleting the definition of “infertility” as “the inability to conceive after five years of unprotected intercourse” on grounds that it was too long a period for a couple to wait for a child.

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 is yet to be passed by the Rajya Sabha and the committee has held ten meetings since the Bill was referred to it by the Lok Sabha on November 21, 2019.

Chairman of the Committee Bhupender Yadav presented the report on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, in order to protect the interests of the child born through surrogacy, the Committee recommended that the order regarding the parentage and custody of the child, issued by a Magistrate, shall be the birth affidavit for the surrogate child.

‘Take up ART first’

As a general recommendation, the Select Committee said that the Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulation) Bill (ART), which is awaiting Cabinet approval, may be taken up before the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, since the ART Bill primarily deals with technical, scientific and medical aspects, including the storage of embryos, gametes, oocytes, etc. as contained in the Surrogacy Bill.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2l7fde/article30485076.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BABY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/surrogate-mother-need-not-be-a-close-relative-rajya-sabha-committee-recommends/article30744022.ece

Also read: Kunal Kamra demands apology, ₹25 lakh from IndiGo

Mr. Kamra, visiting India for a family function, was in for a shock when told at the airport that his ticket stood cancelled and that he was no longer “valid to fly”. Airline officials said that the system showed the PNR as being cancelled, since his name was Kunal Kamra and matched every letter in the name of stand-up comedian, who was the actually barred passenger.

Troubling onus

The Boston resident was made to produce multiple ID proofs before being allowed to fly by Air India. Though grateful for prompt assistance from airline staff and being allowed to board after a quick re-issue of his ticket at the airport itself, Mr. Kamra was concerned that the onus of proving that he was not actually the barred passenger fell entirely on him, just because they shared the same name.

Having learnt from this experience, Mr. Kamra, who was to later fly Indigo from Mumbai to Delhi reached out proactively to the airline and ensured that his ticket was not auto-cancelled by the system based on the name in the PNR.

‘Automatically rejected’

According to government sources, apex health research body Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had sought an emergency approval from the DCGI for the “restricted use” of the combination of two medications — lopinavir and ritonavir — for treatment of the respiratory ailment.

“We did our own docking studies and found that this could be a potentially useful drug against nCoV,” an ICMR official said.

This combination along with other drugs has been used in clinical trials in China, where the coronavirus first emerged, and Thailand for treating nCoV-affected patients.

“The DCGI has given a no objection for restricted use of this drug combination — lopinavir and ritonavir — in case of a public health emergency on patients affected by nCoV as per the treatment protocol designed by the ICMR,” a government source said.

“Before using this combo of drugs on any patient, the doctor has to take an informed consent from the patient,” the source said.

India has reported three confirmed cases of nCoV so far from Kerala, where nearly 2,000 people are under observation in hospitals and homes.

Three medical students of Wuhan University, all natives of Kerala, who recently returned to India have tested positive.

“As of now, patients are being treated with supportive therapies,” another source said.

On the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Group of Ministers (GoM) has been formed to review, monitor and evaluate the preparedness to contain the deadly nCoV infection in the country. The GoM had held its first meeting on Monday.

The Health Ministry has said that various precautionary measures have been undertaken in close coordination with the ministries concerned at the central level.

As many as 401 people have been quarantined at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) facility in Delhi’s Chhawla area since the last week after they were brought in two batches from Wuhan onboard separate Air India flights.

All those admitted to quarantine centres of the Army and the ITBP in and around the national capital are medically examined on a daily basis, though none of them has tested positive for coronavirus, health ministry officials said.

As part of India’s preparedness, passengers arriving from Thailand and Singapore, besides China and Hong Kong, are being screened for possible exposure to nCoV at all the 21 airports.

Screening is also being conducted at international seaports and border crossings.

The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to 490 in China on Tuesday while the number of those affected by the deadly disease has crossed 24,000.

One death was reported earlier this week from the Philippines.

47,2020/02/05,Parliament proceedings | Opposition walks out of Lok Sabha over Farooq Abdullah’s continued detention,"Opposition leaders in the Lok Sabha walked out of the House on Wednesday after raising the issue of the detention of National Conference (NC) leader and former Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) chief minister Farooq Abdullah, who has been under house arrest since August 5, when the Union government abrogated J&K’s special status accorded in Articles 370 and 35A.

“Three former chief ministers, including Farooq Abdullah, are languishing in jails for the past six months. They have been put behind bars without giving any proper reason,” Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said.

Stating that a sitting Member of Parliament is being detained illegally, Mr. Chowdhury demanded his release.

Congress chief whip K. Suresh, who had given an adjournment motion on the issue, first raised it but was cut short by the Speaker. “It is the responsibility of the government and the House to ensure his welfare [Mr. Abdullah’s] and that the NC leader gets to exercise his right as an elected representative,” he said.

When the Speaker did not allow Mr. Suresh to complete what he was reading from a text and asked other members to speak during Zero Hour, members of the Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), NC and the Muslim League trooped into the well of the House and started raising slogans for the release of Mr. Abdullah.

‘Close JNU’

Amidst the sloganeering, BJP MP from Ballia (Uttar Pradesh) Virender Singh demanded the temporary closure of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for “indulging in anti-national activities”.

“It [the University] was meant to give an opportunity to poor students but that has not been the case. People there are indulging in anti-national activities and doing Jinnah’s politics [late All-India Muslim League founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah] just like them [Congress/Opposition MPs],” Mr. Singh said.

At this point, members from the Congress, DMK, NCP and NC walked out of the House.

Trinamool Congress leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay then raised the issue of Mr. Abdullah’s incarceration and said the issue was also raised during the all-party meeting.

“I would request the government to intimate this House at least about his health condition. The principal Opposition party would not have had an opportunity for a walkout if the government had done so,” the Trinamool leader said.

Siachen shortage

Earlier, Mr. Chowdhury had raised the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) report on the acute shortages faced by soldiers posted in Siachen.

The CAG’s report, tabled in Parliament on Monday, pulled up the Army for the delay in the procurement of clothing, equipment, snow goggles and multi-purpose boots required to be provided to soldiers serving in high-altitude areas.

48,2020/02/05,Madhya Pradesh cabinet passes resolution against CAA,"The Cabinet of the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday passed a resolution against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, calling upon the Centre to abrogate it as it purportedly violates the basic tenets of the Constitution and the fundamental Right to Equality.

“In order to stay away from division based on religion and ensure equality before the law for all religions, the Madhya Pradesh government requests the Government of India to abrogate the law,” reads a note, passed at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

Speaking to reporters later, Law Minister P.C. Sharma said, “The resolution will be forwarded to the Centre.” So far, Kerala, Rajasthan, Punjab and West Bengal have passed such resolutions in their Assemblies. It’s as yet unclear whether Madhya Pradesh will follow suit and pass the resolution in its Assembly.

‘Withdraw before NPR’

Furthermore, the State government requested the Centre to begin the update of the National Population Register only after withdrawing the plan to seek new information, so that people’s apprehensions over it were done away with.

Stating that secularism formed the basic idea of the Constitution, the note said, “Article 14 guarantees equality and equal treatment before the law to everyone...the CAA has provisions making distinctions among illegal migrants based on religion.”

After the adoption of the Constitution in 1950, it said, this was the first instance when “a law prescribing distinction based on religion was enacted. This will endanger the country’s secular and tolerant being”.

‘All apprehensive’

It was beyond people’s understanding why such provisions were enacted in the law, which created apprehensions in everyone’s minds, it said. “As a result, there have been vast protests against it across the country, that are continuing. Even in Madhya Pradesh, there have been continuous protests against the law that have been peaceful and attended by all sections of society,” it added.

Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party State president and MP Rakesh Singh said, “The State government, by opposing a law passed according to Constitutional principles in the Parliament, is indulging in vote bank politics.

The government has argued in the Supreme Court that under the Delhi Prison Rules of 2018 the pendency of legal remedies or mercy petitions of other co-convicts would have no bearing on the fate of a convict whose plea for mercy has already been rejected.

‘Miscarriage of justice’

The government has argued that the 2018 Rules does not prohibit the execution of death sentence of co-convicts, one by one, on the rejection of their respective mercy petitions.

Deferring the execution of death sentence of all the four convicts, specifically when Mukesh’s mercy plea has already been dismissed by the President, has led to “gross miscarriage of justice” to the victim’s family as well as the society as a whole, the government contended. The convicts, the Centre said, were taking the judicial process for a ride.

The High Court judgment, however, held that the 2018 Rules observe that pendency of any application filed by one convict would necessarily require the postponement of the death sentence of all his co-convicts, even those whose mercy plea had been rejected.

The court said there could not be a situation whereby one convict “swings” and the others’ lives were later spared by the President. Commutation of death penalty of a fellow convict is a ground for filing fresh mercy petition after all, the High Court reasoned. The convicts have to be executed together and not separately, it held.

7 days’ time

The High Court judge, Justice Suresh Kait, however, gave convicts Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Kumar Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) seven days to exhaust all their available legal remedies. After this, the authorities would act as per rules, the judge said.

On December 16, 2012, Nirbhaya, a paramedical student, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted by six men in a private bus and thrown out of the moving vehicle along with her male friend. The victims later died of their injuries.

The four convicts have since been sentenced to death by a local court. The order has been upheld by the High Court and the Supreme Court.

Except Pawan, all convicts have exhausted their legal remedy available to file a curative petition before the Supreme Court. The President has also rejected the mercy pleas of Mukesh and Vinay.

A juvenile convict in the case has been released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term. One of the accused in the case, Ram Singh, died in the Tihar jail.

50,2020/02/05,"Cabinet clears major port in Maharashtra at a cost of ₹65,000 crore","The government on Wednesday approved setting up a new major port at Vadhavan near Dahanu in Maharashtra at a cost of ₹65,544.54 crore.

The decision was taken at a meeting of the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“Cabinet gives in-principle approval for setting up a new Major Port at Vadhavan in Maharashtra. Total cost of the project is likely to be ₹65,544.54 crore,” an official statement said.

Vadhavan port will be developed on landlord model, it said, adding that a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will also be formed with Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) as the lead partner with equity participation equal to or more than 50% to implement the project.

The SPV, the statement said, will develop the port infrastructure, including reclamation, construction of breakwater, besides establishing connectivity to the hinterland, and all the business activities will be undertaken under public private partnership (PPP) by private developers.

The position of JN Port, the biggest container port in India, is 28th in the world with a traffic of 5.1 million TEUs (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Units).

Even after the completion of 4th terminal at JN Port with a capacity increase up to 10 million TEUs by 2023, it will stand as the 17th largest container port in the world.

“With the development of Vadhavan port, India will break into the countries with top 10 container ports in the world,” it said.

Increasing containerization of cargo in the wake of value-added manufacturing sector makes it important to prepare our port infrastructure for handling import and export to facilitate manufacturing activity.

Container traffic in the JNPT hinterland is expected to grow from 4.5 MTEUs currently to 10.1 MTEUs by 2022-25 when JNPT’s potential will be fully exhausted.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/muld0c/article30742627.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JNPT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/cabinet-clears-major-port-in-maharashtra-at-a-cost-of-65000-crore/article30742590.ece

54,2020/02/05,India did not use capabilities in defence after Independence: Modi,"India became the world’s largest arms importer as it did not utilise its capacities to full potential after Independence, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated on Wednesday and asserted that India was looking to achieve defence exports worth Rs. 35,000 crore in the next five years.

“Post Independence, we did not use our defence opportunities and abilities to the full potential. Our policies and strategies remained focused on import. India thus became the largest arms importer in the world,” Mr. Modi said at the inaugural of the 11th Defexpo. After 2014, the government had undertaken several policy reforms, he pointed out.

Mr. Modi talked about India turning into a manufacturing hub for military platforms and noted that defence manufacturing had found new energy. “In the last two years, defence exports worth Rs. 17,000 crore has been achieved; it is up from Rs. 2000 crore in 2014,” he said.

A long-term integrated defence plan was being conceptualised with emphasis on start-ups and Micro, Medium and Small Enterprises (MSMEs). Two hundred defence start-ups were likely to come up to give a push to indigenisation. “Defence manufacturing will not only make us self-reliant but also ensure we are prepared to help friendly countries in the region if required,” he said.

Mr. Modi declared that India’s ambitions in the defence sector were not directed against anyone. “India has been a trustworthy partner of peace.”

Security challenges were changing with technology and security agencies were also more dependent on technology to counter these, he pointed out.

The Prime Minister highlighted the various joint ventures being set up to build defence hardware in the country. The government had simplified investment guidelines that had the potential to attract Rs. 17,000 crore Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the defence sector in the next five years. “Till 2014, only 217 defence licences were issued. In the last five years, this number has grown to 460. We're now building several defence pieces of equipment like artillery guns, aircraft carriers, submarines, light-combat aircraft and combat helicopters,” he stated.

Mr. Modi also spoke about the importance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). He said his government had created a road map to increase its usage in the defence sector and a lot of prototypes were being launched today. “In the next five years, we want to develop at least 25 products associated with AI in the defence sector,” he added.

This edition of the biennial Defexpo has the participation of over 1000 companies, including 172 foreign manufacturers. Defence ministers of 38 countries were also present.

The theme of the Defexpo, being hosted by Lucknow for the first time, is “India: The Emerging Defence Manufacturing Hub”, with the focus on “digital transformation of defence”, on which Mr. Modi said, “Wrong use of technology, terrorism and cyber threats are the big hurdles for the entire world.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hbgtdx/article30741842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05NARENDRA-MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/our-target-is-5-billion-of-defence-export-in-next-five-years-modi/article30741843.ece

56,2020/02/05,Sabarimala case review | SC to hear arguments on issue of reference to larger Bench on Feb. 6,"A nine-judge Bench led by Chief Justice of India (CJI) S.A. Bobde will on Thursday hear detailed arguments on whether the Supreme Court can refer questions of law to a larger Bench while hearing a plea to review its earlier judgment.

This development follows renowned jurist and senior advocate Fali Nariman’s objection on Monday to the manner in which the court turned a review of the Sabarimala case into an opportunity to examine “larger issues” concerning the essential religious practices of various faiths, including Islam and Zoroastrianism.

And Chief Justice Bobde acknowledged that day that Mr. Nariman had a “formidable point there”. But senior advocate K. Parasaran countered Mr. Nariman, saying the Sabarimala case had its genesis in public interest petitions. The case was not an in personam (affecting a specific person) litigation. In a case emanating from a PIL, there was no restraint on a constitutional court in extending the scope or questions to be examined, he argued.

The review of the case by a five-judge Bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi took a curious turn on November 14 last. It sidestepped the task of reviewing the September 2018 judgment, which declared the prohibition of the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala temple as discriminatory. Instead, the Bench referred seven questions, including whether essential religious practices should be afforded constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs), to a larger Bench. Further, the review Bench tagged other pending cases on the prohibition of Muslim women from entering mosques, female genital mutilation among the Dawoodi Bohras and the ban on Parsi women who married inter-faith from entering the fire temple to the reference.

Chief Justice Bobde, when he succeeded Justice Gogoi, promptly set up the nine-judge Bench to decide this reference.

On Monday, Mr. Nariman contended that the Gogoi Bench had no business to either drag other cases into the reference nor frame such “larger issues” when its sole mandate was to simply review the Sabarimala verdict. He said he could cite at least six judgments of the Court holding that a Bench sitting in review cannot frame new issues and refer them to larger Bench.

There were 6,83,823 vacant posts as on March 1, 2018, it said.

“Vacancies in the central government are caused due to retirement, resignation, death, promotion etc. and the posts falling vacant are required to be filled as per recruitment rules by the concerned Ministries/Departments/organisations,” the Minister said.

He said, filling up of vacant posts is a continuous process depending on the vacancies arising across Ministries/Departments during the year and action calendar of the recruiting agencies.

60,2020/02/05,"Implement it, observes SC after govt says women should go far ahead of men","Women should not just strive to equal men but go far ahead of them, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

This comes just a day after a written note of the government, represented by Mr. Mehta, in the Supreme Court, cast doubts about women officers matching up to men in physical prowess and their ability to take command posts in the Army.

“Why do women strive to be equal to men when they are and can be far ahead of them?” Mr. Mehta told a Bench of Justices D.Y. Chandrachud and Ajay Rastogi during an urgent mentioning.

“We would like to see the government implement that,” Justice Chandrachud responded.

The Bench said a will and a change of mindset on the part of the government would definitely see women officers rise to command posts in the Army. There were many services in addition to combat posts.

The note containing the government’s views on permanent commission for women officers in the Army has raised eyebrows.

It said the “physiological limitations” of women officers, lower physical standards of women officers compared to men, prolonged absence due to pregnancy, children’s education, husband’s career prospects, etc, were great challenges for women officers to meet the exigencies of service.

‘A way of life’

“Profession of arms is not just a profession but a way of life beyond the call of duty,” the note said. Family separation, career prospects of spouses, education of children, prolonged absence due to pregnancy, motherhood were a greater challenge for women to meet the exigencies of service.

Besides, the note stated, the “composition of rank and file being male predominantly drawn from the rural background with prevailing societal norms, troops are not yet mentally schooled to accept women officers in command of units”. It explained that “a soldier relies heavily on his physical prowess to engage in combat”.

It said, “Officers have to lead from the front. They should be in prime physical condition to undertake combat tasks. Inherent physiological differences between men and women preclude equal physical performance resulting in lower physical standards. Physical capacity of women officers in the Indian Army remain a challenge for command of units.”

‘Peculiar dynamics’

Army units were a “unique all-male environment”. Presence of women officers would require “moderated behaviour”. Thus, the posting of women officers in all-male units had its own “peculiar dynamics”, it noted.

It highlighted the environmental and physiological realities of Army posting; the difficult terrains, isolated posts and adverse climate conditions coupled with the internal security situations in the North East and Jammu and Kashmir. “These conditions have a major bearing on the employment of women officers in light of their physiological conditions accentuated by the challenges of confinement, motherhood and childcare,” it said.

KKR issued the clarification after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached Rose Valley’s assets worth over ₹70 crore on Monday. The attached assets include ₹11.87 crore bank deposits of Knight Riders Sports Pvt Ltd, that owns KKR, in connection with a money laundering probe.

The franchise said it hopes for the matter to be resolved expeditiously.

“Rose Valley Hotels was one of KKR’s IPL jersey sponsors for IPL seasons 2012 and 2013. Rose Valley had paid KKR an approx. amount of Rs 11.87 crore as sponsorship fees,” KKR CEO Venky Mysore said in a statement.

“KKR had no other dealings with the Rose Valley Group including Rose Valley’s micro finance business,” he added.

The statement added that in July last year, KRSPL (Knight Riders Sports Pvt Ltd), received a “witness summon” from the ED in connection with an investigation relating to the Rose Valley Group, particularly its micro finance business.

“The ED continues the investigation of Rose Valley. KKR continues to cooperate with the authorities in all respects,” Mr. Mysore said.

“As part of the investigative process, sometime in October 2019, the ED placed a lien on the said amount earlier paid by Rose Valley to KKR,” he asserted.

The directors of KRSPL include Shah Rukh Khan’s wife Gauri Khan, actor Juhi Chawla’s husband Jay Mehta, Mr. Mysore and two others.

Mr. Mysore was questioned in this case by ED’s Kolkata office in October last year.

Apart from KRSPL, the ED attached properties of two other entities -- Multiple Resorts Pvt. Ltd. and Kolkata’s St Xavier’s College on Monday.

The ED registered an FIR against the Rose Valley group, its chairman Gautam Kundu and others under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2014.

Kundu was arrested by the agency in Kolkata in 2015 and is in judicial custody at present.

The ED has filed multiple charge sheets in Kolkata and Bhubaneswar courts in this connection and total attachments are now worth ₹4,750 crore.

People professing every sect and every religion, be they Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christians, Jains and Parsi, they are all part of the larger Indian family. That's why my government has followed the principle of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwaas,” he observed.

“Join me in support of the construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya on this historic occasion and let us all speak in one voice,” he addressed the members, especially the Opposition benches by repeating the words, ‘aayeeye, aayeeye’ (come, come).

Responding to Mr. Modi’s call, several ruling MPs chanted ‘Jai Shri Ram’ amid thumped the desks.

Only 7 in 100 anganwadi beneficiaries are in cities

For every 100 anganwadi beneficiaries in the country, only seven are in urban areas, according to the government’s response to a Right to Information (RTI) query from The Hindu.

65,2020/02/05,Nagaland BJP defends Deputy CM,"The Nagaland unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has defended Deputy Chief Minister Y. Patton, claiming he has always stood for “fairness and meritocracy” in the Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC) examination process.

The State BJP also said Mr. Patton had since 2017 opposed the appointment of people without a civil service background as members of the NPSC, besides fighting against random marking in the interviews.

Mr. Patton had attracted criticism after he allegedly claimed at a function on January 28 that he could help NPSC aspirants cross the interview hurdle after they clear the written exams. He later said his speech was twisted.

The BJP credited Mr. Patton for reducing the NPSC viva marks from 75 to 55. The party said the Deputy Chief Minister had in his speech only challenged the Lotha Naga — the community he belongs to — students to clear the NPSC and the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) and announced cash award for the meritorious students.

“The statement attributed to Mr. Patton is without basis and only a futile attempt to malign the good office of the BJP and its leadership,” a State BJP spokesperson said, warning of stern action against those involved in the “smear campaign”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/6s4fxr/article30717549.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th01-karmakar-NGK972E7H44jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nagaland-bjp-defends-deputy-cm/article30737873.ece
66,2020/02/05,Bhutan ends free entry for Indian tourists,"Ending decades of free entry to Indian tourists visiting Bhutan, the government in Thimphu has decided to levy a daily ₹1,200 ($17) fee for “regional tourists” from India, the Maldives and Bangladesh, beginning July 2020. The fee, called a Sustainable Development Fee (SDF), is meant to help the government deal with burgeoning numbers in tourist traffic, which it is seeking to regulate through a new tourism policy.

The decision was passed by the National Assembly on Tuesday as a ‘Tourism Levy and Exemption Bill of Bhutan’, 2020. The SDF is considerably lower than the $65 charged to other foreign tourists, who are also charged a compulsory flat “cover charge” of $250 per day.

Indians mainly travel to the more developed western region of Bhutan. In a move to promote tourism in Bhutan’s eastern region as well, the government has decided to drop SDF charges for tourists visiting 11 of 20 total districts that fall in the east from Trongsa to Trashigang. Children from India, Maldives and Bangladesh under the age of 5 will not have to pay the levy and those between 6 and 12 years will be required to pay only ₹600.

Bhutan’s Tourism Council Director Dorji Dhradul said the idea of the SDF was to provide better facilities for regional tourists.

“The levy of SDF to regional tourists will help in ensuring an exclusive experience to all tourists which is the intent of our tourism policy of high value, low volume,” Mr. Dhradul told The Hindu.

(Since this video was produced before the new policy was announced, it mentions Bhutan as one of the countries to which Indians can travel without a visa.)

Tour operators unhappy

However, regional tour operators, especially from West Bengal have expressed concerns that the SDF will have dampening effect on numbers, and impact the heavy rush during the October “Puja season”.

When asked, the MEA said the fee was “nominal” and had been discussed with the Bhutanese government in the last few months. Bhutan’s Foreign Minister Tandi Dorji is understood to have discussed the proposal “in general, without specifics” with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar during his visit to Delhi in November 2019.

“Bhutanese authorities have assured that tourists from India would not be inconvenienced in the course of the implementation of the new regulation,” official sources said.

A senior official said, however, that the government has asked the Bhutanese government to make an effort to publicise the new rules in India before they come into effect in July 2020, as is anticipated. “If there is confusion about the provisions, it will cause problems to both sides.”

New Delhi’s hesitation also comes as the new SDF, while a seemingly small amount compared to the fees charged to other nationalities, could be seen as a way of making Indian tourists feel unwelcome. In the past year, Bhutanese newspapers have often complained about Indian tourists who don’t pay heed to local customs and picnickers who litter the country’s pristine environment.

In 2018, of the 2,74,000 tourists visiting Bhutan, the council estimated that about 2,00,000 were from the region, of which about 1,80,000 were from India. In contrast to other international tourists, who pay $250 (Approx. ₹18,000) as a minimum charge per day per person, which includes a $65 a day “Sustainable Development Fee”, as well as a $40 visa charge, tourists from India, Bangladesh and the Maldives had so far paid no fees, and were able to cross over without visas, something that is now set to change.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/hiw7ri/article30738383.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/India-Bhutan-borderjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bhutan-ends-free-entry-for-indian-tourists/article30737792.ece
67,2020/02/05,NDFB factional leaders may contest in Assam election,"Leaders of the factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) may contest in the coming elections in Assam, along with the other signatories to the Bodo Peace Accord.

The signatories are expected to hold a convention in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on February 7 for celebrating the signing of the accord.

Some 2,850 members of the four NDFB factions are likely to lay down arms before Mr. Modi. This would follow the ceremonial surrender of 1,615 members of these factions on January 30.

“People want us to take the responsibility of the BTC administration and ensure that the clauses of the accord are implemented. We are thus thinking in terms of joining politics,” said Promod Boro, president of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), one of the signatories to the accord.

Mr. Boro, however, did not spell out whether the NDFB, the ABSU and other organisations would form a party to take on the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), which has been ruling the BTC since 2003 and is an ally of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The elections to the BTC are expected by April.

Most of the BPF leaders were members of the disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers that rivalled the NDFB for space during its extremist phase.

If the ABSU takes the lead in forming a party, it will steal a march over the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) that has been toying with the idea of a “political alternative” to the BJP, its regional ally Asom Gana Parishad and the Congress. The AASU and its affiliates have held these parties responsible for letting the “anti-Assam” Citizenship (Amendment) Act happen. On January 23, the opposition to the Act saw the birth of a party, Asom Gana Mancha, which hopes to cash in on the “sentiments” against the Act.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ndfb-factional-leaders-may-contest-in-assam-election/article30737839.ece
68,2020/02/05,Only 7 in 100 anganwadi beneficiaries are in cities,"For every 100 anganwadi beneficiaries in the country, only seven are in urban areas, according to the government’s response to a Right to Information (RTI) query from The Hindu. This is primarily because of a severe lack of anganwadis in cities, leading to poor coverage of the government’s flagship programme in early childhood development.

Six services

Anganwadis or day-care centres are set up under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) by the Women and Child Development Ministry to provide a package of six services. The services include supplementary nutrition; pre-school non-formal education; immunisation, nutrition and health education; as well as referral services. The aim of the scheme is to reduce infant mortality and child malnutrition. Beneficiaries include children in the age group of six months to six years, and pregnant women and lactating mothers.

While there were a total 7.95 crore beneficiaries of the anganwadi scheme in the country as on September 30, 2019, only 55 lakh were registered at urban anganwadis, according to the government’s reply on January 28 to the RTI plea.

Acute paucity

This is primarily because of an acute paucity of anganwadi centres in urban areas. There are as many as 13.79 lakh anganwadis operational across the country, out of which 9.31 lakh centres are linked to the government’s web-enabled data entry system called Rapid Reporting System. Of those anganwadis that can be monitored online, 1.09 lakh centres are in urban areas and the remaining 8.22 lakh were in rural areas of the country, according to the RTI reply.

As per Census 2011, 32% of India’s 1.2 billion population live in cities, though experts have said that if the definition of an urban settlement was broadened, the share of urban population will be much higher.

A recent first-of-its kind pan-India study on nutrition status, the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-18, found that 35% of children under five were stunted and 17% were wasted. It also said 22% of children in the age group of 5-9 years were stunted and 23% were thin for their age. Also, 20% of those in the 10-19 years age group were thin for their age.

Urban obesity

At the same time, 2% of under four-year-olds, 8% of children in the 5-9 years age group, and 6% of adolescents, were overweight. Data also showed that children in urban areas showed two to three times higher prevalence of obesity as compared to their peers in rural areas.

69,2020/02/05,PIL filed to stop screening of movie ‘Shikara’,"A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was filed before the J&K High Court on Tuesday to stop the screening of Bollywood movie ‘Shikara’ for “wrong portrayal of Kashmiri Muslims and the mass migration of Kashmiri Pandits in 1990”.

According to the petitioners including journalist Majid Hyderi, former NC leader Iftikhar Misgar and advocate Irfan Hafiz Lone, the trailers of the movie showed “the painful migration of Kashmiri Pandits while portraying the local population, especially Muslims, in contrast to actual facts and events”.

The movie is scheduled to be released on February 7.

“It has tendency of hurting the sentiments of all Kashmiris. The movie has communal content, with no distinction drawn between civilians and militants. When the government records also suggest that there was no role of Muslim population especially Muslims in the mass migration from the Valley. In fact, local Muslims were deadly against the incidents leading to the mass migration,” reads the petition.

The petition, if admitted by the court, will be first such case since 1990 where all events and incidents are likely to be documented up to January 19, 1990, the day the minority community left the Valley.

The petitioners allege that there was “a motive behind the false narration of facts in the movie and the timing of its release”.

“Those who are ignorant of the events and have never visited Kashmir valley, after watching the trailers, have started blaming the Muslim population, invoking a war cry. Many Kashmiri students studying across the country are likely to be victimised,” it pleads.

The petition underlined that all the efforts of the security agencies to maintain calm in Kashmir will go in vain if the movie is allowed to be released “with the concocted and fabricated content”.

The petition has listed the Union Information and Broadcasting Ministry, the government of Jammu and Kashmir, the Central Board of Film Certification, the National Film Development Corporation and Director Vidhu Vinod Chopra, as defendants.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/pil-filed-to-stop-screening-of-movie-shikara/article30736220.ece

UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay will be felicitated on the occasion.

Ms. Azoulay’s visit to Jaipur assumes significance after the UNESCO declared the Walled City, famous for its grid plan-based architecture and buildings constructed with the pink facade, as a world heritage site in July last.

The International Council on Monuments and Sites had earlier inspected the city in 2018 after its nomination. It took into account the architecture of the streets with colonnades, which intersect the centre, creating large public squares called chaupars. The uniform facades of markets, residences and temples in the main streets had also impressed the Council.

Director (Tourism) Bhanwar Lal said here on Tuesday a brochure on “intangible heritage promotion project” would also be released at the function. The project, signed between the Tourism Department and UNESCO, aims at developing 10 new cultural tourism destinations in the State, for which the tourists could extend their stay by at least one extra day.

Dr. Lal said the project would be implemented during the next three years at ₹7.50 crore. It will directly benefit about 1,500 artistes in the districts such as Jodhpur, Barmer, Jaisalmer and Bikaner, known for folk music and traditional handicrafts.

The CBI sought life imprisonment for Thakur and the maximum punishment for the others. Lawyers for the convicts argued for a minimum sentence.

The court had earlier convicted Thakur of the charge of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and of gang-rape, rape and other related crimes under the Indian Penal Code and the Juvenile Justice Act. Vijay Kumar Tiwari, Guddu Patel, Ramanuj Thakur and Kishan Kumar were also found guilty of committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault, rape, gang-rape and other related crimes.

One accused, Vicky, was acquitted. Rosy Rani, a former Assistant Director of the Child Protection Unit, was also convicted. But she had already served out the maximum punishment of six months, hence she was granted bail.

Among the convicts are Dillip Kumar Verma, a Child Welfare Committee chairman in Muzaffarpur, Vikas Kumar, a former member of the committee, and Ravi Roshan, Child Protection Officer. Rama Shankar Singh and Ashwani were convicted of the charge of criminal conspiracy and abetting rape.

Thakur’s close aide Shaista Praveen, who was arrested by the CBI, Indu Kumari, Manju Devi, Minu Devi, Chanda Devi, Hema Masih, Neha Kumari and Kiran Kumari were also convicted of the charge of abetting rape and allied offences.

Union Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said Article 25 of the Constitution provides for the freedom to profess, practice and propagate religion subject to public order, morality and health. “Various courts, including the Kerala High Court, have upheld this view,” he said in a written reply.

“The term ‘Love Jihad’ is not defined under the extant laws. No such case of ‘Love Jihad’ has been reported by any of the Central agencies,” Mr. Reddy said to a question by Congress MP Benny Behanan on “whether Central agencies have reported any case of ‘Love Jihad’ from Kerala during the past two years and if so, the details thereof?”

Mr. Reddy, however, said two cases from Kerala involving inter-faith marriage had been probed by the National Investigation Agency.

Syro-Malabar Church firm on its stance on ‘love jihad’

The synod of the bishops of the Syro-Malabar Church says it has not approached the issue of ‘love jihad’ in a way that would affect the longstanding friendship with the Muslim community.

In a statement here on Tuesday, the Syro-Malabar Media Commission said the synod had only expressed its opinion that inter-religious love affairs caused family troubles and that such cases should be inquired into. And, the circumstances in which the bishops raised the demand continued to exist.

The statement comes in the wake of protests against the stance of the synod on ‘love jihad’ in the second week of January. The synod had then called for inquiries into instances of ‘love jihad’ in which Christian girls fell victims to inter-religious love affairs. In some cases, such girls also joined terrorist organisations such as the Islamic State, the bishops had said.

However, Tuesday’s statement from the Church said the Union Home Ministry had made clarifications on the issue in the Lok Sabha. It had said that there were no instances of ‘love jihad’ or ‘love affairs with malicious intentions’ reported in Kerala. There was no mention of ‘love jihad’ in the existing set of laws, the government said.

The Church statement, however, said the synod’s opinion on the issue was based on information received from its various dioceses. The synod had expressed its anxiety on the issue based on the information it had received. -- Our Kochi Correspondent",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kprom4/article30736763.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KishanReddy-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/love-jihad-not-defined-under-law-says-centre/article30736760.ece

“The report says that some States have sought grant of SCS, but it does not constitute part of the mandate of the 15th Finance Commission, as it remains entirely in the domain of the Union government, which can take an appropriate decision after due consideration,” the Chief Minister said.

“The people of the State of Andhra Pradesh remain hapless victims of this unfortunate scenario. I humbly seek your intervention in this manner,” he said.

Further, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy stated that the Central government had promised SCS to Andhra Pradesh at the time of bifurcation in 2014, but did not fulfil it citing the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. Post bifurcation, the benefits of higher revenues accrued to Telangana, depriving the same to the successor State of Andhra Pradesh, he said.

Referring to the Union Budget, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, “In these difficult times, when the economy is sluggish and the sentiment weak, the budget has been most reassuring and has provided necessary enthusiasm.”

“There is, however, a sense of dissatisfaction in the people of Andhra Pradesh, owing to the fact that there is no mention in the budget on the steps intended to be taken by the Central government to support the State,” he added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/jagan-takes-up-scs-issue-with-modi/article30745466.ece
78,2020/02/05,Health team to review nCoV preparedness at Vizag airport,"Teams of doctors from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are expected to inspect 14 international airports in the country, including the one in the city, in the next few days to review the preventive measures being taken to tackle cases, if any, of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) that is causing alarm worldwide.

According to reliable sources, the teams, comprising three doctors each, will inspect the screening camps, the testing facilities at airports, and the designated hospitals at each location.

The teams will later submit their reports to the Director General of Health Services (DGHS). They will also brief the Health Secretary of the respective State governments about the measures to be taken up.

The other 13 airports to be visited by the Central teams are Amritsar, Guwahati, Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Trichy, Coimbatore, Bhubaneswar, Lucknow, Varanasi, Thiruvananthapuram, Goa, Bagdogra, and Gaya.

Lab in Hyderabad

Meanwhile, the Virology Lab at Gandhi Medical College in Hyderabad was on Wednesday given the approval to test the samples of suspected nCoV patients coming from the Wuhan province and other parts of China.

“Earlier, the samples were sent to the Virology Lab in Pune. But now, the lab in Hyderabad has been designated to test the samples of suspected patients from Andhra Pradesh,” K. Rambabu, Professor of Medicine, Andhra Medical College (AMC), and State Nodal Officer, told The Hindu.

Dr. Rambabu said this would reduce the delay in sending the samples to Pune and enable quick delivery of reports.

“We have not home quarantined any person so far in Visakhapatnam. In Tirupati, one family that arrived from China has been kept in isolation. A student from China, who came to Kakinada, has complained of sore throat but has no other symptoms such as fever and cough. He has been kept in an isolation ward there,” Dr. Rambabu said.

Symptomatic treatment

“There is no specific drug, or specific treatment for nCoV till date. Only symptomatic treatment is being given to the patients. However, research is on and a drug may be found soon,” Dr. Rambabu said, and appealed to the people not to believe in rumours that there was a drug to cure the virus.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/health-team-to-review-ncov-preparedness-at-vizag-airport/article30745451.ece

During this week, the authorities are promoting ‘plogging’, the emerging concept of picking up litter while jogging, which was popularised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Mamallapuram beach during his meeting with Chinese premier Xi Jinping.

NARL Director Amit Kumar Patra laid emphasis on plogging and has advised his employees to clean up the premises on-the-go. The huge balloon carrying the message on cleanliness written in three languages is a huge hit among the passers-by on the adjoining Tirupati-Bengaluru highway.

Driving home the message on ‘Swachh Bharat’ mission, Mr. Patra appealed to the employees and their family members to segregate waste as dry waste, wet waste and sanitary waste.

“God has saved us. We never thought that there would be a blast in the pipeline,” Mr. Mark, who has vast experience in the field of oil and gas exploration, told The Hindu on Wednesday.

Besides Mr. Mark, PFH project manager C.V. Ramakrishna and three others survived the blast at Uppudi, a village of Katrenikona mandal in East Godavari district.

“It was our luck that there was not fire from the well from which gas leaked. As there was no major equipment, or electric motor, in the vicinity, there was no ignition. Had there been flames, we would have been burnt alive,” Mr. Mark said.

“We took lease of the well a year ago and started operations there three months ago after obtaining permission from the A.P. Pollution Control Board (APPCB) and the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF),” he said.

Mr. Mark said that the PFH had taken two wells on lease in the KG Basin – one at Uppudi and another at Achanta in West Godavari district. Besides, it had one project in Gujarat.

“We have entered into an agreement with Schlumberger for supplying necessary equipment for taking up the operations in A.P.,” he said.

“For three days, we tried to open the valve of the closed well at Uppudi. At around 3 p.m. on Sunday, we opened the cap of the pipeline, and then there was a sudden gush of gas. When we tried to control it, there was a blast. Two personnel of the PFH and three technicians of Schlumberger were at the spot,” Mr. Mark recalled.

“The PFH is ready to pay compensation to the farmers and villagers for the loss caused. The company will follow the directions of the public representatives, officials and the State government,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lucky-to-survive-minor-blast-at-uppudi-says-phf-official/article30745401.ece
81,2020/02/05,"Reverse tenders helped save ₹2,000 crore: Jagan","Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy said on Wednesday that his government could save ₹2,000 crore in various projects, including the Polavaram multi-purpose dam, in the last seven months, and exuded confidence that it was going to emerge as a model for other States.

Responding to a question by The Hindu Group (THG) Chairman N. Ram at the conclave on ‘Excellence in Education’ here, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said, “A sum of ₹830 crore was saved in the Polavaram project and ₹400 crore in the AP-TIDCO housing scheme for the weaker sections as the government cancelled the previous tenders and called for reverse tenders.”

Accountability

In a significant step towards enhancing transparency and accountability, the government brought the A.P. Infrastructure (Transparency through Judicial Preview) Act, the Chief Minister said.

“Under this system, all tenders costing more than ₹100 crore are sent to a judge, who puts them in public domain for seven days. During that period, anyone, even the critics, are free to suggest changes in the contractual terms, which were hitherto tailor-made to suit a few companies,” he said.

Fresh tenders were then invited by displaying the amount quoted by the original lowest bidder without mentioning the company’s name. Devoid of any scope for bribes, it helped in lowering the costs. Even the companies that participated in the initial bidding could again throw their hat into the ring, the Chief Minister said.

Earlier, Mr. Ram sought to know what was Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s experience with reverse tenders, which the latter claimed to have yielded up to 20% savings in projects. He appreciated the fact that the government saved public money through reverse tenders.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hleqw/article30745386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06VJPG4-THEHINDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/reverse-tenders-helped-save-2000-crore-jagan/article30745387.ece
82,2020/02/05,YSRCP failed to fulfil promises made to BCs: former TDP MP,"YSR Congress Party government has forgotten all the promises its founder and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy made to the Backward Classes(BC) during his padayatra, alleged former Hindupur two-time MP and TDP leader Nimmala Kristappa. Threatening to launch a massive agitation, he advised the YSRCP leaders to behave in a more sane manner before they begin to face public backlash.

At a press conference at the party district office here on Wednesday, Mr. Kristappa took strong objection to the Chief Minister not restricting the party cadre during attacks on the BCs for the past seven months and pointed out that more than 650 cases of attack on TDP cadre were reported from all over Andhra Pradesh, but nowhere did the YSRCP chief took interest and come to their rescue, he pointed out.

He gave the example of an ENT specialist Sekhar Babu of Gurazala, who was forcibly evicted from his clinic premises and was confined in a room overnight to put pressure on him to vacate the place, but no action was taken by the government, he alleged.

He also said that closer to Anantapur, at Somandepalli, a youth named Ashok from the Backward Classes was attacked, but none bothered to take action against the culprits.

On the Amaravati issue, he said the government can score good points if it continued the development started by the TDP and increase the pace to bring real benefit to the people so that they vote the YSRCP back to power in the next elections instead of shifting the capital and dealing blow to the farming community there, who donated their lands to the State government in good faith.

Addressing the media in New Delhi on Wednesday, Mr. Rao, however, said that the BJP had already announced its political resolution that it was against relocation of the capital in Andhra Pradesh.

Mr. Rao said that the party also wanted the continuation of Amaravati as the capital as already 53,000 acres of land had been pooled.

“We haven’t said that there is no misuse of land, or no unlawful real estate trade took place in the capital region. In fact, we have said the same in the party election manifesto. Yet, as a party, we do not support relocation of the capital,” he said.

“The Centre has already clarified that it is for the State to decide on the capital, and it would not interfere in the process. At least now, the Opposition and ruling parties should stop this drama over the capital and come to a conclusion acceptable to all, without causing any loss to the farmers of Amaravati,” Mr. Rao said.

Stating that nowhere in the country one could witness political dramas similar to that in Andhra Pradesh, Mr. Rao said that former Chief Minister N.

84,2020/02/05,Development programmes on top of govt. agenda: Peddireddi,"Panchayat Raj Minister Peddireddi Ramachandra Reddy on Wednesday said development and welfare programmes were on top of the government agenda.

Speaking after laying foundation stones for works worth ₹2.82 crore in the Vijayawada Central constituency limits, the Krishna district in-charge Minister said funds to the tune of ₹320 crore had already been allocated for taking up various development works in Vijayawada.

The projects for which he laid the foundation stones include cement roads, drains and a ‘kharmala’ bhavan in various divisions and an emergency treatment centre for children in the old Government General Hospital.

The Minister said with a focus on improving basic amenities in cities, towns and villages, the government had been allocating funds for laying cement roads and construction of drains wherever necessary.

‘Positive result of new sand policy’

Referring to the new sand policy, he said it was being supplied at the doorstep and the positive result of it had already started showing. Programmes like Amma Vodi, Jagananna Goru Mudda and Naadu-Nedu were aimed at improving the living standards of the down-trodden sections.

85,2020/02/05,The tech way to excellence,"Experts in education technology highlighted the role of technology in making education and learning accessible to the children who are deprived of regular means of education due to various reasons while speaking at the Excellence in Education conclave organised by The Hindu in the city on Wednesday.

Moderated by STEP (Standardised Test of English Proficiency) business head Pundi Sriram, the panel discussion on ‘Use of technology in supporting English skills development’ saw presentation of successful tech-based initiatives by Sujatha Sahu, founder-director of 17000 ft Foundation, Chandra Viswanathan, founder-director of English Learning Foundation and Nitin Kashyap, product manager (Bolo) at Google India.

Stating that just a book would not be enough for children who are new to English to learn it, Ms. Chandra Viswanathan said it was possible with technology to teach in an engaging way and without any intimidation.

“It is important to remove the fear, seriousness and the necessity to be correct always. If we keep correcting them, they choose to stay silent. Mistakes should be allowed to build confidence before skills are imparted. Secondly, different formats are needed to approach children when teaching English. In case of children who were never exposed to the language, the role of technology comes in where listening to English content like movies, comics could be useful,” she said.

An impresssive case

Ms. Sujata Sahu presented the impressive case of how her organisation’s initiative of DigiLabs transformed education in Ladakh where English is the only medium of instruction and availability of electricity is a rarity.

She said solar-powered DigiLabs with content and devices for children to learn subjects in innovative and easy methods has improved enrollment in government schools and at the same time the enrolment in private schools came down.

Google initiative

Speaking about Google India’s new yet successful initiative Google Bolo app Mr. Nitin said that the application was able to help lakhs of children who could not read or write, learn them using just mobile phones.

86,2020/02/05,Successful implementation a challenging task: Minister,"Minister for Human Resources Development A. Suresh has said that having no dearth of talent, Andhra Pradesh has the best of minds as teachers in government schools. Mr. Suresh has, however, said that in the endeavour of transforming school education with the introduction of English medium and new student-centric curriculum, training teachers has been a major challenge.

Mr. Suresh took part in a panel discussion on ‘Capacity building required in AP schools to support the transition of English medium’ along with Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) founder-director Anjali Jain and Naandi Foundation chief policy officer Rohini Mukherjee at the ‘Excellence in Education’ conclave organised by The Hindu. The session was moderated by Vijaya Padma Srinivas, head of training and content development at STEP, a product of The Hindu Group. Representatives of various educational institutions in large numbers participated in the conclave. “The task of converting all the schools into English medium schools could be done with just an order, but successful implementation is a great challenge. The biggest challenge is training the teachers as it is not just a matter of proficiency in English but also the development of content.

“We have over 20 lakh students in primary schools and from the coming academic year, medium of instruction will be English. For this, we need over 98,000 teachers to instruct in English and it requires a lot of training for them. AP has no dearth of talent, teachers are recruited through a tough process of DSC examination and are the best of the minds. The only thing they lack is the confidence to teach in English while they are strong in content and the same situation could be seen in higher education in AP and other States too,” he said.

Bridge courses

Briefly explaining why the government did not make English medium as an option in government primary schools, Mr. Suresh said, “Children below the age of 10 can learn five to six languages and the ability comes down as age progresses. Yet, one’s comfort in learning and teaching is also important. To make it possible we have started bridge courses for students using technology and robust training modules for teachers. It is not that we are making all the 45,000 schools as English medium schools overnight, there are many government schools instructing in English and Telugu. When an option is given to the children and teachers, due to lack of confidence, they might not choose English medium,” Mr. Suresh said.

Ms. Anjali said that lack of motivation for teachers and focus on individuals has been two common challenges in building teacher capabilities.

Ms. Anjali explained CENTA’s standard teacher competency framework and how it helped in motivating and improving skills of teachers. Ms. Rohini said that foundation believes in the importance of English medium education.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gzsyul/article30745284.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06ONGRMINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/successful-implementation-a-challenging-task-minister/article30745285.ece
87,2020/02/05,"A radical step, says N. Ram","In his initial remarks at the The Hindu Group’s education conclave, Chairman N. Ram called the decision to introduce English medium in government schools a radical step which seemed to be demand-driven.

Mr. Ram said: “It is in tune with the thrust laid on the English language in the Southern States, notably in Kerala where more than half of the 37 lakh children in schools are studying in that medium. What Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy proposed is, therefore, the universalisation of English medium education, which no other State has perhaps ventured to do.”

Mr. Ram stated that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy took the firm decision to introduce English medium compulsory in government schools by drawing from the experiences during his Praja Sankalpa Yatra when he came across government and government-aided schools that lacked basic facilities and parents who landed in debt trap due to their children’s education. This made Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy to go for a complete makeover of the education system.

STEP programme

On the topic of the conclave ‘Excellence in Education’, Mr. Ram said The Hindu has obvious interest in it having been contributing to the learning and improvement of the English language through its 141-year history. The Standardised Test of English Proficiency (STEP) programme launched by The Hindu in August 2016 has been facilitating an increase in the English language skills in South India.

Setting the agenda for the event, Mr. Ram said the challenge for governments was to strike a balance between the pursuit of quality and excellence and the imperative need to make quality education available at all levels in a progressive way.

“The tension between these two goals defines the nature of all serious intellectual and cultural endeavours in society which is striving to excel while being non-elitist, just and truly democratic in a contemporary sense,” Mr. Ram stated, calling for a pragmatic approach to the reconciliation of those goals and eventually putting things into practice.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/3fjj8h/article30745266.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06ONGHINDU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/a-radical-step-says-n-ram/article30745267.ece
88,2020/02/05,English key to getting a decent job: CM,"Introduction of English medium from Class 1 to 6 in government schools is aimed at enabling the children to earn decent jobs. Quality education is the only way to alleviate poverty and raise the living standards of the poor, according to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy.

Providing English medium education at zero cost was a step in that direction, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said while delivering the keynote address at an education conclave with the theme ‘Excellence in Education’ organised by The Hindu Group and moderated by its Chairman N. Ram here on Wednesday. “Telugu has been made a compulsory subject in both government and private schools to ensure that it is not neglected,” he pointed out. In the era of computers and the Internet, English could not be ignored, he added.

The fact that 98.50% of the private schools were imparting education in English proved the importance of the language. The government schools could ill afford to buck that trend if they were to stay in the reckoning and the future generations should be equipped with the skills required to be competitive, observed the Chief Minister.

“The government has not only laid thrust on English language communication skills but also initiated steps to improve the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of the children aged between 18 and 23.” India’s GER was 23% compared to about 50% in Brazil and China and an impressive 81% in Russia. It meant that 77% of the children were not enrolled in colleges beyond Intermediate. The illiteracy rate in Andhra Pradesh as per the 2011 Census stood at 33% against the national average of 27%. Priority was, therefore, attached to improving the GER and the literacy level, which were crucial to achieve the stated goals, he said.

“English is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Since English medium education is expensive, it has been decided to offer it in government schools to benefit the poor children who needed to possess the skills before they pass out of college.”

At the same time, the Chief Minister said, the government was aware of the teething problems which mainly include the gap of English language skills among the teachers. Hence, bridge courses were contemplated to be conducted to sort out the issue.

Major initiative

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said ‘Nadu-Nedu’ was another major initiative under which facilities were being improved in 15,715 schools in the first phase of the total 45,000 schools. Besides, the quality of midday meal was being enhanced and the menu diversified.

Financial assistance of ₹15,000 was being extended to mothers under the ‘Amma Vodi’ scheme to help them in getting their children educated. Seventy-five per cent attendance would be made compulsory from the next academic year for availing the benefit of the scheme, he said. To make higher education more qualitative, it has been decided to increase the duration of bachelor’s degree courses, including engineering, from four to five years. They would be henceforth ‘honours degrees’, the Chief Minister added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/m8f7hc/article30745258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06ONGSPEAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/english-key-to-getting-a-decent-job-cm/article30745259.ece
89,2020/02/05,‘Three capitals’ a cautious decision to ensure justice to all regions: A.P. CM Jagan Mohan Reddy,"Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has asserted that the decision to have separate seats of governance at Amaravati (Legislative), Visakhapatnam (Executive or Administrative) and Kurnool (Judicial) was a cautious one prompted by the benefits of decentralisation and the State’s shoe-string budget.

Sharing his views on the idea of ‘three capitals’ which kicked up a political storm and triggered protests by farmers in the existing capital region, at Excellence in Education an education conclave organised by The Hindu Group and moderated by its Chairman N. Ram here on Wednesday, Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said even if the government spent 10 per cent of ₹ 1.09 lakh crore on Visakhapatnam, it would become a growth engine capable of competing with Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad in about 10 years.

Investments were bound to come in and youth would find jobs within the State if Visakhapatnam was given a fillip.

Can’t spend on grandiose plans

Completing former CM N. Chandrababu Naidu’s dream capital which is neither in Vijayawada nor in Guntur and lacked even a two-lane road entailed an expenditure of ₹ 1.09 lakh crore on the basic infrastructure alone at the rate of a whopping ₹ 2 crore per acre as per the previous government’s reports.

“The present government is not in a position to spend huge sums on such grandiose plans. Plus, the Central government has so far given only ₹ 1,500 crore and it might at best come up with an additional funding of ₹ 1,000 crore,” the CM said.

No land bank in Amaravati

“Besides, there was no land bank in Amaravati. If the lands where construction activity is not permitted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) and the River Conservation Act were to be excluded, the State was left with just about 5,200 acres,” he added.

Taking these things into consideration, the government has decided to split the capital into three parts to do justice to all regions, the CM pointed out.

Capital cronies

While saying that, the CM said he would not speak much on the purchase of large chunks of land by cronies of Mr. Chandrababu Naidu in Amaravati before it was declared the capital of Andhra Pradesh.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy said the TDP Government had spent ₹ 5,677 crore at a high interest of 10.32 per cent due to its dependence on borrowings. It was, therefore, prudent to limit the expenditure.

In bifurcation impact context

Mr. Ram said he was asking about the concept of three capitals, the resource crunch faced by the State, its plans to revolutionise education etc. Because, they could not be talked about in isolation in the context of the impact of bifurcation.

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy clarified that the Legislative Capital would continue to be in Amaravati and it would witness growth in the natural course. “Amaravati is not being deprived of anything,” he stated while pointing out that it was to give Rayalaseema its due share in the process of development that the Judicial Capital was proposed to be set up in Kurnool which was the capital of Andhra State from 1953 to 1956.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/p641m2/article30742793.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05VJA-JAGAN-EXCELLENCE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-capitals-a-cautious-decision-cm-jagan/article30742601.ece

93,2020/02/05,Hot pursuit to save life of girl absconding from hospital,"A girl, suspected to be a minor, has kept a team of medical and revenue officials on their toes, after she went absconding from the ICU of Government Maternity Hospital at Tirupati on Monday.

Admitted there five days ago, the girl, married and six months pregnant, underwent “medical termination of pregnancy”, after she was reportedly diagnosed with a serious heart ailment “pericardial effusion” and severe anaemia. The medical team which attended to her was getting ready for blood transfusion on Monday, when she disappeared from the hospital.

After a day-long search, the girl was found hiding at home in tribal village, and was rushed back to Tirupati hospital on Tuesday. The teenager lives with her husband, parents and in-laws in a thatched hut. The family ekes out a living working in mango orchards.

Five days ago, the girl was brought to the primary health centre at Narayanavanam mandal headquarters, with symptoms of giddiness. After preliminary tests, she was found to be pregnant and suffering from severe anaemia. She was referred to the Community Health Centre at Puttur, from where she was later shifted to the Government Maternity Hospital at Tirupati. Advanced diagnosis revealed that she was suffering from severe cardiac ailment.

Three days ago, she underwent medical termination of pregnancy as the growth of the six-month foetus was stunted.

Resistance

The hospital doctors contacted Ravi Raju at Narayanavanam. A team of ASHA workers and paramedical staff went to the girl’s house, only to face stiff resistance from the family members. The girl’s parents reportedly hid her in a nearby field.

On Tuesday, Dr. Ravi Raju along with the Mandal Parishad Development Officer (Narayanavanam) Ganga Bhavani and paramedical staff rushed to the colony, once again to face resistance from the family members. The officials threatened the family members that if they did not budge; the police would be called in. The neighbours too supported the medical officer. Fearing police involvement, the parents agreed to send the girl back to hospital.

The Medical Officer, finding the parents penniless, offered them some financial assistance. An ambulance was summoned in a few minutes, thus bringing curtains on the issue.

Dr. Ravi Raju said: “It gives our team immense happiness to send the girl back to hospital. After blood transfusion, the girl needs to undergo complicated treatment for her heart ailment. Any delay will only endanger her life.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/hot-pursuit-to-save-life-of-girl-absconding-from-hospital/article30738346.ece

“Extending support to the government’s proposals for administrative reforms is the responsibility of all officers and employees in the State,” the association said at a press conference.

“The association is always with the government in spite of a malafide campaign launched by a few newly-formed organisations. We will support the establishment of an Executive capital in Visakhapatnam. It has already been approved by the association recently with a unanimous resolution. We hope the government would provide all facilities to employees who will be transferred to Visakhapatnam,” said Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy.

Mr. Purushottam Naidu said that the association enjoyed the backing of over 150 associations of different government organisations, and the collective support would be helpful to the government which was keen on decentralising administration and development.

Mr. Purushottam Naidu urged Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to scrap the Contributory Pension System and regularise outsourcing and contract employees in the State. Earlier, association leaders organised a massive rally in Srikakulam over the re-election of Mr. Purushottam Naidu as State associate president.

95,2020/02/05,SPMVV sets its sights on making students job-ready,"The Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswa Vidyalayam is striving to offer an all-round comfortable experience to its students.

SPMVV officials said that the administration is of the view that students can be successful in academics only when other aspects, such as accommodation, physical wellness, and recreation, are taken care of.

Duvvuru Jamuna, who recently took over as the university’s Vice-Chancellor, spoke to The Hindu on her plans for the all-women university. A retired professor of psychology at the neighbouring Sri Venkateswara University, Prof. Jamuna is keen on improving amenities available to students.

Wellness centre

Prof. Jamuna is envisagin a ‘Wellness Centre’ on the campus that will focus on students’ all-round health.

“As the students here hail predominantly from the rural and semi-urban backgrounds, their heterogeneous socio-economic profiles will be collected and a study conducted to identify their talents, core competence and inadequacies, if any. With this, we can plan the required intervention to help them excel,” Prof. Jamuna said. The newly-conceived wellness centre will offer counselling on stress management and help students tackle examination stress and anxiety, besides training them in yoga and meditation.

‘Need-based curriculum’

As SPMVV is known for offering self-financing courses, introduction of a need-based curriculum is the need of the hour, Prof. Jamuna said, adding that she is planning career-oriented courses to make the graduates ‘job-ready’.

“The absence of skill sets makes graduating students merely qualified, but not employable. We need to bridge this gap,” she said.

A five-month programme in Mid-Level Health Practitioners (MLHP) is one such course that is expected to be launched soon in association with IGNOU. The administration is also mulling to tweak people-oriented courses like women’s studies, social work and sociology, not just to make graduates employable, but also to make the course appealing to newcomers in the future.

Prof. Jamuna has 45 years of academic experience and has handled several national and international research projects.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/spmvv-sets-its-sights-on-making-students-job-ready/article30738252.ece
96,2020/02/05,VMC focusses on collecting property tax dues,"Vizianagaram Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been giving top priority to collection of property tax and recover dues to improve civic amenities and take up more developmental activities in the city, VMC in-charge and trainee Collector Ketan Garg said on Tuesday.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Garg said that around 60 ward volunteers had been directed to meet property tax defaulters and get them to clear their dues at the earliest.

“Property tax collection is the basic income source for the civic body. That is why we are focusing on collection of dues amounting to ₹48 crore with the directive of Special Officer of the Corporation and Collector M. Hari Jawaharlal. The actual collection so far in the current financial year was around ₹10 crore. With the support of bill collectors and revenue officials, the ward volunteers have been meeting property owners for quick payment of dues,” he said.

“Clearing dues is beneficial for property owners too as they can avoid penalty and interest. The same is being explained during the door-to-door campaign by the rapid action teams formed with volunteers,” he said.

Mr. Garg said that the beautification of the city at all its entrances is being given importance to enhance the image of the historic fort city. “Cleanliness and no-plastic campaign are also being taken up as a priority as this would give the city a new look. Non-governmental organisations are supporting us to create awareness among the public,” he said.

He said that commercial establishments were being asked to cooperate with the civic body in enhancing the image of the city. “Haphazard parking would give a bad look in spite of providing many amenities. That is why traffic regulation is being given equal priority. Many new traffic rules are being implemented to ensure smooth flow of traffic while also ensuring safety of the public at places like APSRTC junction,” said Mr.Garg.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/vmc-focusses-on-collecting-property-tax-dues/article30738230.ece

Both of them left behind the clothes and the blanket at their school’s Wall of Kindness — an initiative taken by the school management to develop a sense of giving among its students.

The Montessori Public School officials said that whatever items would be donated to the Wall of Kindness would be distributed to underprivileged students. “Students have been asked to bring anything that is no longer of use to them, as such items can prove to be useful for another person,” said school correspondent Prakash Babu. “Anyone can walk up to the wall inside the school and take whatever they need, such as water bottles, school bags, utensils, clothes,” he said.

Some students are bringing along home-cooked food for lunch every day in turns which the school is donating to underprivileged students studying elsewhere.

“We have also set up a ‘Wall of Honesty’ in the school wherein students can take stationery they need and leave behind the money for the items. Pens, pencils, notebooks and other stationery will be placed here. There will be no one to monitor the students here and they will pay for the items themselves without being asked,” school officials said.

Delivering his address at the ninth convocation of Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University (SVVU) here on Tuesday, Dr. Mohapatra spoke on ways to make agriculture remunerative by linking it with veterinary, fishery and horticulture departments and by turning every farmer into an entrepreneur.

“The required business skills have to be imparted to farmers. Agriculture has to be viewed in that perspective and this narrative has to be brought into farming and allied sectors,” Dr. Mohapatra said, adding that it requires market linkage, productivity enhancement, diversification into allied areas, food processing and value addition.

“The country has met with success in milk production by achieving an output of 176 million tonnes, with the sector growing at a rate of 6%. Per capita milk availability has also exceeded the level recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Similarly, poultry and fisheries sectors grew phenomenally to reach impressive figures, fetching over 7 billion USD through exports,” Dr. Mohapatra said.

Crediting cattle rearers for high production, he also appreciated the scientific fraternity for bringing modern vaccines at affordable rates and introducing induced breeding programmes and slashing the cost of animal feed, all of which contributed to enhanced productivity.

Governor and Chancellor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan called upon the graduates to play a pivotal role in tackling air, water and industrial pollution, and also urged them to reach out to animals desperately waiting for medical intervention in the countryside. He spoke on the evil effects of pesticides and the need to promote greener alternatives to save future generations. He later presented gold medals and awards to meritorious students.

She demanded the resignation of Mr. Baligar for failing to rise up to protect the autonomy of KSP. She was speaking at the session on “Kalyana Karnataka – Yesterday, today and tomorrow”.

Ms. Neela began her speech by condemning the Koppal police who registered a case against poet Siraj Bisralli for writing a poem against CAA/NRC, which she said has to be condemned by every responsible writer.

“A government that scuttles voices of dissent and prohibits freedom of expression needs to be condemned,” she said.

110,2020/02/05,Hindi cannot be the first among equal languages in India: Venkateshamurthy,"Categorically opposing Hindi as the link language for communication between States and linguistic communities, H.S. Venkateshamurthy, president of the 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, proposed developing Sanskrit or Prakrit for the purpose. It could be English for the time being until one of the two is developed into a link language, he argued.

Pointing to the disparities in language teaching across the country, Mr. Venkateshamurthy opposed the three-language formula for South India and two-language formula for North India.

“If we accept the three-language policy, it should be implemented uniformly throughout India. It should not be like three languages for South India and two languages for North India. The children in the north should learn an extra language of their interest along with English and Hindi,” he said.

Like Yiddish

“It’s not acceptable to say Hindi is the first among equal languages. If a language is required to unite India and make communication between States easy, it should be a language that is not of a particular province or it should be Sanskrit, which was the language of literature and taught once in India, or Prakrit, which was a language of communication among common people. They could be developed as a link language just as Jews developed Yiddish. For the time being, English can be used as a link language between people of different provinces in India. Such communicative English could be taught in a few months through training courses,” he said, in his presidential address delivered from the main stage of the literary event, Sri Vijaya Vedike, on Wednesday.

Mr. Venkateshamurthy also argued strongly for Kannada as a medium of instruction at the primary level in Karnataka. He said that arguments of people who forward the parents’ rights of choosing their child’s medium of instruction is flawed. “The profit-oriented educational institutions argue that making Kannada a medium of instruction would adversely affect children whose mother tongue is not Kannada. They say that it would snatch the parents’ right of choosing the medium of instruction for their children. It is a well-known fact that a child can learn better in its native language. Kannada is Karnataka’s native language and we want it as the medium of instruction,” he said.

Strike a balance

In an attempt to strike a balance between Kannada and the other mother tongues in the State such as Tamil, the poet suggested speaking mother tongues at home and Kannada outside.

“This approach could solve a lot of problems and friction. Most of our language issues would be solved if we expand the meaning of mother tongue to mean native language,” he said.

‘Govt. to ensure Kannada taught in all pvt. schools’

The State government will take steps to ensure that Kannada as a language is taught in all private schools, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced at the sammelana in Kalaburagi. This came in the wake of demands by some Kannada activists at making Kannada medium compulsory in all schools in the State. Sammelana president H.S. Venkateshamurthy also reiterated the CM’s demand.

“We are committed to putting in place a series of steps to see that Kannada is taught in all schools, aided and private, as a language. Kannada should be the first or second language in schools. We will also take steps to strengthen government schools,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.

111,2020/02/05,HC stays tribunal order of calling records from court,"The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday stayed the two orders passed by the Karnataka State Administrative Tribunal (KSAT), which had directed its registry to call for entire records from the Registrar-General of the High Court related to two writ petitions filed in 2012 on recruitment of Group A and B Gazetted Probationers of the 1998 batch.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar passed the order on a petition suo motu initiated by the court on the two directions issued in December 2019 and January 2020 by the KSAT.

The Bench observed that the High Court has judicial superintendence over KSAT as per law laid down by the apex court and hence, it is required to examine the propriety and legality of the orders passed by KSAT calling records from the High Court.

However, the Bench said that the KSAT Registrar was free to get a direction from the tribunal to request for providing photocopies of the documents related to writ petitions from the HC’s Registrar-General. And if such a request was made, the Registrar-General would have to furnish it, the Bench said.

Though the court has not issued notice to KSAT at the present, it gave liberty to the State to seek modification of the tribunal’s two orders calling for records from the HC. A Bench of KSAT comprising its Chairman K. Bhakthavatsala and G. Latha Krishna Rao (Administrative Member) had passed the orders calling for the records from the court and based on it the KSAT Registrar had written to the Registrar-General of High Court.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hc-stays-tribunal-order-of-calling-records-from-court/article30745180.ece
112,2020/02/05,Coronavirus: State launches aggressive awareness campaign,"Following the detection of three cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in Kerala, Karnataka has now launched an aggressive awareness campaign.

Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey told The Hindu that short audio jingles on the virus and its symptoms and precautions are being played in bus stations, private FM channels and All India Radio.

“We are also getting a small video played in 500 cinema halls advising people to take precautions and stay safe,” he said.

The department has also written to BMRCL to display coronavirus symptoms and precautions in all metro stations and trains.

On Wednesday, the Union Cabinet Secretary held a high-level meeting to review the actions taken for management of coronavirus and preparedness of States.

Till date, 87 travellers from coronavirus-affected countries have been identified in the State and 83 are under home isolation. The suspected case quarantined in Tumakuru district hospital has tested negative and has been discharged, said B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases).

113,2020/02/05,Karnataka-Kerala border in H.D. Kote on radar,"The district health authorities have constituted a mobile team comprising doctors and nurses in H.D. Kote to monitor the villages sharing border with Kerala that has had three confirmed case of novel coronavirus.

H.D. Kote and surrounding areas of the town have regular movement of daily wagers and local businessmen dealing with agricultural and horticultural produce that is transported to Manathavady in the neighbouring State. Besides, daily wagers from H.D. Kote are hired on a contract basis in plantations in the adjoining State just as Kodagu in Karnataka draws workers from Kerala.

But it is practically impossible to monitor and screen every individual given that scores of vehicles transport them regularly across the border at dawn and bring them back at dusk. Kabini river, which meanders through H.D. Kote, constitutes the border along vast swathe of the taluk and people use coracles and boats to cross over and return.

There is also inward movement from Kerala to H.D. Kote mainly by contract farmers who have invested heavily in farmlands here.

Bulk of the ginger that is cultivated in H.D. Kote is by contract farmers from Kerala who also tend to bring in their own workers. Given the impossibility and impracticality of monitoring every to and fro movement between the two States, the authorities have decided to step up public awareness.

“The mobile team conducts random checks and screening, besides creating awareness, especially along the border villages like Bawali and Machchuru,” said Venkatesh, District Health Officer, Mysuru. A quarantine ward has been created in H.D. Kote hospital for screening patients with symptoms of novel coronavirus, if any.

Liquor stores

Meanwhile, the liquor stores in H.D. Kote’s D.B. Kuppe Gram Panchayat limits continue to attract villagers from across the border.

The liquor store in Machchuru, a village in H.D. Kote, situated along the Kabini, has been a favourite haunt of people from Kerala.

“Many people from Kerala cross the river by boat and come to D.B. Kuppe looking for work. They also have a drink in the liquor stores,” said Ramachandra, Sub-Inspector of Beechanahalli police station.

115,2020/02/05,Lack of funds hits conservation of heritage buildings in Mysuru,"Lack of adequate funds for conservation of heritage structures and absence of clarity on their management is hampering conservation endeavours in the city.

The city could witness the dismantling of a few more buildings to pave way for commercial complexes. Already, there is a question mark on the future of Devaraja Market and the Lansdowne Building.

Silver Jubilee Clock Tower

One of the iconic structures in Mysuru is the Silver Jubilee Clock Tower or the Dodda Gadiyara which was constructed to mark the completion of 25 years of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar’s rule in 1927. Expert committee members noticed cracks in the upper chamber in May 2019.

After many inspections and observations, the authorities are yet to formalise a detailed project report nor have they estimated the cost of the repairs. N.S. Rangaraju, member of the District Heritage Committee, told The Hindu that in case the clock tower was not repaired by the onset of monsoon, the damage to the structure could aggravate.

Similarly, the Jayalakshmi Vilas Mansion and the Government House need to be restored on a priority basis but lack of funds is hampering conservation works. If there is so much apathy for the restoration of well-known structures, the less said the better regarding the lesser-known buildings, said Prof.R angaraju.

There are over 200 heritage structures in the city and the recent revision and mapping of the city has shored up their numbers above 400 though they are yet to be notified. But there are concerns as to who will foot the bill for conservation in case the ownership of the heritage structure is vested in private hands.

Budgetary provisions

Prof. Rangaraju said as far as government buildings are concerned there is clarity on the management and source of finance for restoration. But many of the departments and the PWD responsible for their maintenance, have not made adequate budgetary provisions for this purpose. Hence they have been instructed to do so.

During a recent inspection, the compound of the Mysuru City Corporation (MCC) building was found to be at a lower level than the main road and the footpath. A portion of the cast iron grills was found to be dismantled and stolen and hence instructions were issued to lift the foundation of the compound wall and carry out the repairs.

Similarly, the Ayurvedic Medical College suffered from lack of maintenance but it has secured funds for restoration and the works would be taken up in due course, said Prof. Rangaraju.

But in the case of an old choultry behind the Janata Bazaar building a portion of the wall was found to be eroded.

Though the ownership is vested with the Muzrai Department, it refused to take up any repairs citing lack of expertise. “Hence they were instructed to release funds and the Heritage Committee would get the work done for them’’, Prof. Rangaraju added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/s0o1pi/article30745086.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MYSTOWER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/lack-of-funds-hits-conservation-of-heritage-buildings-in-mysuru/article30745087.ece
116,2020/02/05,Flower show to be ‘plastic-free’,"This year’s flower show in the sprawling garden of Raja Seat in Madikeri from February 7 to 10 will be plastic-free. The organisers have banned visitors from carrying plastic inside the show, which is expected to attract a lot of locals and tourists.

The organisers have urged the visitors not to carry plastic carry bags and bottles.

Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Annies Kanmani Joy on Wednesday inspected the arrangements for the show and later held a meeting with officials of the Departments of Horticulture and Tourism.

The Departments of Kannada and Culture, Kodava Sahitya Academy and other academies and cultural institutions will be presenting cultural shows on each day.

While the show is free for schoolchildren if they come wearing their uniform or with a letter issued by the heads of their schools, the entry fee for others would be ₹10, said Deputy Director of Horticulture Chandrashekar.

He requested the Police department to make arrangements for the parking of visitors’ vehicles and barricades at the venue.

Police Inspector K.B. Belliappa said temporary parking can be arranged at the old private bus-stand in view of the show from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. and private buses can operate from the APMC premises until the flower show gets over.

Ms Joy told the officials to ensure convenience to the public and communicate information well in advance in case of changes in the arrangements.

Tourism officials urged the Deputy Commissioner to allow food stalls at the venue for the convenience of visitors.

The appeal was considered and those willing to set up food stalls will be getting space at the venue for free, a release said.

119,2020/02/05,Linking education loan to CIBIL scores condemned,"Expressing displeasure over the denial of education loan by a few banks to deserving students citing low CIBIL scores of their parents, George Kurian, Vice-Chairman of National Commission for Minorities, has said that he would draw the attention of the Central government to the issue.

He was speaking at a meeting held here on Wednesday to review the progress of implementation of schemes related to welfare of minorities.

When the issue of access to education loan for the students from minority communities came for discussion, Solomon Menezes, Manager of District Lead Bank, said that, citing guidelines by the Reserve Bank of India, some banks were displaying reluctance to grant education loan for the children of persons having low CIBIL scores. Deputy Commissioner K.B. Sivakumar requested Mr. Kurian to draw the attention of the Centre.

Mr. Kurian said that the children should not be made to suffer for the financial problems of their parents.

The officials told the meeting that 47 of the total 68 madrasas in the district were registered with the State government. Mr. Kurian directed the officials of Department of Public Instruction to take measures to impart formal education at the madrasas. Mr. Sivakumar told the meeting that, during a survey undertaken recently, as many as 22 school dropouts from minority communities have been identified in the district of which nine students have been brought back to the purview of formal education system.

On the measures taken to prevent communal violence, Superintendent of Police K.M. Shantharaju said that since 2015, incidents of communal riots have not been reported in the district. In 2019, a total of 750 meetings of mohalla-level committees, formed to maintain peace and amity, were held across the district. As a precautionary measure, surveillance will be stepped up during the festivals that attract huge crowds to avoid untoward incidents, he added.

121,2020/02/05,Venkatesh Murthy proposes either Sanskrit or Prakrit as link language,"Categorically opposing Hindi as a link language for communication between different States and linguistic communities, H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, president of the 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelan, proposed Sanskrit or Prakrit for the purpose.

“It is not acceptable for us to see Hindi as the first among equal languages. If you feel a language is required to unite India and make the communication between the States easy, it should not be Hindi. A language which is not a language of a particular province or Sanskrit which was the language of literature and thought once in India or Prakrit which was a language of communication among common people could be developed as a link language, just as Jews developed Yiddish.

Most of our language problems would get solved if we expand the meaning of mother tongue to mean native language.” he said.

Pointing to the disparities in language teaching across the country, Mr. Murthy disagreed with the approach of three-language policy for South India and two-language policy for North India.

“If we accept the three-language policy, it should uniformly be implemented throughout India. It should not be like three languages for South India and two languages for north India. The children in North should learn one more language of interest along with English and Hindi,” he said.

Unleashing his wrath on individuals and institutions who wanted English as the medium of instruction, Mr. Murthy said that such people and institutions would bring forward the parents’ right of choosing their child’s medium of instruction.

122,2020/02/05,Three held for abducting woman,"Hassan police, on Wednesday, arrested three persons on charges of abducting a 21-year-old woman and harassing her. One of the accused had forcibly tied her a thread in an attempt to marry her in captivity.

The arrested are K.N. Manu Kumar, 30, of Kudukundi village in Arsikere taluk; Vinay T.N., 25, of Tarabenahalli in Channarayapatna taluk; and Praveen Kumar, 23, of Kudakundi village. Two more people, Sandeep K.A., 26, and Gandhi, allegedly involved in the case, are absconding.

Hassan Superintendent of Police R. Srinivas Gowda, in a press conference, said that the accused abducted the girl on Monday (February 3) and Manu Kumar tied her a thread even as she protested. The accused video-recorded their act and shared it on social media platforms.

“We got information about a video clip going viral on Tuesday evening. By then we had received a complaint at Dudda police station about a woman missing. We got to know that the girl on the video was the one missing”, he said.

A special team of officers was put on the job to trace the accused. The officers tracked them down in Ramanagaram and took them into custody late in the night on Tuesday.

“The main accused, Manu, is a relative of the girl. He wanted to marry her, but her parents were against it. He with the help of his friends abducted her, intending to marry her”, the SP said.

123,2020/02/05,Will ensure Kannada is taught in all private schools: CM,"The State government will take steps to ensure that Kannada as a language is taught in all private schools, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced today at the 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana in Kalaburagi.

This comes in the wake of the demand by some Kannada activists for making Kannada medium compulsory in all schools in the State. Sammelana president H.S. Venkatesh Murthy, who spoke after the Chief Minister, also made this demand.

The Chief Minister said “We are committed to putting in place a series of steps to see that Kannada is taught in all schools, aided and private, as a language. Kannada should be taught as the first or second language. We will also take steps to strengthen government schools. However, the government alone cannot do much. The community and parents should offer support to make sure that government schools provide quality education to all.”

To inculcate the spirit of scientific inquiry, the State government is setting up mobile planetariums. This will increase the interest of children in space technology and India’s efforts in space exploration.

The government is committed to protecting the interests of the State in Mahadayi and other river water disputes. It will take the border row issue, based on the Mahajan Commission report pending in the Supreme Court, to its logical end.

The government will also address backwardness and related issues. It will make sure that adequate funds are allocated to the development of Kalyana Karnataka. Among other things, it will establish a hostel for students from Kalaburagi region in Bengaluru. Land has been allotted in Nagarabavi for the hostel that can accommodate around 200 students. The government has decided to celebrate Kalyana Karnataka Utsav once every two years. This will showcase the culture of the region.

“We are working towards forging sentimental and emotional unity of the State other than unity based on language or administration. Our dream is to see that Karnataka remains a homogeneous unit with equality and equal opportunity for all,’’ the Chief Minister added.

Kambar bats for technology

Chandrashekar Kambar, Sahitya Akademi president and former president of the Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana, favoured effective implementation of technology in administration and for universal use of Kannada in computing and e-governance.

Speaking at the Sammelana inauguration, he said “Several years ago, at the insistence of writer Poornachandra Tejaswi, I appealed to the State government to give a push to Kannada computing. We were convinced that no language can survive without the use of modern technology and use of the language in computers. The Department of Kannada and Culture, headed by then director Manu Baligar, released ₹2 crore for the project. The work began in earnest and teams of technologists came up with software and fonts. Some departments started using Kannada software. But this work has stopped or slowed down at some level. I appeal to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa to continue the work and ensure that computerised Kannada is used at all levels of government and in e-governance.’’

Supports dubbing

Mr. Kambar batted for content dubbing of informative TV channels in Kannada. Channels such as Discovery and History produce good quality content that can be educative and informative. They are very useful for children. These channels are now available in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi and some other Indian languages. But they are not available in Kannada. That is because some people in the film industry are opposing dubbing. Such opposition is not good. Informative channels are our window to the world and allowing dubbing will enhance our knowledge base. There is no merit in not allowing dubbing. I appeal to C.T. Ravi, Minister for Kannada and Culture, to allow dubbing in Kannada, he said.

Mr. Kambar favoured primary education in the mother tongue of the child and urged the State government to introduce universal and compulsory education in Kannada medium in all schools. “This will help preserve our culture. Nothing else can,’’ he said.

He blamed the East India Company administration for inculcating a craze for English education among the people. “The introduction of English education by the British was strongly welcomed by the masses in India as they had been denied the opportunity for education for millenia. The deprived classes and Dalits who had not been exposed to education till then, were excited about the opportunity. However, along with English education, the British were successful in introducing inferiority in our minds. We are yet to escape from this inferiority complex.”

Quoting from Greek mythology, Mr. Kambar said that Hercules had killed his children and relatives in a fit of alcohol-induced rage. “We should not behave like that. We may be very strong, but we should not kill our mother tongue, in our power-induced rage,’’ he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/will-ensure-kannada-is-taught-in-all-private-schools-cm/article30741768.ece
124,2020/02/05,Kannada Sahitya Sammelana begins with colourful procession,"The 85th Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana began with a grand cultural procession here on Wednesday morning. Tens of thousands of people including writers, artists, schoolchildren, staff and officials, along with decorated chariots and tableaux, marched in the procession waving yellow-red flags and banners. Pro-Kannada slogans reverberated in the air throughout the 5.5 km procession route.

Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi in-charge Govind Karjol, in the presence of Sammelana president H.S. Venkatesh Murthy and Kannada Sahitya Parishat president Manu Baligar, flagged off the colourful procession at S.M. Pandit Rangamandir at about 8.30 a.m.

Mr. Murthy and Mr. Baligar then sat on the specially decorated golden chariot followed by 12 decorated silver chariots carrying the presidents of 30 district Kannada Sahitya Parishat units and proceeded along with the procession towards the main venue built on the Gulbarga University campus.

There were over 60 cultural troupes with 800 artistes showcasing Kamsaale, Dollu Kunitha, Pooja Kunitha, Veeragaase, Nandi Dhwaja, Navilu Kunitha, Bombe Kunitha, Nagari, Kangeelu Kunitha and other performances. Artistes were dressed as Hindu religious characters in the procession.

A carnival atmosphere prevailed all through the procession route. People from neighbouring districts and taluks joined the procession at various junctions and it took three hours to reach the main venue.

The people and children were busy taking selfies with the dolls and artists painted in colours. While the girls and staff of various departments participating in the procession wore bright-coloured sarees and traditional dresses like ghagra-choli, boys were seen in dhoti and other traditional attire. Throughout the main streets, school students were waving Kannada flags to welcome the troupes and artists.

The crowd including Ashwmedha chariots, tableaux and cultural troupes took almost one hour at the procession’s tail-end to leave the Rangamandir premises.

Earlier, Mr Karjol, Mr. Baligar and district president of Kannada Sahitya Parishat Veerabhadra Simpi hoisted the national flag, Kannada flag and the Parishat flag respectively outside the main venue.

Bheemaraya Hugar rode his bike all the way from his hometown of Huvina Hipparagi of Basavana Bagevadi in Vijayapura district to Kalaburagi to promote the event and spread awareness about the sammelan.

The 39-year-old graduate, who works at an incense sticks manufacturing unit, loves attending Kannada literary events. After reaching the district headquarters, he visited the taluk headquarters on his motorcycle appealing to people to attend the literary event and make it a grand success. He also carried a carton full of books of “one-line quotes” written by him. He intends to sell them to the people he meets; he, however, presents the books free to students.

Mr. Hugar has written around one lakh quotes and published the first volume comprising 10,000 such quotes. He has also written a thousand Vachanas.

126,2020/02/05,"Govt. to resume supply of rice, wheat to private institutions","The State government has decided to continue midday meal scheme in 351 private schools, with students totalling 32,700, for one more year. The scheme was stopped following reduction in grants by the Centre to the State.

This Cabinet decision came hours after the former Minister U.T. Khader held a press conference on Tuesday criticising supplies to these institutions, including those run by Siddaganga Mutt in Tumakuru and Muruga Rajendra Mutt in Chitradurga, being stopped for over two months.

Minister for Women and Child Development Shashikala Jolle said the government had decided to extend the programme to students of private schools. The Cabinet also took a decision on this matter. The decision to supply rice and wheat to unaided schools would cost an additional ₹18 crore to the State exchequer.

Ms. Jolle claimed that supply of rice and wheat was stopped during the tenure of the coalition government headed by H.D. Kumaraswamy. The seer of Siddaganga Mutt had written to her on the stoppage of the supply of foodgrains to the schools run by the mutt, she said.

The supply of foodgrains to schools run by private managements and mutts was stopped following cut in grants from the Union government, Ms. Jolle said. The State government had not deliberately stopped the supply of foodgrains, she claimed.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Khader accused the State government of “scrapping” the Dasoha scheme started by the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah.

As a result of this, supply of free foodgrains to thousands of schoolchildren and those living in hostels, old age and destitute homes, beggars’ rehabilitation centres, and night shelters run by 468 welfare institutions, including mutts and NGOs, came to a halt in November 2019.

The former Minister told reporters here that a majority of the beneficiaries (nearly 25,000) under the Dasoha scheme were students of schools and hostels run by Siddaganga Mutt, Suttur Mutt in Mysuru district, Adichunchanagiri Mutt, and Muruga Rajendra Mutt in Chitradurga.

“This has affected thousands of orphans, widows, and homeless and aged people in these welfare institutions. Over a 1,000 patients and their attendants in the State-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, who are included in the beneficiary list, have also been hit,” Mr. Khader alleged.

Stating that this was following the Centre’s directions, he alleged that it clearly showed that the BJP government had no concern for the poor.

After the implementation of the National Food Security Act, 2013, the Centre had been providing an additional 5% of the 2.17 lakh tonnes of foodgrains allocated to the State (for public distribution system) every month. The State had been procuring rice at ₹3 a kg and wheat at ₹2 and providing the foodgrains for free to the beneficiaries of welfare organisations under the Dasoha scheme since 2016.

Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Hindu that the Centre issued an order in July 2019 stopping the additional 5% allocation to the State as there were large-scale complaints of misuse in some States.

“Karnataka should have written back to the Centre then itself clarifying that there is no misuse as the distribution is done after verifying the biometrics and Aadhaar details of every beneficiary. That did not happen and it became inevitable for this government to stop the free supply of foodgrains from November 2019. Even now, the allocation can resume if the State clarifies and convinces the Centre,” sources said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/govt-to-resume-supply-of-rice-wheat-to-private-institutions/article30737616.ece
127,2020/02/05,Bengaluru flower vendor finds ₹30 crore credited in wife’s bank account,"What do you do when you wake up one morning to learn that ₹30 crore has been deposited in your bank account overnight?

That is exactly what happened to a flower vendor from Channapatna who had been scrounging for funds so that he could undergo a medical procedure. On December 2, 2019, bank officials came knocking on 32-year-old Syed Malik Burhan’s door seeking an explanation for “some money” that had been deposited in his wife’s account.

“We had only ₹60 in the SBI account, which is in my wife Rehana’s name. We were trying to raise ₹2 lakh for an ear surgery I need to undergo, and then suddenly there’s around ₹30 crore in the account,” he said.

Account frozen

Since then, Mr. Burhan, who lives with his wife and two children, a 10-year-old son and a nine-year-old daughter, in a rented house in Channapatna has been running from one agency to another seeking help from the authorities to probe the source of the money. The bank account has been frozen.

According to Mr. Burhan, the bank did not reveal the amount of money deposited in the account. On December 2 evening itself, Mr. Burhan and his wife met with bank officers to answer some questions. “They kept asking me who had sent her the money. We kept telling them that we knew nothing about it,” he said.

Suspecting that something was afoot, Mr. Burhan later went to an ATM near their house, and saw that there was around ₹30 crore in his account. Thinking that the ATM was not working, Mr. Burhan visited two more kiosks. On the advice of his family and friends, he approached the police and the I-T Department.

On December 5, he went to the bank and sought details of the account stating that he wanted to file a complaint. “But I was told that the account was frozen. I told the bank officers that a few days before the money appeared, I had ordered a sari for my wife online. The next day, a person who said he was an executive with the online platform called me to inform me that I was the winner of an SUV worth ₹14 lakh. He asked me to pay ₹6,900 towards the insurance of the vehicle following which he would send the car to my address. I told him that I had no money and needed ₹2 lakh for my surgery. The person took the bank account details and the OTP and disconnected the call saying that he would get back to me,” Mr. Burhan said.

He tried approaching the I-T Department in Mandya and Channapatna to file a complaint, but officers allegedly asked him to leave. Finally, with the help of a friend, he approached a senior police officer, who, took up the case on January 9.

Mr. Burhan said he recently got a call from an unidentified man who claimed that he was the one who deposited the money. “He said I could keep ₹15 crore if I transferred the remaining ₹15 crore back to him,” he said.

The Channapattana police filed an FIR under cheating, impersonation and also under various sections of the I-T Act. The police suspect that the bank account has been misused by online fraudsters and are trying to track down the person who had contacted Mr. Burhan.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/p6kuo5/article30737564.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BgBank-account-Illustationcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flower-vendor-finds-30-crore-credited-in-wifes-bank-account/article30737566.ece
128,2020/02/05,"Mangaluru firing: Issue notice seeking private video footage, says HC","The High Court of Karnataka on Tuesday directed the District Magistrate, who is conducting a magisterial inquiry into the police firing during an anti-CAA protest in Mangaluru on December 19, 2019, to issue a public notice asking private individuals and media persons to provide video footage, if available, of the firing and related incidents.

The court also directed the Magistrate to bring all the available video footage on record of the inquiry while directing the State authorities to provide particulars such as length and duration of video footage, recorded in CCTV cameras installed in public places, that is already preserved.

A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar issued the direction during the hearing of a PIL petition filed by freedom fighter H.S. Doreswamy and former Mayor of Mangaluru K. Ashraf.

On a contention in the petition that no action was taken on the complaints filed by several persons against the police, the court directed the government to inform it about the action taken on the complaints.

The Bench also noted from the preliminary report, submitted in a sealed cover by the District Magistrate, that the magisterial inquiry was in the preliminary stages. According to information submitted by the District Magistrate to the Registrar-General of the High Court, certain statements and some evidence were recorded in January and further proceedings would be held on February 6 to record of the statements of 176 witnesses.

Earlier, Advocate-General Prabhuling K. Navadgi told the Bench that the magisterial inquiry was under way and the National Human Rights Commission, acting on a complaint filed by the petitioner Mr. Ashraf, had also asked the State Human Rights Commission to conduct an inquiry into the firing and submit a report. The Bench said that since the human rights commissions could only make recommendations, writ petitions were required to be maintained.

Dismissed

Meanwhile, the Bench dismissed another PIL petition, filed by I.K. Mohammed Iqbal Elimale and B. Umer, both residents of Sullia taluk in Dakshina Kannada, as they were found to be facing several criminal cases and had not disclosed, as per the court’s earlier direction, the types of social work they were engaged in.

The Advocate-General pointed out that one of the petitioners was facing one criminal case and the other, five. The Bench observed that the petitioners could not be considered pro bono litigants as they had failed to make proper disclosures, including social organisations and works that they are associated with.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mangaluru-firing-issue-notice-seeking-private-video-footage-says-hc/article30737494.ece
129,2020/02/05,Yediyurappa promises Karnataka Cabinet reshuffle in July to buy peace,"Amid growing disgruntlement in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the Cabinet expansion, which is scheduled for Thursday, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa seems to be buying peace by promising a reshuffle in July.

Sources in the party said the Chief Minister has spoken to several ministerial aspirants, including those from Kalyana Karnataka region, who were huddled in a series of meetings in the city demanding ministries on Monday and Tuesday. He is believed to have explained his situation — that making newcomers Ministers was imperative and that the high command had only cleared expansion, not reshuffle. He appealed to them to “understand and cooperate”, according to sources.

He has also reportedly promised that he would rejig the Cabinet in July. Seven seats in the Legislative Council will become vacant and then he has promised to make disqualified MLAs R. Shankar and N. Nagaraju (MTB) MLCs and Ministers.

Calls for ‘sacrifice’

Notwithstanding this, there has been a growing clamour for senior Ministers to “sacrifice” their posts to accommodate others from the party. Saundatti MLA Anand C. Mamani, in a series of tweets on Tuesday, said that seniors who have enjoyed power in all governments till now were refusing to give it up. Basanagouda Patil Yatnal said on Monday that an evaluation of Ministers was necessary and non-perfomers should be removed to accommodate the more deserving leaders.

As Ministers expressed concerns over reports of a reshuffle at the Cabinet meet on Tuesday, the Chief Minister assured them that only an expansion would happen on Thursday. But, according to a senior Minister, he admitted that a reshuffle might happen later this year.

Regional balance

Meanwhile, several MLAs from Kalyana Karnataka and coastal Karnataka have demanded “adequate representation” for their regions in the Cabinet. More than 10 MLAs from Kalyana Karnataka held a meeting at the Legislators’ House on Tuesday, as they did on Monday. Of the 40 seats in the region of six districts, the BJP won 15 in 2018 and added another one to its tally with Anand Singh joining the saffron party and winning in the byelection. At present, the region has only one Minister (Prabhu Chauhan). It is expected to add another in Mr. Singh.

Similarly, the BJP won 16 of 19 seats in coastal Karnataka in 2018, and the tally is now up to 17 with Shivaram Hebbar joining it and winning the bypoll. However, none of the MLAs have found a berth in the Cabinet. Kota Srinivas Poojary, the sole Minister from the region, is an MLC. Mr. Hebbar, also from the region, will now make the Cabinet. The MLAs from both regions believe their regions are under-represented.

Against Yogeshwar

These MLAs have opposed C.P. Yogeshwar’s candidature for a berth in the Cabinet, as he was defeated in the 2018 Assembly polls. Rudresh, president of the Ramanagaram district unit of BJP, visited as the Kalyana Karnataka MLAs met and appealed to them not to oppose Mr. Yogeshwar’s candidature. However, Umesh Katti, who is all set to be inducted into the Cabinet, said that those defeated could be made Ministers “only in special cases, which is not the case now”.

Mr. Yogeshwar, Ramesh Jarkiholi and Mahesh Kumathalli were at Tirupati on Tuesday and are expected to return on Wednesday. According to sources, Mr. Yediyurappa is still trying to induct Mr. Kumathalli into the Cabinet.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/inx9sh/article30739881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THYEDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/yediyurappa-promises-cabinet-reshuffle-in-july-to-buy-peace/article30737421.ece

Doctors, Kudumbashree workers, and Accredited Social Health Activists (Asha workers) have been briefed on preventive measures and local bodies are in charge of organising awareness campaigns for educational institutions.

“All the 18 samples sent from the district have been tested negative and there is no need for panic. At the same time, the public should stay alert and follow all instructions issued by the department,” said District Medical Officer (DMO) V.V. Shirely on Wednesday.

The department has intensified infection control practices in all public health centres, community health centres, and taluk hospitals along with ensuring the availability of personal protection equipment (PPE). The public has been advised to follow strict cough hygiene while cough corners and airborne infection control corners have been set up in all hospitals.

Tourist centres, hotels, homestays, and those conducting public functions have been advised to exercise caution.

“All directions from the government should be followed and stringent action will be initiated against those spreading fake news,” said District Collector B. Abdul Nasar.

The DMO has formed 15 emergency teams to handle the situation and coordinate various activities, including ambulance service, surveillance, and call centre management. So far, 7,013 persons from various departments, including the staff of government and private hospitals, have been given training. Panchayat-and ward-level training sessions will be conducted in the coming days.

135,2020/02/05,Nilackal-Pampa metro or monorail mooted,"Road safety expert and former Regional Transport Officer P.D. Sunilbabu, who has been the nodal officer of the Safe Zone Sabarimala project ever since its inception in 2012, has proposed metro or monorail connectivity between the pilgrim base camp of Nilackal and Pampa.

Mr. Sunilbabu says he has submitted a project report to the government. Talking to The Hindu, Mr Sunilbabu said the proposed metro or monorail would be of great help in minimising the environment pollution owing to carbon emission from diesel and petrol engines of vehicles in the evergreen reserve forests. Moreover, it would reduce the distance between Nilackal and Pampa by 10 km. The best part of the proposed project was that it would be of great help in ensuring effective crowd management and regulation of pilgrim flow to Sabarimala during rush days, thereby avoiding overcrowding and congestion at the hillock, he said.

‘No tree felling’

According to Mr. Sunilbabu, the road distance between Nilackal and Pampa is 21 km and the proposed Nilackal-Pampa metro rail will only be 11 km.

Construction of a metro or monorail would necessitate no felling of trees as the railway line would be laid on an elevated path supported by tall pillars, he said. Mr. Sunilbabu said constructing a metro or monorail between Nilackal and Pampa, cutting across the Attathodu valley, would help authorities stop all transport carriages at the Nilackal base camp and properly regulate the pilgrim flow to Pampa and Sabarimala from there.

The proposed project is 100% eco-friendly and cost-effective, considering the huge environmental cost of existing road transport system, he says.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/p9l2k2/article30745323.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06tvpt-attathoduvalley1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/nilackal-pampa-metro-or-monorail-mooted/article30745324.ece
136,2020/02/05,New residency norms will hit investments: NRIs,"Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations have urged Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to withdraw the proposal to reduce to 120 days from the existing 180 days a year for taxing expatriates for staying in the country.

The new proposal is that anyone who stays in India for 120 days or more in a year will now be deemed as a resident liable to pay tax. This has been aimed at NRIs who evade tax by exploiting the residency norms.

However, many feel that the new policy of the BJP-led government at the Centre will have an adverse impact on investments. “If the government insists with the 120d-ay norm, NRIs will hesitate to start big investments in India,” K.V. Shamsudheen. chairman, UAE-based Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust, said.

He said the government should find better solution to stop people from misusing the current law instead of penalising genuine NRIs. “NRIs have remitted $80 billion in 2018, out of that $35 billion came from Indian diaspora residing in GCC countries,” he said.

In GCC countries, Mr. Shamsudheen said that high net worth NRIs having large business establishments in India, regularly visit the country to manage their establishments. So they have to stay more in India than for 120 days.

Also, NRIs who run business establishments such as grocery, restaurants, maintenance companies with partnership firms would stay at least five-and-half months in a year in India.

Similarly, more than half a million Indians working in oil and gas industry in off shores in various GCC countries have to work 35 days at a stretch and take 28 days leave. In these category, there are highly paid professionals and blue collar workers as well. These people have to stay more than 120 days in a year, Mr. Shamsudheen said.

Besides, Indians residing in GCC countries always fly down to India for medical treatment and to support aged parents. In such situation, they have to stay in India for more than 120 days, he said.

The budgetary objectives to increase the income and spending of the people to boost the economy is a welcome step. But taxing an NRI for staying in India for more than 120 days was fraught with danger, Mr. Shamsudheen said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/new-residency-norms-will-hit-investments-nris/article30743680.ece

The court issued the directive when a petition relating to the display of fireworks came up for hearing.

Meanwhile, the Additional District Magistrate (ADM) told the High Court that the organisers had blatantly violated the directives of the Supreme Court, High Court, Ministry of Commerce and Industry besides the conditions set by the District Collector in the licence granted to them.

The report of the ADM pointed out that improper and careless fixing of ‘amittu’ on the ground had caused ‘amittu stand’ to topple on the ground when the explosives were lit. The toppling had resulted in fireworks landing at the feet of spectators, causing them injuries.

The report also said that the organisers had misled the High Court by producing a falsified plan of the fireworks display site in which they indicated that the mandatory safety distance of 100 metres was available between the fireworks display site and spectators. When the police were trying to move the spectators to a safe distance from the fireworks area, the organisers lit the fireworks in disobedience of the directions, resulting in the accident.

In fact, the district authorities had asked the organisers not to conduct the fireworks when it noticed violations of various conditions. The report also said that the seizure of unexploded explosives from the scene revealed that the organisers had used traditional fireworks like ‘Gundu’ and ‘Olappadakkam’ without any approval from PESO, Nagpur. Moreover, the organisers didn’t conduct any risk assessment by a reputed organisation to identify potential hazards arising from the fireworks.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kh81l/article30740077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05kiFire3,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/fireworks-accident-govt-told-to-verify-insurance-coverage/article30740078.ece

142,2020/02/05,Vidhu Vinod Chopra: ‘I want people to see Shikara without any prejudices’,"The exodus of Kashmiri Pandits has been frequently used for political whataboutery while discussing the current lockdown and reports of human rights violation in Kashmir. Already surrounded by controversies, Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s Shikara sets out to navigate this tricky subject, with an intent to provide “healing” to Kashmiri Pandits. Ahead of its release this Friday, the filmmaker discusses the relevance of the film in today’s India and Kashmir. Edited excerpts from an email interview…

What prompted you to adapt Rahul Pandita’s book, Our Moon Has Blood Clots? How faithful were you to the source material as a filmmaker?

Shikara is a story about the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits and draws its inspiration from several sources. [It’s] primarily [about] my own past, having [been] born and having lived in Kashmir for many years. And our own families’ experience of being part of the exodus. Apart from that, Rahul Pandita’s brilliant book, Our Moon Has Blood Clots is a significant resource for the film. It is a very well-researched documentation on what led to the Kashmiri Pandit exodus and the apathy and neglect of the Kashmiri Pandit families for all these years. We have also used details from actual Pandit family experiences and their plight living in Jagti refugee camp. It has taken me 11 years to tell this story and is a combination of a significantly large amount of people who have been part of the process. Abhijat [Joshi], Rahul and I worked on this together and hopefully when the movie opens on February 7, it should leave an impact across.

How do you translate exposition and factually dense material onto the screen, which is an audio-visual medium?

In Shikara’s case, it has taken me 11 years of painstakingly sifting through tons of documentation, actual accounts, references from books and our own collective wisdom to tell a story which is palatable and communicates the message.

Looking for healing: (left) Vidhu Vinod Chopra; (right) A still from Shikara

Particularly with Kashmir as it stands today, how do you think this film adds to the ongoing conversation?

It will be a welcome relief as it talks about communities and people coming together to resolve an issue. We have tried to do full justice in telling about the atrocities done to the Kashmiri Pandits and how a once blossoming region polarised almost overnight and led to driving out of more than four lakh Kashmiri Hindus. Since we speak about a dialogue, and I have spoken about it in several of my interviews, I believe there is no better time than now to start a dialogue in Kashmir about the return of the Kashmiri Pandits.

You said earlier that the film provides ‘healing’. Could you elaborate on that?

The film’s underlying theme is that when hate is all that is left, love is your only weapon. The story revolves around Shiv and Shanti Dhar, a Kashmiri Pandit couple displaced from their home and 30 years of their struggle to go back. Despite having gone through the ordeal of being thrown out from their motherland, they display immaculate patience, perseverance and are an embodiment of love and peace. Without diluting any aspect of the gruesome atrocities done on the Kashmiri Pandit families, we have tried to tell a story that when love fails, there is no hope. And that we believe is the message the movie will communicate. We want communities to come together and have a dialogue so that we can restore the peace and prosperity of Kashmir. I firmly believe that the movie will heal and bring people together.

From the time the book released in 2013 (under a different government) to today, when the film is releasing in a completely different time (after the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir), do you think that the relevance of the story has changed? Would it be perceived differently?

The Kashmiri Pandit issue has remained irrelevant for the last 30 years. Barring this book and the movie that we are releasing after our arduous journey, there is hardly any relevant documentation or discussion or steps taken to rehabilitate the Kashmiri Pandits back in Kashmir. I believe that the movie should force the establishment to take cognisance of the issue and do what is right, which we have failed to do for the last 30 years and that is to give the Kashmiri Pandits justice. A very large part of India and the world is not aware of what transpired and led to the events of 1990. Perceptions across are very different and we wish to bring out the reality to celluloid.

The trailer shows a sense of disappointment in Kashmiri Pandits not receiving any support from the ‘majority’ during the exodus. Does the film aim at generating that solidarity that the Pandits didn’t receive back then?

Yes, it is a fact that the Kashmiri Pandits did not get the necessary support from subsequent governments starting with 1990. The film does aim at generating a conversation around the apathy and neglect faced by the Kashmiri Pandit families with the hope that a conversation will start and things will normalise. There is a great saying in Kashmir – Sheen galli, wand tsali, te pat aayi bahaar. What it means is that the snow will melt, winter will vanish and spring will come again. And I hope that that spring returns to the Valley soon.

A film can hardly be detached from the time it is releasing in, and with the controversies surrounding the film already, are you worried about the film being used for political gains?

The movie has been ready for over six months and we had intended to release in November. But due to the 370 abrogation, I delayed it because I did not want to look like I am exploiting the situation. It is a very intense film which tells a story about the atrocities and injustice done to Kashmiri Pandits and I want people to see it without any prejudices.

What, in your opinion, is the way forward for Kashmiri Pandits to truly achieve catharsis with the past?

There is only one way forward – that the movie generates enough momentum for the establishment to sit up and take notice. And initiate a conducive dialogue for the Pandit families to return to their motherland.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/a4dcic/article30750851.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VIDHU,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vidhu-vinod-chopra-i-want-people-to-see-shikara-without-any-prejudices/article30744433.ece

144,2020/02/05,Income Tax team escorts Vijay to Chennai from Cuddalore 'Master' shoot for an inquiry,"Amid high drama, officials from the Income Tax (I-T) department’s Investigation Wing stormed NLC India Ltd’s campus in Cuddalore district and persuaded actor Vijay, who was shooting for his latest film Master there, to return to Chennai to aid their investigation.

With a warrant issued under the provisions of Section 132 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the officials explained to the actor that he had to accompany them and cooperate in the ongoing search operation at his Chennai residence. Accompanied by the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (Investigation), the actor then left the shoot during a break for lunch, officials told The Hindu on Wednesday.

“We had information that he had taken a huge amount in cash towards salary for his recent film Bigil,” said one of the officials. The film, touted as one of the highest grossing Tamil movies of 2019, was produced by AGS Entertainment.

Earlier in the day, special teams of the Investigation Wing, probing allegations of tax evasion, launched simultaneous searches at the premises of AGS Group, including AGS Cinemas, film financier Anbu Chezhiyan and the premises of Vijay in Chennai, Madurai and a few other places. The officials decided to question the actor after his wife pleaded ignorance about some documents, officials said.

“In the case of Anbu, we have found unaccounted cash of ₹40 crore in Chennai and ₹17 crore in Madurai,” a senior I-T official said. During the searches at AGS, we have found some evidence and details pertaining to this, but they can be shared only after the raids are concluded,” a senior I-T official from the Investigation Wing said. He added that the raids were ongoing and details would be provided once the searches concluded.

When investigators, following Google Maps to the area where the shooting was taking place inside the NLC campus, reached a gate meant for locals, they were stopped by personnel of the Central Industrial Security Force and asked to go to the main gate. However, armed guards at the main gate denied them permission even though officials showed their identity cards.

The security personnel alerted the mines manager, who is the competent authority to issue permits. I-T officials then gave a request in writing, seeking access to the mining area without disclosing who they wanted to meet. They only revealed that access to the shooting site was required in connection with a case registered under the Income Tax Act.

After permission was granted, investigators drove to where Vijay was resting after lunch. They showed him the warrant and searched his caravan. For about 15 minutes the officials explained to the actor the necessity of him accompanying them to Chennai, after which he agreed, the officials added.

Permission for shooting Master was granted for 10 days in NLC’s mining area, commencing on February 4.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fpptrt/article30742287.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/masterf,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vijay-escorted-by-income-tax-team-to-chennai-from-cuddalore-film-shoot-for-an-inquiry/article30742288.ece
145,2020/02/05,Brahmaji’s son Sanjay Rao to debut with ‘O Pitta Katha’,"Sanjay Rao is known to the Telugu film industry folks as actor Brahmaji’s son, but when he makes his debut next month with O Pitta Katha, the audience will know him as a reasonably good debutant.

Ask the debut actor if he is being introduced as a hero or a villain, he says there is hardly any stigma attached to being an on-screen villain. For him, acting as a hero and a villain is all the same: “I want to be introduced as an actor. In every film, the hero falls in love, loses her and wins her back. That is not what acting or script is about. A film is about telling a story, all characters play a part in bringing together the story. It is we who have named the characters a hero and a heroine. We coined it, actually all are artistes. I don’t mind playing any part as long as there is meaning and contribution to the story. It shouldn’t be routine,” says Sanjay, who struggled for five years to get a film and now hopes to capitalise on this golden phase of Telugu cinema where concept films are making a mark.

Director Chendu Muddu of O Pitta Katha was introduced to him through director Merlapaka Gandhi at a time when Sanjay was hunting for opportunities. Three years back, Merlapaka had introduced Chendu to Brahmaji as a good writer who is worth a hearing. After that, Sanjay, the director and a few set out with a camera and made a two-hour film and showed it to many people.

Sanjay recalls, “Everyone had kind words to say but there wasn’t any concrete response. We could make out who was genuine and who wasn’t. I guess they had their own reasons for not making a film with me. After three and a half years of knocking people’s doors, someone said we should be meeting Bhavya’s (production house) who consider stories if they are good and are not driven by market logistics. The producers liked the story and said they would do it with me.” While he was asked to lose some weight, they also gave inputs to actors Nitya Shetty and Vishwant. They gave the actors one and a half months to prepare and work on their physique.

The three were ready and met the deadlines. The producers saw the two-hour video that was shot and gave additional inputs. Director Chandrasekhar Yeleti read the script and oversaw the process. It has all elements of romance and mystery. Brahmaji too liked the story because all the characters get to play a lot of shades. Ask Sanjay the meaning of O Pitta Katha, and he explains, “It could have many meanings. Pitta could be a girl and also a short story. Director Trivikram Srinivas suggested the tagline to be ‘a long story’. It revolves around three primary characters; other actors play prominent roles and are very well placed. The story begins organically.”

Sanjay also recalls his training days as an actor: “I trained in Mumbai under Alok Ulfat, he was the head of selection committee in FTII (Film and Television Institute of India) who trained actors like Manoj Bajpai. Back in Hyderabad, I got trained by Devadas Kanakala. It was good to learn different styles from various people. In Mumbai we did street plays, and after one month of training we would go to Dharavi and do a lot of plays for street and slum kids.”

Prior to wanting to become an actor, Sanjay worked with the Merchant Navy. He says his dad and wife (also associated with the film industry) are principled people and believe that he should find his own path and gain confidence; that would be rewarding later, and he would be proud of making it on his own.

He shares an interesting aspect of his personality, “Dad tells me to be diplomatic as people could interpret things wrongly. I had been trained in Navy in a rigorous way and was told to be truthful and blunt. It will be difficult not to be diplomatic but at the end of the day, the result will be in your favour.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/yhmetl/article30741735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym06Sanjay-Rao,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/brahmajis-son-sanjay-to-make-his-acting-debut-in-the-telugu-film-o-pitta-katha/article30741736.ece
146,2020/02/05,Actor Yogi Babu gets married to Manju Bhargavi in a private ceremony,"Popular comedian Yogi Babu, who is one of the busiest actors in Kollywood, got married on the morning Wednesday, February 5.

The actor, known for his roles in films such as Aandavan Kattalai, Kolamavu Kokila and Pariyerum Perumal, has become a regular feature in several big-budget films and is considered a huge selling point to any ‘mass’ film featuring a big star.

His long-standing hunt for a bride became a good-natured joke in the industry as well, with even some like actor Vijay asking him to get married soon, most recently during the audio launch of Bigil, in which the duo acted together.

Yogi Babu married Manju Bhargavi in a private ceremony at Murugan Temple in Thituttani, Tamil Nadu, with just close friends and family. As per reports, the marriage was an arranged affair. The Darbar star is expected to host a reception for his friends in the film industry and fans next month in Chennai.

148,2020/02/05,Disney Plus hits nearly 29 million subscribers in three months,"Disney said its Disney Plus streaming service reached nearly 29 million paid subscribers in less than three months, an impressive start for what the company has positioned as its future as more people drop cable subscriptions.

But as expected, starting up a new service comes with huge expenses, contributing to a 23% profit decline for the company in the latest quarter.

Disney Plus launched in November to compete with online video services like Netflix. Disney had 26.5 million Disney Plus subscribers as of Dec. 28, the end of its fiscal first quarter. That grew to 28.6 million as of Monday, well on the way to Disney’s target of 60 million to 90 million worldwide by 2024.

Original series on Disney Plus include the “Star Wars” series “The Mandalorian.” One of the hit characters from the show is one resembling a baby version of Yoda. Disney CEO Bob Iger told analysts Tuesday that “Baby Yoda” consumer products will go on sale in the coming months. He said the “sensational response” to the character said a lot about Disney Plus.

The company also said a second season for “The Mandalorian” is coming in October and said the priority for “Star Wars” going forward is through the streaming service. After 42 years, the franchise just concluded its nine-part core series with “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in theaters. Disney has said the next “Star Wars” theatrical movie, which is to be set outside the Skywalker saga, isn’t scheduled for release until 2022.

Disney also had 30.4 million Hulu customers and 6.6 million ESPN Plus subscribers as of Dec. 28, big gains for both from a year ago. Disney offers a bundle of the three streaming services.

Disney Plus is currently available in the U.S., Canada, The Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. Disney expects growth in the near term to come primarily from further expansion abroad, as the service launches over the next two years in Western Europe, India and Latin America. Disney also plans to roll out Hulu outside the U.S. next year after getting Disney Plus off the ground abroad.

The company has been turning to heavy promotions to boost Disney Plus in the early months. Disney, for example, struck a deal with Verizon to give some customers a free year. Disney said about 20% of its subscribers came through Verizon. About half signed up directly through Disney, and the rest from other channels.

Disney earned $2.13 billion in the latest quarter, or $1.17 per share. Adjusted for one-time items, earnings came to $1.53 per share. Analysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $1.46. Revenue rose 36% to $20.9 billion. Wall Street expected revenue of $20.7 billion.

Disney shares gained 27 cents, or less than 1%, to $145 in after-hours trading after the release of results.

The direct-to-consumer business that includes Disney Plus posted revenue of $4 billion, up from $918 million a year ago, while its operating loss widened to $693 million from $136 million. Disney expects the business to lose another $900 million during the current quarter.

Revenue at the movie business more than doubled to $3.8 billion thanks to “Frozen II” and the new “Star Wars” movie in theaters.

Revenue slid at Disney’s cable networks division, by 20% to $4.8 billion. It said ESPN weighed on its profit because of higher programming and production costs and lower ad revenue as viewers decline. The broadcasting arm’s revenue rose 34% to $2.6 billion, while the parks division’s sales rose 8% to $7.4 billion.

Disney said attendance and hotel stays in Hong Kong were lower because of “recent events.” Disney didn’t elaborate, though there has been anti-government protests there. That was offset by growth in Shanghai, though a virus outbreak in China could impede travel and attendance.

Both parks are currently closed because of the virus. Assuming a two-month shutdown, impact to operating income in the current quarter will be $175 million. Both parks usually see a lot of visitors at this time of year.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/w5cy6b/article30741272.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DISNEYSTREAMINGSERVICE,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/disney-plus-hits-nearly-29-million-subscribers-in-three-months/article30741273.ece
149,2020/02/05,"Simrat Kaur keeps fingers crossed for her next outing, 'Dirty Hari'","Producer M S Raju who had directed Vaana in 2008 returns after a decade to direct a new film, Dirty Hari. He terms it a thriller and love elements as poetic. On the posters is the lingerie-clad heroine Simrat Kaur. Having done two Telugu films earlier, Prematho Mee Karthik and Parichayam, Simrat plays Jasmine, while Ruhani Sharma plays the lead.

Simrat says, “I had decided not to do any film post Parichayam, but when MS Raju called me for audition, he convinced me with the story. I have a bold role of a confident, urban girl. It’s not erotic, but her character is narrated in a poetic way, like the one Deepika Padukone played in Cocktail. The industry has changed a lot in the past few years, women are shown smoking, drinking and wearing short clothes but all this should go with the story. I wore a typical half sari in my earlier films. Things have changed a lot. We have been watching family films in the last decade and now this change.”

She heaps praises on her director MS Raju; “He has put his heart and soul into the film. He is very dedicated and the film would not have been possible without him. He would take care of us and get home-made food and he treated me like a kid. He trained and moulded me into the character of a bold and confident girl.”

Change of scenario

Simrat’s earlier two films were family dramas. “I had a good role in the first film and in the second film, I play a typical south Indian, wearing lehengas. In Dirty Hari, MS sir made me believe I am that character. The hero is addressed as Hari. We finished the film in November end and it is due for release in February. Right now the post-production is going on. There are situational songs and everything is shot in Hyderabad. We shot for 23 hours at a stretch; It was hard work and I finished my part in 20 days.”

Karate to cinema

As opposed to Simrat’s role, Ruhani Sharma plays a traditional desi girl.

Simrat had already got offers for Telugu web series but she won’t do them now. She shares, “I had decided I won’t do even films, I thought maybe I was not cut out for it. I was born and brought up in Mumbai but I am basically a Punjabi. I have done B.Sc Computer Science. From the age of seven I was into karate; at that age you do what your parents want. I even won an international championship in karate; that news was on TV and on posters all over. Then I came into college; as one needs sponsorship to continue sports. It has been three to four years since I gave up the sport. I got encouragement from family to be in films.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3inas9/article30740492.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym05simrat1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/simrat-kaur-keeps-fingers-crossed-for-her-next-outing-dirty-hari/article30740493.ece

Addressing media persons, he said that no protest was organised at any place by Opposition parties against the public examinations for these two classes in the State. “Did DMK, Congress or the Pattali Makkal Katchi stage protests”, he questioned and added that the decision was withdrawn only to motivate students. He said that students would be provided with additional training without stress, and a decision to conduct public examinations would be taken up later. He said the examination fees collected by teachers in private schools should be returned to the students as it is their duty to do so.

151,2020/02/05,"Opposition parties are misleading the public about CAA, NPR, says actor Rajinikanth","Actor Rajinikanth on Wednesday said that the Opposition parties were misleading the public about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Rajinikanth's comments come weeks after widespread protests broke out across India against the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Speaking to reporters, Rajinikanth said that the NPR “very essential”. “The Congress has done it in 2010 and also it was done in 2015. It needs to be done to identify those who are Indians/who are foreigners -- which country they are from. Shouldn’t we know this? It is very, very essential and it has to be done. I don’t know what problem others have with this,” he said.

Rajinikanth also cited the Central government’s assurances about the CAA -- that it would not affect Indian citizens in anyway. “It is about giving citizenships to people who have come from neighbouring countries. A big scare has been created that Muslims will be affected. How will it affect Indian Muslims? The Muslims in India decided to stay back here during Partition stating that India is their land and that they will live and die here. How can they be sent out? If something like that happens, I will be the first one to speak out,” he said.

Rajinikanth further said that a few political parties are instigating these protests for political gain. “Some religious gurus are also supporting these efforts. This is very wrong,” he said. He also appealed to the students who have been protesting across India to understand and comprehend the issues around CAA, NRC and NPR. “Please do proper research on the subject, ask your parents and professors about this issue and then protest. Otherwise, political leaders will use you. Nobody knows how police will react. If an FIR is lodged, then it will become an issue in your life,” he said.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/jmayzn/article30740867.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05FEBTH-RAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/opposition-parties-are-misleading-the-public-about-caa-npr-says-actor-rajinikanth/article30740868.ece

In his first reaction after the amendment to the Citizenship Act and nation wide protests against it, the top actor wondered as to how Muslims, who chose to stay back in India following partition will be sent out of the country.

“CAA is no threat to Muslims, if they face trouble I will be the first person to raise voice for them,” he told reporters here.

Besides, the central government has assured that Indian people will have no issues in view of the Citizenship Amendment Act, he noted.

Alleging that some political parties were instigating people against CAA for their selfish interests, he also blamed religious leaders for supporting protests against the law and dubbed it “very wrong.”

153,2020/02/05,"A year after TN rolled out solar policy, not much has happened say experts","A year after Tamil Nadu rolled out its Solar Energy Policy 2019, there is not much change on the ground, experts say.

The policy aimed at having an installed solar capacity of 9000 MW by 2023 in the State, with 40% coming from rooftop solar systems.

“The consumer-focused policy, aiming to achieve 3600 MW of rooftop solar, may still remain a dream given policy, regulatory and administrative hurdles,” Martin Scherfler, Co-Founder, Auroville Consulting said. He pointed out that one of the major pain points has been the tariff determined for rooftop solar systems.

In 2019, the Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) in its solar tariff order, had determined a net-feed in tariff (net exported energy after self-consumption) at ₹2.28 per unit. Consumers can also opt for gross feed-in for selling all the energy produced by the solar panel to the utility. The gross feed-in attracts a utility category tariff i.e. ₹3.04 per unit.

“The net feed in tariff for solar rooftops equates the cost of a single rooftop plant with a utility scale solar plant, covering hundreds of panels and enjoying considerable economies of scale, which is puzzling,” Mr. Scherfler said. This net feed-in tariff does not even cover 50% of the actual cost of solar rooftops. Further, this goes against the Policy 2019 where it specifically states that “solar energy gross and net feed-in tariffs will be determined by TNERC taking into consideration different capital costs based on the solar system capacity,” he added.

Raj Prabhu, CEO of Mercom Capital Group said Tamil Nadu was the third-largest State in solar installations in the country at the end of 2019, and renewables represent over 50% of the total installed power capacity in the State. “TN was one of the early adopters of solar in the country, but lately, momentum has stalled and support for solar has faded. Tamil Nadu has instead become known for curtailing solar power generation and delaying payments to developers. Nobody wants to develop any new projects in the State because of its reputation. Unless there is a complete turnaround in its approach to solar power development, it is likely to be surpassed by other States,” he added.

Mr. Scherfler said there is no accountability for the targets and no action has been taken yet since the policy has been announced.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/y0kdcr/article30740747.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05FEBTH--SOLAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/a-year-after-tn-rolled-out-solar-policy-not-much-has-happened-say-experts/article30740748.ece
154,2020/02/05,Consecration of Thanjavur’s Big Temple performed,"The consecration of Sri Brahadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur was performed on Wednesday with religious fervour and gaiety. Thousands of people converged to the town to witness the event at the 1,000-year-old historic temple.

Holy water, brought from the ‘yaga salai’ was poured on the gold-plated ‘kalasam’ atop the 216-feet high ‘vimanam’ over the sanctum sanctorum of Sri Brahadeeswarar, and on the towers over the sanctum sanctorums of Goddess Brahannayaki and other deities at around 9.20 a.m. Later, the granite idols of Peruvudaiyar (Brahadeeswarar), Periyanayaki (Brahannayaki) and other deities were sanctified with the holy water brought from the ‘yaga salai’, at around 9.45 a.m.

The ‘yaga pujas’ at the ‘yaga salai’, which commenced on Saturday evening, culminated on Wednesday with ‘mahapoornahuthi’ at around 7 a.m. following which the pots containing the holy water were taken in a procession to the respective sanctum sanctorums of the deities.

Though the Big Temple is a Saivaite temple, the procession of pots from the ‘yaga salai’ was taken out in the pattern in which such processions would be conducted in Vaishnavite temples, where Thamizh Divya Prabhantham reciting ‘goshti’ would lead the line-up. At the Big Temple, the ‘Othuvamoorthys’ led the procession from the ‘yaga salai’ to the sanctum sanctorums and the ‘vimanams’.

Apart from the Maratha Royal family members, led by the Prince, Babaji Rajah Bhonsle Chattrapathi, who witnessed the consecration from within the temple precincts, thousands of devotees witnessed the kumbhabishegam, held after 23 years, from within the temple complex and from the lawns surrounding the temple.

While the devotees and VIP pass-holders were allowed to enter the temple through the two mini-gates on the southern side of the temple, the VVIPs arrived at the enclosure put up for them on the northern side of the main shrine through the mini-gate on the northern side.

The suspects were planning to sell the rare variety of idols for ₹ 20 crore to prospective customers.

The Additional-Director General of Police, Idol Wing CID, Abhay Kumar Singh, said, “It is a major catch. Following information, a special team of police personnel led by Additional Superintendent of Police Rajaraman arrested the gang and recovered the antique idols which are huge in size.”

Plainclothesmen deployed decoys who approached a suspect, Vellaisamy, a quarry owner. He offered to sell the idol for ₹ 6 crore.

After much negotiation, the deal was struck for ₹ 3.5 crore. He showed them the idol in his custody. Then, the police team apprehended him.

Based on his confession, the police arrested Aravindh, 24, of R.S.Mangalam; Mathiyazhagan, 30, of Thodaiyur and Kumar, 29, of Lalgudi. The suspects are operators of earthmoving machines in the area.

156,2020/02/05,Sri Brahadeeswarar Temple: All set for consecration today,"The four Main Streets around the Palace and the roads leading to the Sri Brahadeeswarar Temple in the Old Town area wore a festive look on Tuesday ahead of the consecration scheduled for Wednesday.

Right from the morning, the Big Temple received a steady flow of devotees from the town and far-off places as several tourist groups have added Thanjavur among the places they planned to visit in view of the consecration.

The cloudy atmosphere over the town and the day-long recitation of Tamil hymns such as Thevaram, Thiruvasagam, Thirumurai and other Saivaite hymns by Othuvamoorthis at the Sri Natarajar Sannadhi in the temple precincts presented a perfect ambience for rituals.

A procession was taken out by ‘sivacharyars’ (the priests) from the temple precincts to the `yaga salai’ in the morning and the evening after performing the ‘visesha sandhi’. At the ‘yaga salai’, the wholehearted recitation of Tamil Vedams by Othuvamoorthis, hymns from Vedas by `sastrigals’ and playing of various `kirthanas’ in Nagaswaram vidwans supported by Thavil and other supporting artists, one by one, during the `kala pujas’ pepped up the religious fervour setting the stage for the `maha poornahuthi’ on Wednesday morning, to be performed at the `yaga salai’ to mark the culmination of `yaga salai pujas’.

After ‘maha poornahuthi,’ pots containing holy water will be taken in a procession from ‘yaga salai’ to the temple precincts for the consecration of towers and idols by 9-30 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

Events cancelled

Meanwhile, classical and folk dance programmes planned by the South Zone Cultural Centre (SSCC) in association with the Archaeological Survey of India at the Big Temple premises for Wednesday evening have been cancelled.

According to sources at SZCC, the organisers of the consecration directed the Centre to cancel all the programmes scheduled on the day of kumbabhishekam stating that they anticipate a large numbers of devotees.

Hence, it cancelled all the events, including a Bharathanatyam performance by Padma Subrahmanyam and Bhagavatha Mela Dance Drama, scheduled to take place near the Nandimandapam on the night of the consecration day.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ldvcgj/article30725351.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FEBTH-BIGTEMPLE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/all-set-for-big-temple-consecration-today/article30738116.ece
157,2020/02/05,Minister’s ‘associate’ moves HC against I-T proceedings,"Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar’s suspected associate R. Nainar Mohammed, 35, at whose residence the Income Tax sleuths reportedly found ₹3.03 crore in cash during the April 2017 R.K. Nagar bypoll campaign, has moved the Madras High Court challenging a tax demand of ₹2.12 crore along with interest, surcharge, cess and so on.

When the case was listed for admission before Justice Anita Sumanth on Tuesday, the judge directed the standing counsel for Income Tax A.P. Srinivas and A.N.R. Jaya Prathap to get instructions by Friday since the petitioner had accused the department of not having followed the procedures scrupulously before raising the tax demand.

According to the Assessment Order, for the year 2018-19, which had been challenged in the present proceedings, Mr. Mohammed was one of the members of Royapettah Stationery and Printing and Allied Product Producers Industrial Cooperative Society and he had been supplying stationery and printing materials to the government health department.

His residence at Triplicane High Road in Chennai was one of the many premises that were raided on April 7, 2017 on the basis of a search warrant obtained in the name of the Health Minister. The sleuths found ₹ 3.03 crore in cash and seized ₹2.94 crore.

The I-T officials also reportedly recovered loose sheets of paper containing details of election booth-wise expenses pertaining to the R.K. Nagar bypoll and issued notices to the petitioner.

In reply, the petitioner stated that he was not aware of the loose sheets of paper and claimed that they do not belong to him. In so far as the cash was concerned, the petitioner stated that he had filed income tax returns on August 18, 2018, disclosing a gross total income of ₹3.06 crore for the assessment year 2017-18 and paid ₹1.43 crore towards tax along with interest of ₹36.28 lakh. Similarly, he had filed returns for 2018-19 too on August 30, 2018.

In the return, he disclosed a gross total income of ₹1.49 crore and paid total tax of ₹ 53.80 lakh along with interest of ₹ 3.04 lakh. Nevertheless, stating that he had failed to submit evidences such as books of accounts to prove his income, the I-T officials went ahead with the proceedings under Section 153C of the Income Tax Act of 1961.

They held that the aggregate total income of the petitioner in 2018-19 should be assessed as ₹4.52 crore by adding up the figure mentioned in his own returns along with cash of ₹ 3.03 crore supposedly found at his residence. Though the tax for the amount worked out to ₹ 1.33 crore, they added surcharge, education cess and penalty to finally demand ₹ 2.12 crore in taxes.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/ministers-associate-moves-hc-against-i-t-proceedings/article30738042.ece
158,2020/02/05,"Amid controversy, Rajenthra Bhalaji ‘isolated’ within Cabinet","Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji, who is at the centre of a political controversy over his remarks that “Islamic terrorism” will fuel “Hindu terrorism” and that the murder of a BJP functionary in Tiruchi recently had a religious angle to it, appears to have been isolated within the State Cabinet.

Several Ministers are said to have told Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami that the continuance of Mr. Bhalaji as a Minister would not be desirable. Mr. Palaniswami is said to be keeping his cards close to his chest.

Mr. Bhalaji had recently stated that if the DMK “continues its support for Islamic terrorism and organisations that kill Hindus, nobody can stop Hindu terrorism”. The DMK has since written to Governor Banwarilal Purohit, seeking Mr. Bhalaji’s dismissal from the Cabinet — a demand endorsed by other parties, including the Congress.

‘Religious angle’

Also, on the issue of the BJP office-bearer’s murder, the Minister’s view contradicted the stand of the Tiruchi Commissioner of Police, V. Varadharaju, who had emphatically ruled out a communal angle to the incident and had attributed the crime to “personal enmity”. But the Minister has insisted on there being a “religious angle” to the murder.

We admitted him, and he is under observation at the isolation ward. He is stable. Depending on the symptoms, we will take a throat swab on Wednesday and send it for testing,” she said.

Meanwhile, addressing the media, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said 9 persons, including a four-member family from China, had tested negative for the novel coronavirus (nCoV). Throat and nasal swabs and blood samples from three more travellers from Wuhan were sent to the King Institute of Preventive Medicine, Guindy, for testing on Tuesday, and the results were expected in a day or two, he added. Of the 9 samples, four were sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, and five were tested at the King Institute, he said. The family from China is currently under observation at the government medical college hospital, Coimbatore.

“So far, the throat and nasal swabs and blood samples lifted from 21 persons have returned negative for coronavirus. There is no case of coronavirus in Tamil Nadu,” the Minister said.

With Kerala reporting three positive cases of nCoV and declaring it a State calamity, he said, “We are extremely cautious and are continuing our monitoring measures. We are taking adequate measures, including checks at the entry points along the border areas of Kerala and Tamil Nadu such as in Coimbatore and Theni.”

As per an advisory from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, a separate aerobridge for travellers from China and an exclusive screening team for them were in place at Chennai airport, he said.

Nela Talli Farmer Producer Company is located at Kohir mandal, in which as many as 1,006 farmers are members. Of them, 30 farmers are producing pulses under NPM.

The officials of the District Rural Development Agency (DRDO) have procured five quintals of raw pulses from the farmers and it was able to produce 3.9 quintals of fine pluses. Both red gram and green gram pulses are being sold in half kilogram and kilogram packets. Red gram is being sold for ₹ 95 per kilogram followed by green gram ₹ 120 per kilogram. The response from the public is satisfactory.

However, these pulses are yet to be certified by any agency. It would take some more time though these pulses are grown under NPM. “We are at the beginning stage and it would take some time to involve more farmers in this activity. Once the farm produce levels increase we will take up that activity as well,” said Ch. Sridevi, Assistant Project Manager (APM), Farmers Producers Organisations, Sangareddy.

There are 119 Farmers Producers Groups (FPG) in the district and only one Nela Talli Farmer Producer Company was created in the district in which 58 FPG groups are members. Though about ₹ 50 lakh was released to do business under the Nela Talli FPC, the business could not develop to the expected level and the reasons cited were lack of coordination at State and district level. The FPC has been procuring fertilizers from the market and selling it to farmers. Likewise it has been procuring red gram and green gram from farmers and selling them in the market.

“We have no clear instructions on how to proceed. Market sources were also clearly identified. We cannot take decisions on our own.

167,2020/02/05,Medaram jatara gets under way,"The biennial Sammakka-Sarakka jatara got underway here on Wednesday evening with the arrival of tribal deity Sarakka from Kannepalli village, six km from Medaram village.

A group of tribal priests huddled into the small temple in the village and offered prayers for over two hours before they finally came out carrying the deity – a bamboo pole wrapped with a red cloth and a casket of vermilion. As the priests came out, hundreds of devotees jostled and vied with each other to touch the priests while many women rolled on the ground with wet clothes wishing the priests to walk over them. Touching the priest carrying the deity is considered lucky by many devout.

However, the posse of police and rope parties kept the surging crowds at bay, allowing the priests to proceed towards Medaram. They virtually sprinted their way and waded through waist-deep waters of Jampanna rivulet before entering Medaram village.

Devotees who were having a holy dip before proceeding to the altar also rushed towards priests carrying Sarakka deity thus creating mild chaos.

The priests and policemen had a tough time reaching the venue as they had to avoid the crowd that were trying to get near and touch the priests. The procession that began around 7 pm reached the altar at Medaram village around 9 pm.

ITDA project officer V Chakradhar Rao and additional SP K Dakshinamurthy and other officials accompanied by the tribal priests from Kannepalli to Medaram as was the custom on behalf of the State.

The lanes and bylanes from surrounding villages leading to Medaram were packed to the full. People pushed their way towards the village and they were all herded into the barricades around the altar by the police and revenue officials on duty.

Mulugu district collector V Karnan and Superintendent of Police SSG Patil were seen moving all over the pathways leading to the altar in the village regulating and overseeing the swarming devotees.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/dftapv/article30745896.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY06MEDARAMYATRA1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/medaram-jatara-gets-under-way/article30744860.ece
168,2020/02/05,Wild cat sighting suspected in Kanagal,"A team of forest officials from Nalgonda clicked pictures of animal footprints, suspected to be those of a wild cat, following a petition by triple-riding youths here on Wednesday.

Konda Mahesh, a resident of Kanagal, who was riding the motorcycle on his way from Ammuguda to Kanagal, claimed that he and his two friends saw a tiger cross the road near Bommepally stage. They sped away from the place and approached sub-inspector Satish Reddy. They said the sighting was at about 6 a.m.

The police soon passed on the information to Nalgonda Forest Divisional Officer and a team reached the site by 7.30 a.m., to ascertain the situation.

According to Forest Section Officer Nagaiah and Beat Officer Sowjanya, the description given by the youths portray a leopard. However, the many footprints near the Bommepally stage suggest the animal could be a hyena, they said.

“This place has never seen such wild cats. We have collected and submitted enough field material to the Range and District Forest Officer, who would confirm of the sighting soon,” Mr. Nagaiah said.

Meanwhile, Forest and police officials said the surrounding villages were alerted of a suspected wild animal to be loitering in the region, and advised residents to keep indoors during night and travel in groups in the day.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/wild-cat-sighting-suspected-in-kanagal/article30744790.ece
169,2020/02/05,Khammam PACS ready for polls on Feb. 15,"An estimated 1,51,622 members of the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Societies (PACSs) are expected to exercise their right to franchise in the cooperative polls for as many as 76 PACSs in the district scheduled to be held on February 15.

The final list of the electors has been prepared two days ago after deleting the names of some ineligible members comprising several ‘defaulting farmers’ for non-payment of loans, sources said.

The nomination filing process for the co-operative elections is slated to begin on Thursday. Elated over its recent victory in the municipal elections, an upbeat TRS is keen on continuing its winning spree to hold sway over the PACSs, which form the crux of the three-tier cooperative credit structure.

Eyeing to capture the reins of administration of the coveted District Cooperative Central Bank (DCCB), the ruling party local leaders are drawing up poll strategies to win an overwhelming number of the PACSs at the hustings.

The main Opposition Congress party is exploring all options to strike an alliance with the CPI (M) and the TDP to put up a tough fight against the ruling TRS to win a maximum number of PACSs and revive its past glory among the cooperative societies.

172,2020/02/05,IIT-H finds molecule to treat rare neurodegenerative disease,"Researchers of the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad (IIT-H) have found a molecule called “AIM4” that can help in the treatment of a rare and debilitating neurodegenerative disease called “Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis” (ALS) also known as “Lou Gehrig’s disease”.

ALS is a neurodegenerative disorder that severely affects voluntary movement of muscles and can lead to paralysis and death. It occurs due to changes in specific genes, which may be triggered by factors such as smoking, exposure to toxins, metals and pesticides.

The results of this research, performed by a team led by Basant Kumar Patel, Sandeep Singh and Rajakumara Eerappa, faculty from the Department of Biotechnology, IIT-H, and Ganesan Prabushankar from the Department of Chemistry, were recently published in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Biological Macromolecules.

The paper has been co-authored by these scientists along with research scholars Amandeep Girdhar, Vidhya Bharathi, Vikas Ramyagya Tiwari, Suman Abhishek, Waghela Deeksha, Usha Saraswat Mahawar and Gembali Raju.

Currently, no drugs are available to cure ALS. The treatment options are limited to two drugs only to manage the condition. Research is ongoing throughout the world to find better drugs that can arrest this disorder and not merely manage the symptoms. Such a research must first identify the causes for the onset of ALS.

“One of the causes of ALS is alterations in genes that code for a critical protein called TDP-43. The gene alteration modifies the protein, which results in its liquid-liquid phase separation. This phase separation in turn causes proteins to be deposited on nerve cells, resulting in neurodegeneration,” said Basant Kumar Patel, associate professor.

In 2016, Dr. Patel and Prof. G. Prabushankar found a small molecule called AIM4, which seemed to be better than the other related molecules that have been studied all around the world, in its ability to inhibit abnormal aggregation of TDP-43 in vitro ALS disease model systems.

Armed with this knowledge, IIT-H scientists proceeded to analyse this molecule and study its action on TDP-43, to predict how it would potentially inhibit the deposition of protein in nerve cells.

Dr. Patel added, “We have shown that AIM4 prevents liquid-liquid phase separation of the modified protein, TDP-43-A315T. By this, AIM4 prevents aggregation of the protein and may potentially prevent the deposition on neurons.”

The research group compared the ability of AIM4 to prevent protein phase separation with that of other molecules like Dimebon. Dimebon is an antihistamine that was studied for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders by an American pharmaceutical company but failed clinical trials.

The IIT-H research team found that AIM4 was better than earlier molecules in preventing protein phase separation.

The research team also discovered through computational studies that AIM4 has specific binding site on this protein and binding energy calculations have shown that the bond between AIM4 and the mutant protein is energetically favourable, which makes it a promising drug for potential treatment of ALS.

“This work is an important step towards an area of therapeutics of the neurodegenerative disease, ALS, as current options for ALS are minimal or even non-existent,” said Dr. Patel.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/6z93zw/article30745870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYD-IIT-H,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/iit-h-finds-molecule-to-treat-rare-neurodegenerative-disease/article30743754.ece

176,2020/02/05,NRI teen sponsors snacks for govt. school students in Khammam,"Setting an example, a handful of proactive elected representatives of the local bodies in Kalluru mandal are playing a catalyst role in encouraging philanthropists and NRIs to sponsor evening snacks for SSC students of State-run schools attending special classes for the upcoming SSC exams.

The school education department has laid renewed focus on the ongoing special classes to achieve cent percent results in the exams scheduled to be held from March 19 to April 6.

The district secured a pass percentage of 92.45 in SSC exams last year.

A host of donors, including a few NRIs, have donated money in various mandals to provide evening snacks to the SSC students to boost their energy levels and enable them to prepare well for the exams. The voluntary efforts assumed significance in the backdrop of absence of fund allocation by the government for provision of evening snacks.

Katta Anjali from Kalluru, who is presently studying tenth grade in the US, donated her accumulated pocket money of ₹1.63 lakh for the purpose in her native mandal after being apprised of the inability of poor parents to afford evening snacks, by Kalluru ZPTC member Katta Ajay, a close relative of hers, sources said. The money was handed over to District Educational Officer P. Madan Mohan in the presence of Sattupalli MLA Sandra Venkata Veeraiah last week.

Several donors also mobilised ₹7.5 lakh through voluntary contributions in all five mandals, including Kalluru, in Sattupalli constituency, said Mr Madan Mohan.

Many others have come forward to support the cause of SSC students in Khammam and other divisions. The special classes will be held daily from 4.30 p.m. to 5.45 p.m. till the SSC exams, the DEO added.

“We have been providing evening snacks such as lemon rice and tomato bhaat to as many as 75 SSC students in our school for the past 50 days,” said G. Rajasekhar, headmaster of the Zilla Parishad High School at Tanikella in Konijerla mandal.

Teachers and some parents have also become active partners in this initiative.

“It is imperative to serve evening snacks to SSC students, who stay back in the school after the regular classes, to overcome tiredness and focus on studies,” said Telangana State Untied Teachers’ Federation district president G.V. Nagamalleswara Rao, adding that the government should earmark separate funds to provide nutrient-rich evening snacks to the students in all State-run schools.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/q9zszu/article30737624.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04-KHM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nri-teen-sponsors-snacks-for-govt-school-students-in-khammam/article30737625.ece
177,2020/02/05,Tokyo Olympics CEO: I’m seriously worried over China virus,"Tokyo Olympics organisers on Wednesday said they are increasingly concerned about the disruption the fast-spreading virus in China is causing ahead of the games, which open in just under six months.

Chief Executive Officer Toshiro Muto sounded a grave note speaking at a meeting with officials of the International Paralympic Committee.

“I am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the games,” Mr. Muto said, speaking in Japanese.

“I hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible.”

Saburo Kawabuchi, the mayor of the Athletes Village where 11,000 Olympians will stay, showed his apprehension.

“I truly hope that the infectious disease will die down somehow so that we will be able to operate the Paralympics and Olympics smoothly,” he said.

“In the worst case — we will do our utmost for the athletes so that they will be able to concentrate on performing their best.”

Tokyo organisers have repeatedly said there are no plans to cancel the Olympics. That position has been repeated by the Switzerland-based International Olympic Committee.

But the problems deepen with each passing day. Some Olympic qualifying events have been cancelled, or relocated. Travel restrictions will add more confusion, and travelling fans are sure to be fearful.

Japan has not reported any deaths from the virus. But deaths in mainland China rose to 490 on Wednesday.

“In Japan, we are facing all sorts of problems including coronavirus infections, cyber security and transportation systems,” Toshiaki Endo, an organising committee vice president, said on Tuesday at a news conference.

“The IOC is satisfied with our preparations,” he added.

Craig Spence, a spokesman for the Paralympic committee, tried to be reassuring.

“We have full confidence that the relevant authorities, in particular here in Japan and the World Health Organization, will take all the necessary measures to address the situation.”

Japanese Prime Minister Shino Abe was asked Monday in the national legislature about the viral outbreak and the impact on the Olympics. He brushed aside worries.

But Yurkio Koike, the government of Tokyo, sounded more concerned in recent comments.

“We must firmly tackle the new coronavirus to contain it, or we are going to regret it,” she said.",sport,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/g0p2ec/article30740670.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05TOKYO2020OLYMPICSCANNABIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tokyo-olympics-ceo-im-seriously-worried-over-china-virus/article30740671.ece

183,2020/02/05,Swine flu detected in Manipur as Myanmar border markets screen for nCoV,"Swine flu or H1N1 was detected in two people during the precautionary screening for the novel coronavirus (nCoV) in Manipur.

The State’s Directorate of Health has said the two who returned from China have tested positive for swine flu. They were screened for nCoV and their samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.

“We received confirmation from the Pune laboratory that the two from Imphal West district contracted swine flu. But there is no need to panic as they are stable after suffering from mild flu,” Manipur’s Health Director K. Rajo said.

Health officials said the duo – a man and his sister – was being given proper treatment and medication while the other members of their family were being tested for possible contagion. Steps have also been taken to ensure the disease did not spread, they added.

Swine flu was first reported in Manipur in 2010. Five of the 17 people detected with the virus over the years till 2019 died. “We have medicines available for swine flu, but none for the novel coronavirus,” said an official at Imphal’s Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences.

Districts in the north-eastern States along the border with China and Myanmar have stepped up screening at border markets to check the entry of people who might carry the nCoV.

Apart from the geographically-isolated Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh shares a 1,080-km border with China. Arunachal Pradesh also shares a part of India’s 1,624-km border with Myanmar.

The other States on the India-Myanmar border are Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram.

Screening in Mizoram

On Monday, Mizoram became the last of the States bordering Myanmar to install nCoV screening counter and station a rapid response force at Zokhawthar, the border trade point in Champhai district.

“We are screening traders and travellers to and from Myanmar based on their health status and travel history,” said Samuel Laldinthara, the medical officer heading the screening team.

Myanmar officials and health specialists had been screening visitors from Mizoram from January 27. They have been similarly screening people at other border trade points such as Moreh (Manipur).

Mr. Lone, arrested during the clampdown launched on August 5 as the Centre revoked J&K’s Special Status, was shifted to his official residence in Srinagar. “On reaching his official home, Mr. Lone continues to remain under house detention,” a PC spokesman said.

Mr. Parra, who is close to incarcerated PDP president Mehbooba Mufti, has also been shifted to his residence and “would remain under house arrest”.

The fresh release brings the number of detained politicians to 14 in the MLA Hostel, designated as a Sub-Jail. Over 40 regional leaders were placed inside the MLA Hostel in November.

Sources said another batch of senior leaders from the PDP and NC may also be released in the coming days.

No review

However, there has been no review of the cases of the three detained former chief ministers — NC’s Dr. Farooq Abdullah and Omar Abdullah, and the PDP’s Mehbooba Mufti — so far.

“Dr. Abdullah and Omar Abdullah have all along worked towards strengthening democracy and sustaining peace in J&K. The need is to restore political activities. The Centre should take steps for releasing Dr. Abdullah, Mr. Omar and Ms. Mufti. A massive reach to win over the hearts and minds of the people will only herald a new era of peace in J&K,” said Provincial President Mr Devender Singh Rana said.

Valley shutdown

Meanwhile, a spontaneous shutdown was observed in parts of the Kashmir valley on Wednesday, coinciding with the passing of resolutions by the United Nations on Kashmir in 1957.

185,2020/02/05,"ULFA, Naga groups hold ‘solidarity meeting’","State-specific extremist groups have begun peace parleys alongside the Centre’s push for resolving decades-old conflicts in the northeast.

On Tuesday, members of the Working Committee of the Naga National Political Groups (NNPGs) held a “solidarity meeting” with leaders of the pro-talks United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) in Guwahati toward peaceful co-existence.

The NNPGs, in talks with Delhi since 2017, comprise the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Unification), the NSCN (Reformation), the NSCN (Khango), the Naga National Council and two of its factions, and the Federal Government of Nagaland.

Leaders of the NNPGs and the ULFA said the meeting for “appreciating each other’s ongoing peace process” was significant given the history of inter-State boundary disputes and apprehensions that the final solution to the Naga political problem could lead to Assam losing large swathes of land for a “Naga-administered sub-region”.

Unification of all Naga-inhabited areas beyond Nagaland has been a long-term demand of the Isak-Muivah faction of the NSCN, or NSCN-IM, the largest and strongest group in the peace process that has continued since August 1997.

“We have the common goal of taking the region forward while protecting our identity and culture. We appreciated each other’s peace process with New Delhi and hoped that an early inclusive agreement (with the Naga groups) would be inked fulfilling the aspirations of the indigenous people of Assam,” ULFA general secretary Anup Chetia said on Wednesday.

“The two sides also agreed to maintain constant interactions and ensure continuity of dialogue, besides maintaining, preserving and promoting fraternal relationship in the future,” said N. Kitovi Zhimomi, the convenor of the Working Committee of the NNPGs.

186,2020/02/05,5 acres given for building mosque is in Ayodhya’s Dhannipur village,"The five acres allotted to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board for building a mosque following the Supreme Court verdict in Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi title suit will be in Dhannipur village in Sohawal tehsil of Ayodhya, around 25 km from the site where the Babri Masjid once stood.

The land is 18 km from the district headquarters on the Lucknow State highway, the Uttar Pradesh government said after a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

The State had sent a proposal with three alternative sites to the Centre and one was selected, State Cabinet Minister Shrikant Sharma said.

“This is a suitable location in Ayodhya in many ways,” said Mr. Sharma. This would prove to be a suitable location from the perspective of transportation, road connectivity, public facilities, communal harmony, public order and law and order, he added.

Cief executive officer of the Waqf Board Syed Shoeb said they were yet to receive a formal order from the government. Whether the Board accepts the site or not could be decided at its meeting scheduled on February 24. “It was earlier scheduled for February 12 but due to certain reasons, it had to be postponed. It depends on the chairman if he keeps it in the agenda,” Mr. Shoeb told The Hindu.

The issue of alternate land for a mosque in Ayodhya was, however, not yet included in the formal agenda of the next meeting, he said.

At a meeting in November 2019 after the apex court declared its verdict, the Board announced it was still undecided on whether to accept the five acres allotted to it, and reiterated that it would not go in for any review of the order.

Six out of seven members of the Board present at the meeting voted in favour of the decision to not challenge the court ruling.

‘Against principles of Islam’

Abdur Razzaque Khan, who was the lone dissenting member then, said on Wednesday that Muslims should not accept the 5-acres as it “goes against the principles of Islam.”

“In Islam, a mosque should be built by Muslims on a land purchased by them or a mosque should be built where the earlier one stood,” he said.

Haji Mehboob, one of the litigants in the long-drawn case, also rejected the land. He felt the location, though having Muslim population, was too far from Ayodhya town. “We have already said we don't want the land. Plus, the site is pretty far, 25 km outside of Ayodhya. Who will keep a watch over it?”, he said.

Mr. Mehboob, who lives in the vicinity of the Ram Janmabhoomi police station, said if the government offered Muslims land close to Ayodhya, where once mosques stood, they could think about it. “But this [Dhannipur], there is no question”, he said. “We are not beggars asking the government land for building a mosque”.

187,2020/02/05,"Two militants, CRPF jawan killed in Srinagar encounter","Two militants and one CRPF jawan were killed in an encounter on the outskirts of Srinagar on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, police have warned that virtual private networks (VPNs) were being misused by militants in Kashmir after the restoration of 2G mobile service.

“Two terrorists were killed on the Srinagar-Baramulla road after they fired at the police and the CRPF party deployed there. Security forces had prior information about the movement of militants passing through the area,” Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said.

Fired at checkpoint

The incident took place around 11:45 a.m. when militants fired upon a joint checkpoint of the CRPF and the police at Lawaypora on the Srinagar highway. Constable Ramesh Rajan of CRPF’s 73 Battalion died in the exchange of fire. The attackers were believed to have come on a two-wheeler.

Police identified the slain militants as Khateeb Ahmad Dass from Anantnag’s Bijbehara and Zia u Rehman Wani from Budgam’s Aarath areas. “Dass was brother-in-law of slain terrorist Mugees Mir of Parimpora. Affiliated to the Hizbul Mujahideen, Dass had been part of groups involved in carrying out terror attacks in south Kashmir,” the police said.

Another slain militant, Zia u Rehman Wani, was affiliated to the Lashkar-e-Taiba. “Wani was involved in carrying out attacks on guard posts, security deployments and several other grenade attacks since 2018. He also figures in a case pertaining to decamping of weapons from the residential guard post of erstwhile Congress MLC Muzaffar Parray at Jawahar Nagar, Srinagar,” the police said.

Incriminating materials, including arms and ammunition, was recovered from the terrorists, said the police.

Police said they were ascertaining the identity of the injured person during the cross-fire. Earlier, the DGP said the injured was a militant. However, a family from Srinagar contested the police claim and said he was a civilian and “ran a shop near the encounter site.”

20 killed so far

According to the DGP, 20 militants were killed this year so far in Kashmir. He expressed the hope to “witness a peaceful summer this year.”

He, however, warned that militants were misusing the VPNs, which allowed locals to access social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc.

“The driver of the truck [which was involved in the Nagrota toll plaza encounter on January 31] first clicked the photograph of encounter and sent it to Pakistan as an evidence that they have been intercepted. Such use and misuse is happening,” said Mr. Singh.

Coordination among ultras

He said militant modules were now working in coordination with one another to conduct subversive activities and were equipped with latest ammunition and gadgetry.

“We have busted several modules of terrorists last month but the grenade attack at Lal Chowk shows that there are some remnants. We will get them soon,” the DGP added.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/wx19ug/article30745150.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH06SRINAGARSHOOOTOUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/militants-crpf-jawan-dead-in-gunbattle-outside-srinagar/article30741256.ece
188,2020/02/05,Wardha teacher set ablaze by stalker critical,"The State government on Tuesday flew a burns specialist doctor to Nagpur, where a college teacher from Wardha district who was set on fire by a stalker is battling for life.

Home Minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted that Sunil Keswani, a specialist from the Navi Mumbai-based National Burns Centre, was accompanying him to Nagpur to supervise the treatment of the victim.

Meanwhile, residents of Hinganghat and Samudrapur in Wardha took out a protest march, demanding death penalty for the accused, Vikesh Nagrale (27). Around 7,000 people, including members of political parties, women and college students, marched from Nanduri Chowk to Ambedkar Square in Wardha town, also seeking a fast-track trial.

A few demonstrators even demanded that the accused be “handed over to the public for ten minutes”, an official said. Residents of Hinganghat town and neighbouring areas also called for a shutdown.

Mr. Nagrale allegedly set Ankita Pisudde (25) ablaze at Hinganghat town on Monday morning while she was on her way to college. She is being treated at Orange City Hospital in Nagpur, where doctors said her condition was “very critical”.

“At present, her condition is still very critical,” a medical bulletin issued by the hospital said, adding she was on oxygen support. “In view of her very critical condition, prognosis has been repeatedly explained to relatives and police personnel,” the bulletin said.

Wardha’s Guardian Minister Sunil Kedar and Hinganghat BJP MLA Samir Kunnawar visited the hospital on Tuesday.

Mr. Deshmukh said the incident was a “blot on humanity”. “The case will be tried in a fast-track court and the accused would be punished severely,” he tweeted.

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray asked the police to ensure that the accused was convicted. Mr. Thackeray took a serious note of the incident, a statement from his office said, adding the expenses of the woman’s treatment would be borne from the Chief Minister’s Medical Assistance Fund.

191,2020/02/05,Recovery of lost Kishore Kumar film has buffs agog,"For decades, collectors of rare Indian film memorabilia and, particularly, aficionados of the music of legendary Bollywood composer duo of Shanker-Jaikishan, have been doggedly searching for prints of a “lost” 1957 film starring Kishore Kumar, which uniquely featured a song picturised on Jaikishan himself.

For Indian film cineastes, the haunting melody ‘Ae Pyase Dil Bezubaan’ from the film Begunah, sung by the great Mukesh, had Jaikishan playing the piano in the song sequence. It was considered the ‘Holy Grail’ of rare collectibles as it was believed that prints of the film did not exist any more.

Serendipity

Now, in a fortunate stroke of serendipity, the Pune-based National Film Archive of India (NFAI) has come into possession of two 16 mm reels of Begunah, totalling around 60 minutes of the film’s footage but more vitally, has the iconic song picturised on Jaikishan.

Of all hard-to-find Indian film items, Begunah has a particularly interesting history as it was a knock-off of a 1954 Hollywood film from Paramount Pictures titled Knock on Wood, starring famous comedian-musician Danny Kaye.

NFAI Director Prakash Magdum with 16 mm reels of the 'lost' Hindi film Begunah, whose prints were allegedly destroyed by a court order in 1957.

A little more than a week after its release, Paramount Pictures got wind of the Hindi rip-off and allegedly filed a copyright suit in a Mumbai court. The court, with alacrity, then directed all prints of the Hindi film to be destroyed.

“While it may have been the Mumbai Metropolitan Court, we do not exactly know in which Mumbai court the copyright suit was allegedly filed by Paramount. The court directed all prints of Begunah to be destroyed on grounds of plagiarism. The film is especially interesting as it features Kishore Kumar, who was a darling of Indian film distributors in his acting heyday, and most fascinatingly, the famous song sung by Mukesh ‘Ae Pyase Dil Bezubaan’ and picturised on maestro Jaikishan marks his only substantial appearance in any movie,” said NFAI director Prakash Magdum, speaking to The Hindu.

Unique song

He said that the uniqueness of the song had prompted a veritable “treasure hunt” among die-hard Shanker-Jaikishan fans for any surviving prints of Begunah.

“I had been approached by several collectors and Indian cinema enthusiasts who firmly believed that rare prints of Begunah still existed. Until this thrilling acquisition, we had nothing save a few stills of the film, including one still of that song,” Mr. Magdum said.

Commenting on the fortuitous discovery, he said the NFAI had several enthusiasts across India who helped it source content of rare archival value.

“It was one such contact in Mumbai who gave us the two reels of Begunah, which contains around 60-70 minutes of the film with no title credits, but has the classic song. This is an important discovery and we believe that this is piece of history that must be preserved as part of our cinematic heritage,” Mr. Magdum said.

Talking about the genesis of the song in Begunah, Sandeep Apte, a city-based researcher and writer currently working on a web series on Shanker-Jaikishan, said that it was notable as it was not sung by Kishore Kumar in a film which starred him, and incidentally also featured a memorable Kishore number, ‘Aaj Na Jaane Pagal Manwa’.

‘Final word’

“What transpired was that Mukesh was in need of money and approached Shankar, who was incidentally in the process of composing the tune. Shankar got his collaborator and friend, the renowned Shailendra, to write the lyrics and called the film’s producer Mahipatray Shah to say the song, which would be sung by Mukesh, would be picturised on Jaikishan. The idea startled Shah, who feared that the song had no relation to the film. But in the late 1950s, Shanker-Jaikishan practically ruled the Indian film music world and Shanker’s word was final,” Mr. Apte said, remarking that Sheila Vaz’s dancing was another major highlight of the song.

He further said that the severity of the court’s judgement was ironic as Kishore Kumar used to idolise Danny Kaye, even keeping a picture of the entertainer among a gallery of cinema and literary luminaries at his residence.

While Knock on Wood was a typical vehicle for Kaye, whose talents were better showcased in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (1947) and The Inspector General (1949), the Hindi version was considerably more interesting for its astonishing confluence of talents.

Besides Kishore Kumar starring in a tailor-made role, the film had songs by Manna Dey, Mukesh, Lata Mangeshkar and Kishore himself, with lyrics by Shailendra and Hasrat Jaipuri and the “plagiarised” story written by none other than the colourful I.S. Johar.

‘A highlight’

“The song featuring Jaikishan must have been marketed as a highlight of Begunah. These are historic artefacts, which need to be preserved, and Begunah is a particularly unusual case in that a film starring Kishore Kumar as the hero has a classic song sung by Mukesh and picturised on Jaikishan,” said Mr. Apte, remarking that he felt a frisson of excitement on learning that the NFAI had finally acquired footage of the lost film.

“The Kishore Kumar of the 1950s is often bracketed with S.D. Burman, but what many are unaware of is the deep relationship that the singer-actor shared with Shanker-Jaikishan, who scored six of the films he starred in. A classic example is the song ‘Nakhrewaali’ from the 1956 film New Delhi,” observed Mr. Apte, remarking that Begunah was a film as important for Kishore Kumar fans as it was for Shanker-Jaikishan aficionados.

Speaking on the prickly legal issues that have dogged Begunah since its release, Mr. Magdum said that the NFAI’s stand was very clear on the matter and that the reels of film must be preserved for educational use as the archive believed it to be a part of cinematic history.

‘No commercial motive’

“There is no commercial motive involved in preserving these reels. Following their discovery, the NFAI has written to the Mumbai High Court asking if they could source a copy of the original court judgement. However, the High Court wrote back to us demanding additional details, which we are not aware of. I have, through several lawyers working on film and copyright issues, also attempted to get hold of a copy of the judgment, but we have not found anything till date. Even then, we have alerted the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and Paramount Pictures, of the same,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/yndqf6/article30736857.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200204-WA0078,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/recovery-of-lost-kishore-kumar-film-has-buffs-agog/article30736858.ece
192,2020/02/05,Maharashtra tops list of States hit by global medical data leak,"Medical details of over 120 million Indian patients have been leaked and made freely available on the Internet, according to a recent report published by Greenbone Sustainable Resilience, a German cybersecurity firm.

What is even more worrying is that the number of data troves containing this sensitive data went up by a significant number in the Indian context a month after Greenbone’s initial report was published. The updated report also places Maharashtra at the top of the States affected by the leak.

The first report was published in October last year, in which Greenbone revealed a widespread data leak of a massive number of records, including images of CT scans, X-rays, MRIs and even pictures of the patients.

The follow-up report, which was published in November, classifies countries in the “good”, “bad” and “ugly” categories based on the action taken by their governments after the first report was made public. India ranks second in the “ugly” category, after the U.S.

The report says that in 60 days after the first report was put out, the number of data troves bearing the patients’ information went up from 6,27,000 to 1.01 million, and that the images of patients’ details rose from 105 million to 121 million.

“It is a notable fact for the systems located in India, that almost 100% of the studies (data troves) allow full access to related images,” the report states.

As per the follow-up report, Maharashtra ranks the highest in terms of the number of data troves available online, with 3,08,451 troves offering access to 6,97,89,685 images. The next is Karnataka, with 1,82,865 data troves giving access to 1,37,31,001 images.

“The leak is worrying because the affected patients can include anyone from the common working man to politicians and celebrities. In image-driven fields like politics or entertainment, knowledge about certain ailments faced by people from these fields could deal a huge blow to their image. The other concern is of fake identities being created using the details, which can be misused in any possible number of ways,” a Maharashtra cybersecurity officer said.

Medico-legal expert Lalit Kapoor said any communication between a doctor and a patient was privileged one. “A doctor or a hospital is thus ethically, legally and morally bound to maintain confidentiality,” he said.

PACS servers

Greenbone’s original report says the leak was facilitated by the fact that the Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) servers, where these details are stored, are not secure and linked to the public Internet without any protection, making them easily accessible to malicious elements.

“The fact that PACS servers are vulnerable to attack or are accessible is not new information, and there have been a number of reports on this topic in the past. No report, however, has dealt with the breadth and depth of the problem associated with unsecured PACS servers,” the report states.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/czqutv/article30740313.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05MEDICAL-DATA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/maharashtra-tops-list-of-states-hit-by-global-medical-data-leak/article30737743.ece

195,2020/02/05,Surrendered militants may enter Assam politics,"Leaders of the factions of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) may contest in the coming elections in Assam, along with the other signatories to the Bodo peace accord.

The signatories are expected to hold a convention in Kokrajhar, the headquarters of the Bodoland Territorial Council, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on February 7 for celebrating the signing of the accord.

Some 2,850 members of the four NDFB factions are likely to lay down arms before Mr. Modi.

This would follow the ceremonial surrender of 1,615 members on January 30 by these members.

“People want us to take the responsibility of the BTC administration and, like the government, ensure that the clauses of the accord are implemented. We are thus thinking in terms of joining politics,” said Promod Boro, president of the All Bodo Students’ Union (ABSU), one of the signatories to the accord.

Mr. Boro, however, did not spell out whether the NDFB, the ABSU and other organisations would form a party to take on the Bodoland People’s Front, which has been ruling the BTC since 2003 and is an ally of the BJP.

The elections to the BTC are expected by April.

New party

Most of the BPF leaders were members of the disbanded Bodo Liberation Tigers that rivalled the NDFB for space during its extremist phase.

If the ABSU takes the lead in forming a party, it will steal a march over the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) that has been toying with the idea of a “political alternative” to BJP, its regional ally Asom Gana Parishad and the Congress.

The AASU and its affiliates have held these parties responsible for letting the “anti-Assam” Citizenship (Amendment) Act happen.

197,2020/02/05,Kerala just about keeps hopes alive,"A beleaguered Kerala enjoyed one of its best days of the season at the VCA Stadium here on Wednesday. It was one of those rare days when it managed to lose just three wickets despite batting for two sessions.

The visitors finished the second day at 191 for three, chasing Vidarbha’s first innings total of 326. They have to thank their wicket-keeping opener Mohammed Azharuddeen largely for that healthy score.

He, however, would not be too pleased: he was out for 81 (98b, 9x4, 2x6), when a second First Class hundred looked a possibility. He put on 70 for the first wicket with skipper Jalaj Saxena and 69 for the third with Rohan Prem.

Though Kerala lost the wickets of Azharuddeen and Rohan in successive overs — both at 139 — Sachin Baby and Akshay Chandran, who was promoted up the order, took the team to safety. They have so far added 52 for the unbroken fourth wicket.

The fate of the match could very well depend on how the duo, and the rest of the batsmen, negotiate the opening session on Thursday morning. Kerala just cannot afford to concede the first innings lead and settle for one point if it wants to keep its hopes of remaining in Groups A and B.

Earlier, the host resumed its first innings at 239 for six. A stunning counterattack by Darshan Nalkande, who came in at No. 10, helped Vidarbha post a decent total.

His unbeaten 66 came off just 65 balls (7x4, 3x6). He put on 57 for the last wicket with Aditya Takare, whose contribution was four runs.

For Kerala, M.D. Nidheesh bowled his heart out to take five for 82. It was his third five-wicket haul in First Class cricket and second of the season.

The scores: Vidarbha – 1st innings: Faiz Fazal c Azharuddeen b Nidheesh 10, Aniruddha Choudhari c Vinoop b Basil 0, Wasim Jaffer c Azharuddeen b Vinoop 57, G.

198,2020/02/05,Jackson gives Saurashtra the upper hand,"Sheldon Jackson (85, 151b, 10x4, 1x6) and his twin partnerships with stand-in captain Arpit Vasavada (46, 77b, 7x4) and all-rounder Chirag Jani (45 n.o., 101b, 5x4, 1x6) ensured Saurashtra held the upper hand on a gripping day at the SCA stadium.

Thanks to Jackson’s solid knock and his 82-run and 66-run association with Vasavada and Jani for the fourth and sixth wicket respectively, Saurashtra ended day two of the Ranji Trophy Group B tie at 257/6 on Wednesday, five runs shy of Mumbai’s 262.

With the second new ball just one over old, Mumbai will rely on the pace duo of Royston Dias and Tushar Deshpande — both of whom were impressive — to fold up Saurashtra’s first innings quickly on Thursday.

Had it not been for Jackson’s resolute knock, Mumbai could well have tightened its grip despite adding just 13 to its overnight total of 249/8. When Jackson walked out to bat in the 22nd over, Saurashtra was 64/2 and offie Shashank Attarde was in the middle of a virtuous spell.

Spot of bother

Having enticed opener Harvik Desai into a return catch after beating him and Divyaraj Chauhan several times, Attarde soon bowled Chauhan through the gate with one that pitched and turned in sharply. At 77/3 at lunch, Saurashtra was in a spot of bother.

But Jackson and Vasavada showed their wealth of experience to not let either Attarde or left-arm spinn duo of Shams Mulani and Vinayak Bhoir settle into rhythm. It forced Mumbai captain Aditya Tare to reintroduce pace and eventually it was Dias who got one to jag back in on Vasavada and trapped him leg before.

Deshpande then unleashed his pace on Prerak Mankad and the all-rounder perished to a well-directed short-ball, nicking it to Tare on the cusp of tea.

At 173/5, Jackson, having crossed his fifty by then, saw Jani ease the pressure on him as the duo waged a counter attack on the spinners after the break. Just when Jackson was cruising towards towards his third hundred of the season, having tucked Bhoir through on-side for a brilliant boundary, he edged the spinner to Tare.

Scoreboard:

199,2020/02/05,I enjoy scoring against Mumbai: Jackson,"Sheldon Jackson has a special bond with Mumbai, with the stylish Saurashtra batsman having spent his formative years in the Maximum City.

The love affair has trickled on to the cricket field while facing Mumbai, with Jackson scoring his fourth consecutive fifty against the domestic powerhouse to bail Saurashtra out of trouble on the second day of their Ranji Trophy tie.

In his first six innings against Mumbai, Jackson tasted little success, tallying just 68 runs, including four single-digit scores. But ever since helping Rest of India chase down a mammoth target of 480 with an unbeaten 59 in the Irani Cup tie in March 2016, Jackson has found his mojo against Mumbai. He followed it up with 95 and 57 at the Wankhede Stadium in the last season’s Ranji Trophy tie.

What is it about facing Mumbai that gets the best out of the seasoned batsman? “I just find them an aggressive side and I enjoy scoring against them. Maybe I haven’t got the hundreds — I had two chances but missed it — but I have scored some crucial runs against them,” Jackson told The Hindu after his knock of 85 tilted the balance in favour of Saurashtra.

Having crossed the 5,000-run mark in First Class cricket earlier this season, Jackson may have missed out on his third hundred of the season — and 19th overall. But more than missing out on a ton, he was ruing the fact that he left allrounder Chirag Jani — batting on 45 — to take the game away from Mumbai with a sizeable first innings lead.

“More than missing out on a hundred, it would have been ideal to remain unbeaten today and take the game away from Mumbai tomorrow. Hopefully, Chirag can do that along with the lower order,” he said.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/i-enjoy-scoring-against-mumbai-jackson/article30743653.ece
200,2020/02/05,NZ vs IND | Taylor-made victory for Black Caps,"An unbeaten century from veteran batsman Ross Taylor powered New Zealand to a stunning four-wicket win over India in the first One-Day International here on Wednesday.

The host completed the second highest run chase in its history to finish on 348 for four and overhaul the imposing target set by India.

It was a morale-boosting victory for the Black Caps, who went into the match as underdogs after a 5-0 whitewash in the recent Twenty20 series, when they repeatedly squandered winning opportunities.

Role reversal

The roles were reversed at Seddon Park, with India posting a mammoth total of 347 for four after losing the toss, including a maiden century to Shreyas Iyer and half-centuries for skipper Virat Kohli and K.L. Rahul.

But the tourists’ bowling attack failed to prevent a match-turning innings from Taylor, who scored a 73-ball century, his 21st in ODIs, and ended the match on 109 not out.

He was supported by a quick-fire 69 from captain Tom Latham and Henry Nicholls’ hard-fought 78, although three late wickets gave India hope of rescuing the match.

Long-awaited

“It’s been a long time between drinks,” said Latham, whose side suffered a 3-0 Test series defeat in Australia before the T20 drubbing on home soil.

“It’s nice to get over the line and we managed to keep our composure at the end and get there.”

Kohli was gracious in defeat, saying India produced a “decent” performance that was not quite good enough on the day.

“You have to say that the opposition played better than us because they were more intense,” he said.

New Zealand started its chase well, reaching 147 for two after 25 overs as Taylor and Nicholls developed a promising partnership.

Fielding brilliance

It took a piece of fielding brilliance from Kohli to break it with India’s skipper swooping on the ball and tossing it underarm with skill in mid-air to run-out a diving Nicholls.

But Taylor continued his assault with Latham to take New Zealand to 292 for three with 10 overs remaining and the 35-year-old remained at the crease to hit the winning run.

While Shreyas’s 103 from 107 balls was the highlight of India’s innings, debutant opening batsmen Mayank Agarwal and Prithvi Shaw also performed solidly, bring up an opening partnership of 50.

Praise from Laxman

Shreyas rode his luck at times — dropped on nine and 83 — but earned praise from V.V.S. Laxman for the way he set about dismantling New Zealand’s attack.

“I really enjoyed the way he paced his innings, a very mature knock,” the Indian batting legend said in commentary.

Laxman’s praise for Rahul, who scored an unbeaten 88, was even more fulsome, saying the wicketkeeper-batsman had cemented his spot in the Indian side after recovering from a form slump.

“He’s a special talent, I’d put him in the league of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli,” he said.

Deceptive flight

The ever-reliable Kohli cruised to his 58th ODI half-century in a 102-run partnership with Shreyas that ended when spinner Ish Sodhi clean bowled him on 51 with a deceptively flighted ball.

It was a rare highlight for the New Zealand bowlers, whose inaccuracy proved expensive on the small ground.

Tim Southee was the best performer with two wickets, but he conceded 8.5 runs an over taking them.

The second ODI will be played at Auckland’s Eden Park on Saturday.

Brief Scores:

India: 347 for 4 in 50 overs (Shreyas Iyer 103, KL Rahul 88 not out, Virat Kohli 51; Tim Southee 2/85).

New Zealand: 348 for 6 in 48.1 overs.

201,2020/02/05,"Ranji Trophy | Mohammed, openers put Tamil Nadu in box seat","M. Mohammed’s seven-wicket haul, followed by a solid, unbeaten opening-wicket partnership between Abhinav Mukund and L. Suryapprakash, helped Tamil Nadu seize the initiative against Baroda on the first day at the Motibaug Cricket Ground here on Tuesday.

After TN won a crucial toss, Mohammed made full use of the conditions as he ran through the Baroda line-up, bundling out the home team for 174.

Abhinav (73 bating) and Suryapprakash (61 batting) then played some free-flowing strokes — the two hit 26 boundaries between them — to take TN to 135 for no loss at stumps. Abhinav, needing 34 runs to reach a milestone — 10,000 runs in First Class cricket — crossed it in style with a boundary off Anureet Singh.

Inducing errors

Mohammed kept it simple, bowling a full length and letting the batsmen make errors. Kedar Devdhar was the first to go when he was foxed by a short-pitched delivery, the top-edge landing in the mid-wicket fielder’s hands.

The medium-pacer was hit for four boundaries by the other opener Ahmadnoor Pathan. However, Mohammed had the last word, forcing the batsmen to edge to slip.

Abhishek Tanwar, playing his first match of the season, then struck twice in two overs, dismissing Vishnu Solanki — who was dropped twice, on 0 and 2, by ’keeper N. Jagadeesan — and skipper Krunal Pandya, to reduce Baroda to 50 for four.

Immediate success

In his second spell, Mohammed changed ends and found immediate success with two very good deliveries to dismiss Deepak Hooda and Yusuf Pathan. He had the former leg-before with a sharp inswinger, while Yusuf edged to third slip, the extra bounce taking him by surprise.

Even though wickets kept falling, the Baroda batsmen managed to find the boundaries but none of them capitalised on their starts.

At the stroke of lunch, Mohammed completed his five-wicket haul, having Swapnil Singh caught at slip, leaving Baroda in dire straits at 95 for seven.

TN let the opposition off the hook, after restricting it to 100 for eight, as Atit Sheth (53) went after the tiring medium-pacers. When Mohammed and Tanwar were taken off, Sheth and Anureet punished K. Vignesh who was lacklustre.

In the final session, the TN had the best conditions for batting and the openers produced some stylish cover-drives, scoring at more than four runs per over to cap off a productive day.

202,2020/02/05,SA vs AUS | Maxwell back in Australian squad,"Despite an outstanding show in the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL), all-rounder Marcus Stonis was not included in Australia’s ODI and T20I squads for their upcoming tour of South Africa while Glenn Maxwell has been recalled.

“(Stoinis) was unlucky to miss out due to the makeup of the current top order,” Australia men’s national team selector Trevor Hohns was quoted as saying by the ICC.

“It is terrific to have a backup player of his calibre in such good form,” he added.

On the other hand, Maxwell, who took a break from international cricket in October 2019 due to mental health issues, has been included in the both Aussies squads and will make his return in national colours.

203,2020/02/05,CMCH performs its first organ harvest and transplantation,"A medical team of the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Wednesday harvested multiple organs of a brain-dead person and transplanted a kidney in a needy patient, the first such organ harvest-cum-transplantation performed at the hospital.

‘Team effort’

CMCH Dean B. Asokan said that Wednesday’s procedure was a milestone for the tertiary-level Government hospital, which was achieved through “a team effort”.

The liver, kidneys and corneas of a 35-year-old man from Kattabettu in the Nilgiris were harvested after he was declared brain dead. He suffered a grievous injury to the brain when he fell from a building under construction.

Dr. Asokan said that as one kidney was allotted to the CMCH by Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (TRANSTAN), which controls the transplantation programme and organ sharing in the State, it was transplanted in wait-listed patient at the hospital by Wednesday evening. The entire procedure -- from harvest to transplantation -- took seven hours.

While other kidney was allotted to Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital in Salem, the liver was allotted to a private hospital in Coimbatore.

Both corneas were also allotted to CMCH.

The injured man was brought to CMCH on February 2. The Dean said he did not respond to treatment and was declared brain dead Tuesday evening after the mandatory medical examinations.

Family’s consent

The hospital’s grief counsellor approached the man’s family members for organ donation and they consented to it. The consent was conveyed to TRANSTAN, which allotted the organs to the three hospitals based on the waiting list.

CMCH has been performing live-donor kidney transplantation since 2017. In 2018, it obtained approval from TRANSTAN to start registration of patients for cadaver kidney transplantation.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cmch-performs-its-first-organ-harvest-and-transplantation/article30745546.ece
204,2020/02/05,Elephant calf found dead,"An elephant calf, purportedly 9 to 10 months old was found dead inside Sanamavu Reserve forest three days ago. The calf was buried by the forest department inside the forest.

However, the incident that came to light only on Wednesday sparked allegations that the calf was the same one that had strayed from its herd out of the reserve forest last month, before it was tranquilized and guided back twice after it repeatedly strayed back into the fringe farm lands outside the forest.

But, the forest department stated that the earlier calf was male and is believed to have rejoined its herd, while the dead calf was female.

The Hindu spoke to Dr. Prakash, forest veterinarian. The female calf is suspected to have died of enteritis (inflammation of the intestine) . The calf was found to have had infection from enteritis, possibly from muddy waters and food, said the official source. Sanamavu forest is patrolled regularly on a daily basis and the carcass was found in less than a day of the death of the calf, said the official.

However, the incident sparked allegations that the dead calf was the same calf that was chased back into the forest last month despite the calf seen returning to patta lands from its inability to locate its herd.

On January 12, an eight-month-old elephant calf (which was male according to the forest department) had strayed from its herd outside the Sanamavu reserve forest. The calf was tranquilized and guided back into the forest twice, after it was found straying back to patta lands lending itself vulnerable to taunts by the local youth.

The calf was sent back into the forest once again on January 27. Close on its heels, the death of an elephant calf and its burial three days ago sparked allegations denied by the forest department, which has clearly stated that gender of the dead calf was different from the rescued calf last month.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/elephant-calf-found-dead/article30745528.ece
205,2020/02/05,DMK’s signature campaign against CAA begins,"The local DMK unit here kicked off the signature campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act, after the party’s chief M.K. Stalin flagged off the campaign in Chennai early this week.

The signature campaign that is set to galvanize the ongoing opposition to the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, and translate the opposition to the fraught Act into one crore signatures was brought to a start here at the roundana in the town on Wednesday.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) State general secretary K. Balakrishnan visited the signature campaign site at the Five Road Junction near the roundana and affixed his signature before kicking off the campaign alongside DMK MLA and district secretary T. Senguttuvan.

The campaign is being held in all the 10 unions in the district. The cadres are mobilising opinions and securing signatures from the public in the campaign site all through the day.

According to Mr. Balakrishnan, if Edappadi K. Palaniswami’s government claimed responsibility for its so-called achievements, then they should also take responsibility for the scams played out under its watch. “They (scams) run deeper. Without the hand of the Ministers, no junior junior level official or a clerk will have the wherewithal to indulge in a scam of this magnitude,” said the CPI (M) leader. That is why, the CPI (M) has demanded that a CBI investigation monitored by the High Court should be ordered into the scams.

Dubbing last week’s Central budget as a budget only in name, Mr. Balakrishnan alleged the government failed to raise the spending capacity of the rural poor, whilst giving relief to the corporates.

“The allocation for MNREGS was far lower than last year. During the time, the majority of the country’s purchasing capacity plummeted, the prosperity of a few rich grew correspondingly,” said Mr. Balakrishnan.

On the rising incidents of sexual crimes against children, Mr. Balakrishna urged the State government should stop viewing it as a mere law and order issue and instead take a holistic view by holding consultations with all stakeholders. “What does development mean, if we can’t provide safe spaces for the country’s children?”",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/wrjkod/article30745523.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/KA06-CPM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/dmks-signature-campaign-against-caa-begins/article30745524.ece

Sengottaiyan, inspected Periya Kodiveri and Kongarpalayam villages in Gobichettipalayam Taluk where forest department has installed cameras and a cage to trap a leopard on Wednesday.

In the past one week, a leopard had strayed from forest area in Thookanaickenpalayam (T.N. Palayam) forest range in Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve (STR) and had killed two goats and a cow at these villages located near the forest.

Panic situation

The incident caused panic among the villagers and later the forest department had placed cameras and a cage to trap the animal.

However, in the past four days the leopard could not be caught despite officials relocating the cage in the agriculture field. The Minister inspected the spot where cameras were installed and held discussions with T.N. Palayam Forest Ranger Ganesh Pandian and other officials.

212,2020/02/05,Activist protests against Corpn.,"To draw the attention of the Tiruppur Corporation to wastage of drinking water, an activist bathed in a roadside pit at Kumar Nagar opposite Bungalow Bus Stop here on Tuesday.

S. Chandrasekar, coordinator of an outfit named Gramiya Makkal Iyakkam, said that the leakage had been persisting for two months and that the Corporation officials had not taken any action yet. “Lakhs of litres of drinking water is being wasted every day,” he said.

Mr. Chandrasekar, who runs a two-wheeler service centre in Ram Nagar, said that he was on his way to work at around 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday when he saw the pit brimming with water. “I decided to bathe for everyone to know about this issue,” he said. Mr. Chandrasekar said that he would submit a petition to the Corporation authorities if no action was taken to stop the leak.

When contacted, a Corporation official said that the pit was dug on Monday to attend to the leak. “We could not attend to it immediately as water supply was under way at Kumar Nagar,” the official said. After the supply, the tank at Kumar Nagar would be closed for the works to stop the leak, the official said.

Though the leak was from a water distribution line at Ward No. 25 (Zone – II), the cause was not clear. Denying Mr. Chandrasekar’s claims, the official said the leak had only been occurring for a week and the regular water supply was not affected. “The leak will be repaired by Tuesday night,” the official said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/activist-protests-against-corpn/article30737723.ece
213,2020/02/05,LIC employees stage protest,"Employees and officers of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) took part in a protest here on Tuesday, as part of the nation-wide protest against Central Government’s plan to sell part of its share in the LIC through public offer. The protesters urged the government to give up the proposal.

V. Suresh, joint secretary of the South India Insurance Employees Association, said that by selling a part of its shares now, the government was moving towards privatising LIC. It would not only affect the employees, but the public too. The demonstration staged on Tuesday was the initial response of the employees. If the government did not give up its move, there would be massive protests, he said.

S. Kamalathiagarajan, general secretary of National Federation of Insurance Field Workesr of India, Coimbatore Division, said, in a press release, that the proposed sale of government share in LIC would lead to sale of major share in the future. In critical financial situations, LIC would not be able to save the nation and the amount of dividend paid to the government would suffer a set back.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/lic-employees-stage-protest/article30737717.ece
214,2020/02/05,e-mobility: trade and industry want challenges to be addressed,"Ampere Vehicles, a wholly-owned electric mobility subsidiary of Greaves Cotton, recently said that it had inked a pact with Bigbasket to provide electric scooters for delivery purposes in key cities, including Chennai. Bigbasket operates fleets of delivery teams across 26 cities in India.

At the Taste of Coimbatore event held here last month, organisers used e-scooters for mobility inside the 4.5-acre venue.

While there is a big push from the government on e-mobility and manufacturers are looking at different models of vehicles, one of the potential segments seems to be vehicles used for delivery purposes by industries and trade.

P. Sanjeev, Chief Operating Officer of Ampere Electric Vehicles, told The Hindu the company had tie-ups with 20 institutions in the State, including textiles mills and schools, that used different types of e-vehicles. “Many of them use three-wheelers and there is a very encouraging response. The advantage that e-vehicles bring to the table is cost economics especially when used within the premises. We can customise vehicles according to the need of the sector that we are catering to. In e-vehicles, there is a greater scope for customisation,” he says.

“Even when customised, when the manufacturers follow all the prescribed standards, the customers get the government subsidy,” he points out.

Textile mills initially started using e-vehicles in the spinning department a few years ago to reduce the fatigue for workers, as they need to move around a lot for checking the spinning process. Though not many mills have adopted e-mobility for internal use, some of them do use the vehicles in the godowns and packaging departments to move goods. The adoption depends on the cost involved and facilities and space available within a mill, says an industry source.

While the manufacturers and dealers feel that e-vehicles are a great option for delivery personnel, trade and industry here are of the view that there are challenges that need to be overcome.

“The preference is still for the moped and not even the regular scooters for delivery purposes,” points out one of the hoteliers. “Multiple hands use a vehicle that a hotel has for delivery or to pick up goods. What matters is the robustness of the vehicle and the confidence of the user,” adds Jegan Damodarasamy, Executive Director of Sree Annapoorna Sree Gowrishankar Hotels. It will take some more time of the employees to get confidence in the vehicle, when its usage and technology develop further. They (employees) should be comfortable using the e-vehicles and only then will hotels start switching over to e-vehicles, he says.

V. Lakshminarayanasamy, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Coimbatore, says while the scope is high for use of e-vehicles by industries and trade, there are issues. Availability of battery charging points within the city, life of batteries and the weight that the vehicles can handle matter for more industries to switch over. For use within an industry, the vehicle should be able to carry maximum 500 kg and for outside use, it should be minimum one tonne, he says.

“In China, e-cycles were introduced nearly three decades ago. But we need to study the use in industries and for delivery purposes,” he says.

Domestic manufacture of e-vehicles is just picking up and a few companies have announced plans for e-autos too. Only when there is continuous support and facilities locally for servicing of the vehicles, will the customers get confidence in these vehicles. Since batteries constitute significant portion of the cost of an e-vehicle, the life of batteries, charging time, and charging facilities will determine the success of the use of e-vehicles, he adds.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/7f9hcd/article30737713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB05E-SCOOTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/e-mobility-trade-and-industry-want-challenges-to-be-addressed/article30737714.ece
215,2020/02/05,"Cancellation of public exam for Classes V, VIII welcomed","Education activists in Coimbatore have welcomed the cancellation of public examination for Classes V and VIII, while stressing that the announcement should have been made earlier.

Special classes

T. Arulanandam, State body member of Tamil Nadu High Higher Secondary School Graduate Teachers’ Association, said that the announcement came after the preliminary works for the examinations such as particulars of students in the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) portal have been completed in schools. Apart from this, special classes were held for Classes V to VIII since November 2019, he said.

“The teachers in government schools are burdened with work already,” he said, expressing hope that some of the work load might be reduced with this cancellation of examinations. The Association had petitioned Commissioner of School Education Sigy Thomas Vaidhyan in December 2019 in this regard, Mr. Arulanandam recalled.

The State government did not think through the impact of conducting examinations for young students, alleged V. Eswaran, education activist and secretary of MDMK’s state youth wing.

Quality of education

“They have cancelled it only because of the opposition to the original announcement and not because of how it would affect students,” he alleged. Mr. Eswaran urged the Department of School Education to improve the quality of education in government schools to enhance the students’ performance as opposed to conducting more examinations.

“If held, these examinations would have increased the number of dropouts in government schools,” he claimed.

Coimbatore Chief Education Officer P. Ayyanan said that the special classes for Classes V to VIII in government schools in Coimbatore district would continue. “They are only to improve the reading and writing skills of students,” he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/cancellation-of-public-exam-for-classes-v-viii-welcomed/article30737521.ece

Stopping by Coimbatore on Tuesday for a two-day visit as part of his trip, Mr. Mahajan recalled why he was drawn towards organ donation. “I donated my kidney to a jawan (soldier) in my village in 2000,” he said. Mr. Mahajan hails from a village in Sangli district, Maharashtra.

Following the incident, Mr. Mahajan said that he wanted to raise awareness on organ donation across the country, which made him undertake his first nation-wide trip in 2018. In the first trip, he covered 19 States and 10,000 km in 100 days, he said. “This time, it will be 132 days,” he said, noting that he plans to cover 94 cities across 25 States.

Mr. Mahajan started this trip from Pune on January 18 with the support of Rebirth Trust, a Pune-based NGO advocating organ donation. After covering Goa, Karnataka and Kerala, Mr. Mahajan entered Tamil Nadu with a visit to Madurai on Monday. He said that the trip will include Madurai, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore, Salem, Erode and Chennai in the State along with Puducherry. He plans to conclude the trip on May 28 at Pune.

Balaji Suresh, a member of All India Riders Federation, said that the Federation members would support Mr. Mahajan during his stay in the 94 cities.

“We will arrange food, accommodation and his visits [in a given city] during the stay,” Mr. Suresh said, who looked after Mr. Mahajan during his Coimbatore visit.

“A cat or a dog does not live for itself, it lives for its masters,” Mr. Mahajan said, adding that humans must help others through organ donation.

217,2020/02/05,"Tribal residents, estate workers sensitised to forest fires in Gudalur","The Forest department is organising village-level awareness campaigns in the settlements bordering reserve forests in Gudalur to prevent forest fires.

The campaigns, which began after Pongal holidays, are aimed at sensitising local communities, primarily tribal groups and estate workers, to the dangers of forest fires and to prevent them from setting fire to grasslands and forested areas. Officials said that the fires are set by locals so that their cattle would have fresh fodder after a few months. As forest fires would destroy forest cover and put wildlife at risk, Forest officials have launched awareness campaigns in all forest ranges in the Gudalur division.

“We have distributed notices to local communities, urging them to share information about any fires they witness in forest areas, or share information about people who are responsible for starting fires, including tourists,” said a forest department official.

In Gudalur range, awareness campaigns were conducted in three tribal villages so far. Campaigns conducted with the involvement of local communities prior to the peak “fire season” tends to help control the number of forest fires in the division, the officials said.

This year, check dams are being constructed in the Gudalur forest division to provide enough water for wildlife during the lean summer months, so that animals, especially elephants, are not forced into entering towns or settlements in search of food and water, they added.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/eyheqd/article30737466.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/OT05AWARENESSCAMPAIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tribal-residents-estate-workers-sensitised-to-forest-fires-in-gudalur/article30737467.ece

Deputy Director of Health Services G. Ramesh Kumar told The Hindu that various teams were involved in the awareness activities at major check-posts along the Tamil Nadu–Kerala border.

“Five-member teams are working at major check-posts such as Walayar, Anaikatti and Meenakshipuram to educate people about the virus. Each team includes a doctor, a health inspector and nursing staff. They mainly target people travelling from Kerala to Tamil Nadu,” he said.

The medical teams advise the public to follow precautions such as washing of hands at frequent intervals, covering of mouth and nose with a handkerchief while coughing or sneezing, cleaning of surfaces/floors with disinfectant solution and to avoid touching surfaces such as railings in public places.

The teams ask the public to alert the Health Department about people who have come from China, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand where many cases have been reported. The Department is also collecting details of such travellers from airports.

Further, they advise people to seek treatment if they have symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat or headache.

After starting the first leg of the in-line baggage screening on January 31, the Airports Authority of India (AAI) introduced the second leg on February 3. “This will eliminate the need for scanning check-in baggage before check-in counters. Passengers can now go straightaway to the counter thus saving time,” an AAI official said.

The in-line baggage screening system installed is in compliance with the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security norms for ensuring safe and secure in-line hold baggage screening system. From October 1, AAI Cargo Logistics and Allied Services Company Limited commenced operations on standalone screening system at Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Calicut airports, adding airports, in a phased manner.

In the automated in-line system, a piece of baggage deposited at the check-in counter goes through X-ray machines on a conveyor belt. The belts are fitted with cameras and sensors that create images of the luggage with a bar code. The luggage is screened in a control room manned by trained security personnel.

Once a bag goes through the first X-ray scan, the image reaches the screen monitored by the security personnel in the control room. The bag then goes through a second screening. It is mandatory for each piece of luggage to pass through two X-ray machines.

“If the control room clears the luggage, it goes to a designated area in the basement through a conveyor belt. From there, the airline’s luggage handlers take over. In the event of the control room doubting the contents of a bag, it is made to pass through a third X-ray machine. An experienced screener checks the image and, if cleared, the bag goes to the basement. If not, it is sent to the fourth level, where the owner is called and the bag manually checked,” the official said.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/7gjgvx/article30737779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bm-Goa-Airport,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/goa-airport-gets-in-line-baggage-screening/article30737753.ece
222,2020/02/05,"Centre grants ₹296 cr. for automated vehicle inspection centres, test tracks","The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has sanctioned ₹296.02 crore to Maharashtra for setting up of automated vehicle inspection and certification centres along with automated driving test tracks (ADTT).

The decision came about during a meeting between Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways, Nitin Gadkari, and State Minister for Transport and Parliamentary Affairs, Anil Parab, on Tuesday.

Mr. Parab said the State had proposed to set up 50 automated vehicle inspection and certification centres with technical assistance from the Automotive Research Association of India, Pune. The first such centre came up in Nashik in 2015 with a financial assistance of ₹14 crore from the Central government.

The State established the second centre on land owned by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, at Kurla (East).

“Of the remaining 48 centres, we had requested for the Central funding for 10 centres,” the Minister said. The centres are to come up at Kolhapur, Aurangabad, Kalyan, Nagpur rural, Mumbai Central, Hingana-Nagpur, Panvel, Diveghat-Pune, and Nanded.

The government is also planning to set up a number of ADTT for completely computerised testing of drivers. The State in consultation with the Central Institute of Road Transport, Pune, has prepared a proposal for setting up 22 ADTT with an outlay of ₹ 156.22 crore.

“Since these projects are highly capital intensive in nature, requiring a huge investment for executing in a time-bound manner, we had requested financial assistance for 10 inspection and certification centres along with 22 ADTT at a total outlay of ₹296.02 crore and it has been approved,” officials in the State Transport Department said.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/centre-grants-296-cr-for-automated-vehicle-inspection-centres-test-tracks/article30737722.ece
223,2020/02/05,NMMC polls to be MVA govt.’s first political test,"The tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi may have won the Maharashtra Council election for Yavatmal seat on Tuesday, with the Shiv Sena’s Dushyant Chaturvedi defeating Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Sumit Bajoria, but the real test of the coalition is set to be the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) polls, slated to be held in the next two to three months.

The Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and Congress alliance on Tuesday held their first joint programme in Vashi announcing that the election will be fought unitedly against BJP MLA Ganesh Naik, who had jumped to the BJP from the NCP days before the Assembly elections last year. Mr. Naik single-handedly controls the NMMC, which he had won as NCP leader five years ago. With him leaving the NCP, all but three corporators switched sides to join the BJP.

According to sources, the NCP and Sena are determined to end Mr. Naik’s reign in Navi Mumbai and have even agreed to make seat adjustments to contest the election. NCP’s State president and Irrigation Minister Jayant Patil, Thane’s Guardian Minister and Urban Development Department minister Eknath Shinde, and local Congress leaders participated in Tuesday’s programme in Vashi.

“With the departure of Mr. Naik from the NCP, the party is left with no face to fight the poll. But with the unexpected turn of events at the State level and the party coming back to power, it is still in the contest. Some corporators will come back to the party fold,” said a senior NCP leader. The party is ready to give more space to the Sena to ensure Mr. Naik and his family are defeated, he said.

On the other hand, the Sena has been fighting Mr. Naik for over years now. A former Sena leader, Mr. Naik had switched to the NCP and enjoyed a ministerial berth in the previous Congress-NCP governments in the State. He single-handedly controlled the party and the NMMC, without letting others in the party to grow.

The BJP, despite being in power in 2015 in the State, had not managed to win more than seven seats in the 111-member corporation. “With Mr. Naik’s entry into the BJP, it had hoped to expand its base, but the situation has changed yet again. We are determined to defeat him this time,” said a Sena leader. Meanwhile, in the State Council election in Yavatmal district, Mr. Chaturvedi of the Sena won 298 votes while Mr. Bajoria managed only 185. The seat had become vacant after former MLC Tanaji Sawant of the Sena contested the Assembly election and won from Osmanabad’s Bhoom-Paranda constituency.",states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/oiybpa/article30737696.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMGANESHNAIK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/states/nmmc-polls-to-be-mva-govts-first-political-test/article30737684.ece

226,2020/02/05,Pregnancy termination: board to examine minor,"The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the constitution of a medical board to examine a minor rape victim, who is seeking permission to terminate her 24-week pregnancy.

Justice Vibhu Bakhru asked the medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital to constitute the board to examine the condition of the 16-year-old girl and expeditiously submit the report on whether continuing the pregnancy would pose any risk to her health.

The board shall also include a psychiatrist, the court said.

The court, which listed the matter for February 6, requested the concerned doctor to be present during the hearing. The court further said that it would also interact with the girl and her parents, who were present during the hearing, on the next date and asked them to be there.

The petition, filed through the girl’s mother, is aggrieved as Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act does not permit termination of pregnancy in case the period of gestation is over 20 weeks.

The plea, filed through advocates Anwesh Madhukar and Prachi Nirwan, said the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the girl as she herself is of a ‘tender age’.

The plea said the rape victim was examined by doctors at a government hospital here on January 25 and she was found to be 24-weeks pregnant. Pursuant to this, a case of rape and criminal intimidation was lodged at Swaroop Nagar police station here.

The doctor has opined that since the period of gestation is over 20 weeks, it is beyond the permissible limit and the court’s permission is required for pregnancy termination.

Last week, the Union Cabinet had approved extending the upper limit for permitting abortions from the present 20 weeks to 24 weeks for “special categories of women”, which would include rape survivors, victims of incest, differently-abled and minors.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/g8yi95/article30739969.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05DELHIHIGHCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/pregnancy-termination-board-to-examine-minor/article30739970.ece

The directions came days after the Supreme Court set aside a previous order of the NGT ordering status quo on the construction, which the builder had challenged.

During the February 3 hearing, the counsel appearing for the builder, sought an adjournment in the matter which was opposed by the counsel appearing for DU on the grounds that in the absence of a stay, the project proponent may proceed with the project.

Taking note of the submission by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, a Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar granted the Centre time till April 29 to submit its reply.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for some JMI students, said that 93 students and teachers had filed complaints about attacks on them by the police but no FIR has been filed against the agency till date.

On December 19, the HC had asked the Centre, the Delhi government and the police to reply to several petitions seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence at JMI during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

231,2020/02/05,An Oppn. councillor fights to become an MLA,"A two-time councillor of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation from the Congress, Abhishek Dutt, is a familiar face in the Kasturba Nagar constituency from where he is contesting the Delhi Assembly elections.

Since the announcement of the elections, locals say he has been regularly meeting people in public gatherings.

On Tuesday, he was seen engaged in a door-to-door campaign at Lodhi Complex appealing to occupants of the government flats here. Various local civic and infrastructure issues such as provision of better roads, cleanliness, sewerage facilities are his priorities. In conversation with prospective voters, he repeats, “I am asking for votes based on my work. That’s the difference between us and others.” While the Congress may not form the government in Delhi Assembly, Mr. Dutt is no stranger to working from the Opposition benches.

Despite sitting in the Opposition, Mr. Dutt has managed to develop his ward considerably, even being selected as a model ward to achieve complete waste segregation. While three such model wards were picked in each of the three municipal corporations following the National Green Tribunal orders, Mr. Dutt points out that the selection was done based on which ward was most likely to succeed and that waste segregation had been implemented here prior to the scheme itself. “There are also no dark spots in my ward,” he said. Asked what his plan for the constituency was, Mr. Dutt said, “We will take the Andrews Gunj [ward] model forward.”

Mr. Dutt’s holds a reputation of a “hard worker”, with area residents complimenting on how he regularly responds to people’s calls and resolves issues. “I have heard a lot about him from the people in Garhi, Sadiq Nagar, Andrews Gunj. They say he will work for you even if you call him at night,” said Krishna Mehto, a resident.

Inspite of ‘goodwill’

His reputation extends to those who are not keen on voting for the Congress as well. Commenting on him, Amit Kagra from Lodhi Complex, said: “He has a lot of goodwill here. Everyone knows he gets work done, but my vote is going to AAP.” For him and many others here, the present election was about issues effecting Delhi at large. However, Sukhvinder Kaur who met Mr. Dutt, earlier in the day, believed he is a good candidate but argued that older parties such as the BJP and the Congress have had been given several chances. “These people [AAP] should also get a chance,” she said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/yrrgqk/article30737909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05CAMPAIGN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/an-oppn-councillor-fights-to-become-an-mla/article30737910.ece

233,2020/02/05,Shaheen Bagh shooter an AAP member: police,"Delhi Police on Tuesday said that Kapil Baisala, who allegedly opened fire at the Shaheen Bagh protest site on February 1, is a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).

The announcement kicked off a political storm with the BJP accusing AAP of “selling the security of the country for political gains”.

AAP has said that it will inquire into whether Mr. Baisala is part of the party.

DCP (Crime) Rajesh Deo said that Mr. Baisala and his father had joined AAP in early 2019. He said that the police had recovered pictures from his phone — seized for the probe — in which the accused can be seen with senior AAP leaders.

“We have retrieved WhatsApp data and photos of him and his father Gaje Singh joining AAP. He had deleted these pictures but with technical help, the photos were recovered,” Mr. Deo said, adding that Mr. Baisala has admitted to joining AAP.

Mr. Baisala’s family, however, has refuted the police’s claim. “I have no idea where these photographs are from. My nephew had no association with any political party,” said Fatesh Singh, uncle of the accused.

Legal notice

Meanwhile, AAP has said that they will send a legal notice to the DCP for taking the party’s name without the Election Commission’s permission and “influencing” the Assembly elections, which are scheduled to be held on Saturday.

AAP MP Sanjay Singh accused Mr. Deo of being a BJP spokesperson and said that the party will complain to the EC to find out on “whose permission the officer took the party’s name”.

“As per EC rules, no official can take the name of any political party, which can influence the election, without permission of the poll panel. He [the DCP] did not have permission from the EC. He had permission from [Home Minister]Amit Shah, he had permission from the BJP,"" Mr. Singh said.

On whether Mr. Baisala is an AAP member, Mr. Singh said: “Let us first inquire whether they [accused shooter and his father] are part of the party or whether they were part of the party and then joined any other party after it. I do not know their status, let us check it first.”

The pictures retrieved from the phone allegedly show Mr. Baisala and his father in the presence of several AAP leaders, including Atishi and Mr. Singh.

During interrogation, it was revealed that on February 1, Mr. Baisala, along with his friend Sarthak Larolla, had gone to Shaheen Bagh on a bike. When they reached the protest site, Mr. Larolla left with the bike and Mr. Baisala's phone.

Later, Mr. Baisala fired two rounds in the air and was apprehended. The weapon was also recovered. Mr. Larolla joined the investigation and the mobile phone was recovered from his residence.

The police said his father had unsuccessfully fought two municipal polls from Jangpura and Patparganj on the Bahujan Samaj Party ticket in 2008 and 2012.

Meanwhile, BJP national president J.P. Nadda alleged that both the country and the Capital had now seen the “ugly face” of AAP.

“For political motives, Mr. Kejriwal and his people have sold the security of the country. Earlier, Mr. Kejriwal used to insult the Army and argue in favour of terrorists but today his connections with those terrorist activities have surfaced,” he alleged.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said: “It is clear that AAP’s design is to allure votes of one community and defame another community. They have instigated the youth to incite violence.”

Custody extended

Meanwhile, a local court on Tuesday extended by two days the police custody of Mr. Baisala. The Delhi police have submitted that the incident could be a part of a larger conspiracy. “The time and place of the incident clearly indicates that the incident is part of a larger conspiracy, which is to be unearthed,” the investigating officer said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/3yd78t/article30714972.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Shaheen-shooterjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/shaheen-bagh-shooter-an-aap-member-police/article30737892.ece
234,2020/02/05,"Will ensure Delhi develops with the speed it deserves, says Modi","At his final public meeting before Delhi goes to the polls on February 8, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday assured voters that he would ensure that the Capital develops with the speed that it deserves to progress, but only if they exercised their franchise in favour of the BJP.

PM Modi promised to build a “world-class” Delhi, which would be “safe and bereft of chaos and violence”, even as he appealed to voters to “punish and send on holiday”, practitioners of “vote-bank politics” and the “politics of selfishness and hate”.

‘Take the right decision’

“This is my second rally after the one in east Delhi on Monday. The support for the BJP is palpable and we all know what is going to happen on February 11 [election result]... This is the first election of the decade and the progress of the country will depend on the decisions the country takes... Today, the Capital has to show the rest of it the way forward. You have to make the right decision on February 8,” he said at the Ramlila Maidan in Dwarka.

“Delhi needs a government that shows the way forward, not one that levels accusations; not a government that complicates matters and creates stumbling blocks... Delhi can never develop with a government that makes excuses, spreads lies and accusations... I have eaten your salt; I will stand by you and do whatever it takes to develop Delhi,” he added.

Making a direct reference to AAP’s flagship Mohalla Clinics, Mr. Modi connected it to the non-implementation of the Centre’s Aayushman Bharat initiative. He attacked the AAP government for allegedly turning a blind eye to the woes of the Capital’s poor.

“In Delhi, there is a government that does not feel anything for you; doesn’t care about you...What a dirty imagination must that government have that it nurses such dastardly motives against the poor of this city. I’m amazed...What is the fault of the poor of Delhi that they have been kept away from the benefits of the Aayushman Bharat scheme?” he demanded. “The merits of this scheme are not about the ₹5 lakh limit. What if a citizen of Delhi gets ill somewhere else? Will the local Mohalla Clinic go to treat him there? If the Aayushman Bharat scheme was implemented in Delhi, even if the beneficiary suffered a heart attack in another city, they would have been able to afford treatment,” he added.

He said the people of Delhi are watching how “politics of selfishness and hate” is being practiced in the city, which has had made them “angry” even as he asked whether those who voted for the AAP in 2015 had “wished for” the government it had become. The development of Delhi according to the “standards of the 21st century” was not only imperative for its own people but for all the citizens of the country, he argued. He also alleged that , further alleging that Delhi needed a government which, when the time came, “strengthened the hand of the nation” instead of one that “weakens it” in front of its opponents.

Talking about illegal colonies, he said: “The seven Lok Sabha MPs that you chose made it possible [conferring ownership rights to residents of unauthorised colonies] because you elected them... All your dreams will continue to come true if you exercise that power in favour of the BJP again... Remember that February 8 is not a holiday but a day to send the practitioners of the politics of hatred on a holiday.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/tciaeg/article30737888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE05MODI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/will-ensure-delhi-develops-with-the-speed-it-deserves-says-modi/article30737889.ece

On the contrary, it is the CAA that divides India and the protests at Shaheen Bagh and other places unite India,” he said.

In a series of tweets, Mr. Chidamabaram took on Mr. Modi, who had made those remarks at an election rally in Delhi.

“PM Modi says that protests against CAA in Jamia, Seelampur and Shaheen Bagh are not a coincidence and that ‘it is a conspiracy’. Protests have taken place and are taking place all over the country.

“The world is looking towards India to set up manufacturing hubs that will create jobs. Major countries want an alternative to China so that there is healthy competition, but Mr. Modi and Mr. Kejriwal are only interested in divisive politics and not concerned about the future of the youth,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi said the educated youth are told that there are no jobs for them.

Mr. Gandhi on Tuesday addressed rallies in Jangpura and Sangam Vihar.

In Sangam Vihar, he was accompanied by Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.

“Home Minister Amit Shah wants to fight the entire election on the Shaheen Bagh protests. He is so powerful. Can he not open a road?” said the CM.

Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill, Delhi Swaraj Bill and full statehood for Delhi have also been included in the manifesto.

“A compensation of ₹1 crore will be given to families of Safai Karamcharis who die on duty,” said party senior leader Manish Sisodia at a press conference. But the compensation will not be given to workers who are not part of a government body, said a member of the manifesto committee.

‘21st Century Delhi’

Speaking after the launch, AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal said the manifesto will to turn Delhi into a “21st Century, progressive Capital” and his government would need “support” of the Centre.

“In the last five years, our government has provided relief to the people of Delhi in various sectors and issues of public importance. Our vision now is to take Delhi to the next level. We have to turn Delhi into a 21st century, highly advanced, and progressive Capital of a developed nation. This manifesto has been created keeping in mind this idea of a progressive Capital. We cannot do it alone, we need participation and support from the people, the Centre, and all agencies in creating a Delhi of our dreams,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal said the manifesto talks about all communities and sections of people, including women, traders, contractual workers, sanitation workers, and victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots. The document also promises to connect Burari, Kirari, Bijwasan, Narela, Karawal Nagar, Mangolpuri and other places to the metro network, which will be increased to over 500 km.

It also promises a Deshbhakti Curriculum, protection from sealing of shops, and legal protection to street vendors and hawkers. “We shall pursue with the Centre for Bhojpuri language to be included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution,” states another promise.

Full statehood, the demand around which the party’s 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto was created, also found its mention at the 28th point. The document is shorter compared to the 70-point manifesto released by the party ahead of the 2015 Assembly elections.

“AAP had passed the Delhi Jan Lokpal Bill, 2015, in the last Assembly elections and it is pending with the Centre for the last four years. AAP resolves to continue its struggle to get the Bill passed,” the manifesto reads.

“This manifesto is our dream of creating a better Delhi. Creating a Delhi of our dreams has two roadmaps as per our manifesto,” Mr. Sisodia said. He added that the first phase of the roadmap of the manifesto was the 10-point guarantee card, which was released in January, vowing 10 guarantees to the people of Delhi. The current manifesto is the second phase and it involves a detailed description of some of the works to be undertaken by the AAP government in the next five years.

“I want to tell the BJP... the people of Delhi want the BJP to declare the Chief Ministerial face. I am ready to debate with that CM face. The debate can be at any place,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Subhash Chopra called AAP manifesto a pack of empty promises as it was repeating the same set of lies which it could not deliver in the past five years.

“What prevented AAP from fulfilling its earlier promises despite having an absolute majority,” he questioned. Commenting on AAP saying it “will pursue with the Centre to bring in a strong Delhi Swaraj Bill”, Mr. Chopra said in the first five years, AAP only clashed with the Centre. He added that last time, AAP did not regularise the sanitation workers on contract and also delayed their wages.

A bundle of lies: BJP

At a press conference here, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari said the AAP manifesto was a “bundle of lies. This manifesto contains the same old promises that were in AAP’s 2015 manifesto while some points are copied from the BJP’s Sankalp Patra.”

Union Minister Harsh Vardhan alleged that the Kejriwal-led party had removed the manifesto from its website thinking they could “cheat” the people of Delhi.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-manifesto-promises-24-hour-markets-swaraj-bill/article30737863.ece
240,2020/02/05,In the light of the moon,"It is remarkable how often monuments spring up at places associated with great personages. Take the Mata Sundari Gurdwara near Rouse Avenue in New Delhi. It marks the site of the house where Guru Gobind Singh lived in the 18th century. Mata Sundari, the guru’s wife and Mata Sahib Devi, considered the Mother of the Khalsa, survived the 10th and last guru. They also resided for some time near Ajmeri Gate in Kucha Diwali Singhan during the decadent years of the Mughal empire, when Mohammad Shah was on the throne, but luckily did not live to see the sack of Delhi by Nadir Shah.

After the death of Aurangzeb, when the war of succession broke out between Prince Muazzam and Prince Azam, the former sought the help of Gobind Singh who sent a token force to help his friend at the Battle of Jajua, near Agra, in June 1707. But the guru camped nearby and when the need arose for reinforcements, he rushed in to Muazzam’s aid. Azam was fatally wounded and his elder brother ascended the throne as Shah Alam, Bahadur Shah I.

When Guru Gobind Singh wanted to felicitate the emperor, he shot an arrow into the walls of the Red Fort and Bahadur Shah knew that his friend had arrived. After the death of the guru and successive rulers came and went, Mata Sundari and Mata Sahib Devi were not unduly disturbed, except when the heroic Sikh warrior Banda Singh Bahadur was executed in 1716 and then in June 1725 when they had to leave Delhi and live in Mathura for two years.

They continued to guide the panth (community) from Mata Sundari haveli, sending hukumnamas (encyclicals) to followers as far away as Kabul in the north and Dhaka in the east, rallying the Sikhs and prevailing upon them not to accept those who were trying to set up an 11th guru.

Their abode, built in 1727, is now a gurdwara, and there is a college and road too named after Mata Sundari. Those who come to worship at this shrine remember the venerable ladies who, despite the loss of four sons early in life, left an indelible mark on Delhi when it was passing through some of its most troublesome times. The two travelled on camel carts, bullock carts and in palanquins to propagate the message they had imbibed.

Not far from Mata Sundari Gurdwara is what was once the bungalow of Mirza Raja Jai Singh of Amber and has, over the centuries, become the Gurdwara Bangla Sahib. The Delhi palace of Jai Singh, General of Emperor Aurangzeb, was surrounded by a beautiful garden with pleasure walks and a sarovar (pool) in the centre. During Diwali the bungalow used to glitter in the light of thousands of lamps.

Raja Jai Singh was a man of taste, even though he was one of the greatest warlords of his time. He owned some of the best horses and his armoury was the envy of every man who wielded the sword. He was a busy man who did not stay put in Delhi. Most of the time he was fighting wars at the head of the Mughal army or quelling rebellions. It was his help that Aurangzeb took in dealing with the Marathas and the Sikhs, both of whom had been alienated by the emperor.

Even a peaceful Guru like Har Rai, who had succeeded Guru Hargovind, drew the emperor’s ire for the alleged help he gave to the fugitive Dara Shikoh during the war of succession that followed Shah Jahan’s illness. Guru Har Rai sent his elder son Ram Rai to talk things over with the emperor and later his younger son, Harkrishan, brought to the court with the help of Jai Singh.

Harkrishan, who had succeeded his father as the child Guru, lived at the palace of Jai Singh about the year 1664 and held discussions there with the Mughal heir apparent, Prince Muazzam (later Bahadur Shah I). But the Guru died soon after under mysterious circumstances. Some say he was a victim of smallpox, but the general belief is that he was done away with on the orders of Aurangzeb.

The palace of Jai Singh became the headquarters of his descendant, Jai Singh II, while the latter was building the Jantar Manter (1724-25). It was eventually acquired by the Sikh panth and converted into a gurdwara.

The building which has come up as Bangla Sahib makes one wonder how history repeats itself. It was at the site of the pleasure garden of Raja Man Singh, Akbar’s general, passed on to Raja Jai Singh, that the Taj Mahal was built because it was found to be the most suitable place in Agra.

The Rajput connection links the Taj Mahal and the Bangla Sahib as the full moon sheds its lustre on them on purnima (full moon) nights.

241,2020/02/05,"14 lakh ryots being denied voting rights, says Ponnala","Former PCC president Ponnala Lakshmaiah has alleged that 14 lakh farmers are being denied voting rights in the elections to the Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies and Farmers Service Cooperatives in the State.

He said the hurried manner with which the government has announced elections to the agricultural societies without giving any scope for revision of voters and members indicates that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao wants to complete the process.

This, he said, was due to the fact that the Chief Minister fears the farmers who would vote against the TRS supported candidates questioning the government on denial of loan waiver and partial release of Rythu Bandhu. As the government failed to release the loan waiver funds, farmers’ dues have increased with the interest growing. Farmers are angry and Mr. Rao has realised it, and that is why the elections are being held in a hurried manner without involving the farmers. “Mr. Rao can’t face the farmers, given the fact that all his promises are yet to be fulfilled,” he said. Mr. Lakshmaiah alleged that the government has collected ₹ 390 crore from sheep rearing societies and ₹1,040 crore from the fishermen societies as advance but it is yet to give any assistance to them. With the closure of Telangana State Co-Operative Marketing Federation Limited (Markfed), farmers are not getting any remunerative prices, he alleged.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/14-lakh-ryots-being-denied-voting-rights-says-ponnala/article30745509.ece
242,2020/02/05,Forest staff told to be on guard against fires,"Expressing serious concern over two successive instances of fire in the Amrabad Tiger Reserve, in which a total of 26 hectares of forest land was burnt, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (PCCF) and Head of Forest Force (HOFF) R. Shoba has asked all district-level forest officials to be on constant alert.

Addressing the forest officials and staff through a video conference on Wednesday, Ms. Shoba asked them to take fire prevention measures.

In view of summer round the corner, utmost priority should be given to prevention of fire incidents in forests. Awareness programmes should be taken up on forest paths and abutting villages, to sensitise people about prevention of accidents, she said.

During past survey, a total of 1,106 compartments in 43 forest ranges have been identified as fire-prone. Ms.Shoba has directed constitution of quick response teams with five members, vehicle, and blowers for fire extinguishing. Fire lines should be demarcated in all compartments to prevent spread of fire, she said.

Forest fires are being monitored through satellites by the Forest Survey of India, and mobile alerts about fire accidents are issued to officials concerned and also to the nearest village secretary. So far, a total of 11,700 names and phone numbers have been registered for this purpose, a statement from the department said.

Funds will be made available in all districts for taking fire prevention measures, Ms. Shoba assured, and asked the officials to be on guard till May. Travellers should be sensitised against throwing lit stubs of cigarettes and beedis, and also against making fire for cooking inside forests, especially in view of the Medaram jatara, she said.

The meeting also discussed forest rejuvenation, urban forest parks, works taken up with CAMPA funds, compensatory afforestation, and nurseries for next Haritha Haram season.

Noting that there were 11.79 lakh LIC agents across the country, he said if the government went ahead with the proposal, the agents, LIC employees, including Development Officers, and policyholders would hold protests in Delhi’s Rama Lila Maidan or Jantar Mantar. The dates were yet to be decided, he added.

On reasons for opposing the Budget proposal, he said post the stake sale there would not be any guarantee for the money invested by policyholders of LIC. “We procured this business as people’s money for people’s welfare.

248,2020/02/05,"Pressure on media in a polarised environment, says Barkha Dutt","Television journalist and anchor Barkha Dutt has said there is tendency to put pressure on media, not only on “political people”, in the present highly-polarised environment to align with one ideology or the other.

Sometimes, there may be only one position to take depending on an issue, but as journalists, one should be willing to engage with all kinds of opinions as there is more than one dimension to a story, she said. “I am a free thinker and I don’t subscribe to any dogma. One need not be an Arnab Goswami or Arundhati Roy. There is a middle path between these extremes,” she said.

Ms. Dutt was here to address the FICCI Ladies Organisation on ‘Changing nature of Indian Media’ here on Tuesday and interacted with mediapersons.

Today’s fast changing technology, the journalist said, has given a huge opportunity to those interested in providing better content and journalists have their own personal brand but the challenge is the polarised environment. “Never before the charge of bias was used so casually because viewers and audience already with a view were looking for confirmation bias,” she added.

Asked about the reality of Shaheen Bagh protests in Delhi against CAA and NRC, she said she found it quite extraordinary as there had never been such mass mobilisation of Muslim women, some of them 90-years-old, carrying the tricolour. It created a moral pressure on the government, but now, it is becoming politicised with BJP making it an election issue, she averred.

She said NRC could weaponise the CAA and that the problem was not fast-tracking the citizenship of those persecuted in their countries but for putting a religious filter to it.

On the likely outcome of Delhi election, Ms. Dutt said she did not wish to get into number crunching but “my gut feeling is Delhi will go with the trend of people voting differently for State elections and national elections”.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/2cewdy/article30737664.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04-BARKHA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/pressure-on-media-in-a-polarised-environment-says-barkha-dutt/article30737656.ece
249,2020/02/05,Bike manufacturer ordered to refund money,"A consumer forum directed motorcycle manufacturer Royal Enfield to refund ₹25,000 which a customer had paid online for booking a limited-edition two-wheeler and pay ₹10,000 as compensation. While the company stated that a refund was processed, the complainant maintained that he did not receive any such payment.

The District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum Hyderabad–I was dealing with a complaint filed by G. Anil Kumar, a resident of Parsigutta. He said after finding out about the limited-edition bike, he made the payment on July 25, 2018, but the company cancelled his booking and did not refund the money.

The complainant also said he received a letter the next day informing him of the ‘cancellation’ without ascribing reasons. Two days after that, he received another letter stating that the transaction did not go through given the fact that several potential customers also had made bookings. He said that thereafter no refund reflected in his bank account.

For their part, the company stated their payment gateway had processed the refund but the complainant’s bank had blocked his credit card through which payment was made and that the complainant was informed about this. It also stated the amount was with the bank.

The forum stated no deficiency of service has been noted. However, it did state that the company did not furnish proof that the complainant’s credit card was blocked by the bank. “In the absence of such documentary proof, the self-serving claims that the refund was already processed with the CC Avenue and complainant received the amount cannot be taken as sacrosanct,” it noted.

Airline pulled up

A consumer forum directed SpiceJet Ltd. to pay ₹7,000 as compensation towards flight cancellation, ₹4,818 as refund of ticket amount and ₹3,000 as costs.

The same forum was dealing with a complaint filed by Jay Prakash Minda, his wife Shalu Minda and their minor son. They stated having booked tickets to Chennai from Hyderabad for June 16, 2017, and back to Hyderabad. However, they were told their flight was delayed and subsequently cancelled due to issues beyond their control.

The airline stated they were not liable to pay the differential amount as claimed by the complainants as the flight cancellation was informed in advance. They also said despite asking the complainants to approach the helpdesk for a refund, they did not comply.

The forum held that while the respondents are not liable to pay the differential amount, cancellation of flights causes ‘mental agony’. The forum cited the case of Rajasthan State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission’s order of Indian Airlines Limited vs V.A. Singh and stated that compensation must be awarded in case of flight cancellation as it causes mental agony.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bike-manufacturer-ordered-to-refund-money/article30737648.ece
250,2020/02/05,Miscalculation costs GHMC dear,"GHMC is losing several lakhs of rupees every year by way of property tax, owing to miscalculation of the deviation penalty payable by various commercial establishments in the North Zone.

More than 50 commercial establishments and complexes have not been paying the tax for the last three to four years, miffed with the inflated property tax bills, sources informed. “Our complex was constructed way back in 1995, and as per applicable law, I am not required to pay more than 10% penalty for deviations in the structure. I paid the same amount for several years, till the authorities started charging me 100% penalty,” Vittal Ram (name changed), a commercial complex owner from Regimental Bazaar, who has been doing rounds of GHMC, said.

About four years ago, all these complexes were served notices for payment of unauthorised construction penalty of 100%.

Attempts to represent to the circle-level authorities were not successful, and in protest, the owners have stopped paying property tax. “After a while, the official who initially overcharged us got transferred, and whoever came in later continued the same assessment.

Any number of representations would not help, as no official was willing to take the onus of reducing the tax amount upon himself,” another owner said.

As per the rulebook, only 10% penalty for deviations should be levied on property tax for structures built after March 1, 1994 and up to December 14, 2007. For the structures rising since since December 15, 2007 up to August 4, 2013, the penalty for deviations has been fixed at 25% of the property tax.

For structures coming up after August 4, 2013, the unauthorised construction penalty has been revised to anywhere between 25% and 100%, based on the extent of deviation.

Accordingly, if the deviation from the sanctioned plan is below 10%, the penalty will be 25% on the tax amount. If it is more than 10%, 50% penalty is chargeable. If the deviation from sanctioned plan is 100%, a penalty of 100% will be charged on the property tax.

Approached for their version, GHMC officials admitted off the record that several complexes in areas such as Regimental Bazaar, Kalasiguda, Ranigunj, Monda Market, Patigadda, Begumpet and Prakash Nagar had stopped paying property tax owing to a flaw in calculation, which nobody was ready to rectify.

“For the last four years, it has been a game of who would blink first. The complex owners are not approaching the court of law seeking redress, nor are GHMC officials trying to seize the properties despite non-payment of property tax. In the bargain, the corporation is losing several lakhs of rupees every year,” an official shared.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/miscalculation-costs-ghmc-dear/article30737630.ece
251,2020/02/05,Finance Minister’s Harappan reference puzzles historians,"In her second Budget speech on Saturday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman used information from Harappa seals to buttress claims about India’s maritime trade a few millennia ago.

While India’s maritime trade in the historic period is quite well known, what left historians puzzled was the Minister’s use of words and their meanings from the seals.

“The script has not been deciphered satisfactorily. There are some claims but they are not accepted by leading scientists,” said K.P. Rao of the University of Hyderabad when asked about the claim.

Another historian, Tathagata Neogi dismissed the claim about the decipherment of the script. “We don’t know the language spoken by the people. Unless we get a clue like the Rosetta Stone or multiple cuneiforms in one location, the language may remain untranslated,” he said.

Minister’s speech

Reading from her speech, the Finance Minister had said: “The guilds of Saraswati-Sindhu civilisation and the Harappan seals are remarkable. They belong to 3300 BCE. Words from the Indus Script-hieroglyphs have been deciphered. Commerce and trade-related words show how India for millennia is continuing as rich in skills, metallurgy, trade etc. ‘Takara Kolimi=Tin smithery’, ‘Sreni’ = Guild, ‘Sethi’= wholesale merchant, ‘Poddar’= Assayer of metal into the treasury.”

Indus script

The word ‘Sreni’ translated as ‘guild’ used by Ms. Sitharaman could be traced to a paper published by S. Kalyanaraman in 2016. Mr. Kalyanraman is a former banker who is now part of Sarasvati Sindhu Research Centre in Chennai.

Incidentally, 2019 was a bumper year for the decipherment of Indus script with four authors registering their books for publication with the Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN.

“Scholars are facing three challenges for the decipherment of the script,” says Mr Rao. “Devanagari was key to the decipherment of Brahmi script used for Ashoka edicts. But in the case of Indus Valley Civilisation, the link is broken and it doesn’t match with any modern script. The second hurdle is we don’t know the language. We don’t even know whether it was written from left to right or right to left,” asserted Mr. Rao.

Historian B.B. Lal has hypothesised that the script is from right to left, unlike modern Indian languages which are left to right.

The other notable example of an attempt to decipher the Indus Script was made by S.R. Rao who discovered the Lothal site of Harappan Civilisation.

Not surprisingly, the budget has a proposal for setting up a maritime museum in Lothal.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/hyaby5/article30737600.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY04-NIRMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/finance-ministers-harappan-reference-puzzles-historians/article30737587.ece

254,2020/02/05,Budget discussed threadbare,"Tax experts, industry leaders as well as veteran bureaucrats who had held important posts on Tuesday hailed a few of the Union budget 2020-21 proposals while seeking to be critical of some others, including a lesser devolution to States, reduction in allocation towards MGNREGS and missing an opportunity to spur demand.

ASCI chairman and former Union Home Secretary K. Padmanabhaiah said lesser devolution is bound to affect growth of infrastructure in the States. Telangana State Council of industry body FICCI, in association with ASCI and BDO India, had organised the post-budget symposium here.

Pointing out that the budget came amid an economic slowdown and rising unemployment, he said expectations from it were high. Many viewed it as an opportunity for the government to spur consumption. He welcomed the budget for measures aimed at encouraging startups and the proposal to have Taxpayers’ Charter.

Chairman of FICCI-Telangana State Council T. Muralidharan said it was time the government acknowledged role of entrepreneurs in the country’s development and improved credit flow to MSMEs.

ASCI Director General S.K. Pattanayak said MGNREGS expenditure has been reduced by ₹10,000 crore and the budget is silent on Farmer Producer Organisations. Making a presentation on the direct tax proposals, BDO Partner (Tax and Regulatory Services) Pradeep Kasthala said taxpayers switching to the new, simplified personal tax regime have an option of reverting to the old regime. Some of the tax proposals are likely to take more time and efforts in terms of planning and compliance.

Partner, Indirect Taxes of BDO-India Abhinav Shrivastava said the budget has increased customs duty rates on certain products that are also made in India to boost domestic manufacturing.

255,2020/02/05,Four suspected nCoV patients admitted in two city hospitals,"Four more people with travel history to China were admitted in isolation wards of Gandhi Hospital and Fever Hospital after they showed symptoms of Novel Coronavirus (nCoV) such as cold and fever. While one was admitted on Monday night, three more were admitted on Tuesday.

Their samples will be tested at the virology laboratory at Gandhi Hospital and the results verified by National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune.

Meanwhile, three earlier samples tested negative for nCoV while the results of four other samples are expected to be known by Wednesday evening. Till date, 21 samples from State have tested negative for the virus.

Apart from 25 people who were isolated in government hospitals, most of whom were discharged, 26 more are quarantined at home for 28 days. Their condition is being monitored by Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme teams.

In the wake of World Health Organisation declaring 2019-nCoV outbreak as Public Health Emergency of International Concern, health officials here said they have strengthened surveillance and control measures against nCoV.

Passengers who take flights coming from China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia are screened using thermal scanners at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Shamshabad. A total of 3,297 passengers have been screened till date.

Officials have urged people arriving from nCoV-affected countries to isolate themselves at home for 28 days from the date of arrival in India, irrespective of whether they have symptoms or are asymptomatic. They have also appealed for following cough etiquette by covering the mouth with handkerchief while sneezing or coughing.

‘Suspend breathanalyser tests temporarily’

Founder of city-based NGO Vaada Foundation, P. Suresh Raju has requested Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar to temporarily suspend breathanalysers during drunk driving checks to avoid possible spread of Novel Coronavirus.

Mr Raju said he was a strong advocate of such routine checks but when he was stopped during a drunk driving check at Jubilee Hills three days ago, he was reluctant about undergoing the breathanalyser test suspecting that the police were using same straw for multiple people. “Besides, when people blow into the device, droplets of their saliva fall on it. This is one of the ways in which nCoV can spread,” Mr. Raju said.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/four-suspected-ncov-patients-admitted-in-two-city-hospitals/article30737504.ece
256,2020/02/05,"Heralding jazz, looking for the blues","For Mumbai’s jazz lovers, here comes another celebration, with the two-day World Jazz Festival being held at the St Andrews Auditorium, Bandra, on February 22 and 23. Since the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Nariman Point, has its International Jazz Festival in November, this is an ideal destination for suburban audiences.

The event is being conceived and produced by Banyan Tree Events with knowledge consultancy from Amersfoort Jazz, which organises a festival in the Netherlands. Before Mumbai, it will take place in Pune on February 21. The performers are South African pianist Ntando Ngcapu and his band, Dutch trumpeter Saskia Laroo, the New York Round Midnight Orchestra, also from the Netherlands, and the Koh Mr Saxman and Takeshi Band from Thailand. Guest appearances by Indian artistes are planned too.

Destination Bandra

Of late, several jazz events in Mumbai have focused on vocals, guitars and keyboards. It will be wonderful to hear the saxophone and trumpet in full swing at the World Jazz Festival. The Round Midnight Orchestra played at the last NCPA event with two saxophonists and a trumpeter, but they had a guest performer, American vocalist Deborah Carter that time. Their set should hopefully be different. Indian audiences are familiar with Laroo, described by some as the ‘female Miles Davis’. A versatile performer, Laroo blends her jazz trumpet with world music, electronic music and hip-hop. She’s also scheduled to play at the Trumpets Around The World show at Experimental Theatre on February 29.

Coming a fortnight after the Mahindra Blues Festival at the Mehboob Studio, the World Jazz Festival will be the second major international music festival in Bandra this month. Come to think of it, the western suburb has a fairly large audience for jazz and blues, and it’s good to see more action there.

In the past, St Andrews has hosted many international jazz gigs like the band Spyro Gyra, violinist Jean-Luc Ponty, guitarist John McLaughlin and his group The 4th Dimension, and guitarist Scott Henderson. Besides the annual Mahindra Blues, Mehboob Studio has had a show by the eclectic group Snarky Puppy, which incorporates jazz elements. In 2018, Balgandharva Rangmandir featured legendary pianist Chick Corea and the John DI Martino Quartet, but has slowed down since.

Among the nightspots, Bandra Base off Waterfield Road has regular jazz gigs. Last October, the Blubop Cafe was opened on Linking Road, Khar, to cater to jazz and blues buffs. Its Friday night live shows attract a huge crowd. For its monthly vinyl listening sessions, the Adagio multi-activity centre on Chapel Road has chosen the blues as its February theme.

Over the next few years, one should hopefully see more jazz and blues events around Bandra. The MMRDA Grounds and Jio Garden in Bandra Kurla Complex have seen lots of rock and Indie music acts, but after the One Tree Festival some 12 or 13 years ago, there has barely been any blues. With Jio planning to have performing arts at its World Centre, one hopes there is a fair amount of jazz.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/vonzev/article30744410.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Round-Midnight-Orchestra,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/heralding-jazz-looking-for-the-blues/article30744411.ece
257,2020/02/05,Sanaya Ardeshir to perform at Heatwave,"Prepare for a heatwave in Kochi.

An electronic music showcase, ‘Heatwave’, will be organised by Kekao, a local underground music collective. Launched at the Kochi Muziris Biennale in January, 2019, Kekao brought to the city electronic artistes playing experimental music at its maiden event.

In the second edition, which begins on February 7, the line-up is longer and includes leading EDM artistes such as Sanaya Ardeshir, XCPT, a record label from Italy and home-grown talent such as The Derelicts (band), Stalwart John and DJ Obscuit.

“The event will offer two different experiences,” says Navath Rahin, the founder of Kekao. While the opening day, February 7, will focus on experimental and ambient music, the second day will play European EDM—techno and electro.

Delikwe and Nothus, artistes who played in the last edition are back this year, and will be joined by Marco Segato and Cem3340, who are also part of XCPT.

“The electronic music scene is developing fast in Kochi and we have been receiving great responses,” says Navath. Kekao has completed five gigs in less than a year. A team of five people, Kekao brings artistes to the city, programmes the event and promotes underground artistes by giving them a platform.

“There are a number of talented artistes pushing their own brand of music. We also promote street culture and new music trends,” says Navath.

The event will be held on February 7 and 8 at Pepper House, Fort Kochi.

‘My music is emotional’

Sanaya Ardeshir, who calls herself Sandunes, will be headlining the show on day one, presenting her ‘Hand of Thought’, a piano-based project, which explores the possibilities of the piano, and new experiments in orchestration. Incubated for over two years between Mumbai, Berlin and London, the project would be Sanaya’s special showcase. A Mumbai-based producer, composer and synth player, Sanaya musical influences are drawn from jazz, dubstep and London electronica with South Asian influences.

Excerpts from an interiew with Sanaya.

You have been inspired by jazz to rock, funk and blues. How would you define your music?

These days I’m thinking about my music (and all music) as “emotional”— and I'm trying to be mindful about creating work that moves people on a very basic, human level.

I think we live in an extremely exciting time, and although technology and social media has made it so easy to stay tapped in to what’s going on and draw inspiration from sub-cultures in far away parts of the world, it has also become scary how much those same tools pose threats to our mental health, and tendencies towards connection and community. In that light, I feel like it’s become increasingly important to make music that brings people closer to their emotional selves in some way or the other.

What are you working on currently?

Currently I’m working on some new music which features several different vocalists and I’m exploring the idea of bringing different disciplines, languages, and modalities of music-making together. I’m feeling inspired to create after a bit of a slump, and that has pointed me in a new direction of song-writing that’s influenced by Carnatic music and even some Bollywood.

Which city has influenced your music more, Mumbai or London?

Initially and when I was only just beginning, I was super inspired by what was happening in London.. That's probably because I was super thirsty for knowledge, inspiration and new sounds and there was a limited range of what was happening locally. But more recently Mumbai has influenced a lot of my ideas around identity, belonging, and the role music needs to play - in a social context - especially in the current political climate - to bring people together in a manner that's inclusive and non-violent.

What are your musical plans for the future? Any new collaborations in the offing?

My musical plans are a bit polarised at the moment - I'm trying to stay focused on the current ideas so I can explore them in depth and retain a commitment to a certain approach and style within the music making process. And at the same time, I’m planning to explore sounds from new geographies and traditions and I'm keen to dip my toes into terrain that's completely new to me.

How do you see your audience? Has the culture of music appreciation changed in India?

I believe so. I see my audience as informed, engaged, and thoughtful about what they’re consuming.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/m50t9s/article30742424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Sandunes1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sanaya-ardeshir-to-perform-at-heatwave/article30742425.ece
258,2020/02/05,It’s a country run by fascists: Kavitha Lankesh,"If Gauri Lankesh had not been shot, she would have been at the forefront of the anti-CAA protests, said her sister and filmmaker Kavitha Lankesh.

In the two-and-a-half years since journalist Gauri Lankesh was shot dead in Bengaluru, the political situation has only worsened with people feeling increasingly unsafe in their own country, Ms. Lankesh said. “It is a country run by fascists and incompetent people, where people are hunted down and shot,” she said.

Ms. Lankesh was in the city to inaugurate a two-day cultural event commemorating Bob Marley’s 75th birthday, organised by the People’s Political Platform at Fort Kochi. A few lines she read out in memory of her sister said that if Gauri Lankesh, who had not even had an Aadhaar card, had been around, she would have been “behind bars for sedition, or in a detention camp, or shot over and over again.”

Pointing to the growing atmosphere of repression, she said that they were denied permission for a meet in Bengaluru last month to mark Gauri’s birthday.

In the event of the 18th suspect in Gauri Lankesh’s murder being arrested last month, Ms. Lankesh said that finding the masterminds who planned the attack was important, rather than just those who executed it.

She hoped that the fight against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act would continue.

Justice Amit Rawal issued the directive on a petition filed by P.K. Manoj and another person from Vypeen seeking a directive to the District Police Chief (Kochi city) to stop unauthorised parking on both sides of approach roads towards Goshree bridges. According to the petitioners, the authorities were not taking appropriate action to stop illegal parking.

260,2020/02/05,Call to expedite decision on private industrial estates,"The scarcity of space on industrial estates has once again triggered a call from entrepreneurs in the district to the government to speed up decision on allowing private industrial estates in the State.

“All industrial estates are filled to capacity and there is little or no space left in any of them,” said Sojan Joseph, an entrepreneur in the Edayar industrial area, heart of the industrial belt in the district. He said that there were around 300 units operating on about 400 acres and there had been constant demand for more space for new units.

The Kerala State Small Industries Association (KSSIA) too has appealed to the government to speed up decision on allowing private industrial estates. The decision has been pending since 2017 when the government had begun considering the proposal for allowing individuals to develop infrastructure for enterprises to start operations.

“Small and medium enterprises are always on the lookout for space for launching their operations and Kerala must imitate States like Gujarat, Maharashtra and Telangana in getting industrial space ready,” said M. Khalid, president of KSSIA, in a submission to the Finance Minister ahead of the State Budget which would be presented on Friday. He was of the view that if entrepreneurs were offered space with basic facilities like water, electricity and road connectivity, there would be no scarcity of new enterprises.

Industries Department sources said that a government order in this connection was likely to be issued soon and that a decision was pending as there was some confusion over the minimum land extent that could be developed into industrial estates.

P.K. Somanathan in Angamaly industrial area, one of the first industrial estates in the State, said that there were 115 units operating out of the estate spread over 238 acres. Space had been a major constraint for further development. The industrial units’ association had also submitted a plea to the department to assist in developing facilities like a common effluent treatment plant as well as road in the industrial area, he said.

The Aluva industrial area too has been suffering from shrinking space. There had been a long-pending demand from the industries association for allocation of land for a building to house workers, said C.P. Subairudeen. There were seventy industrial units operating out of 68 acres in the area, he said. Decades-old demands such as common facilities and expansion of the industrial area had not been met so far, he added.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/call-to-expedite-decision-on-private-industrial-estates/article30744057.ece

The board will continuously monitor the debris removal and dust levels at the sites. A team of board officials carried out site sampling work at the Alfa Serene apartment building site in the morning. “The SLMC had asked the board to closely monitor the debris removal till it was over. We have to ensure that all construction and demolition waste are transported in covered vehicles only,” said M.A. Baiju, Chief Environmental Engineer, Regional Office of the board in Ernakulam.

SLMC Chairman A.V. Ramakrishna Pillai, who had visited the sites on February 3, had made it clear that the Maradu municipal secretary was responsible for the safe handling of construction waste. The board had to ensure that the removal was in accordance with the Construction and Demolition Rules, 2016 aimed at protecting the environment.

The committee had asked the Maradu municipality authorities to ensure that CCTV was installed at the strategic points of all sites to make the monitoring process effective. The civic authorities had pointed out that it would be difficult to install cameras as there was no power supply at the sites. The chairman had directed that alternate power support had to be provided and the direction should be implemented without raising lame excuses.

He also directed that a tri-party agreement should be entered into by the service providers, municipality and the party who would further manage the materials.

262,2020/02/05,HC nod for fireworks display at temple,"A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Wednesday directed the District Collector to permit the Ernakulam Kshetra Kshema Samiti to conduct fireworks display on two days in connection with the annual festival of Ernakulam Shiva Temple.

The Bench comprising Justice C.T. Ravikumar and Justice N. Nagaresh directed the District Collector to issue permit by way of licence to conduct fireworks on February 5 and 7 strictly by using the firework items mentioned in the application submitted to the district authorities seeking permission.

The court while issuing the directives stayed the District Collector’s order rejecting the request of the committee.

The Bench also ordered that barricades be put up at a distance of 100 metres from the firework display site and that no persons except those who handled the materials be permitted to enter within the 100-metre radius.

The court directed the authorities, including the police and Fire and Rescue

Services Department, to ensure that competent officers were deputed to see that the fireworks would be conducted in accordance with the conditions and that only permitted firework items were used during the display.

When the petition came up for hearing, the Government pleader submitted that the Collector had refused licence for the fireworks display on the ground that the temple authorities would not be able to provide the distance norm of 100 metres between the crowd and the display site.

The court pointed out that the authorities had not carried out any measurement to find out whether a space of 100-metres distance could be made available at the temple site or not.

In his petition, Samiti secretary A. Balagopalan said that the temple festival was one of the grand festivals in the city. Every year on the day of ‘Valiya vilakku’, ‘Pakalpooram’ was conducted and immediately after the ‘Pakalpooram’, fireworks were displayed as a customary practice.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-nod-for-fireworks-display-at-temple/article30744050.ece

Justice Devan Ramachandran issued the directive when a case relating to removal of waste from the Thevara-Perandoor canal came up for hearing.

In a report given to the High Court, K.T. Nisar Ahammed, member secretary, Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA) and head of the High Court-appointed monitoring committee which inspected the Perandoor Canal, submitted that at Kammattippadam, railway line had been laid across the canal. There was only a small passage of about one-metre width below the railway line, blocking the flow of water in the canal. Besides, at Kallupalam where the Konthuruthy river joins Perandoor Canal, silts had been accumulated at the mouth of the river joining the canal. A bridge was constructed near the site in such a manner that flow of water was obstructed. There was a reduction of the width of the canal as well. Moreover, sewage outlets from the nearby buildings were emptied into the canal.

The report also pointed out that the Kochi Corporation had also encroached on the canal at the Thevara market near Pandit Karuppan Road by constructing a road. The committee also noticed that most of the sewage outlets of buildings at Panampilly Nagar were also emptied into the canal. The report also pointed out that no period cleaning of the canal had been undertaken.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/hc-tells-panel-to-clear-blocks-in-perandoor-canal/article30744047.ece

The National Marine Biodiversity Museum, various laboratories, marine research aquarium and hatcheries were big attractions and displayed a variety of marine aquatic life. The exhibits offered a platform to acquire knowledge about the secrets of marine biodiversity.

The visitors were treated to a rich collection of a wide spectrum of niches ranging from estuaries to coastal and deeper waters of the Indian seas. The visitors were also able to see the “largest fish – whale shark”, horse shoe crab, sea snakes, sea birds, pearl oyster, sea cow, dolphins and sharks.

Earrings

Earrings made of fish otoliths exhibited at CMFRI drew attention of the visitors. There was a rush to have a close look at the ornaments in different sizes and designs. Though majority of the fish have otoliths, only that of around ten species are suitable for making ornaments.

Researchers at CMFRI regularly use these otoliths as taxonomic tool for identification and estimation of fish age.

266,2020/02/05,Kinfra awaits Central nod to begin work on petrochem park,"Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Kinfra) is awaiting clearance from the Ministry of Environment and Forests to begin work on the proposed petrochemicals park coming up on more than 300 acres at Ambalamugal, the property purchased from the public sector Fertilizers and Chemicals Travancore (FACT).

The land and documents for the park were formally handed over to Kifnra by the District Collector last week paving the way for the government-owned consultancy and infrastructure developer to begin preparations for the project in tandem with the Union government clearance.

A detailed project report on the proposed petrochemicals park too had been submitted to the Government, Kinfra sources said. They said that of the 481 acres acquired by the State Government from FACT, 170 had been handed over to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), which was setting up a petrochemicals plant to produce polyols at Kochi refinery.

The petrochemicals park has been long in the making with the initial proposal having been made about a decade ago. The State budget 2018-19 had said that Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board would release ₹1,264 crore for land acquisition. The Centre and the Kerala Government signed an agreement for transfer of 481 acres of FACT land in 2017 and permission for the land transfer was received in July 2019.

Kinfra’s responsibilities include development of the land, and providing infrastructure like road, water and electricity for potential investors in the park.

In the meanwhile, the first unit of BPCL’s propylene derivatives petrochemical project at Kochi refinery is expected to be commissioned in about five months. The petrochemicals project has three units - acrylics, acrylic acids and oxoalcochol. Once commissioned, BPCL refinery will produce niche petrochemicals, significantly reducing India’s import dependence.

The project involves an investment of over ₹5,200 crore. The initial State Government plan was to ensure that the petrochemicals park was ready in tandem with the commissioning of the BPCL project.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/kinfra-awaits-central-nod-to-begin-work-on-petrochem-park/article30740088.ece

Inaugurating the protest, CITU secretary K. Chandran Pillai said minimum wages was a human right. While some hospitals in the private sector had implemented minimum wages, some others had moved court against the Labour Department. Many were working in private hospitals without minimum wages in the past 29 months, he said.

United stand

All health-care employees need to be organised in the fight for minimum wages. For this, private laboratories, scanning centres, and other institutions related to health care should also be brought under the purview of minimum wages, he said.

Federation president M. Anil Kumar presided.

The federation also demanded that hospitals desist from contractual appointments.

A welfare fund for employees should also be formed besides bringing in the private hospital employees Act to provide security to the employees.

Nurses and other employees from private hospitals joined the protest as the nurses’ associations that spearheaded the struggle earlier were not functioning in many hospitals now.

Presiding over a meeting of the nodal officers in the district, he told them that if a patient had visited a corona virus-affected region, the information had to be immediately conveyed to the district control room or Disha on 1056 or 0471-2552056. Instructions received from the Health Department would have to be followed regarding the patient’s movement.

Mr. Suhas said the move to hike prices of masks and gloves, which were part of preventive requirements against the spread of coronavirus, would be strictly dealt with.

The control room at the collectorate can be contacted on 0484-2368802 for any information on the disease.

269,2020/02/05,Water Metro to boost tourism on islands,"With the first air-conditioned vessel for the ₹747-crore Water Metro project expected to roll out of the Cochin Shipyard by November, local bodies, NGOs and others have sought earmarking of at least 2% of the project cost for tourism promotion on the islands along the waterways.

The first vessel will be used primarily to conduct speed and related tests on the waterway spread across the Greater Kochi region. A total of 23 100-seater vessels will be inducted before the last quarter of 2021, it is learnt. The second lot of 55 50-seater ferries will be launched later.

“The State Government must prevail on the Koci Metro Rail Ltd so that it sets apart at least ₹16 crore as corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds to increase tourist footfall in the pristine islands,” demanded George Kattunilath, general secretary of the Greater Cochin Development Watch (GCDW), an NGO.

The Edapally Block Panchayat Council recently passed a resolution, raising a similar demand. “The block panchayat comprises four panchayats – Kadamakudy, Cheranalloor, Mulavukad and Elankunnapuzha, which together have a population of approximately 1.20 lakh,” said Ebenser Chullikat of GCDW.

Development plan

Referring to an integrated development plan for Bolghatty and Vallarpadam islands, readied by the School of Architecture of Government Engineering College, Thrissur, he pointed out how increase in tourist footfall can revive pokkali farming, traditional art forms etc., providing an impetus to local communities. The development plan suggests promotion of tourism by improving water transport connectivity to the locales.

Mr. Chullikat spoke of how Kadamakudy acquired ‘kadannal kudungi’ as its nickname, due to inadequate connectivity with the mainland.

“The Water Metro should be able to change this. Direct ferry services from Fort Kochi, the prime tourist hub in the district, to Eloor via Kadamakudy, covering an approximately 22-km distance, will become a boon to the locale. Above all, the ferry fare must be affordable,” he said.

DPR proposals

Responding to the demand, KMRL sources said the Water Metro’s DPR proposes according the pride of place to tourism, since that will in turn increase patronage for the ferries.

270,2020/02/05,Process to pick new VC for Calicut varsity to begin soon,"The process to pick a new Vice Chancellor for Calicut University is expected to begin soon with the reconstitution of the search panel, retaining all the three members who were part of it earlier.

The varsity does not have a full-time VC now after the retirement of K. Mohammed Basheer in November and V. Anil Kumar, Vice Chancellor, Thunchath Ezhuthachan Malayalam University, is holding additional charge.

University sources said that the tenure of the search panel is three months, which can be extended up to one month by the Chancellor. Applications will be sought from aspirants now and a round of interview may follow. However, it remains to be seen if the panel recommends only one name or a list of names to Governor Arif Mohammed Khan, also the Chancellor of the varsity, who has the final word on the issue. Mr. Khan could raise an objection to the candidate the government wants for the post. It had earlier been reported that he had gone against the wishes of the government while choosing a VC for the Kerala University of Health Sciences. His predecessor, P. Sathasivam, had not reportedly interfered in such appointments.

The opinion of Jagadesh Kumar, Vice Chancellor, Jawaharlal Nehru University, who has been renominated by the University Grants Commission nominee to the new search panel, could also be significant as he may not agree with the views of the other members.

The tenure of the previous search panel ended on November 15 and it could not submit a list of applicants to Mr. Khan. In the previous panel, apart from Mr. Kumar, V.K. Ramachandran, deputy chairman, Kerala State Planning Board, was the Senate nominee; Chief Secretary Tom Jose was the Chancellor’s nominee. Their interview with five short-listed applicants could not be held as Mr. Kumar could not make it to Thiruvananthapuram on November 12. The Governor later decided to reconstitute the panel and the Senate renominated Mr. Ramachandran in December. Now, Mr. Jose and Mr. Kumar had been retained too.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/process-to-pick-new-vc-for-calicut-varsity-to-begin-soon/article30744363.ece
271,2020/02/05,Industrialists share their experiences with students,"The two-day Annual Management Conclave ‘Horizons 2020’, organised by the Industry Interaction Cell (IIC) of Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode (IIM-K), concluded here.

Speakers from diverse backgrounds shared their insights and experiences with the students and faculty members at the event titled ‘Above and Beyond’.

Indian tennis legend Mahesh Bhupathi, who opened the summit, shared his experiences from his days representing the country and discussed the challenges in succeeding against the finest in the world.

The athlete-turned-entrepreneur stressed on the need to nurture a strong sports culture in the country. “India needs a strong top-down funnel for developing world-class talent in sports. Private sports foundations can play a major role in developing world class athletes,” said the ATP world-record holder.

In his interaction with the students, Chairman and Managing Director of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation Limited Mahendra Pratap Mall touched upon the future roadmap of the company and the many hurdles it faced leading up to its fabulously successful listing at the bourses. He referred to the challenges in managing a State-owned enterprise in a price sensitive market and posting a healthy profit growth year after year.

“There are constraints, and there always will be. It is your job to work with them, strategise a plan and execute it for the organisation to achieve sustainable growth,” he said.

Subhalakshmi Nandi, Director of Policy at the International Centre for Research on Women (ICRW), discussed the economic and social aspects of gender and caste-based discrimination.

Debashis Chatterjee, Director IIM-K, said the Live Projects offered in various domains allowed students to have a first-hand experience of the business issues faced by organisations. It is essential that budding managers stay in touch with the real world, while honing their skills in the classrooms, he said.

Entrusted with all non-placement industry-related activities at the IIM-K, the IIC is committed to forging a long-term symbiotic relationship between the institution and the industry.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/industrialists-share-their-experiences-with-students/article30743593.ece

274,2020/02/05,Public events annoy beachgoers,"Calm and peace is what one usually seeks on a visit to the beach. But visitors to the Kozhikode beach these days get anything but. The choice of parts of the beach as venues for public conventions seems to have put a damper on the expectations of tourists to some level.

The issue was brought to the attention of the Kozhikode Corporation council recently by councillor P. Kishenchand. “There seems to be no control over programmes held on the beach these days,” he said and sought the corporation’s intervention in the matter.

It is only the tiled pathway along the beach, extending to the newly renovated South Beach that is mostly under the scanner. The north end of the pathway has become a favourite venue of small programme organisers these days. “It is easy to pull the crowd there and is hence a convenient venue,” said port officer Ashwani Prathap.

The whole beach stretch comes under the Department of Ports and hence any programme organised on the beach requires prior permission from the port officer. “We usually discourage those planning to organise programmes at that part of the beach. But we are often under pressure from various agencies to comply. The scarcity of good venues for public functions in Kozhikode is often highlighted by those seeking permission,” he added.

According to Mayor Thottathil Raveendran, the issue will be brought to the notice of the authorities.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/23bsop/article30738295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04-KI-BEACH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/public-events-annoy-beachgoers/article30738296.ece

276,2020/02/05,Naqvi: anti-CAA protests led to secularisation of Muslim ghetto,"The ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) have led to the secularisation of the Muslim ghetto, veteran journalist Saeed Naqvi has said.

He was here on Tuesday to deliver a lecture in memory of the late President of India, K.R. Narayanan. The event was organised by the Centre for Research and Education for Social Transformation (CREST).

Ayodhya verdict

The CAA followed the Supreme Court verdict that allowed the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya, Mr. Naqvi noted. “The goose that laid the saffron eggs was dead with the court order,” he said.

“However, the CAA is not working the way they [the National Democratic Alliance government] thought it would,” he said. People across the country, irrespective of their religious or community background, were alarmed at the prospect of fishing out documents to prove their ancestry. “The documents from not a small number of people, around 1.2 billion,” he said. The protests against it were led by the youth, who had bypassed the political Opposition. “It has spread everywhere... Wherever there are universities and campuses,” Mr. Naqvi said.

At Shaheen Bagh

Also, the Muslim women up north, who were very timid in coming out of their homes, were now found talking in front of the camera. “Please don’t believe what the TV channels are saying about the Shaheen Bagh protests, that it is led only by Muslim women... these protests have led to the secularisation of the Muslim ghettos,” he said.

Mr. Naqvi said that India had become a “Hindu Raj” from a “British Raj” after Partition itself. The rulers created a muddle around words such as India-Pakistan, Hindu-Muslim, and New Delhi-Srinagar, so that it could not be solved once and for all. “If you touch one of these issues, it will directly get connected to others so that no solution will emerge,” he said.

Recalling his friendship with Narayanan, Mr. Naqvi said that he would not have become the President had he been alive today as the social condition in the country had changed now.

Nampoothiri was present.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/eeqby2/article30738162.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04KI-NAQVI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/naqvi-anti-caa-protests-led-to-secularisation-of-muslim-ghetto/article30738163.ece
277,2020/02/05,"A mobile incinerator for diapers, sanitary pads","Diapers and sanitary napkins constitute a large chunk of the non-biodegradable waste across the world. That they cannot even be recycled, unlike the rest of the plastic waste, make them the most dangerous form of waste.

Disposing of napkins and diapers is a headache for most people, who are not equipped with incinerators. Thus, these objects end up being thrown into the waste bin or clogging the toilets.

The Eco-Friendly Group, a friendly collective under the Sevana Charitable Trust, has come up with a solution to this problem. They have brought two high quality Japanese incinerators to the town, which can be hired by people for a day to burn their household waste.

“This incinerator burns down anything into ashes within seconds. It works at 850 degree Celsius. There is no smoke or foul smell”, Faisal Pallikkandy, chairman of the group, said adding that they would take up only orders from residents’ associations or similar organisations.

The incinerator has a capacity to handle 50 kg of waste at a time and can burn up to one tonne a day. “We charge ₹30 per kg of waste to be burnt. However, anything other than diapers and sanitary napkins will not be allowed”, Mr. Pallikkandy said.

The used diapers and sanitary napkins could be collected and kept aside. The incinerator can be hired by a group of houses for a day to burn collected waste.

“With the ban on single use plastic, there is a chance of these objects getting thrown on the roadsides. Burning them is the only solution”, Mr. Pallikkandy said. Those interested may contact the group on 9744331165 between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to avail of the services.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/a-mobile-incinerator-for-diapers-sanitary-pads/article30738122.ece
278,2020/02/05,"Read the Constitution, Khan tells adversaries","Governor Arif Mohammed Khan on Tuesday came down heavily on Ramesh Chennithala, Leader of the Opposition, stating that he had violated the oath of office by publicly stating that when he was Home Minister in the previous United Democratic Front government, he had appointed T.P. Senkumar as Director General of Police overlooking the seniority of north Indian officer Mahesh Kumar, considering that the former was a Malayali.

Mr. Khan was replying to questions by journalists seeking his response to the Opposition’s demand that the State Assembly pass a resolution seeking the recall of the Governor. “I don’t want to comment about those who are so irresponsible that they publicly say ‘I appointed so and so to such and such a position because of his ethnic background’. I really shudder at the thought of what was said,” he said, without naming Mr. Chennithala.

“When a Minister took an oath, he swore that he will do good to all manner of people without any feeling of favour or ill-will. And here, the limits of all irresponsibility have been crossed,” he said.

He wondered how people could be divided on the basis of ethnicity. “How can I say I will favour her over her because she has a different background. So, people who are irresponsibly speaking against me, I leave it to them. But I request them to read the Constitution. I have no problem if somebody says [something] against me. But be within the bounds of the Constitution,” he said.“I am not here for any confrontation. I have not only the right but also the duty to advise, to encourage and warn.

280,2020/02/05,Preschool education: experts call for policy framework,"Early childhood education is not something that has been streamlined or regulated in the State despite the mushrooming of preschools of different types, both in Government and unaided sectors. Framing a policy for that unregulated territory was among the long-term goals of a seminar organised by the District Institute for Education and Training (DIET), Kozhikode, here on Monday.

DIET senior lecturer U.K. Abdunnasar said the event was an evaluation of a project titled ‘Kalippura’ taken up in preschools attached to 30 Government schools in Kozhikode district. “The attempt was to find out if the students were able to develop their intellectual, physical, creative, knowledge and social skills. Parents too were involved in the process. Normally, teachers focus on developing their arithmetic and linguistic skils, which we didn’t,” he pointed out.

It was observed that providing education in their mother tongue would help children evolve better. It would develop their social and literacy skills. Also, it was better to initially teach children through play and games rather than forcing numbers and letters on them. Involving parents in the process helped them track the growth of their wards, said Mr. Abdunnassar. The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) had earlier prepared a teacher’s textbook titled ‘Kalippattam’ and a students’ handbook titled ‘Kalithoni’ to be used in preschools.

Pointing out that not much research had been conducted in the area, DIET officials claimed that preschool education had a pivotal role in the educational system, a fact stressed in the draft of the New Educational Policy as well as the ‘Save Public Education’ campaign undertaken by the State Government. They claimed that there was a need to carry out scientific as well as innovative teaching methods. At the seminar, the participants discussed issues such as a curriculum for preschools, the policies and approach, developmental domains of children and classroom adaptations, disability and inclusion, and the link between children and their natural environments and families. It was opened by M.A. Khader, former director, SCERT, who highlighted the need for a policy framework for preschool education.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/preschool-education-experts-call-for-policy-framework/article30737657.ece
281,2020/02/05,Kozhikode pins high hopes on State Budget,"Despite the State Government facing severe financial crunch, Kozhikode has high expectations from the State Budget to be presented by Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in the Assembly on Friday.

Multiple infrastructure projects such as the construction of flyovers, widening of roads and solutions to parking woes, which have been lying idle for several years, will need budgetary allocation for revival.

The construction of overbridges at Malaparamba and Eranhipalam has been a long-pending demand of city planners to ease traffic snarls on the intersections. The widening of Muthalakulam-Kallai and Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu stretches remains on paper.

The proposal to widen the Muthalakulam-Kallai corridor has been in cold storage for nearly five decades while the expansion of the 8-km Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu stretch on the highway remains a distant dream.

In December, a magistrate’s court had fined historian M.G.S. Narayanan and Gandhian Thayat Balan for picketing the Malaparamba junction in connection with an agitation.

Funds allotment

More than a year ago, the Government said funds would be allotted in three phases. However, the district administration has not been able to utilise the allotted funds for land acquisition or junction improvement.

The government sanctioned ₹100 crore before the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls last year. Four months later, a sum of ₹50 crore was released. But, only ₹2.5 crore had been spent so far, said the Mananchira-Vellimadukunnu Road Action Committee.

Similarly, parking projects have been pending for at least 10 years. Two successive governments had laid the foundation stone for a parking plaza on Link Road, which has not reached anywhere. Proposals for multi-level parking projects at Kidson Corner and Muthalakulam are also in limbo.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/kozhikode-pins-high-hopes-on-state-budget/article30737653.ece

283,2020/02/05,Drought-resistant paddy seeds distributed,"An awareness programme on paddy varieties suitable for summer cultivation was held recently for farmers living in Madurai East and Sivaganga region.

The programme, conducted through the Tamil Nadu Irrigated Agriculture Modernisation Project (TNIAMP), involved discussions on drought-resistant paddy varieties, usage of irrigation monitoring devices and disease-free banana planters.

Dean, Agriculture College, V. K. Paulpandi, who distributed ADT-45 variety seed to farmers, said ryots were educated on the need to increase yield and reduce cost by using the right technology.

N. Seenivasan, associate professor, told the gathering that ADT45 variety would generate good yield even if only half of the usual quantity of water used per acre was available. while normal varieties required 1,250 mm, the drought-resistant type required 40% less (600-800 mm). “Most farmers in this area only cultivate for one season when Vaigai water is available. A variety that requires less water can certainly help,” he said.

Technological intervention by adopting wetting and drying technology for irrigation management could help farmers conserve water during bountiful availability and optimally use it during drought.

“We have provided free drips to farmers in the belt so that they can use soluble fertilizers and biological pest control agents through the drip irrigation system,” he said.

E.G. Ebenezar, Professor and Head, Department of Plant Pathology, elaborated on the presence of rice blast and bacterial leaf blight diseases. He also instructed the farmers to do seed priming or seed treatment with psuedomonas fluoresces, a bio-pest control agent available at Madurai Agricultural College.

284,2020/02/05,Demolition of portion of GRH to begin in June,"Deputy Director of Medical Education T. Sabeetha on Wednesday said the demolition of a portion of Government Rajaji Hospital (GRH) would begin in June. A new structure funded by the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) would come up in its place.

Speaking to The Hindu, Ms. Sabeetha said the State government had received approval for construction of a six-storied structure, along with the ground floor, upon consultation with experts from JICA. While the ground floor would host the emergency room for cardiology, a section for radiodiagnosis and the central sterile supply department, the outpatient ward would be located on the first floor.

All wards would be on the second and third floors. The rest of the floors would have operation and post-operation theatres and intensive care units.

“Work is finally picking up pace with respect to the project. We are beginning the process of listing the equipment necessary for each department such as workstations for anaesthetists, patient monitors, defibrillators, ventilators, ECHO machines and ECG machines,” she said.

Since the machines would include high-end equipment, there was a need to prepare extensive lists and seek approval from JICA representatives before procurement.

The first-level consultation meeting with experts from GRH, representatives from JICA and the Directorate of Medical Education was held here on Monday. The building was expected to become functional by 2022.

A total of ₹330 crore had been estimated for the project that envisaged 24 modular operation theatres with pore-free walls to disallow dust from settling in, making the environment more sterile.

The building would house five departments: General Surgery, ENT, Plastic Surgery, Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery.

Dr. Sabeetha added that although they had received the State government’s approval for land rights at the site in Thoppur where the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) project was slated to come up, there was little clarity about when construction of the medical college and hospital would begin.

JICA representatives were expected to revisit the site and reorganise the existing detailed project report prior to any further move.

287,2020/02/05,District admn. issues advisory to visitors from nCoV-hit regions,"People who have returned from China and other novel coronavirus (nCoV)-affected areas in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and South-East Asia in the last one month have been asked to get in touch with the District Health and Family Welfare Office, Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh said here on Tuesday.

In a press release, Ms. Rupesh said that those who returned from nCoV-affected areas should be in touch with the district health officials regardless of whether they have symptoms of viral infection or not. Those who have come in contact with persons who have returned from nCoV-affected regions should also contact the health officials, she said.

These visitors can contact personnel at the District Health and Family Welfare Office on Ph: 0824 2423672 or personnel at the District Disease Surveillance Office on Ph: 0824-2427316. Calls can also be made to Arogya Sahayavani on Ph: 104. The information that is shared will be kept confidential, she said.

District Health and Family Welfare Officer M. Ramakrishna Rao said that the exercise was being carried out to ensure that virus-infected persons should not go undetected and untreated.

This request has come two days after a person from Kasaragod, who had returned from Japan, reported at a private hospital in the city with cold and fever. When he was asked to undergo treatment in isolation, he left the hospital stating that he will get treatment in Kanhangad, Kerala.

Meanwhile, district health officials said that they have so far not received any case of suspected nCoV. Ten beds have been set apart at the Government Wenlock Hospital in the city and personnel have been sensitised about the treatment procedure.

Meanwhile, at the New Mangalore Port, all the 1,841 passengers and 794 crew of Italian cruise vessel Costa Victoria, which arrived here on Tuesday morning, were screened. After scanning the passengers and the crew members by using a temperature scanner, NMPT officials took a declaration from the master of the vessel of the health status of the passengers and the crew members. The officials also took a copy of the tour itinerary.

About 1,500 passengers opted for a ground tour and visited local churches, temples and other places. The ship, which had come from Mumbai, sailed to Kochi at around 8 p.m. As many as 45 passengers, who disembarked at NMPT, were allowed to move out of the port only after they were found negative for nCoV symptoms, sources said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/iur97u/article30737834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MNCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/district-admn-issues-advisory-to-visitors-from-ncov-hit-regions/article30737835.ece
288,2020/02/05,Evaluation records in Mangalore University being digitised,"In a mega exercise, Mangalore University has begun the process of digitising its ledgers having manually recorded marks of students who have passed out during the 27 years since the university came into being in 1980.

According to Registrar (Evaluation) V. Ravindrachary, all the ledgers from 1980 to 2007 are now being scanned and their images are being stored in digital format.

Many medical, dental, engineering and law colleges had been affiliated to Mangalore University after it was carved out of the University of Mysore and became an independent university in 1980.

After a due course of time, medical and dental colleges came under the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS), Bengaluru, and engineering colleges were brought under the Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belagavi. The law colleges came under the administration of the Karnataka State Law University, Hubballi.

Hence, Mangalore University will have to scan the ledgers having records of marks of old medical, dental, engineering and law graduates.

Mr. Ravindrachary said that the process of scanning and digitising the ledgers of engineering students have been almost completed now.

Digitisation would help in the speedy verification of marks in computers when sought by employers and other agencies. Searching key words such as name of student, course, registration number, name of the college, verification could be carried out without taking much time as in the case of searching in ledgers. In case of verification, it will help all, including the examination section, the employers and those who are to be employed.

Digitisation is being done by Karnataka State Electronics Development Corporation Ltd. (KEONICS), a State government undertaking.

As the evaluation records have been digitised since 2008 onwards, there is no need to scan any records from that year onwards, he said.

Registrar (Administration) A.M. Khan said that the next step in the digitisation process would be recording the personal details of students who have studied in the university during those 27 years.

Mr. Khan said that as the university has entered into an agreement with the National Securities Depository Ltd. (NSDL), the digital data base of the students can be shared on the National Academic Depository. It would also allow students to get access to their academic records on-line.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/wr3dyw/article30739961.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05MNUNIVERSITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/evaluation-records-in-mangalore-university-being-digitised/article30737782.ece
289,2020/02/05,Move to list LIC in Stock Exchange opposed,"Members of the Insurance Employees and Officers’ affiliated to the Federation of LIC Class I Officers’ Association, National Federation of Insurance Field Workers of India (NFIFWI) and All India Insurance Employees’ Association (AIIEA) staged a protest in front of the LIC Divisional Office here on Tuesday against the budget proposal to list LIC of India in the Stock Exchange and sell part of its stake through public offering.

Addressing the protesters, Prabhakar B. Kunder, AIEEA leader, said that the joint front of these major unions representing over 90% of LIC officers and employees strongly opposed this move of the government. The LIC, which was wholly government owned, mobilised small savings of the people and made them available for national development.

Since its inception in 1956, LIC had earned the trust and goodwill of the people of the country. Commencing its operations with a paltry sum of ₹5 crore in 1956, the LIC today commanded a huge asset base of over ₹31 lakh crore. Even after two decades of competition in the life insurance business, the LIC stood tall with a market share of over 73%. It contributed more than 25% to the total budgetary efforts of the Union government. The LIC recently paid a dividend of ₹2,611 crore to the Union government against an initial equity of ₹100 crore. The total dividend paid by LIC since its inception was ₹26,005.38 crore.

Selling a part of LIC’s stake to private interests and its disinvestment would be a blow to the resource mobilisation efforts of the country. At a time when the government was faced with a severe resource crunch because of dwindling tax revenue collections, selling a part of government equity in LIC was akin to killing the goose that laid golden eggs. The government should drop this move, Mr. Kundar said.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/move-to-list-lic-in-stock-exchange-opposed/article30737474.ece

291,2020/02/05,Four-lane work between Hassan and Maranahalli back on track,"Work on four-laning of National Highway 75 between Hassan and Maranahalli in Hassan district, which had almost come to a halt, has resumed after the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) decided to get it done through the sub-contractor of the original contractor.

The initial contract to build the four-lane concrete road (55 km) was awarded to Isolux Corson at a cost of ₹400 crore and the stretch between Addahole and B.C. Road in Dakshina Kannada to Larsen and Toubro Ltd., at a cost of ₹821 crore on EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) mode in March 2017.

With Isolux Corson slowing down the work and later reporting insolvency, NHAI cancelled the contract while the contract with L&T too was cancelled after the company sought to withdraw from the project on the ground of change of scope in the work.

Sub-contractor

NHAI general manager and project director of Hassan-B.C. Road project P.S. Somashekhar told The Hindu that the authority has decided to get the Hassan-Maranahalli work done by Rajkamal Builders, the authorised sub-contractor of Isolux. This was done to avoid delays in completing the work by following procedures, including fresh tenders.

“As of now, 8% of the work is complete; we have given the target of 25% work completion by March this year. We will review the work later and fix deadline for completing the project,” Mr. Somashekhar said. He further said works on culverts and bridges are being done at present even as work on bypasses, including that of 5 km Sakleshpur town, have started.

When The Hindu visited the work site last week, work, including straightening the curves, was being carried out at very few places along the stretch.

NHAI is in the process of choosing the contractor to execute the four-lane work between Addahole and B.C. Road after L&T backed out. The scope of work had to be modified to include three elephant corridors between Addahole and Pariyashanthi and a few vehicular under/overpasses. Bid documents have been submitted to NHAI headquarters for approval, said Mr. Somashekhar.

Potholes repaired

Pending execution of the four-lane work, NHAI has ensured all potholes and craters between Hassan and B.C. Road were filled and the highway was made motorable. Driving on this stretch had become a herculean task during the last monsoon, forcing road users to launch massive campaigns demanding repair.

Affected stretches unattended

Two stretches of NH 75 between Sakleshpur and Maranahalli in Hassan district that were affected by the August 2018 heavy rains continue to remain almost in the same condition.

About 100 m of the highway had slid at Anemahal leaving a very narrow stretch of the carriageway for vehicles. While NHAI has stabilised the base to prevent further sliding, the carriageway at the top remains narrow.

Similarly, another 300 m of the highway near Doddatappale village that was affected by a landslip in the adjacent hillock, remains as it was. The stretch has not seen any restoration work.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/1c8uos/article30737450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGNHAI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/four-lane-work-between-hassan-and-maranahalli-back-on-track/article30737451.ece

293,2020/02/05,Rupee settles nearly flat at 71.24 against US dollar,"The rupee pared initial gains to settle nearly flat at 71.24 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, as market participants await fresh cues from the RBI’s monetary policy.

The rupee opened stronger as hopes of a breakthrough in battling the coronavirus epidemic strengthened investor sentiments, forex traders said.

The domestic unit eroded the initial gains as investors are anticipating no change in key interest rate in the RBI policy meet amid surge in inflation, they added.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is scheduled to announce the outcome of its sixth bi-monthly monetary policy statement for 2019-20 on February 6, 2020.

Moreover, rising crude oil prices and strengthening of the American currency in the overseas market also weighed on the domestic unit, while heavy buying in domestic equities and foreign fund inflows supported the local unit.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local currency opened at 71.25. During the day, the local unit saw a high of 71.16 and a low of 71.29. The Indian rupee finally settled at 71.24, up 1 paisa from its previous close.

“Rupee gained on hopes of a breakthrough in battling the coronavirus epidemic. Risk appetite back on reports of possible vaccines and treatments for the deadly Wuhan virus,” said V.K. Sharma, Head PCG and Capital Markets Strategy, HDFC Securities.

“All eyes will remain on RBI policy stance as markets do not expect any change in interest rate amid surge in inflation. We expect central bank to continue accommodative stance amid temporary spike in inflation,” he added.

298,2020/02/05,Beyond preparedness,"Recent reports suggest that the Union Cabinet will be taking up the proposal to amend the Disaster Management Act of 2005, which largely focuses on improving preparedness, providing immediate relief, and protecting infrastructure. However, it neglects a key aspect of disaster management – long-term recovery.

The Disaster Management Act was enacted to effectively prevent, mitigate and prepare for disasters. It came into being on the heels of three major disasters in the Indian subcontinent: the 1999 super cyclone in Odisha, the 2001 Bhuj earthquake, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The Act mandated the creation of the National Disaster Management Authority, State Disaster Management Authorities, and District Disaster Management Authorities. It laid down the framework, roles and responsibilities of these bodies to formulate and implement disaster management plans at their levels.

The Act rightly emphasises the need to move from responding to disasters to effective preparedness, which has led to most States investing in resilient infrastructure, early warning systems and evacuation. However, steps towards recovery and rehabilitation of disaster-affected people are hardly discussed. How has this imbalance in priorities shaped disaster management since 2005?

Fragmented outcomes

The Act’s enormous emphasis on preparedness has translated into timely warnings, relief shelters and massive evacuation exercises. All these steps have reduced casualties. Further, the National Disaster Response Fund and State Disaster Response Funds have helped guide immediate relief in the aftermath of disasters. Post-disaster rehabilitation and recovery are left to respective Ministries and Departments. However, only select States like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Odisha have department-level disaster management plans. This inconsistent manner of implementation is akin to how the National Disaster Management Plan was drawn up in 2016, 10 years after the enactment of the Act.

While integrating post-disaster rehabilitation measures with existing development schemes can be seen as the right step towards mainstreaming disaster management, it is marred by poor implementation and lack of intent from different ministries and departments. For instance, post-disaster housing reconstruction activities in Odisha are aligned with Central and State housing schemes such as the Biju Pucca Ghar Yojana and the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. However, evidence from research in Ersama, Odisha, shows that pucca houses built under these housing schemes were dilapidated and uninhabited in several places because of costs associated with reconstruction.

Long-term recovery focus

Scholarship on disaster management conceptualises recovery as action taken to rebuild lives once the hazardous situation has passed. However, this has been commonly interpreted as providing food, water and medicines. Even in instances where States have moved beyond this, long-term recovery measures have largely focussed on addressing physical vulnerabilities such as the provision of shelter. While these interventions are crucial, long-term recovery needs much more, but it is tricky because everyday vulnerabilities stemming from poverty are accentuated by recurring hazards.

Recovery measures should address inherent vulnerabilities pertaining to livelihoods, education, water, sanitation, health, and ecology of the disaster-affected communities. Intangible losses such as psychosocial needs of the communities should be given equal emphasis. Long-term recovery needs to be thought of alongside development in an integrated and comprehensive manner by combining with health, skill building, and livelihood diversification schemes. This would ensure that communities have, at the very least, recovered to a new normal before the next disaster strikes. This understanding is crucial to the lawmakers looking to the amend the Act.

299,2020/02/05,Navy to the rescue,"Earlier this week, India sent an amphibious warship, INS Airavat, to Madagascar in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) to help in rescue efforts after the island nation was hit by a cyclone. As part of Operation Vanilla, the Navy delivered clothing, food and medicines, and also provided diving and communication assistance for evacuation. The move follows an appeal by Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina for international help to deal with an unprecedented situation caused by floods.

Component of peacetime strategy

New Delhi’s prompt response doesn’t come as a surprise. In recent years, humanitarian operations have emerged as a key component of the Indian Navy’s peacetime strategy in the IOR. In March 2019, the Navy deployed four warships for relief operations when Mozambique was hit by Cyclone Idai. Indian naval teams played a stellar role in search and rescue operations and even set up medical camps. A few months later, the Navy sent two warships to Japan to assist in rescue efforts following Typhoon Hagibis.

A year earlier, Indian vessels had delivered urgent medical assistance to Sulawesi, Indonesia, after it was struck by a high-intensity earthquake. Operation Samudra Maitri was launched after a telephonic conversation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Indonesian President Joko Widodo, with naval planners mobilising assets and relief material in quick time. The Navy’s new humanitarian approach, many say, is a maritime manifestation of Mr. Modi’s vision for the IOR, christened SAGAR (Security And Growth for All in the Region).

Yet the Navy’s turn towards human-centred maritime security isn’t recent. It was in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami that naval commanders first recognised the importance of large-scale relief and rescue missions in the IOR. For over a decade, considerable resource and energy has been spent developing specialist capability and skills for naval humanitarian operations.

What’s new today is New Delhi’s resolve to burnish its ‘regional security provider’ credentials. The Navy has reached out to countries across the Indo-Pacific region, with greater deployment of assets, personnel and specialist equipment, showcasing an ability to undertake complex and diverse missions. The highpoint of the Navy’s ‘benign’ efforts was the evacuation of over 1,500 Indian expatriates and 1,300 foreign nationals from Yemen in 2015 amid fighting for control of Aden. Three years later, Indian naval ships were in Yemen again, to evacuate 38 Indians stranded in the cyclone-hit Socotra Island.

The Navy’s humanitarian impulse stems from a desire to be a linchpin of security in the IOR. At the core of the evolving operations philosophy is the concept of ‘first responder’, with the capability and willingness to provide assistance. Such an approach has the potential to create an extended sphere of Indian influence in the IOR. Naval leaders recognise that benign missions help project Indian soft power and extend New Delhi’s influence in the littorals. Prompt response during humanitarian crisis helps generate political goodwill in the neighbourhood.

Cause for caution

Yet, there is cause for caution. While low-end naval assets in humanitarian mode create strategic equity for India, prolonged presence of front-line warships in foreign waters has the potential to make partners anxious. Naval power, experts underline, must be deployed discreetly, shaping perceptions in subtle ways. The key is to not let the underlying intent of a mission appear geopolitical.

To ensure that motives aren’t misunderstood, and assistance provided is efficient and cost-effective, it is best to use dedicated disaster-relief platforms. However, unlike the U.S. and China that have in their inventory hospital ships fully equipped for medical assistance, India deploys regular warships and survey ships converted for medical aid. India’s improvised platforms do not match the U.S. Navy’s medical ship USNS Mercy or the People’s Liberation Army Navy’s Peace Ark that enable specialised medical services on a more visible scale.

The Navy’s expanding array of humanitarian missions reveals a need for greater coordination with the Indo-Pacific navies – in particular the U.S. Navy, the Royal Australian Navy and the Japanese Self-Defense Forces — which possess significant experience and assets to mitigate humanitarian threats.

As natural disasters in the IOR become more frequent and intense, India’s regional security role is likely to grow exponentially.

300,2020/02/05,How to reduce NRC’s administrative burdens,"In June 2014, the Modi government set out to change how the government worked. At that time, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke in a meeting of Union Secretaries about “reforming the public service delivery system and bridging the governance deficit” by introducing “self-certification” in place of “affidavits”. That event revealed his enthusiasm and commitment to improving the ease of citizen-state interactions. However, there is little public evidence after that, of the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances systematically following up with government departments to allow self-attestation of documents and to reduce the use of affidavits.

Mr. Modi displayed the same initiative in convincing the public to embrace Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) reforms. He was successful in reframing technocratic goals in populist terms, thereby enhancing DBT reforms’ public legitimacy. Schemes such as Ujjwala demonstrated his government’s adeptness at translating ‘good governance’ into popular politics by expanding market access to cooking gas in rural areas.

Compliance barriers

The reliance on centralised technology solutions as part of DBT reforms has enhanced the effectiveness and efficiency in the operations of government agencies and their private partners. But the absence of concerted efforts towards reorganising the government’s internal processes to improve the ease of identification, authentication, and verification of policy targets creates risks for the long-term viability of the expansion of such digitalised welfare. The hardships for policy targets arise because each of DBT’s inter-linked service conditionalities, such as mobile connectivity, banking, and LPG distribution, spanning many policy domains creates its unique set of hurdles. Each conditionality effectively operates as a sieve that filters out those who are unable to fulfil the compliance requirements. The legitimacy derived from such welfare expansion can potentially diminish if those who are meant to benefit from such digitalised welfare policies exit those social programmes in the long run, due to the intractable nature of the programme’s compliance barriers.

Similarly, in the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam, the tyranny of administrative rule-making combined with centralised, technology-driven administrative processing has created public discontent. Predictably, after the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was passed, public anger spilled over into the streets even before the detailed implementation guidelines were put in place. Much of the political opposition is against the exclusion categories within the letter of the law. However, it is also fuelled by widespread public concerns about rules determining the category of ‘doubtful citizens’, the horrors of paperwork, repeated visits to offices, the fear of political misuse of data, and the administrative discretion engendered by the law’s vast scope.

Thus, Mr. Modi’s challenges are two-pronged. The first is to address the law’s exclusion categories and the second is to reduce public resentment against the IT-driven bureaucracy that, instead of reorganising internal processes to utilise previously submitted citizen data to the government effectively, may likely ask the entire Indian population to resubmit documents to prove their citizenship against the presumption of guilt. However, these protests present an opportunity for Mr. Modi to renew his stalled agenda of making bureaucracy more responsive to the rising expectations of public service quality from its citizens.

Such a reform necessitates laying down the legal accountability frameworks that secure bureaucratic commitment towards the exercise of state power within the constraints of due process of law, especially in matters concerning individual liberties. The demands for a citizen charter, and law for public grievances redress during the Anna agitation, were an early popular expression of this aspiration. The recent protests present an opportunity for Mr. Modi to seize back the reform narrative by proactively laying down a new Magna Carta that imbues democratic principles within the processes of governance.

The Once-Only Principle

The European Union countries, as part of the 2017 Tallinn Declaration on e-Government, have come together to enact the ‘The Once-Only Principle (TOOP)’. The EU’s Single Digital Gateway Regulation marks an important step towards making governments more responsive to concerns about privacy, the hardships faced by vulnerable social groups, and the lack of proportionality in the policy design for digitalising government. TOOP aims to remove unnecessary administrative burdens on citizens by mandating that citizens are not required to provide the same information more than once to the government. TOOP requires the enacting of the legal and implementation framework that fully realises the individual liberties already bestowed by the Constitution and reiterated by the Supreme Court. However, laying down a legal framework and an implementation pathway for TOOP in India is only possible with a firm and earnest political leadership.

With its vast majority, this government can easily pass legislation mandating the time-bound implementation of TOOP in India. Adopting such a global best practice will provide the bureaucracy with the vision and direction to strengthen in a time-bound manner the internal processes within government agencies and the coordination within existing Digital India initiatives. Under this law, the government first presents the full details of all the information which is already available with it to the citizen. It then requests that the individual verify and correct any errors, by providing multiple, non-coercive opportunities to furnish only further information or additional documents as necessary.

Further, this requires, as in the case of EU countries, that the Indian government should pass long-pending laws concerning privacy and administrative procedures that are already mandated by the Supreme Court. Such a framework will help to minimise the scope for abuse of excessive bureaucratic discretion that comes with arbitrary rule-making. It will also mitigate growing public apprehension about the permission-less use of personal information by government and private agencies.

The Magna Carta, agreed to in 1215, was the first step in a long-drawn-out journey towards a rights-based democracy. But it led to equal treatment before the law and individual rights becoming the bedrock principles of modern democracies. Similarly, TOOP can set India on a time-bound path towards fulfilling the promise of a procedural rights-based democracy by elevating the rule-of-law standards for everyday governance to match other advanced democracies. Many credit the Congress for deepening democracy’s franchise and scope by establishing a liberal Constitution and implementing rights-based laws that secured some substantive rights (employment guarantee and food rations) and procedural rights (right to know). By enacting TOOP, Mr. Modi can lay claim to having made those rights substantial rather than merely symbolic.

301,2020/02/05,A case of a maritime presence adrift,"As the millennium dawned, the world feared that computers would crash because of the Y2K bug. Twenty years later, as 2020 kicked in, there were fears that merchant ships would sputter to a halt, disrupting world trade.

The reason? The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations agency tasked with regulating shipping, had mandated that merchant ships should not burn fuel with sulphur content greater than 0.5% beginning January 1.

Before the ban, fuel had a comfortable sulphur content limit of 3.5%, which was applicable to most parts of the world. Despite the industry gradually gearing up to introduce the new fuel, many industry professionals feared that the new very-low-sulphur fuel would be incompatible with the engines and other vessel equipment.

Past mandates on sulphur limits in American waters had led to many technical problems. There have been instances of ships having been stranded after fine particles separated out from the fuel, damaging equipment and clogging up devices.

This has not happened so far. But the global sulphur cap is only one of the many environment-related regulations that have been shaking up the shipping industry; the industry is generally risk-averse and slow to accept changes. For instance, efforts are ongoing to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone-depleting gases. Further, the IMO has announced an ambitious project to decarbonise shipping in order to reduce carbon emissions. These regulations are triggering massive technological, operational and structural changes; they come at a price which will have to be borne to a large extent by developing countries such as India.

The IMO currently lists India as among the 10 states with the “largest interest in international seaborne trade”. But India’s participation in the IMO to advance its national interests has been desultory and woefully inadequate.

Global regulator

Shipping, which accounts for over 90% by volume and about 80% by value of global trade, is a highly regulated industry with a range of legislation promulgated by the IMO.

The IMO currently has 174 member states and three associate members; there are also scores of non-governmental and inter-governmental organisations.

The IMO’s policies or conventions have a serious impact on every aspect of shipping including the cost of maritime trade. The sulphur cap, for instance, will reduce emissions and reduce the health impact on coastal populations but ship operational costs are going up since the new fuel product is more expensive. As refineries including those in India struggle to meet the demand, freight costs have started moving up, with a cascading effect on retail prices.

The IMO, like any other UN agency, is primarily a secretariat, which facilitates decision-making processes on all maritime matters through meetings of member states. The binding instruments are brought in through the conventions — to which member states sign on to for compliance — as well as amendments to the same and related codes.

Structurally, maritime matters are dealt by the committees of the IMO — the Maritime Safety Committee (MSC), Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC), Technical Cooperation Committee, Legal Committee and the Facilitation Committee. Each committee is designated a separate aspect of shipping and supported by sub-committees. Working groups and correspondence groups support the subcommittees.

The subcommittees are the main working organs, where the proposals from a member state are parsed before they are forwarded to one of the main committees. The main committees, thereafter, with the nod of the Assembly, put the approved proposal for enactment through the Convention, amendments, and codes or circulars.

Prominent maritime nations have their permanent representatives at London and are supported by a large contingent (of domain experts from their maritime administration, seafarers and industry associations) during the meetings. They ensure that they have representation in every subcommittee, working group and even correspondence groups so that they are clued in. Lobbying is key while event sponsorship generates goodwill and support.

A feeble voice

To ensure that their maritime interests are protected, the European countries move their proposals in unison and voting or support are given en bloc. China, Japan, Singapore, Korea and a few others represent their interests through their permanent representative as well as ensuring that a large delegation takes part and intervenes in the meetings.

While these countries have fiercely protected their interests, India has not. For example, its permanent representative post at London has remained vacant for the last 25 years. Representation at meetings is often through a skeletal delegation, approved by the Ministry. Participation in IMO meetings is seen more as a junket. A review of IMO documents shows that the number of submissions made by India in the recent past has been measly and not in proportion to India’s stakes in global shipping.

There have also been obstacles in pushing issues which are of importance to India. A classic case was the promulgation of “High Risk Areas” when piracy was at its peak and dominated media headlines.

The IMO’s demarcation resulted in half the Arabian Sea and virtually the entire south-west coast of India being seen as piracy-infested, despite the presence of the Indian Navy and Coast Guard. The “Enrica Lexie” shooting incident of 2012, off the coast of Kerala was a direct fallout of the demarcation.

The “High Risk Area” formulation led to a ballooning of insurance costs; it affected goods coming into or out of India. It took great efforts to revoke the promulgation and negate the financial burden. The episode highlighted India’s apathy and inadequate representation at the IMO. There was also great difficulty in introducing the indigenously designed NavIC (NAVigation with Indian Constellation) in the worldwide maritime navigation system.

In contrast, the European Union has a documented procedure on how to influence the IMO. New legislative mandates, fitment of new equipment and changes to ship structural designs being brought on have been driven by developed countries. They are not entirely pragmatic from the point of view of India’s interests. Further, it will not be mere speculation to see them as efforts to push products and companies based in the West.

So far, India’s presence and participation in the IMO has been at the individual level. India should now make its presence felt so that its national interests are served. It is time India regained its status as a major maritime power.

302,2020/02/05,Punish the police: On action against school in Bidar,"The action taken by the police against a private school in Bidar district of Karnataka must rank among the worst instances of the misuse of the sedition provision in penal law in recent times. Teams of police personnel have been visiting the Shaheen School for some days now, and they have already arrested a teacher and a parent so far, for an allegedly seditious and inflammatory play against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, in which it is claimed some remarks purportedly insulting to the Prime Minister were made. It is unbelievable that the police would waste their time in pursuing a complaint by a right-wing activist about a play performed by children between the ages of nine and 12. That primary schoolchildren are being subjected to sustained harassment with utter disregard for child-friendly laws and procedures is an egregious violation that the police seem to be committing with impunity. The arrest of a teacher who is said to have supervised the performance and the mother of a child on the allegation that she had added words to the script is particularly condemnable. It is a clear case of misuse of the power to arrest, when it is merely a verbal offence and does not require any custodial interrogation. Besides sedition under Section 124A, the provisions invoked concern insult aimed at provoking breach of peace, statements made with intent to incite people against the state and promote enmity between groups on the basis of religion. It is indeed bizarre for the police to believe that all these offences were made at a play involving a group of children.

It was only a few days ago that a Supreme Court Bench observed that words such as ‘anti-national’ and ‘sedition’ were being bandied about loosely these days. The incident in Bidar exemplifies this trend. And it also confirms that the law is often used to silence political comment on matters deemed sensitive by the rulers. Sedition, an outdated provision which deserves no place in a modern penal code, has been invoked to portray political dissent as promotion of disaffection. Often forgotten is the fact that it cannot be invoked without the essential ingredients for invoking the section, namely, an imminent threat to public order and incitement to take up arms or resort to violence. It is also noteworthy that the police have deemed the opposition to the citizenship law amendment as something against the state, when the section itself has an explanation that nothing that seeks to get the government to change its policy by lawful means is sedition. There must be something seriously wrong with a police system that believes that everyone who is suspected of committing an offence is to be arrested. Given the pervasive misuse of the sedition provision as well as the power to arrest, it may be time to strengthen conduct rules to provide for exemplary punishment to police personnel who violate constitutional guarantees of free speech and personal liberty in an arbitrary way.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/punish-the-police-on-action-against-school-in-bidar/article30736897.ece
303,2020/02/05,Need of the hour: On CAA protests,"As protests continue to ripple in many parts of the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, or the CAA, the National Population Register (NPR) and allied issues, their nature, content and direction have drawn critical attention. The introduction of a religious test for Indian citizenship through the CAA evoked widespread public indignation. Right-thinking people from all walks of life mobilised in a manner befitting a vibrant democracy, and several State governments and Assemblies have expressed reservations. Students have been in the forefront of protests that marked an awakening from a defeatist slumber of the country in the face of creeping majoritarianism. As the protests linger on, however, they appear to be sliding into the control of vested interests that work for religious polarisation. The discriminatory CAA targets Muslims, but the protests were driven by the wider civil society at the beginning. Incendiary speeches and slogans at anti-CAA protests, and even support for Islamist politics, have put non-sectarian opponents of the law in a difficult spot. Muslims have equal rights as all other citizens of India to assemble and protest, but reducing the CAA debate into a question of their rights alone is dishonour of the pluralist, inclusive Constitution of secular India. After the success in kindling a national debate on the issue which is now before the Supreme Court that will litigate its constitutionality, anti-CAA protesters must now hold their fire.

The opportunity that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sniffed in the protests is not to reach out and reconcile, but to confront and polarise, particularly in the campaign for the Delhi Assembly election. The chilling effect of the party’s brazen vilification and dehumanisation of the protesters is no longer an abstract fear. Three separate incidents of firing at protesters, two clearly inspired by Hindutva politics, have been reported in Delhi. Far from condemning these incidents in the strongest terms and ensuring swift and strict police action, the BJP leadership has continued with divisive rhetoric. A Union Minister led slogans calling for the “shooting of traitors”. The BJP must immediately adopt a path of reconciliation and resolution. One way is by making a further amendment to the CAA that will not prioritise religious persecution over other forms of persecution. No protester is against welcoming the persecuted from three neighbouring countries listed in the CAA. By amending the law to remove the arbitrary selection of countries and religious groups, the current turmoil can be easily calmed. A small step of reason and vision will serve India well.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/need-of-the-hour-on-caa-protests/article30736896.ece
304,2020/02/05,‘Animal Welfare Board has initiated process for registering dog breeders and pet shops’,"The Karnataka Animal Welfare Board (KAWB) on Wednesday informed the Karnataka High Court that it has issued a public notice intimating the public that all persons and institutions engaged in dog breeding, marketing, and pet shops as activities/profession will have to register with the Board as per the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (Dog Breeding and Market Rules, 2017 and Pet Shops Rules 2018).

The KAWB also informed the court that individual notices have been issued to 42 persons and institutions, a list of which was submitted to the board by M/s Compassion Unlimited Plus Action, an NGO which had filed a PIL petition.

It has also been stated in the public notice that prior to taking the required licence from the local authorities, all those engaged in dog breeding, marketing, and pet shop business should submit an application within 30 days from the date of publication of the notice, which was January 25.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar disposed of the petition while observing that the question of taking action against those engaged in dog breeding, marketing and pet shop business does not arise as the KAWB itself was constituted in November 2019 and it has recently issued public notice inviting applications for registration. The petition was filed last year seeking direction to the State for implementing the rules and to take action against those who are carrying on such businesses sans registration.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/animal-welfare-board-has-initiated-process-for-registering-dog-breeders-and-pet-shops/article30745416.ece
305,2020/02/05,Searching for the ideal jackfruit variety,"In about a year from now, you can relish tender vegetable jackfruit that will have the highest dietary fibre content among vegetarian foods.

The Indian Institute of Horticultural Research’s Tumakuru-based Central Horticultural Experimental Station (CHES) is in the process of finalising such a variety, according to CHES head Dr. Karunakaran.

He told The Hindu on the sidelines of the National Horticulture Fair on Wednesday that already three vegetable jackfruit varieties with dietary fibre content ranging from 11 to 13% had been identified.

Chemical profiling of these varieties, identified in farmers’ fields in Tumakuru district, had already been done. However, it would take another one year to zero in on a variety that is not only rich in fibre content, but can also be cooked, the scientist said. The emphasis was being given to dietary content as this aspect was too low in the normal vegetable food varieties of Indians, he said.

The task of identifying such a variety had become complex as the CHES is also looking at the kind of variety whose taste suits people’s choice.

“Earlier, we used to classify all the jackfruit varieties that are smaller and have lesser latex as tender vegetable varieties. But now, we conducted a survey in jackfruit consuming areas of Karnataka and Kerala to understand the preferences of people,” he explained.

We are also looking at dual purpose jackfruit variety, which not only has higher dietary fibre content and can be used as vegetable varieties in cooking, but can also be consumed as fruits, he said.

People queue up for Siddu jackfruit saplings

The demand for Siddu variety of jackfruit appears to be growing. People stood in a queue on Wednesday at the sales counter hours before the sale started at the National Horticulture Fair.

This jackfruit variety with deep coppery red flakes, which is tasty and also has high nutritive value, has become popular after IIHR identified this unique variety grown in the farm of S.S. Paramesha and named it ‘Siddu’ after his father who had planted it.

“Such was the rush to buy these plants that we decided to introduce rationing and provided only three plants per person,” said Dr. Karunakaran, head of IIHR’s Tumakuru-based Central Horticultural Experimental Station (CHES) and the scientist who identified this unique tree.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/searching-for-the-ideal-jackfruit-variety/article30745346.ece

“Adivasis means moolavasis of the land. They have been residing here for the longest time. We have to think of them, their welfare and upliftment,” they said. The comment was made in the context of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Registry of Citizens (NRC).

They were speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of the conversation at ‘Samvad’, hosted by the students of Indian Institute of Management-Bangalore (IIM-B).

Prakash Baba Amte urged the audience to ‘work with the people, not just for the people’. “There are over 10 crore tribals in our country who are still illiterate, unemployed and who struggle for even two meals a day. Their welfare and development is much more important than portraying ourselves as ‘vishwa guru’. We cannot become a `vishwa guru’ until we bring them all up,” he later said.

Mr. Amte said that compassion and integrity had a strong impact on society. “Keeping the prevalant economic divide in the country in mind, one has to work for the betterment of society. It is with this conviction and commitment that one has to serve society,” he said.

Market’,"The Karnataka High Court on Wednesday directed the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to put up cautionary boards at all entrances to K.R. Market informing visitors that “those entering the market complex are at risk as BBMP has not provided sufficient fire safety measures in the building”.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoundar issued the direction as the BBMP had failed to comply with various fire safety norms as pointed out in the fire audit report of 2019 submitted by the Karnataka Fire and Emergency Service (F&ES).

The bench also directed the BBMP to inform all occupants of shops, whether occupying legally or illegally, inside the market complex that they are occupying the market building and carrying on business at their own risk as the BBMP has not provided sufficient fire safety measures.

The court had on January 8 indicated to the BBMP that it will have to pass orders for affixing boards cautioning visitors if the BBMP failed to provide sufficient fire safety measures at the earliest.

Meanwhile, BBMP counsel pointed out that a private company had inspected the market complex on February 4 and would soon submit a proposal for providing various fire safety equipment. The counsel also said that the BBMP has already put up notices cautioning visitors.

However, the bench said that the notice should specifically state that risk is due to non provision of fire safety measures by the BBMP.

Plan traced

Meanwhile, BBMP counsel said that the market’s sanctioned building plan, which was missing, was traced. As per the plan, 28 shops were constructed illegally in the passage of the market complex, and soon the BBMP would submit a copy of the plan and other documents to the court.

308,2020/02/05,Techie went to Port Blair after killing mother,"The K.R. Puram police, on Wednesday, tracked down and arrested software engineer Amrutha Chandrashekhar, 33, in Port Blair, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, where she was hiding with a male friend after allegedly stabbing her mother to death and attacking her younger brother with a knife in their house at K.R. Puram. The alleged crimes took place early Sunday morning.

“When we scanned CCTV footage from neighbouring houses, we saw Amrutha leave with a man who was waiting near the house on his scooter,” said a police officer.

The male friend has been identified as Sridhar Rao. “They were hiding in Port Blair. We have arrested the accused and are escorting them back to Bengaluru,” said a senior police officer.

Attack planned 15 days ago

According to the police, Amrutha and Sridhar had planned the murder a fortnight ago. “It was Amrutha who booked their tickets to Port Blair,” said the police, who tracked the route the couple took to Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) by analysing footage from hundreds of CCTV cameras.

After obtaining details of her destination, the police alerted their counterparts in Port Blair and sent pictures of Amrutha. A police team from Port Blair tracked them down to a hotel.

“Though she maintains that she had taken a loan, which she could not repay, as the reason for killing her mother, we suspect that her family did not approve of her relationship with Sridhar. We are also ascertaining why they travelled to Port Blair,” said a senior police inspector.

Last Saturday, Amrutha booked plane tickets for her mother, Nirmala, and brother, Harish, for a quick visit to Hyderabad as she was planning to relocate there on a work assignment. They were scheduled to leave on Sunday morning.

They had dinner together on Saturday night and went to bed as they had to get up early the next day. A little after 4 a.m., she walked into Harish’s room with a knife and slashed his neck.

“Harish jumped out of the bed and started calling his mother. Amrutha told him that she had killed their mother with the same knife. She told him that she had also used an iron rod, and was planning to kill him too,” the police officer added.

He was able to fend her off but sustained injuries on his neck and hands.

309,2020/02/05,Bescom sets up 80 electric vehicle charging stations,"The city’s long wait for charging infrastructure for electric vehicles may end soon. The Bangalore Electricity Supply Company (Bescom) is planning to throw open 80 EV charging stations next week.

Senior Bescom officials said the proposal to inaugurate the stations has been sent to Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and the formal function may happen after the Cabinet expansion, which is on Thursday. “We have readied 80 EV charging stations which have 126 charging units,” a Bescom official told The Hindu.

“Once they are inaugurated, it will be the first-of-its-kind network of charging stations in the country run by a public utility,” Bescom officials said.

The power utility has received ₹4 crore from the State government through the Transport Department for setting up the charging infrastructure. The new charging stations are located on government office premises, such as those of the Bescom. BBMP, BDA, TTMC buildings and RTO offices.

“They are spread out evenly across the city. There are more in the pipeline, especially on important roads and national highways, and a proposal will be sent to the central government,” an official said.

The existing charging stations in the city are run by operators of electric vehicles for captive consumption, said Bescom officials.

Tariff and timings

It will cost around ₹8 per unit for charging at these stations. “These will be self-service stations. Consumers can use online wallets for payment. They will be required to have a minimum balance of ₹50. Only the 12 fast-charging stations will be manned,” officials said.

Bescom plans to keep the stations open for 16 hours, and extend the timings based on response from consumers.

Solar power

With questions being raised over how energy generated through thermal plants to power electric vehicles could be termed “clean energy”, Bescom had earlier announced that the EV charging stations would use solar power. However, they might not be economically viable.

“We may not be able to install solar plants at all locations because of cost and space constraints. But the charging station at our corporate office will be integrated with the solar rooftop plant,” said an official, adding that this will include storing solar energy as well.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/7grqcy/article30743513.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGEVCHARGINGSTATION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bescom-sets-up-80-electric-vehicle-charging-stations/article30743515.ece

311,2020/02/05,Bengaluru: panic as four-storey building tilts,"Panic gripped residents of Kempapura in north Bengaluru as a four-storey building started tilting when the adjacent vacant site was being dug up to construct a basement on Wednesday.

Residents of the building evacuated before alerting the fire control room and the BBMP.

Officials of the BBMP, fire control room and the police are at the spot.

BBMP officials said there was no sign of building bylaw violations. ""The excavation work on the adjacent site led to the tilt. The technical experts' team is analysing the situation and we will act as per their advice,"" said BBMP assistant engineer Pushpalatha.

Though digging work has been stopped, tension prevails among residents of neighbouring buildings as the building in the narrow lane stands dangerously tilted towards the road. Many of them have also left their buildings fearing the worse and are awaiting action from the officials.

No has been one hurt in the incident, a fire officer said.

“Some construction work attached to the particular building in 2nd cross Ramaiah Layout in Kempapura (behind the house) has caused this. One JCB was digging mud out for laying foundation behind the house and the earth has been loosened due to this,” said Uday Kumar, who runs an iron shop on the same road.

“The building has 36 residents, five floors with three houses on each floor.

We were shocked to see the building tilting in the morning today. All of us have come out and are worried about our belongings. One resident went up to at least bring his clothes. But by the time he went up, he felt the staircase shaking. He ran down horrified,” said Tulsi K, another resident.

Owner of the house, Rahul alias Suresh Chandra Jain told The Hindu that the JCB hit the pillar of the house while digging. He said he will lodge a complaint with the police as the owner of the adjacent house did not even inform him about taking up digging work.

Another adjacent house has also been damaged.

“There is no gap in between houses. The road is very narrow. No place even to take up even rescue operations, say like the vehicle of the fire and emergency services also can’t come in,” another resident said.

Other residents are worried that the building may fall on their houses, he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/kmspst/article30740776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/building,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-panic-as-four-storey-building-tilts/article30740723.ece
312,2020/02/05,Country’s biggest horticultural fair begins today,"The stage is set for the country’s biggest horticultural fair with the four-day National Horticultural Fair, being organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), set to begin on Wednesday at the institute’s Hessarghatta campus on the outskirts of Bengaluru.

The institute is expecting about 50,000 farmers from various States of the country, as it has either some technology or crop variety relevant for all agro climatic zones of the country.

Farming as enterprise

As ‘Making farming an enterprise’ is the theme of this year’s fair, special focus has been given to showcasing technologies, crop varieties and management practices that can turn farming into a sustainable as well as a profitable venture, say scientists of IIHR.

Eight of the technologies developed by the IIHR have been contributing a revenue of ₹13,220 crore to the nation’s economy on an annual basis, according to Institute Director Dr. M.R. Dinesh.

Of this, a lion’s share is by Dogridge rootstock of grapes, which contributes ₹6,250 crore to the economy every year. Spread over one lakh hectares, it accounts for 90% of the country’s grape cultivation area.

Bio-pesticide formulations of the institute and foliar nutrient formulations too contribute to the economy. The pheromone trap adopted in mango orchards, Arka Prajwal variety of tuberose and Arka Microbial Consortium too are contributing significantly to the national economy, he added. The fail will have over 200 exhibition stalls on various aspects of horticulture. It will showcase technologies and concepts related to protected cultivation as part of efforts to woo youth to horticultural activity by making it a profitable venture.

Other technologies include those related to cultivation and processing of vegetables, fruits, medicinal & aromatic plants, spices, plantation crops and mushroom varieties.

The fair will be held from February 5 to 8. It will try to bring horticultural entrepreneurs, including nurserymen, farmers and consumers, on a common platform, point out scientists of the institute.

It will also have something for urbanites in the form of a one-day scientific workshop on urban gardening that covers all the aspects related to urban/terrace gardening that will be held on all the five days of the fair.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/uipgod/article30739923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGHORTICULTURE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/countrys-biggest-horticultural-fair-begins-today/article30739924.ece
313,2020/02/05,348 leased properties owe BBMP ₹9.26 crore in rent,"The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has to collect dues amounting to ₹9.26 crore in rent from 348 properties, which it has leased to educational institutions, for parks and playgrounds, fuel stations, marriage and community halls. Of these, the lease of 195 properties has expired.

Several properties, especially in the core zones of East, West and South, have been leased out by the BBMP. However, with lease amounts not being revised and rents not collected in time, the civic body is incurring a loss. Taking note of this, the State government had sought a status report on the number of BBMP-owned properties that had been leased or rented out, and outstanding dues.

Sources in BBMP said that notices have been issued to lessees who failed to pay their dues. Civic Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar had reportedly directed the zonal joint commissioners to take possession of properties whose lease had ended. Admitting that many are under litigation, source said that efforts were being made to recover such properties as well.

Leased out for a pittance

Though rental and lease rates in the city were skyrocketing, many properties, especially those in prime locations, were leased out for a pittance. For instance, 2.6 acres in East zone had been leased to a private school for 99 years for ₹1 per acre per year. However, officials conceded that this was done shortly after Independence.

“This is a loss to the BBMP,” said Byrasandra councillor N. Nagraj, who had headed a committee in 2010-11 to look into leased properties and the low lease rates. A report recommending increase in rates and recovering properties with expired leases had been submitted to the then mayor S.K. Nataraj.

“Unfortunately, nothing was done. The report, I suspect, is gathering dust in the BBMP,” he said. The councillor added that the civic body lacked proper records of land owned by the erstwhile City Municipal Councils, Town Municipal Council and 110 villages that were later added to BBMP limits.

Former Opposition Leader Padmanabha Reddy pointed out that lease rates were not commensurate with the prevailing market rates. “Many have violated lease conditions by sub-leasing a portion of the property. While they are earning lakhs, they pay not even 1% of that to the BBMP,” he alleged.

Senior officials admitted that the lease or rental rates were low, and said they would explore the possibility of hiking the same, which will bring in more revenue to the BBMP.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/lks34c/article30739909.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BGFEBBBMPcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/348-leased-properties-owe-bbmp-926-crore-in-rent/article30739910.ece
314,2020/02/05,Four-year-old girl meets stem cell donor for the first time in Bengaluru,"It was an emotional moment on Tuesday for Debojyoti, a 26-year-old software professional from Bengaluru, when he met four-year-old Shia from Kolkata, recipient of his blood stem cells.

Mr. Debojyoti, who came to the rescue of the little girl by donating his stem cells, met her for the first time at a meeting organised by a non-profit organisation, DKMS-BMST Foundation India, an international blood stem cell donor registry in the city.

Thanks to the donation, Shia — daughter of primary school teacher Saifulla Kobir and homemaker Sajida Kobir — has been cured of thalassemia, an inherited blood disorder. When this family residing in Kolkata found that their daughter was suffering from thalassemia, they researched about the treatments available. Sharing his experience Mr. Kobir said: “Due to lack of awareness about the blood stem cell transplant procedure we were turned down by the local doctors. When we were told that our daughter will need blood transfusion throughout her life to survive, we were devastated.”

“We got a ray of hope after meeting Dr. Revathi Raj in Chennai and she assured us that there is a treatment available in the form of a blood stem cell transplant. That is when our journey to find an unrelated blood stem cell match began,” said an emotional Mr. Kobir.

With the help of doctors, they were lucky to find a match for their daughter within a year, and she underwent a blood stem cell transplantation in Chennai.

Mr. Debojyoti said, “I registered myself as a potential stem cell donor in 2016 and after a year of registration I was found to be a match.” As per protocols, the identity of the donor and recipient are kept anonymous for two years, and thereafter they can be introduced to each other.

Latha Jagannathan, director of DKMS-BMST, said many patients suffering from blood cancer and other blood disorders need a blood stem cell transplant to survive. Unfortunately, a majority of patients are unable to receive a transplant due to the unavailability of a matching blood stem cell donor. Their registry currently has over 40,000 registered potential blood stem cell donors.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/q4e92d/article30739892.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTHALASSEMIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/blood-stem-cell-donor-meets-recipient/article30739893.ece
315,2020/02/05,Skill labs in 17 government medical colleges in Karnataka from next academic year,"With the aim of helping medical students get hands-on experience before they attend to patients, the Karnataka plans to establish skill laboratories in 17 government medical colleges from the next academic year. They will be equipped with simulation mannequins that students can practise on.

Speaking to the media after visiting Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI) on Tuesday, Deputy Chief Minister and Medical Education Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan said, “At these labs, instead of real patients, there will be mannequins through which students can hone their knowledge of the anatomy of the human body as well as to learn medical procedures.”

Such a facility already exists in BMRCI. “The mannequins will also have stimulation technology and will react the same way that a patient would react to a procedure. This will help students get a near-natural feel,” said an official of the Medical Education Department.

He added that the skill laboratories will help students conduct critical surgeries that involve the brain and the spine. Faculty members of these government medical colleges will also be trained on how to use the simulation mannequins.

Some universities have already switched to this method of teaching as there is a shortage of cadavers available at hospitals for students to learn the basics of anatomy. It can be used for both MBBS as well as MD students, said officials.

Health care museum

A dedicated Health Care Museum will come up in the over-a-century-old building in the Victoria hospital premises soon. “We are planning to showcase medical education and technology available in the industry,” said Mr. Ashwath Narayan.

The museum will be dedicated to providing training for medical students studying in government medical colleges.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/skill-labs-in-17-government-medical-colleges-in-karnataka-from-next-academic-year/article30737672.ece
316,2020/02/05,NGT cancels eco-clearance to high-rise near Kaikondrahalli lake,"Environment clearance (EC) given to a high-rise residential apartment project abutting the southern part of the 48 acre Kaikondrahalli lake has been quashed by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) for violation of environment rules.

The NGT, on Monday, said that the EC was a ‘breach of environment norms, violation of municipal laws and buffer zone regulations’. The EC was granted in January 2018 by the Karnataka State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA).

The ruling came while hearing petitions filed by H.P. Rajanna and Mahadevapura Parisara Samrakshane Mattu Abhivrudhi Samiti (MAPSAS).

The NGT has sought an action taken report within a month from a four-member committee appointed by the tribunal in connection with Kaikondrahalli lake.

Lake ‘ecologically fragile’

P. Ramprasad, the advocate who represented MAPSAS before the NGT, told The Hindu that the EC of the ongoing high-rise residential apartment project – Godrej Reflections (Phase 1) and Godrej Lake Gardens (Phase 1) – was quashed.

He said that the lake was in an ‘ecologically fragile’ condition. “This order is a huge milestone that will prevent further adverse impact on the health of the lake and ecology of the surrounding area,” he said.

A representative from the MAPSAS said that the NGT saw the issue holistically. “Approaching the NGT was in itself unfortunate, which was our last resort. Had the civic agencies taken necessary action at the right time, this would not have happened,” the representative said, adding that action taken on the ground, based on directions of the NGT, will be important. “Will the agencies concerned clear the encroachments within a month,” the representative asked.

Report mentioned violation

The four-member committee appointed by the NGT for the Kaikondrahalli lake, in a report submitted in September 2019, had mentioned various violations and encroachments in the lake, including that by Godrej. The report had specified that a part of the project fell under the lake buffer zone.

In March last year, during an inspection of the lake by residents and officials of various civic agencies, it was found that the lake was being choked by entry of raw sewage, various buffer zone violations, dumping of waste and unauthorised construction.

A statement issued by Godrej said: “It has been brought to our notice that the NGT has passed an order concerning our project in Bengaluru. We are yet to receive a copy of the order. As a responsible corporate, we follow all concerned regulations and are confident of our compliance in this project. We look forward to quickly clarifying and resolving this matter once the order is received.”",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ngt-cancels-eco-clearance-to-high-rise-near-kaikondrahalli-lake/article30737579.ece

According to Tamil Nadu Fire and Rescue Services (TNFRS) officers, the control room received a call around 4.45 a.m on Wednesday informing them about a fire accident in a godown, belonging to a lamination shop, in Venkatrangam Pillai Street in Triplicane.

Seven fire tenders (two foam and five water) and 40 personnel rushed to the spot and tried to douse the flames.

319,2020/02/05,"Elderly woman trapped beneath train, rescued by police in Chennai","A 61-year-old woman had a miraculous escape near Basin Bridge on Wednesday morning, after being hit by a train and trapped beneath the engine and cow catcher. Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel and members of the public managed to pull her out safely, after the engine driver stopped the train.

According to the Government Railway Police at Chennai Central, the incident took place around 7.30 a.m when the Chennai-Bengaluru double decker train (No. 22625 ) was moving slowly just beyond the Basin Bridge Railway station.

At this juncture, the woman, Ambika, who was dressed in a nightgown and was trying to cross the tracks, was hit by the train engine.

“Usually if something hits the cow catcher, it gets thrown away. But since the train was moving slowly and since the woman was slim, she got trapped beneath,” said a senior police officer.

The engine driver stopped the locomotive, sensing there was something wrong. “Seeing the train stop, Sarita Priti Khalkho, a woman constable with the RPF, a few railway staff personnel and locals rushed to her help. The driver reversed the train and they managed to pull the woman out safely,” the officer said.

Ambika’s face was stained with blood and she was rushed to Government Stanley Hospital for treatment. She has sustained fractures in her hand and is said to be out of danger.

320,2020/02/05,"Residents of Navalur, Thalambur demand re-laying of bad interior roads","Bad interior roads are a common sight in many areas off Rajiv Gandhi Salai, including Navalur and Thazhambur. Negotiating pot holes and craters and inhaling a lot of dust have become part of the daily routine of many living in these areas.

The road leading to DLF Garden City in Thazhambur near the Perumbakkam Slum Board tenements has been bad since last October, complain parents of students in various schools in the locality. “Some repairs were carried out during the rains, but after that the road quality deteriorated badly and about half a kilometre of the road is just awful,” said Subha, a parent who drives down from Medavakkam daily.

Proximity to Rajiv Gandhi Salai has meant the development of thousands of apartment complexes and many schools for the children in them. “Recently, there was an accident involving an autorickshaw and a two-wheeler on Thazhambur Main Road. This was due to a large crater that the motorists tried to avoid. The two-wheeler rider sustained injuries and the autorickshaw was mangled. The road was laid only about six months ago,” said Ashok Rajendran, a resident of Navalur.

Residents said that the local panchayats do not react to potholes and craters even by filling them up with building debris. “We can only blame poor quality of road laying and bad drainage. If the road had the correct slope, the water would find its own way out and cause less damage to the road,” said Elijah Mathew, a resident of Navalur.

Examinations conducted for MBBS, dental, Indian system of medicines and allied health sciences in 500 centres would be monitored through AI. Through this, malpractices such as interaction between two students in the exam centre, exchange of answer scripts, a student moving from his/her place to another person’s seat and copying would be captured immediately at a surveillance room to be set up in the university.

Such a facility was being set up with help from the Madras Chamber of Commerce.

A team has been formed to monitor the works and a separate surveillance room was being set up at the university with the aim of preventing all kinds of malpractices in exam centres, she said in a press release. From February 3, nearly 12,000 students of 37 colleges are appearing for the MBBS examination (except first year students) in 35 centres.

324,2020/02/05,"Toll collection can’t be stopped on expiry of pact, says NHAI","The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has told the Madras High Court that collection of toll on national highways cannot be stopped on expiry of agreements entered with private concessionaires on Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) basis. The authority claimed that it was entitled to continue the collection till full recovery of the capital cost of individual projects, even if it takes more than three decades to do so.

In a counter affidavit filed before Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and R. Hemalatha on Monday, the NHAI listed several components for determining the capital cost of a project and said, “The initially estimated year of capital recovery period or payback period of investment is always traumatised by unpredictable forces like rate of inflation, change in rate of interest, change in pattern of traffic, alternative options, emerging technology etc.”

The counter was filed in response to a public interest litigation petition filed by Tiruchi-based advocate A. Joseph Sagayaraj to restrain the NHAI from collecting toll at Athur and Paranur toll plazas on the Tambaram-Tindivanam section, since the concession agreements had come to an end in November 2019. His counsel M.J. Jaseem Mohamed argued that unending collection of toll amounted to “tax terrorism.”

On the other hand, explaining the process in detail, Additional Solicitor General G. Rajagopalan and Assistant Solicitor General G. Karthikeyan said the NHAI had entered into an agreement with GMR Tambaram-Tindivanam Expressways Private Limited on October 9, 2001 for carrying out four-laning of the stretch on BOT (payment of annuity) basis. The concession period was 17.5 years, including the construction period of 2.5 years.

The appointed date for the project was declared on May 9, 2002 and as per the agreement, the concession period expired on November 8, 2019.

Separate agreements

Further, between May 2005 and November 2019, the NHAI paid an annuity of ₹1,219.39 crore to the concessionaire at the rate of ₹41.856 crore every semester. Apart from this concession agreement, the NHAI entered into separate agreements with private entities for building toll plazas, operating them and collecting the toll.

Accordingly, user fee collection at Athur and Paranur toll plazas began on April 1, 2005, and till November 30, 2019 only ₹245.07 crore was collected from Paranur and ₹203.84 crore from Athur plaza. Stating that the total cost incurred for executing the project, indexed to the year of construction, was ₹922.61 crore, the law officers told the court that since only ₹448.91 crore had been collected so far from the two plazas, the balance capital cost of ₹473.70 crore was yet to be recovered.

It was further explained to the court that the capital cost was calculated by including the interest during construction, cost of land acquired for the project, rehabilitation and resettlement cost, cost of shifting of utilities and cutting the trees, cost of compensatory afforestation, maintenance work carried out to enhance durability of the highways. Also stating that toll was being collected as per rules, NHAI said: “After recovery of capital cost, user fee will be reduced to 40% as per rules.” The counter affidavit went on to state: “These projects pose another disturbing feature of long gestation period for recovery of the capital invested spanning from 15 to 30 years and necessitate incurring of periodical maintenance expenditure also to sustain the steady stream of expected revenue... It is not always possible for the Government of India or the State government to fund all such projects out of their tax revenues alone.”

After hearing both sides, the judges said refusal of vehicles with political party flags to pay the toll also appeared to be one of the reasons for delay in recovering the capital cost. Hence, they directed the NHAI to file by March 23 a report on the hurdles faced by it in strict implementation of Rule 11 of National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules of 2008 which provides exemption only to President, ministers, judges and a few others.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/k2q36y/article30738233.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05MADRASHC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/toll-collection-cant-be-stopped-on-expiry-of-pact-says-nhai/article30738234.ece
325,2020/02/05,Owners of large land parcels may have to make space for roads,"Owners of large parcels of land may have to hand over space for developing link roads to other properties in the neighbourhood.

Local bodies and urban planning authorities in the State will start directing owners to set apart link roads, within the site, before giving approval for development of the land.

As per the new amendment to the Tamil Nadu Combined Development and Building Rules, 2019, “In the interest of the public for better movement in the area and also to ensure that development does not block access to the properties around, in cases of large developments, where link roads are to be provided, for connectivity to the adjoining land areas through the site applied for development, the competent authority reserves the right to insist the applicant to set apart such road spaces within the site, and the applicant shall hand over the same, for free, through a registered gift deed, to the local body, for declaring it as a public road.”

The new amendment is expected to solve civic problems affecting urban residents, who have to take a circuitous route, owing to lack of connectivity in several neighbourhoods. For example, many neighbourhoods in the vicinity of the Rajiv Gandhi Salai and the East Coast Road do not have proper connectivity, hindering civic infrastructure development.

Residents in suburban areas and added areas of the Chennai Corporation will soon get better connectivity because of the development of new public roads, through the take over of private lands by the local bodies.

Similarly, the new rules will permit better civic facilities in residential areas with very narrow roads. Urban planning authorities will also give approvals for building clinics, polyclinics, dispensaries, diagnostic centres, primary health centres, nursing homes, working women’s hostels, old age homes, special needs homes, reading rooms, libraries, police stations, government offices and local body offices, not exceeding 300 sq m, on roads with a width of 1.5 m, in “continuous building areas” and “economically weaker section areas”.

This will lead to better policing in such areas and improve civic services there.

The new rules also stipulate that written permissions should be issued within 30 days for buildings less than 1200 sq ft.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/g49ogv/article30737943.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05City-TNCDcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/owners-of-large-land-parcels-may-have-to-make-space-for-roads/article30737944.ece

Kumarasamy of Christy Friedgram Industry of Namakkal runs into ₹2,056.76 crore, for which he was liable to pay tax of approximately ₹700 crore, excluding interest.

Justices V. Parthiban and Anita Sumanth were informed by A.P. Srinivas and A.N.R. Jaya Prathap, standing counsel for Income Tax department, that the law did not permit waiver of penalty, immunity from prosecution and stay on recovery proceedings just because the contractor was willing to pay ₹50 crore even before completion of assessment proceedings.

The counsel turned down an offer made by the contractor to pay ₹50 crore forthwith if no coercive action was taken against him and he was allowed to continue his business peacefully. They also submitted a detailed counter affidavit filed by Mangapathy Vivekananda, Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax, rejecting the offer made by the contractor.

The counter stated that a massive search conducted at various premises belonging to the contractor over five days in July 2018 had led to a recovery of unaccounted cash of ₹15 crore from bank lockers held in the name of three of his employees. Books of accounts, sale deeds and various other documents were also seized during the raids.

Apart from all these, 153 electronic devices including 55 compact discs, 31 hard disks, 37 pen drives, 15 laptops and 15 smart phones were recovered by the I-T sleuths. The Deputy Commissioner also gave a detailed breakup of the unaccounted income of ₹1,351.84 crore, reportedly admitted by the group of companies run by the contractor.

The officer said ₹751 crore of unaccounted income had been admitted by Christy Friedgram Industry, ₹270 crore by Natural Food Products, ₹183 crore by Suvarnabhoomi Enterprises Limited and ₹147 crore by Rasi Nutri Foods. Further, an additional income of Rs.17.66 crore was detected during post search proceedings.

That was not all as the I-T department found out unexplained cash expenses to the tune of ₹687.25 crore from the financial year 2011-12 and all this worked out to a total unaccounted income of ₹2,056.76 crore, Mr. Vivekananda added. He stoutly denied the claim of the petitioner struggling to do business because of the pending proceedings.

Though a huge amount of money to be received by the petitioner from the government towards the materials supplied by him was attached by the I-T department, a substantial amount was already released based on court order and at present only ₹213 crore was available in the High Court branch of Indian Bank as per court orders.

Since the ₹213 crore would work out to only a fraction of the tax proposed to be collected, the entire amount should be fully appropriated to protect the interests of the revenue, the officer said.

After perusing his counter affidavit, the judges adjourned all writ petitions filed by the contractor to Monday for hearing the cases on merits.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/govt-contractor-had-unaccounted-income-of-205676-crore-says-i-t-deptartment/article30738166.ece

329,2020/02/05,Fire at distillation unit of CPCL in Manali,"A crude oil distillation unit, inside Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd’s (CPCL) refinery I in Manali, caught fire at 4.30 a.m. on Tuesday.

The fire was put out in an hour’s time by several in-house fire tenders, after isolating it, said company sources. There was no loss of life or injuries in the unit, which is part of the complex commissioned 50 years ago.

Fire and Rescue Services personnel from Ambattur, Madhvaram and Manali were also pressed into service.

Company officials said that the fire would not affect fuel supplies to the State in any manner. “The distillation unit has been isolated, and the rest of the refinery continues to function. Since we have two other refineries in Manali, with higher refining capacities, product supply will be maintained,” explained an official.

330,2020/02/05,HC expresses concern over number of homeless citizens,"Observing that the issue of homelessness could be solved only if curbs were imposed on those who own more than one house, the Madras High Court on Tuesday wanted to know from the Centre as to why families should not be prohibited from purchasing more than one house, why non-resident Indians should not be prevented from purchasing houses in the country and why speculative sale of properties within five hours should not be banned.

Justices N. Kirubakaran and Abdul Quddhose raised the questions while dismissing an appeal preferred by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board (TNHB) against a single judge’s order quashing a land acquisition proceeding for non-compliance of mandatory procedures.

Expressing grave concern over a majority of the citizens in the country remaining homeless, the judge wanted to know by March 6 the number of families that own more than two houses.

The other questions posed by the judges were: “Why not the government restrict the families/individuals from purchasing/possessing more than one housing unit/flat/plot by defining what is meant by single housing unit till ‘Housing for all’ is achieved? Why not the government charge 100% more or extra stamp duty to discourage buying more than one house/flat by a family/individual while purchasing second housing unit/flat at the registration level itself?

“Why not the government conditionally allow the families to purchase more than one house/flat/plot, provided the said family pays 100% extra statutory dues like property tax, electricity charges, water and sewerage charges on the second property? Why not the government prohibit NRIs settled permanently in foreign countries from purchasing housing units/plots/flats in an effort to bring down the cost of housing unit/plots in India?”

Empathising with millions of citizens living on platforms, slums, under trees and on banks of water bodies without shelter and impressing upon the Centre to expedite the process of providing affordable housing, the judges said: “Though single housing unit is enough for a family, considering the future of the children, a family can be allowed to have an additional housing unit on payment of additional charges and the third unit should be completely prohibited.

Affordable housing

“By this restrictions, not only the price of housing units will come down but the persons who do not have sufficient means to purchase housing units will also be in a position to purchase the property. It will further go a long way in preventing the real estate people from converting the agricultural lands into commercial properties or housing properties and thereby the agricultural lands could also be saved.”

Authoring the order, Justice Kirubakaran also said: “Every individual has the right to purchase/own more than one house and as on date there is no restriction to own more than one house. However, such individuals should think of rights of others to have a house and avoid grabbing houses which should be available to others.

“Right to own property/properties by citizens is a constitutional right under Article 300A. Right to property which was a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(f) of the constitution is taken away by deleting (f) from Article 19(1) and placed it as Article 300A by virtue of 44th amendment. Hence, the government has got power to put restrictions to buy properties till ‘Housing for all’ is achieved.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/hc-expresses-concern-over-number-of-homeless-citizens/article30738112.ece
331,2020/02/05,I-T officials chose to levy a minimum penalty of ₹66.21 lakh on Rajinikanth,"The Income Tax department recently withdrew all proceedings against actor Rajinikanth for alleged concealment of income because the penalty to be recovered was less than ₹1 crore. Records show that they had chosen to levy a minimum penalty of ₹66.21 lakh, while the maximum penalty would have been ₹1.98 crore.

Section 271(1)(c) of the IT Act provides for the imposition of a maximum penalty of 300% of the amount of tax an assessee is alleged to have attempted to evade by furnishing inaccurate particulars in his/her returns, and a minimum penalty of 100% of the tax amount he/she allegedly attempted to evade. In the actor’s case, the I-T officials imposed the minimum penalty.

The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (ITAT) orders, accessed by The Hindu, show that it had ruled that the charge of concealment and the consequent imposition of penalty were unwarranted since it was difficult to draw a line between personal and professional expenditure of an actor who “has to maintain his personality” even when he is not acting in films.

According to I-T sleuths, Mr. Rajinikanth had not acted in any film between the assessment years 2002-03 and 2004-05 and, therefore, had not disclosed any revenue from his acting profession. He had supposedly not received any remuneration during those three assessment years, either for projects that had already been completed or for future projects.

Yet, he had claimed to have incurred professional expenses of ₹40.20 lakh, ₹39.51 lakh and ₹36.33 lakh respectively during those three years. Not convinced by his claim, the sleuths conducted a survey of his office, situated in his Poes Garden residence in Chennai, and suspected that he could have declared his personal expenses as professional expenses.

They found that the entire expenditure on the residential-cum-office premises, including electricity, air conditioning maintenance charges, repairs, security charges, telephone and travel expenses, had been debited in the Profit & Loss account. They did not find any vouchers for the supposed professional expenses.

Subsequently, Mr. Rajinikanth filed revised I-T returns, reducing his claim of professional expenses by 50% of what he had claimed in the original returns. Nevertheless, the I-T department initiated penalty proceedings against him on the ground that the revision was made only after the survey proceedings, and not voluntarily, and therefore, it would amount to concealment.

After conclusion of the penalty proceedings in July 2010, the officers had the option of imposing the maximum penalty at the rate of 300% of the amount of tax the assessee allegedly attempted to evade. However, they chose to impose the minimum penalty at the rate of 100% of the evaded tax amount.

Though the actor took the matter on statutory appeal, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) dismissed his plea in 2011 and confirmed the penalty imposed by the Assessing Officers.

On further appeal, the ITAT reversed the order of penalty in 2013 and said: “It is an admitted fact that the assessee is a film actor and he has to incur some expenditure to maintain his personality...”

The 2013 order passed by ITAT Accountant Member Abraham P. George and Judicial Member V. Durga Rao also read: “It is not a fit case to impose penalty under Section 271(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act of 1961. We therefore delete the penalty.”

Though the I-T department had preferred an appeal in the Madras High Court in 2014 challenging the ITAT’s order, it withdrew the case last week citing a general policy decision taken by the Central Board of Direct Taxes last year to withdraw all cases in which the recovery was less than ₹1 crore in order to avoid long pending litigation.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/1s7zot/article30734171.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04FEBTH-RAJINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/i-t-officials-chose-to-levy-a-minimum-penalty-of-6621-lakh-on-rajinikanth/article30738074.ece
332,2020/02/05,Choolaimedu police lend a helping hand to transgenders,"The future seemed bleak for 22-year-old transgender M. Bharati, from Villupuram, when she landed in Chennai a year ago. However, her life took a different trajectory, after the unlikeliest of benefactors — the Choolaimedu police station personnel — came to her aid. They, along with a few others, are helping Ms. Bharati finish her college education, so that she can get a government job.

It is not just Ms. Bharati that the Choolaimedu police have helped. They have supported over 15 transgenders start afresh, by getting them jobs and helping them start their own businesses.

Ms. Bharati, who has studied B.A. History, has a few arrears, which she hopes to clear soon. “I could not focus on my studies due to personal problems. The society, including my family members, look at me with suspicion. I wish to become a village administrative officer (VAO) and help others,” she says.

It was with this dream that she left home for Chennai. She fortuitously met E. Shyam Kumar, who gave her a job at his hostel, a place to stay and food. He also introduced her to G. Anand Babu, Inspector, Choolaimedu police station. She now asserts: “I will clear the arrears and appear for the VAO exam.”

She also helps clean the police station and runs errands. “We will bear the tuition charges. We pool in money and pay her ₹3,000 a month. Besides, Mr. Shyam also provides her a monthly salary of ₹10,000,” says D. Jhansi Rani, sub-inspector, Choolaimedu. The police have also helped bring a change in the life of D. Velvizhi. They helped her start a foodstall in Namashivayapuram, Choolaimedu. “I now earn ₹30,000 a month. I have also adopted a boy,” says Ms. Velvizhi.

Helping the elderly

The police also pool in money every month to provide rations for elderly transgenders in their jurisdiction. Besides, the police have helped six transgenders get jobs, and will be helping a few set up water can business and biryani businesses. They will be given a month’s training in cooking. “When I started interacting with them, I understood the problems they face. Most of them are talented, but society sees them in a negative way. Like others, they just need a platform to showcase their talents,” adds Ms. Jhansi Rani.

Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan said the initiative could be implemented in other station limits too, where there is a considerable transgender population.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/f8760y/article30738044.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THHONEY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/choolaimedu-police-lend-a-helping-hand-to-transgenders/article30738045.ece

334,2020/02/05,Cancer Institute provides breast prosthesis to patients,"To help rehabilitate women who have undergone mastectomy (total breast removal) for breast cancer, the Cancer Institute (WIA), Adyar, has launched an initiative to provide silicon breast prosthesis.

On World Cancer Day on Tuesday, V. Shanta, chairman of the Cancer Institute, handed over the breast prosthesis to patients. This year, the day is being observed with the tagline, ‘I am and I will’, emphasising the need for early detection and cancer prevention and raising awareness on signs to reduce cancer morbidity and improve patients’ chances of survival.

The initiative, supported by the HCL Foundation, will be a continuous process, in which women who undergo mastectomy at the institute will receive the prosthesis, V. Surendran, associate professor and head, Department of Psycho-oncology, Cancer Institute, said.

Arvind Krishnamurthy, professor and head, Department of Surgical Oncology at the institute, said earlier, every appropriately-staged woman with breast cancer had to necessarily undergo mastectomy. “However, over the last three decades, the option of breast conservation has become available, especially for women with early-stage cancers, with survival outcomes similar to the traditional mastectomy approach. Breast conservation is also an option for highly-selected women with advanced-stage breast cancers, who respond well to upfront chemotherapy,” he said.

Approximately 10-35% women with early-stage breast cancer in India opt for breast conservation, he said, adding: “The factors at play include eligibility of women for conservation, as against mastectomy, patient preference and doctor’s attitude.”

With relatively high mastectomy rates in the country, there is a definite need to rehabilitate these women, he said.

“Rehabilitative options include plastic surgery or prosthetic rehabilitation with silicon. Hence, we at the Cancer Institute are giving women, who have undergone mastectomy, the option of external silicon prosthesis. It will be given free for patients who cannot afford the same,” he added.

Dr. Shanta stressed on the need to dispel myths about cancer. “There is no need for fear. Cancer is curable, but early diagnosis is important. Cancer can be prevented. We need to create more awareness to dispel the myths,” she said. The institute organised a cycle rally to create awareness on cancer, while students held placards at 25-30 traffic signals in the city. Newton Raj, deputy manager, HCL Foundation, was present.

At the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, participants, led by dean R. Jayanthi, took a pledge to create awareness on cancer, that was followed by a rally. V.S. Hospitals organised an awareness walkathon. S. Subramanian, chairman and managing director of the hospital, was present.

335,2020/02/05,Unsold stock of luxury units goes up by 33% in city: study,"While the city’s unsold luxury stock increased by 33% in a year, the tilt has been towards affordable and mid-segment housing, according to a recent analysis done by Anarock Property Consultants.

The unsold luxury stock rose from 2,480 units in 2018 to nearly 3,300 units by 2019-end, the analysis claimed. The value of the unsold stock is pegged at ₹5,730 crore at the end of 2019. The average size of the unsold luxury unit is approximately 2,000 sq ft, while the average property price is at ₹13,000 per sq ft.

“The city’s housing demand has moulded itself over the last few years, and it now largely tilts towards affordable and mid-segment housing. Even investors are keeping away from the luxury residential segment,” said Sanjay Chugh, city head-Chennai, Anarock Property Consultants.

“Further, even while the overall new supply, across various budget segments, declined in Chennai by as much as 17% in 2019, against 2018, new supply in the luxury segment saw an uptick of 29%,” he said. Developers added more than 1,100 new luxury units in 2019, priced above ₹1.5 crore.

Drop in rentals

As per Anarock research, the top areas with maximum unsold stock in luxury category (>₹1.5 cr.) are Anna Nagar, Adyar, Perambur, Thiruvanmiyur and Besant Nagar.

Srinivas Anikipatti, senior director-Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Knight Frank India, said in the luxury segment, floors were not innovative and did not cater to demand. He added, “Sizes planned are too large with smaller bedrooms and larger living spaces, and this layout is not preferential to customers.” According to him, rentals have dropped. “A high-end customer can pay rental and live in a luxurious community, without paying the cost of it. For a luxury apartment, the ROI via rental is sub 2%. So rent v/s buy, a rent option is a financially sensible one,” he said.

Siva Krishnan, managing director-Chennai, Jones Lang LaSalle, said: “You cannot cut prices after a point in luxury projects. That’s one reason why such inventory is stagnant. But we are seeing good traction in certain properties. It depends on the location too,” he added.

The managing director of a real estate firm, who wished anonymity, agreed that stock has been piling up in the luxury segment. “They will find takers in the coming months. This is also not happening just in Chennai. This has been the trend across the country,” he said. He also pointed out that the term luxury varies from each location. “What is luxury in Anna Nagar will be a mid-segment in Nungambakkam,” he said.

In India, unsold luxury stock had increased by 10% y-o-y in the top 7 cities by 2019-end. There were 89,200 units of unsold luxury stock (homes priced > ₹1.5 Crore) by 2019-end, as against 81,290 units in 2018. The overall value of unsold luxury stock, as on 2019, is estimated to be nearly ₹1.59 lakh crore, which is 34% of total unsold stock value.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/a0inde/article30737954.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5THBUILDING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unsold-stock-of-luxury-units-goes-up-by-33-in-city-study/article30737955.ece
336,2020/02/05,Continuity and fiscal follow-through,"The appointment of the Fifteenth Finance Commission by the President of India under Article 280 of the Constitution was notified on November 27, 2017. It was required to submit the report by October 30, 2019 for five years for the period 2020-21 to 2024-25. However, due to various political and fiscal developments, notifications were issued first, on July 27 extending the tenure of the Commission up to November 30, 2019, and again on November 29 requiring it to submit two reports, one for 2020-21 and the second covering the period of five years beginning April 1, 2021 and further extending the tenure up to October 30, 2021. The first report submitted by the Commission was placed in Parliament by the Union Finance Minister before presenting the Union Budget on February 1, 2019.

Basis for extension

There were good reasons for extending the tenure of the Finance Commission as making medium-term projections in the current scenario would have entailed serious risks. First, the abolition of Statehood to Jammu and Kashmir required the Commission to make an estimation excluding the Union Territory. Second, the deceleration in growth and low inflation has substantially slowed down the nominal GDP growth which is the main tax base proxy; making projections of tax revenues and expenditures based on this for the medium term could have posed serious risks. Finally, poor revenue performance of tax collection and more particularly Goods and Services Tax combined with the fact that the compensation agreement to the loss of revenue to the States was effective only two years of the period covered by the Commission’s recommendations posed uncertainties.

On projections

The Commission has continued with the approach and methodology adopted by the previous Commissions for tax devolution and revenue-gap grants. It has made projections of revenues and revenue expenditures of the Union and individual States, applied selective norms to the latter, recommended devolution of taxes to the States from the divisible pool, and recommended revenue deficit grants for the States which had post-devolution gaps. Although there were apprehensions that it may deviate from past practice as the terms of reference of the Commission had indicated, “The Commission may also examine whether revenue deficit grants be provided at all”, it continued with the past practice.

By stating that, “…stability and predictability of resources is an essential component of good long-term budgeting for both Union and States”, the Fifteenth Finance Commission continued with the recommendation of the previous Commission relating to vertical division of taxes, and adjusted the States’ share to 41% to exclude the share of Jammu and Kashmir. There were media reports that the share would be reduced and by maintaining the share, the Commission has avoided controversy.

However, for the period 2021-25, it has stated: “Our recommendation in the final report would undergo changes and adjustments as appropriate, in the light of subsequent data and analysis”. For the horizontal shares, however, the formula has been changed to consider “fiscal needs, equity and efficiency”.

Addressing States’ concerns

In addition to income distance, population and area and forest cover, it has used two additional factors — demographic performance and tax effort. It has assigned 15% weight to the 2011 population, reduced the weight of income distance to 45%, increased the weight to forest cover and ecology to 10% and 12.5% weight to demographic performance and 2.5% weight to tax effort. There was considerable controversy over the terms of reference of the Commission requiring it to use 2011 population in its formula by the States that had taken initiatives to arrest population growth.

By keeping the weight of 2011 population at 15% and giving an additional 12.5% to demographic performance which is the inverse of fertility rate, the Commission has shown sensitivity to the concerns of these States.

In terms of relative shares in tax devolution, among the major States the biggest loser is Karnataka followed by Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Kerala and Andhra Pradesh have post-devolution gaps and hence qualify for revenue gap grants. The major reason for Karnataka and Kerala losing on devolution is that their per capita income growth has been faster than most other States. The difference from the highest per capita income in both Karnataka and Kerala is just about 10% now as compared to 34% and 23%, respectively, for the two States when the Fourteenth Finance Commission made the recommendation. In the case of Karnataka and Telangana, as the projected transfer (devolution and revenue-gap grants) in 2020-21 were lower than 2019-20, the Commission recommended a special grant of ₹5,495 crore and ₹723 crore, respectively. However, the government has not accepted the recommendation and has asked the Commission to reconsider it.

Local body grants

The recommended grants for local bodies amount to ₹90,000 crore comprising ₹60,750 crore for panchayats and the remaining ₹29,250 crore for municipal bodies. All the three layers of panchayats will receive the grant and 50% of the grant is tied to improving sanitation and supply of drinking water; the remaining is untied. In the case of municipal bodies, ₹9,229 crore is allocated to cities with a million-plus population and the remaining ₹20,021 is allocated to other towns. In the case of disaster relief, the Commission has recommended the creation of disaster mitigation fund at the Central and State levels. For disaster management, a total of ₹28,183 crore has been determined of which the Central contribution will be ₹22,184 crore. Inter-State allocation is made based on past expenditures, area and population and disaster risk index.

The Commission has worked out a framework for giving some sectoral grants as well. For 2020-21, it has recommended ₹7,735 crore for improving nutrition based on the numbers of children in the 0-6 age group and lactating mothers. In the main report, it has proposed to give grants for police training, modernisation and housing, railway projects in States taken on a cost-sharing basis, maintenance of the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana roads, strengthening the judicial system, and improving the statistical system. The States are required to prepare the necessary grounds. It has also presented a broad framework for recommending monitorable performance grants for agricultural reform, development of aspirational districts and blocks, power sector reform, and incentives to enhance trade including exports and pre-primary education. The challenge, however, will be to design and dovetail sectoral and performance grants with the existing plethora of central sector and centrally sponsored schemes.

337,2020/02/05,No debate,"It is unfortunate that the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha has repeatedly refused to entertain notices given under Rule 267, on the issue of giving space to the Opposition (Inside pages, “Debate denial irks Rajya Sabha MPs”, February 4). Undoubtedly, the nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens were significant events in the recent past, if not post-Independence history. Hence, it would have been imperative to discuss and debate these issues in the Rajya Sabha. On the other hand, it has not been uncommon to find those inthe ruling regime launching into monologues about the CAA and the NRC from time to time. If they have the facts, the logic and reason, it is unclear why they are shying away from a debate in Parliament.

338,2020/02/05,Remarks on Mahatma,"It is highly condemnable the way the Father of the Nation is being maligned and the sacrifices he had made to achieve freedom trivialised by those in politics (Page 1, “BJP pulls up Hedge for remarks on Gandhiji”, February 4). Casting aspersions on the motives and commitment of leaders such as Gandhiji and Jawaharlal Nehru, who put their heart and soul in the pursuit of freedom, and eulogising those who played insignificant or subversive roles during the freedom struggle have become routine as far as certain political members are concerned. This does not need elaboration. Such thoughtless utterances fabricating the events of the past with ulterior motives will only create a negative impact in the minds of the generations born after Independence; it must be remembered that they do not have any first-hand knowledge of the trials and tribulations of the country and what our selfless leaders underwent during the freedom movement. The reaction of the BJP’s leadership in similar cases in the past does not give any confidence or comfort that it would act with an iron hand to avoid a recurrence of such statements.

When the 150th birth anniversary of Bapu is in focus, it is unfortunate that a sitting MP of the ruling party makes such disparaging remarks about the Father of the Nation. . The Opposition’s lack of unity on many critical national issues is what has emboldened the ruling party to think it can get away with anything. It is high time the party in question learnt its lessons.

A.V. Akhilesh,

If according to the MP in question the Mahatma was so insignificant, then why did Albert Einstein say: “Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth”? Why was he called the “Father of our Nation”, by Netaji? Will the ruling party discipline the errant MP?

342,2020/02/05,Women out running,"Sakshi, 15, is a little shy when her teammates point to her as the fastest runner. The group of girls on the Pardada Pardadi’s under-17 basketball team, from Bulandshahr, is always in training, for numerous events they take part in and outside the Uttar Pradesh, many of which they say they come out at the top. This makes it easy to take part in running events, of which Run for Her is one.

Organised over three year now, the run takes place on Women’s Day, March 8, with an aim to raise awareness about women’s empowerment, by way of running. Organised by the High Commission of Canada and the Run with Me Foundation, led by coach Ravinder, the money raised will go to the Pardada Pardadi Educational Society that supports eduction for girls, the Navjyoti India Foundation that works on women’s safety and empowerment, and In For The Cause that helps society be inclusive of those with a disability.

While last year saw about 1,000 women participate, this year coach Ravinder says he’s hoping to see about 1,200, with a few men taking part too. “We want to include men who support women’s running too,” he says, citing those who run in mixed groups for either safety or a sense of camaraderie.

Ankush Mendiratta, whose group Run Bugs has more women than men, says the least men can do, considering the city isn’t safe for women at 4:30 or 5 a.m. when they set out for a run, is to run together. In a men-for-women format developed by the Pinkathon, Mendiratta says, “I get calls asking, ‘Can I run?’ So I ask people to come and join us for tea on a Saturday just to get a sense of the connections we have and the positive spirit.” Women, often reticent about sport find support in these groups.

Of a women’s-only run, Rama Vedashree, 60, who has been running for the past decade or so, says, “New women runners tend to come for this because it’s less intimidating. Distances are — at 3 km, 5 km, 10 km — are doable. A lot of my running friends run with their daughters (those as young as six can participate).” She adds that it’s also a pleasant experience to run in the Chanakyapuri diplomatic area, where it’s rare to get permission for an event.

In the meantime, 50 girls from Pardada Pardadi are getting ready to come to Delhi to run the race. They had five podium finishes out of six last year. “At first our parents weren’t happy with us going out of station, but when they see us win, they’re encourage us now,” says Deepika Chaudhary, one of the participants.

343,2020/02/05,When 'Masterchef USA' contestants did a cookoff in Gummidipoondi,"What are two Masterchef contestants doing at a small school, tucked away in the meandering bylanes of Gummidipoondi?

Subha Ramiah, is no stranger to these woods. Born in Chennai, the alumnus of Anna University, who now calls New York home, is not letting his celebrity get in the way of a community cook-out at the Cascade Montessori rural resource center, run by the Relief Foundation. “I went to college with Vidya Shankar who started the Relief Foundation to give back to the local community through holistic education.” he says.

The foundation, set up in 1998, brings a child-centric education to primary students in deserving communities. It also trains parents, treating them as important stakeholders in the children’s education.

“This cause is close to my heart, and on every trip I like to come down and help in any way I can,” he says.

On this trip, he has brought along Noah Sims, his Masterchef (USA, Season 10) co-conspirator.

He adds, “I also ran into Chef Anand who works with Gossip Fusion Bistro in Kanathur. Along with staff at Gossip, Sims and I will present a labour of love for the students of Cascade, and their parents.”

The menu is simple, yet wholesome, with some Indian-Cajun flair-vegetarian gumbo, fresh salad, and rice.

Noah Sims with children from the local community

The Gossip kitchen staff procured all the produce, prepped some of it, and two chefs accompanied Subha and Sims to the lush school compound.

The Indian experience

Noah Sims, at 6 foot 7 inches towers over the kitchen staff, in the compound. He is furiously chopping over 90 apples, that will go into a rainbow salad of local fruit and vegetables, dressed delicately with tamarind and lemons found at the school. Dressed in a tie and dye vest and overalls, Sims alternates between checking on the salad, and joking around with the sous chefs.

“It’s been a dream to visit India since I did a project on this country in Grade I. I’ve tried over 64 dishes in just six days, and boy, have I fallen in love with the culture and cuisine! I can eat tamarind straight out of the pod now, and have danced at a sangeet in front of 800 people over the weekend. It’s awesome!” exclaims the Georgian resident who made quite an impression on Gordon Ramsay and his crew, with his mean grilling skills.

“It’s funny. I’m known for my steaks, but come November, I turned vegan. Cutting out animal fat completely has made all the difference. I even eat my two pound salads with chopsticks to really slow down my meal time,” he says.

The dish cooked in Louisiana style

Healthy, local food is the USP with both Subha and Sims. “I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in 2013 and was immediately put on a cocktail of medicines. But I wanted to control my sugar naturally. I did a lot of research and it all came down to portion control and glucose monitoring. I ensure that one-third of my plate is always filled with fruit and veggies,” says Subha, while emptying a cup of cajun spice and Kashmiri mirch (chilli) into the vat of simmering gumbo.

As the scent wafts over the compound, the mirch makes a good first impression, while the other spices play second fiddle to the medley of ladies finger, peppers and tomatoes .

The Indian engineer-turned-chef explains, “The holy trinity for me with cooking Louisiana style, is the celery, green onion and parsley combination, a nice spice mix and of course the roux (a creamy mixture of fat and flour, used as a base for gravies/bakes). Studying at Louisiana State University, I had actually cooked for international student delegations, but my first brush with cooking was at home, making savoury snacks and coffee when visitors came over. ”

Subha quickly samples the gumbo that Sims is stirring, adding honey for balance. “The way I cook hasn’t changed after the competition, but I have learned the importance of plating, respecting unfamiliar ingredients and the nuances of baking,” says Subha.

Sims feels differently: “I’ve been cooking since I was 20, and the competition taught me a lot about my limits. The spectacle of it all, is amplified by the drama that they induce. So I had to step back and let my cooking do the talking!” Dhruva, a 10-year old student comes to split a gulkand sandwich with Sims, which he delightfully inhales.

“It’s so fortuitous that we met Subha and Sims,” says Ramya Venkatraman, who runs Gossip Fusion Bistro, and a food court at Mahindra World City with her husband Hari Ganesan.

“We like to pay it forward by cooking for children at different homes and schools every month. Since Subha was doing a cookout here, Gossip sourced the supplies, arranged for logistics and made a pumpkin-carrot-beetroot layered halwa, to top off this very special meal.”

Their restaurant in Kanathur is hosting a five-course meal, curated by the Master Chefs on February 6, where Southern comfort food crosses paths with Cajun chutzpah.

Sims explains, “I am doing bunless burgers, with some onion chutney, Subha will do gumbo, jambalaya, Cajun fish and together, we will create some nice old-fashioned desserts with bourbon thrown in for good measure. It’s a good mix of our styles and stories.”

344,2020/02/05,Cafe-bar SOCIAL is finally in Chennai!,"Yes, there is alcohol. Let’s get that out of the way first, so you don’t suspiciously speed read through this piece. Rest-assured, SOCIAL’s signature ‘Longest Long Island Ice tea’ will not fob you off with just lemon juice, Cola and enthusiasm.

To be fair, with the city’s complex licensing laws, Chennai did end up hosting the world’s first Hard Rock Cafe for teetotallers. Which could explain why it took Riyaaz Amlani, CEO and managing director of Impresario Handmade Restaurants, this long to bring his popular, community space to Chennai. (The first SOCIAL opened in Bengaluru in 2014, and since then the brand has opened 27 more in six cities.)

With the launch a couple of days away, the sprawling 8,600 square feet space that is now Mount Road SOCIAL, at Express Avenue, is packed with electricians, carpenters, painters and waiters, working to a unorthodox rhythm of hammers, drills and thumping music from the DJ box.

Despite the looming deadline, there is a calm energy around Riyaaz and his team. For good reason: Impresario, founded in 2001 with Mocha – Coffees & Conversations, now has 58 restaurants across 16 Indian cities. They are expanding so rapidly that there are openings every month: they head to Bengaluru next to open a SOCIAL in Indiranagar. So, this is a familiar drill.

In pauses between the hammers and saws, Riyaaz explains why he waited for the ideal property. “We are a workspace and a cafe-bar by day. We open for breakfast... so we needed a place with a high footfall.”

This has a very different feel from his first venture, Mocha, launched 19 years ago, first in Mumbai, and then eventually in Chennai. “We had a good eight years or so in Nungambakkam, before we closed,” he says.

Mocha was a product of the early 2000s, with its over-the-top furnishings and unapologetically laid back atmosphere, and service. SOCIAL is a completely different entity, created for an age of startups, entrepreneurs and mobile workspaces, at a time when boundaries between work and leisure are getting increasingly blurry.

“Mocha was a café for Gen X-ers like me. SOCIAL was created keeping millennials in mind,” says Riyaaz, adding, “People used to go to cafés for social interaction. Slowly business meetings started taking place there. We realised that they were evolving into spaces where people like to work, partly because they found it more inspiring than sitting in their office. And partly because cafés are more social...”

Which is how SOCIAL was born, six years ago. “There was an awkwardness about how long you could linger. So we made it more formal. We added a concierge, a printer, a scanner and high speed Internet,” says Riyaaz, adding they also encourage networking. “We are trying to create a collusion between people who can work with each other.”

There is an emphasis on each space being unique. “The trick behind a community space is to start something, and get out of its way,” says Riyaaz. “We like the regulars to tell us what the menu should be. Or what programming should be. Every community has its own distinct flavour.”

Chennai surfaces in the décor and menu via local graffiti artists who have painted the skate park at the entrance, and Marina beach via netholi tacos, served with garlic aioli. (Chase this with their beers on tap, which include Hopper, Heineken and Edelweiss.) There’s a Thalaiva breakfast too, with dosas, idli, kesari and filter coffee.

Inspired by the neon-heavy 80s, the Chennai cafe-bar has generously proportioned spaces, each deliberately different. The co-working area, Social Works, is bright and cheerful, with large windows that let in natural light. The terrace features a relaxed cane canopy. And inside, a riot of different elements unite, including a faux swimming pool and dramatic hanging lights, making you feel like an extra in an old-fashioned music video.

“It’s neon, it’s retro, it’s electro. It’s post modern,” smiles Riyaaz, adding “It’s a Miami, Ibiza vibe.”

345,2020/02/05,Why learning to cook Pulicat’s food is important to save this ecologically sensitive wetland,"Activism and seafood make for an unusual, but unexpectedly persuasive, meal.

As part of the ongoing Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha, an all-star cast recently combined forces to bring Pulicat and its fishing community to the city, by serving up a meal that was a crafty combination of prawn biryani, crab curry and hope.

For this intervention, chefs of Sea Salt joined forces with the women of Pulicat to edit generations of their culinary heritage into one, neat seafood thali, with inputs from Divya Karnad and Chaitanya Krishna of InSeason Fish. And Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha’s most engaging volunteers, social activist-writer Nityanand Jayaraman and Carnatic music vocalist-author TM Krishna stepped in, wielding music and information, to explain why Chennai needs to be more invested in Pulicat.

The result: a set of unique community gatherings for lunch and dinner over three days, using Pulicat’s freshly caught, small, sweet crabs to trigger conversations about sustainability.

Discussing how the restaurant was packed with appreciative diners, Chef Harish Rao, who spent time with the women in Pulicat to learn their recipes, says that the food was an eye-opener.

“There are various villages that come together there: they have an organisation where fisherwomen sit together for meetings. We went to their office premises to meet them,” he says, adding that the chefs quickly realised that the recipes were unique for two reasons. “One is the fact that they have the backwaters, and the sea. So they get a variety of seasonal fish... all line-caught, or with a net,” he says.

Network of communities

So the chefs were able to incorporate fresh ladyfish, silver biddy and mackerel into the thali, in addition to the prawns and crabs the area is known for.

The second is a rich culinary heritage born from this network of Hindus, Muslims and Christians living and cooking side by side. “These women knew each other’s recipes, so we learnt from all of them, together,” says Chef Harish.

When asked for the speciality of the area, the women cooked up crunchy prawn karakal, an ingenious dish that involves boiling fresh prawns till the water evaporates, then roasting them till crisp in the same kadai, with sea salt and red chillies. “It just opened my eyes,” says Chef Harish, who has spent years collating recipes from communities across South India. He adds, “I had never seen anything like it.”

Every meal featured a classical vocalist. On Saturday night, TM Krishna performed, opening with a powerful, and disarmingly casual rendition of the now familiar ‘Poramboke’, which was released in 2016 as part of the campaign to save Ennore Creek and the Kosasthalaiyar river.

As he walked between tables singing — after wryly commenting, “I’ve been told I have to sing for my supper,” — the Sea Salt team began serving thalis, featuring mackerel puttu, dainty prawn vadais, crab masala and lady fish fry, in addition to a fragrant prawn biryani, and a cool, creamy rose kheer.

Discussing why this event is a vital part of Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha, Nityanand said, “Pulicat is one of the most important wetlands in Chennai. And it is under threat.” He spoke about “the danger of large industrial projects coming up, which threaten to smother the wetlands...”

Head to Pulicat The Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha concludes with a day at Pulicat on February 16, starting with a Nature trail from the sea to the backwaters, traversing over sand dunes. This will be followed by lunch, cooked by the Pulicat community. It culminates in a concert with dance and music, at 4.30 pm.

Buses are being organised. Check out the festival’s Facebook page for details on registration.

The Hindu reported in August 2019 how, with the Kattupalli port expansion plan getting the initial nod from the Centre, the locals — fishermen and farmers — fear a loss of livelihood. And how, continued industrialisation of the city’s far North has left a fragile, already polluted ecosystem gasping for breath. It adds that representatives from villages around the project Master Plan publicly opposed it, saying that the expansion will mean the destruction of an ecology that sustains the livelihood of around 50,000 fisherfolk in and around the Ennore-Pulicat region.

“When they fight this battle, it is important that we support them,” added Krishna, “For our own survival, we need places like Pulicat.”

He then launched into a song of the fishermen, pausing only to explain that most fishermen don’t sing any more since mechanised boats lack the rhythm of the row boats. By the second verse, everyone was singing along.

In these times, chaotic with bad news and frenetic social media campaigns, Krishna and Nityanand have realised that the most powerful way to connect with a distracted urban audience is to attach compelling faces to causes.

Even amidst an empathy burnout, it is difficult to turn away after eating a meal cooked by women like the smiling G Rajalakshmi, who entreated diners to enjoy their meal, adding, “We are fighting this battle using food as our weapon.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/q5sz6l/article30743781.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5MPPulicatSeaSaltjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/why-learning-to-cook-pulicats-food-is-important-to-save-this-ecologically-sensitive-wetland/article30743784.ece
346,2020/02/05,Craving baklava or babka? Get this and more at The Rolling Scones,"The thing that drew Siddharth Parmar and Shruti Dwivedi together was a love of travel and food. It was while celebrating Shruti’s birthday in Venice that they experienced the turning point: a tiramisu that blew their minds. On their return to Bengaluru, the couple who has been married for three years now, hunted high and low but a similar tasting tiramisu proved elusive.

“These desserts, which you might term gourmet, weren’t easily available. There was a gap in the market. We just talked about it but we didn’t think we would actually do anything about it. But slowly Siddharth started cooking and experimenting,” says Shruti, who works as an analyst in Flipkart.

And so around Christmas time in 2018, The Rolling Scones was born (the name comes from Siddharth’s love for one band in particular). Initially, operated from their house in Whitefield, as orders went up, Siddharth moved operations to a kitchen outside, operating on a delivery model.

On the menu are 16 dishes from across the world, including babka (Poland), baklava (Turkey), pasteis de nata (Portugal), dark chocolate layered cake (Belgium), pavlova (New Zealand), crème brulee and mille feuille (both from France), Tarta de Santiago and flan (both from Spain), cannoli and, of course, the tiramisu, (both from Italy).

Says Siddharth, who manages everything pretty much on his own, from cooking to delivery, “I started cooking fairly late in life; around six or seven years ago. This translated to trying my hand at baking, starting with a pizza and then eventually moving to desserts.”

As for the desserts that made it to the menu, he says, “I must have made each dessert at least five times before putting it there. It takes a lot of experimentation and weighing the ingredients to get the right taste or consistency. For example, the tiramisu, which is something that is close to our hearts (we still reminisce about it), I made it more than eight times before putting it on the menu. Traditionally, it’s made with uncooked egg yolk but that would not work here in India. So, I had to experiment a lot to do away with the eggs altogether.”

On what his future plans are, he says, “Some fine day, five or six years from now, I want to be in a position where I have a café in Bangalore. I’m basically working towards that. I don’t want to rush it; I’m being very slow but very steady. I haven’t hired anyone because I don’t want to degrade the quality of the products.”

Prices start at ₹180 for a single serving of tiramisu and go up to ₹800 for a 750 grams cake (eggless). Orders need to be placed at least one day in advance.

347,2020/02/05,Winemaker Kishan Pedhapally talks about his professional journey,"Kishan Pedhapally who launched his Asav wines was once known to all hoteliers and those in the F&B business as Sula Kishan because of his constant engagement with the (Sula) brand. Incidentally, he was also instrumental in bringing license fee of ₹2 lakh down to ₹10,000 per label. It involved many years of innumerable visits and meetings with business heads of restaurants, policy makers and decision takers to be where he is. He may be a wine person, but he begins his morning by greeting his friends and business associates with a ‘drink responsibly’ message. “I never cross the limit of two glasses of wine when I am out partying. I totally believe in enjoying the drink,” shares Kishan.

Kishan could be dealing with his own brand of wine at present but he didn’t have a rosy start. He recollects his humble beginning with a smile, never wanting to hide or forget it. “Since I come from a middle-class family, I knew I would have to struggle if I want to make something out of myself; something more than bringing home a salary. I started modelling during my college days to earn pocket money and get some visibility. I won’t say that made me successful, but it definitely helped me step out and face the world,” he says.

That was when he and his friends heard of job opening at erstwhile Bhaskara Palace; they jumped right in. “We joined as stewards in the hotel. My friends called it quits within a week. I didn’t want to forego a week’s salary after hard work, so I continued to complete the month. I felt it would be unprofessional to quit midway; if I quit it would also make me give up on my first job. Completing a month was a challenge which I took up,” recollects Kishan.

With that month’s salary in his pocket, Kishan was determined to become a mechanic.

Since he didn’t know what could be a good career option, he wanted to try things that he knew he could handle. “The garage people made me wash cars as an internship,” he laughs. So Kishan washed cars and didn’t really get to fix any automobile. Then he read about job openings. “It was during this time that the liquor prohibition was lifted. Smirnoff was entering the state (then Andhra Pradesh). The job call was for a sales executive. As I entered the room at Minerva with my friends, all we could see were experienced people. At about 2pm my friends insisted that we leave, they said we couldn’t have much hope against the experienced candidates. I waited till I was called in for a chat at 10pm. They spoke to me and asked me to come again the following day, this continued for a week. Finally I was offered a job and I did my best to prove what I promised,” recollects Kishan.

As a businessman, Kishan says if you are ashamed of doing anything that is required to make the brand visible, then you will find it hard to succeed. After a few years with Smirnoff, Kishan moved on to a wine company. “Everything was hunky dory until the license fee was hiked. That hike affected the market and the brand I was working with decided to shut operations in Hyderabad,” he said.

This is when Kishan pulled up his socks and spent months pushing the file seeking reduction of license fee from one room to the other in the Secretariat. “₹10,000 per label. It was the most tiring work without knowing whether I would succeed or fail. Finally when I was successful, everyone took notice of me. That was the real success. But now I know there is no better feeling than having to work and launch my own wine brand. There were lots of visits to and fro Nasik carrying bottles of wines to get the brand visibility. Now that it is visible, I feel I have been able to live my dream,” smiles Kishan.

What does he plan to do next? “Start an exclusive wine and salsa club. For that, I will walk as much as needed to make it happen.”",food,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/4kwpaz/article30742606.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/kishan,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/food/kishan-pedhapally-asav-sula-wine/article30742607.ece
348,2020/02/05,"Ophelia at The Ashok: To go or not to go, that is the question","The annexe of the iconic The Ashok hotel in Chanakyapuri is perhaps the best spot in space-deprived South Delhi to open a restaurant. It’s a standalone, large and leafy spot, separate from the Government-owned hotel, where music is played until the wee hours of the morning. Till recently, the space boasted of Zerruco, a Mediterranean and Italian restaurant that never really took off, and now, restaurateur Akshay Anand of Toy Room fame has taken over and opened the opulent and pumping Ophelia. The cuisine, however, has not changed.

To paraphrase from Hamlet, to go, or not to go: that is the question. My answer: It’s an entertaining spot for some drinks and sheesha, but I would not go for the food alone.

The vibe: Ophelia, named after a character in Shakespeare’s play, Hamlet, has a lovely deck area with white cloth swathed cabanas, open flames and perfect mood lighting. Indoors is a stark contrast. The interior designer really went to town – high ceilings, lots of velvet and suede, mahogany type wood everywhere, gilded paintings and crystal chandeliers — you feel like you’re in a illicit den. You will either love Ophelia or hate it. It is a perfect yuppie spot, and on the evening I visited, the deck area was loud and packed with people dressed to impress. Thumping music was a constant, indoors or out.

Do try: From the Mediterranean menu, the Prawn Shish was grilled just right and the meat was plump and sweet. The Balloon Breads were also fluffy and light. On the Italian menu, the Pappardelle with Pulled Pork Ragout was the star of the evening. Full of flavour, the pasta was fresh and the ragout coated each strand pasta perfectly.

Skip: The mainstay of any Mediterranean/Turkish menu is hummus, falafel, shawarma and pide (flat bread). Unfortunately, all four were poor. The hummus was too liquidy, the falafel was too dry and over fried, the shawarmas were closer to desi wraps than the Ottoman original, and the pide was flat in terms of texture and flavour.

Go with: Over 25s (Delhi’s legal age to drink) and under 40s (you just wont fit in if you’re older).

Space bar: 8,000 sq. ft.; 180 covers indoors and out

How much: Unnecessarily expensive at ₹4,500 for two, sans alcohol

Getting there: There is valet parking as well as ample parking space.

350,2020/02/05,Farmers protest unpaid insurance,"A group of more than 100 farmers from across the State staged a protest outside the office of an insurance company in Andheri on Tuesday, demanding payment of insurance for damaged crops.

The farmers, under the banner of Prahar Janshakti Paksh, alleged that the company had not released their claims under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana for the crop losses that they have suffered since 2018.

Farmers from Ahmednagar, Nashik, Jamkhed, Karjat and other districts were seen holding damaged crop in their hands and shouting slogans. The insurance was not being paid despite the fact that farmers had paid premiums on time, one of the protesters said. “We met the district agriculture officer in Ahmednagar to apprise him of the losses we have incurred, but nothing has been done so far,” he said.

A delegation of farmers met an official from the insurance company, who assured them their demands has been taken in writing and would be forwarded to the Central government.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/farmers-protest-unpaid-insurance/article30739932.ece
351,2020/02/05,CSMT-Panvel corridor may get Maglev train,"After the bullet train, hyperloop and monorail, Mumbai may well be the testing ground for a new transportation technology in the country — Maglev.

The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) is proposing to introduce the technology on the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT)-Panvel elevated fast corridor on a public-private partnership (PPP) model.

Sources said a Swiss-based company, SwissRapide AG, in partnership with an Indian company, had expressed interest in executing the project at a cost of nearly ₹13,347 crore.

Maglev is short for magnetic levitation and is in operation in Shanghai. The technology uses two sets of magnets to make the train levitate over the rails and propel it ahead, thereby eliminating the need for wheels or overhead wires. As a result, Maglev trains reach speeds of nearly 400 km per hour and are much quieter than any other mode of rail transport.

The proposal has been sent by the MRVC to the Railway Board and the State government for an in-principle approval.

The 55-km-long elevated line will be built with a spur to the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA). Sources said the proposal states that the train’s speed will be capped at 200 km per hour and will be able to complete the entire distance in 35 minutes.

The Swiss firm has proposed to run an eight-coach train with a carrying capacity of 2,872 passengers. It will have a headway of three minutes on the main corridor and 8.6 minutes for the NMIA spur.

Private investment is expected to cover the cost of construction, operation and running, but the government will need to foot the bill for land acquisition and utility shifting, which will be borne on a 50:50 cost-sharing basis between the State government and the Ministry of Railways.

The MRVC had earlier proposed the elevated corridor under its Mumbai Urban Transport Project 3A at an estimated ₹10,870 crore, but did not get Cabinet approval, considering the cost.

The minimum fare was pegged at ₹10 and maximum fare at ₹110.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/csmt-panvel-corridor-may-get-maglev-train/article30738359.ece
352,2020/02/05,Budget allocation for primary education up by ₹210 crore,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) presented a budget estimate of ₹2,944.59 crore for primary education for the financial year 2020-21, an increase of ₹210.82 crore over the last financial year. The budget for 2019-20 was ₹2,733 crore.

Ashutosh Salil, joint municipal commissioner (education), presented the annual education budget for all BMC-run schools. The BMC has made substantial allocations towards providing digital classrooms, self-defence training to girls, distribution of free scholastic materials and better infrastructure.

The corporation increased the allocation for the repair, upgradation and reconstruction of 467 school buildings, by ₹144.27 crore. The latest budget allocates ₹346 crore for the construction works, and a few of them will be completed by the end of March 2020. In addition, 15 new school buildings will be constructed.

The joint municipal commissioner announced that the Woolen Mill MCGM School in Dadar and the Poonam Nagar MCGM School in Andheri will be affiliated to the ICSE and CBSE boards respectively from the new academic year.

The BMC allocated ₹20 crore for installing cameras at all the schools’ entry and exit gates as well as in the classrooms of Class IV to Class VII. Last year, ₹24 crore was earmarked for installing the cameras.

The administration announced that head teachers will be given the power to appoint retired teachers on a temporary basis when any teacher has to proceed on long medical or maternity leave. These teachers could be appointed for anywhere between 11 and 179 days, and ₹2.95 crore has been allocated towards their salaries.

The BMC has also announced the allocation of ₹50 lakh to support undergraduate education of the first 25 rank holders in the Class X examination. An amount of ₹26 lakh has been allocated for the establishment of a mini-observatory with a digital telescope at the Vigyaan Kutuhal Bhavan.

An amount of ₹10 lakh was allocated for upgradation of old file storage in the offices into a modular sliding file storage system, while ₹1.84 crore was allocated for installing hand sanitisers in ‘specially-abled students’ schools. After the Kerala government initiated water break bells, the BMC has also proposed to provide three water breaks in one session.

Altogether 1,300 digital classrooms will be set up at a cost of ₹29 crore, whereas ₹111.82 crore has been allocated for the distribution of free scholastic materials like uniforms, rain footwear, raincoats and umbrellas. The BMC has also announced the continuation of self-defence training to girls from Class V to Class X alongwith an allocation of ₹7.86 crore for a fixed deposit scheme for girls.

Mr. Salil announced the allocation of ₹17.7 crore for free bus services to the schools, which was started in 2017.

353,2020/02/05,One held for robbing Bhiwandi businessman,"The Thane Police Crime Branch has arrested one of the six people who had executed an armed robbery at the Bhiwandi residence of a businessman last month.

According to Crime Branch officers, the complainant, a real estate developer who also works in the warehousing business, had gone out for a morning walk when the robbers struck on January 30.

“Four people barged in, each armed with a handgun, and held his wife, daughter and domestic help at gunpoint. They bound and gagged all the captives and robbed the house of cash and valuables worth ₹1.68 crore. They then fled with two others, who were keeping watch outside,” an officer said.

The officer said a complaint was registered at Narpoli police station and the Crime Branch was instructed to conduct parallel investigations into the matter. A joint team of officers and constables from the Central Unit and Property Cell was formed to probe the case.

“We obtained preliminary information from local informants, and developed it further using cellular location and analysis of CCTV camera footage to map the movements of the accused. On Monday, we traced and arrested one of them,” the officer said.

Preliminary inquiries with the accused, Dharmesh Vaishnav (38), a Navi Mumbai resident, have indicated that the gang kept a watch on the victim’s residence for several days to acquaint themselves with his daily routine.

“We found a bag in Mr. Vaishnav’s possession which contained gold jewellery worth ₹1.26 crore. The cash that they took is in the possession of the other accused and efforts are under way to trace and apprehend them,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, Thane Police Commissioner Vivek Phansalkar has declared a cash reward of ₹50,000 for the investigating team for its speedy detection of the case and recovery of the stolen valuables.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/one-held-for-robbing-bhiwandi-businessman/article30738329.ece
354,2020/02/05,Kala Ghoda’s new attraction: donate your hair for a cause,"Celebrity hairstylist Sapna Bhavnani was in great demand at the Kala Ghoda Festival on Tuesday, with women and children lining up for a haircut. Only this time, the reason behind getting a haircut was not to undergo an image makeover.

Around 40 people gathered in a corner at the festival venue, where Ms. Bhavnani had set up a special initiative to collect hair to be donated for cancer patients on the occasion of World Cancer Day on Tuesday. The hair collection drive was held from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., with Ms. Bhavnani giving free haircuts to anyone who had a hair length of at least 12 inches or more.

“I first held this drive at Jaslok Hospital in 2017 and adapted this to my salon, Mad-O-Wot, where people come on any day of the year to donate their hair and get free haircuts in return. Especially in India, confidence is in a way related to hair and losing all your hair amounts to one’s confidence being shaken. People who are donating hair are the real heroes today,” Ms. Bhavnani said.

The hair will be turned into wigs by Cope With Cancer, an NGO that works for cancer patients.

Urvija Sanghvi, chief executive officer at the NGO, said, “The drive is mostly for economically challenged patients but we also respond to any hospital or individual who sends us an email. Wigs are delivered to them by courier. Dyed and coloured hair is not accepted.”

Archana Toshniwal, one of the hair donors at Tuesday’s event, said she was taking part in the drive because she has a soft corner for cancer patients. “My undergraduate course was connected to infectious diseases. I know the ordeal patients go through. I love my long hair but think about women who have lost their hair to a disease and may not have it grow back naturally. In the larger scheme of things, I feel like I will contribute to a cause at such little cost.”

Vandana Mahajan, a cancer coach who mostly deals with stage 3 and stage 4 cancer patients, spoke about her own fight with thryroid cancer. “Beauty to literate people is different as compared to people from rural areas, for whom it is aligned to self-image and suffers a major blow (in case of cancer),” Ms. Mahajan said.

George Philip Alex, chief medical officer, Jaslok Hospital, said the hospital’s observation of their patients’ problems after chemotherapy moved them to start the initiative in 2017, which was then called the Hairley’s Angels. “The hair donated is braided and kept in samples because it will help in the making of the wigs. The braids will help in making of the skullcap needed for the wigs, without which they will get entangled.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/adpwli/article30738303.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bmhairdonatiom,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/kala-ghodas-new-attraction-donate-your-hair-for-a-cause/article30738306.ece
355,2020/02/05,"Schoolchildren cut through smoke, ask about tobacco use","Students from government and municipal schools came together for an unusual event on Tuesday — to ask questions on the harm tobacco causes. Their mentors: bureaucrats from various government departments.

The event marked the 14th Balparishad, a convention of select bal panchayats from government and municipal schools, and was held at N.M. Joshi Municipal School in Currey Road. Bal panchayats are governing bodies in every school constituting students.

The Salaam Bombay Foundation organised the event, titled ‘Collaboration for a Healthier Generation’. It covered topics like general nutrition, tobacco-free school policies, the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, food and health policies and prohibition on direct and indirect advertisements. The 300 students, from Classes VI to IX, were from 268 schools in the city.

There is a direct link between tobacco consumption and nutrition, said Tshering D. Bhutia, vice president, Preventive Health and Nutrition Programme, Salaam Bombay Foundation.

“Children who are not receiving complete nutrition have a lot of chemical reactions that can lead them to becoming addicted to something. I am not saying they will get addicted to tobacco per se but since tobacco is cheaper, it is more accessible,” Mr. Bhutia said.

Officials at the event included senior police inspector Sandesh Rewale from the Anti Human Trafficking Cell, Joint Commissioner Sailesh Adhav from the Food and Drug Administration, deputy director Krishna Methekar from the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, and assistant education officer Ranjana Rao from the State Education Department. They were joined by executive health officer Dr. Arun Nakhwa from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation and journalist Suvarna Joshi.

Sohel Khan, a Class IX student and bal panchayat leader of Sahakar Nagar municipal school, said the opportunity to interact directly with officials was a step towards bringing about change in society. “Tobacco should directly be banned. The children present here today will in a way spread awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco in their circles and help in spreading the word,” he said.

The students raised questions that dealt with the tobacco-free school policy in schools and its effectiveness, how can it be enforced better, and the role that commercials play in attracting impressionable minds towards addictive substances like tobacco. They also asked about other issues surrounding education, including the mid-day meal policy.

“To not consume tobacco should be an individual decision. It should start with us not exposing ourselves to such advertisements. Even when superstars take part in promoting products like pan masala or tobacco, they should be conscious that they are selling their individual personalities, which will in turn impact their massive fan following to take up such habits,” Ms. Joshi said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pyxkm8/article30738273.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bm-food-festival,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/schoolchildren-cut-through-smoke-ask-about-tobacco-use/article30738274.ece
356,2020/02/05,"Bullet train project a white elephant, says Uddhav","Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday said a decision on moving forward with the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project will be taken only after he is convinced it will boost industrial development of the State.

“Who will benefit from the bullet train? How will trade and industry in Maharashtra get a boost because of it? If it is useful, convince me and then let’s go before the people and decide what to do,” Mr. Thackeray said in the second part of his interview with Sanjay Raut, Shiv Sena MP and executive editor of party mouthpiece Saamana.

Asked about the bullet train being a dream project of Prime Miniser Narendra Modi, Mr. Thackeray said, “Even though it is a dream project, when someone wakes up, it is reality that faces them … We have to see what is urgent and not take up something because we are getting a loan at zero interest or low interest. We acquire farmers’ land for no reason and then look after these white elephants. This is not right.”

Since taking the reigns of the State, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has said the bullet train project is not a priority for it, attracting criticism from the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.

Central funds delayed

Mr. Thackeray said the State was not getting its rightful share of Central funds. “In December last year, I wrote to the Centre that ₹15,000 crore was pending, including the GST refund. Last month, we got around ₹4,500 crore. Now, the pending amount will increase again. Will the Opposition take out a morcha for this?” he asked.

“I will not say if the funds are being deliberately delayed. But there is a delay due to which State schemes are held up. If the money is received on time, the State government can utilise it for farmers,” he said.

The CM said the farm loan waiver announced by his government in December last year will be launched next month and loans up to ₹2 lakh will be waived. “A separate scheme for farmers with loans of more than ₹2 lakh and those who regularly repay their loan will be announced soon,” he said.

Loan waiver is a primary step to ease hardships of farmers, he said, adding that the priority is to ensure cultivators are economically empowered.

Mr. Thackeray said his government is reviewing the economic situation of Maharashtra. “The work is almost complete. Once it is over, we will place it before the people. Let them see how the State functioned earlier,” he said.

To another question, the chief minister said he had recently met industry captains in Mumbai and assured them that their grievances would be addressed. “I will not allow a single industry to move out of the State. Maximum locals should benefit in terms of employment from these industries,” he added.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bullet-train-project-a-white-elephant-says-uddhav/article30738269.ece
357,2020/02/05,Hausla: motivating cancer patients not to give up their fight,"A city-based music composer has produced a motivational music video for cancer patients to help them cope with the emotional distress caused by the disease. The song has been released in 12 Indian languages and the producers are working towards launching it in foreign languages such as Spanish and French.

First launched on World Cancer Day in 2019 in five languages, it was made in seven more languages this year. Playback singer Shaan has lent his voice in seven languages. The video depicts the journey of a young man diagnosed with cancer who loses hope and stops pursuing his hobbies. Gradually, his family and friends encourage him not to give up and he conquers the fight.

Director and music composer Hitesh Mishra said that the video is purely meant to encourage cancer patients to live freely without any emotional burden. “Dealing with cancer is distressing for patients. The video aims at boosting confidence of patients, as those who lose confidence, often don’t respond well to medications,” he said.

Mr. Mishra said they have also made a set of videos for caregivers who are often ignored and need a lot of support too. The video has been uploaded on an application named ‘Hausla’ and the producers are trying to share it across the hospitals of the country.

Low awareness rates

An online questionnaire-based survey carried out by by Nanavati Super Speciality Hospital, Mumbai, and BLK Hospital, New Delhi, has revealed low awareness about cervical cancer and breast cancer among youngsters. The respondents included 375 students between 18 to 21 from two Mumbai colleges and 220 students between 16 to 24 from Delhi.

“Almost 60% youths were unaware of cervical cancer, over 50% didn’t know of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which majorly causes the disease; 74% participants were unaware that self breast examination helps detect early signs of breast cancer,” the study said.

However, the youth was more aware about oral cancers and nearly 80% of those surveyed were aware about the direct correlation of tobacco and alcohol with that of oral cancers.

App for counselling

Hopscotch Health, a technology-driven healthcare start-up, and Asian Cancer Institute have launched a mobile application to help users quit tobacco.

The interactive app asks users about tobacco cravings, assigns tasks to distract them from the cravings and schedules emergency sessions with a counsellor. When the user completes a six-month paid course, a graduation is held. An updated version of the app will also have games to keep the user engaged and away from tobacco.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/xc51de/article30738243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMX-Ray1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hausla-motivating-cancer-patients-not-to-give-up-their-fight/article30738244.ece
358,2020/02/05,Cluster development outside Mumbai to to kick off tomorrow,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will lay the foundation stone of the first cluster development scheme outside Mumbai at Kisan Nagar-Jai Bhavani Nagar in Thane on Thursday.

Of the six Urban Renewal Plans (URPs) under the cluster development scheme, Kisan Nagar is the largest one, covering 132.37 ha. All six URPs — Kisan Nagar, Kopri (45.90 ha), Rabodi (35.4 ha), Hajuri (9.24 ha), Tekdi Bangla (4.17 ha) and Lokmanya Nagar (60.51 ha) were cleared by the State government on Tuesday.

The Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had submitted these six URPs to the government for approval, out of of 44 URPs. The total area to be covered under themis 287.59 ha. There will be 1.07 lakh constructions in the area and 4.85 lakh beneficiaries.

Politically, the decision will give a boost to the Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party in Thane. Urban Development Department Minister Eknath Shinde, who is from Thane, will launch the first cluster development project in his constituency.

The scheme was promoted in Thane as a tool to extend secure housing to people living in buildings classified as dangerous and extremely dangerous. There were fears that the scheme, cleared by the previous government, would be delayed in the judicial process. The TMC submitted a social impact assessment report to the Bombay High Court, following which the path for the scheme was cleared.

The Sena had earlier organised a protest march from Thane to Mantralaya demanding the implementation of the project. Mr. Thackeray had participated in it as well.

“Now that the URPs have been approved, the process to finalise the builder or consortium of builders will begin soon,” said an officer of the Urban Development Department.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/cluster-development-outside-mumbai-to-to-kick-off-tomorrow/article30738239.ece
359,2020/02/05,"Protest to be called off, says NCP leader; women refuse to budge","The agitation at Mumbai Central, known as the Mumbai Bagh protest, is likely to witness some turbulence over the next two days, with the politicians wanting to call it off but the women being adamant on staying put.

The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens started late at night on January 26 near the Arabia Hotel on Morland Road and has been continuing on a relay basis, with women being at the forefront.

On Monday night, the convening committee of the agitation, which includes leaders from parties like the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, met State Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.

“Several issues, like the fact that the protest is being carried out without proper police permission and that it is being held on an under-construction road in a residential area, were discussed. The Home Minister assured us that permission would be granted if we seek it through the proper channels and hold the protest at a suitable venue. We have thus decided to call the protest off by 5 p.m. on Thursday,” NCP leader Naseem Siddiqui said.

The original protesters, however, said they have been increasingly upset with the attempts to hijack the narrative by political players who joined in only after the protest gathered steam.

“We gathered here on our own on the first night and have been here since then. The so-called convening committee only got involved later and it has caused us nothing but inconvenience. Earlier this week, too, some among them tried to get the protest called off. We will stay true to our core objective and will keep protesting,” said one of the women who has been at the site since the beginning of the protest.

Activist Firoze Mithiborwala, one of the core orgainsers, confirmed the sentiment, saying, “We have had meetings among ourselves and the protest will not be called off. The women of Mumbai started this and they will continue it.”

Mr. Siddiqui said attempts will be made to reason with the protesters till Thursday. “If they stay adamant after 5 p.m. on Thursday, whatever happens thereafter will be neither with our support nor with our participation.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/x9s6nl/article30738223.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMMUMBAIBAGH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/protest-to-be-called-off-says-ncp-leader-women-refuse-to-budge/article30738224.ece
360,2020/02/05,BMC proposes mini medical colleges at peripheral hospitals,"In an attempt to strengthen the secondary healthcare facilities in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to develop six peripheral hospitals as smaller medical colleges and thus equip them for specialised care. It was announced in Tuesday’s civic budget that Diplomate of National Board (DNB) courses will be started in three hospitals each in the eastern and westerns suburbs.

Increase in footfall

The BMC has a three-tier health system: dispensaries at the primary level, peripheral hospitals at the second level and major hospitals attached to medical colleges at the tertiary level. With the increasing footfall of patients in the tertiary hospitals, strengthening the primary and secondary healthcare facilities has become crucial. “The peripheral hospitals are being converted to postgraduate centres for College Of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS)/Fellowship of CPS and DNB courses,” the budget document said.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said starting the courses and fellowships will convert the peripheral hospitals into “mini medical colleges”. “We are yet to finalise the six hospitals. Population growth in specific areas will be looked at before we finalise the hospitals,” he said.

The civic body also plans to build new peripheral hospitals to cater to areas that have seen a massive population growth. One of the areas that is under consideration for the new hospital is Chandivali. Mr. Kakani said only 60% of the health budget for 2019-20 was spent in the current financial year and he plans to take it to 90% in the next year.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/t9yaap/article30738203.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/5bmhealthcarerevcol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/bmc-proposes-mini-medical-colleges-at-peripheral-hospitals/article30738204.ece
361,2020/02/05,MMRDA terminates contracts for Metro Line 2B over delays,"The recent decision of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) to terminate the contract of Simplex Infrastructures for Metro Line 7 over project delays has put the future of another Metro corridor in jeopardy — Metro 2B which is being built from DN Nagar in Andheri to Mandale in Mankhurd.

The MMRDA has now terminated the Metro 2B contract of Simplex Infrastructure, which started work in November 2018 on a 12-km-long viaduct from DN Nagar to Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), and 11 stations.

The authority has also served termination notices to M/s RCC-MBZ, which was executing the section of the corridor between BKC MTNL and Chembur, and the car depot for the corridor at Mandale.

“MMRDA is extremely serious about completing projects on time and hence is not going to spare any contracting agency to delay the project. We gave [a] long rope to these agencies and after following all procedures we have terminated their contracts,” R.A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said.

MMRDA terminated the Metro 7 contract citing delays and has encashed bank guarantee of nearly ₹35 crore. Sources said it is working out the modalities to terminate the contracts for Metro 2B and encash the bank guarantee of around ₹100 crore.

Senior officials, on condition of anonymity, said work on both sections had come to a halt over the last four to five months and the contractors had been issued several notices and letters about the slow pace of work and non-payment of dues. Simplex had completed only around 5% of the work, while RCC-MBZ had completed around 4% of the viaduct and 6% of the carshed work since 2018.

The corridor is expected to be commissioned by 2022. “In terms of meeting the deadline, there should be no issue if we get a good contractor. Work between Chembur and Mankhurd is running on time,” an official said.

The MMRDA has floated tenders for the balance work of Metro 7, which it aims to open by December 2020. In the scope of work, the tender states the “part design and construction of balance works of four elevated stations of package 1, Line 7”. The four Metro stations are Andheri Metro (East), Shankarwadi, JVLR station and Mahanand, and the work includes the viaducts.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/6qmdm3/article30738183.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05BMMETRO2B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mmrda-terminates-contracts-for-metro-line-2b-over-delays/article30738184.ece

The Shiv Sena has ruled BMC for decades and the party now wants to push for its ambitious projects that required impetus from State government. The BMC’s tourism department will be headed by senior officers who will take the help of external experts and accredited travel agents. The BMC wants to start eco-tourism activities around water supply reservoirs such as Tansa, Vaitarna, Modak Sagar dam. It may involve hospitality partners to upgrade and maintain civic guest houses there and organise cycling tours, nature trails, bird watching, and star gazing among other things.

The department will take up documenting heritage and history of Mumbai streets, historical structures, organise tours, and will hold music shows, community activities, festivals in open spaces. It also set aside ₹183 crore for improvement works of Mahim, Bandra, Sion, and Worli forts.

Taking forward Mr. Aaditya Thackeray’s meeting related to Mithi rejuvenation project and the need to expedite work on Dahisar, Poisar, Oshiwara rivers, the storm water department has been allocated ₹912 crore.

The creation of urban forest by means of Miyawaki technique also finds mention in the garden department budget which has been allocated ₹254 crore.

Mayor Kishori Pednekar has called the budget as “one that takes Mumbai on the path of development”.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/shiv-sena-stamp-on-33441-crore-bmc-budget/article30738115.ece
363,2020/02/05,"Funds fillip for most departments, but BEST aid slashed","In its budget for 2020-21, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has doled out minor to moderate hikes in allocation for most of its departments. However, aid to the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking was slashed from ₹1,900 crore to ₹1,500 crore.

The BMC has set aside ₹14,637 crore for capital expenditure and aims to boost the city’s infrastructure. It will be investing on building roads, bridges, and storm water drains, and increasing the quality of solid waste management, healthcare and education.

Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said in his budget speech that the average commute speed in Mumbai will be increased from 20 kmph to 40 kmph by decongesting roads, bolstering public transport, and increasing the area under roads from less than 10% to over 20%.

The road department has got ₹2,279 crore to take up improvement work of 289 km of roads. An additional ₹50 crore has been set aside for improving footpaths. New roads such as the coastal road and Goregaon-Mulund link road will also be constructed. Since the stay on the coastal road project has been lifted, the civic body has increased its allocation from ₹1,600 crore to ₹2,000 crore. The BMC has set apart ₹48 crore to build missing links between Mahim-Sion link road and KM Marg, and Ahilya Bai Holkar Marg and Lotus Colony Road.

In a new announcement, quality groups selected through global competition will oversee maintenance of roads within the guarantee period. The contractor will be paid only after these groups give their approval. Last year, the BMC had approached expert consultants from Japan to study the issue of flooding during monsoon. This year, ₹5 crore has been earmarked to construct underground silos and tunnels to store and carry floodwater.

The BMC has allocated ₹503 crore for the proposed 440 mld Gargai dam and ₹1,728 crore for laying new pipelines, repairing reservoirs and constructing underground tunnels. A total of ₹231 crore has been allotted to build another 600-metric tonne waste-to-energy plant in Deonar.

Meanwhile, the BMC has reduced its aid to BEST and urged it to increase its own revenue through reduction of operation costs, better management of leased properties and recovery of funds.

The ₹1,500-crore allocation will be used on strict terms for repayment of loans and procurement of new buses on wet lease.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/o0lu42/article30738080.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/6BMCOASTALROAD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/funds-fillip-for-most-departments-but-best-aid-slashed/article30738081.ece
364,2020/02/05,"New isolation facility, advanced lab to be set up in Kasturba Hospital","To counter the threat of novel coronavirus (nCoV) and emergence of new infectious pathogens, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to build a new state-of-the-art isolation facility and an advanced laboratory at Kasturba Hospital in Chinchpokli.

The civic body made an initial allocation of ₹2 crore in its Budget on Tuesday. The BMC plans to increase the allocation to spruce up the isolation facility over two years.

Kasturba Hospital is a dedicated infectious diseases hospital with a 28-bed isolation facility, which was set up during the H1N1 outbreak in 2009. The facility is a simple ward with open ventilation and lacks an air handling unit, a negative pressure room with air conditioning, high-efficiency particulate air filters, and ultraviolet lights.

Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “One of the wards in the hospital is in a dilapidated condition. We plan to demolish it and construct a ground-plus-three-storey structure.” The BMC has allocated ₹7 crore to construct the new building, which will have 145 beds and negative pressure rooms.

He said, “The rooms will also have televisions and internet connection as patients who are quarantined often feel alone and restless.” The BMC is in talks with experts from the Central government and the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune.

In 2007, the hospital had set up a polymerase chain reaction laboratory, which is equipped to test H1N1 and acute febrile illnesses such as leptospirosis, dengue and malaria. Before the lab was set up, samples had to be sent to NIV or a laboratory in Port Blair. The

BMC now plans to equip the laboratory with a testing facility for nCoV. “The initial budget of ₹2 crore will cover some of the equipment required to upgrade the laboratory,” said Mr. Kakani.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/new-isolation-facility-advanced-lab-to-be-set-up-in-kasturba-hospital/article30738029.ece
365,2020/02/05,BMC bucks the trend,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday unveiled its budget for 2020-21 with a total outlay of ₹33,441 crore, a 8.95% increase from last year.

In an unusual move, which BMC sources said was the first of its kind, Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi thanked Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray while presenting his first budget in the standing committee. He said, “For the first time, a Mumbai-born, Shri Uddhavji Thackeray, is the honourable CM. This is a great opportunity to transform Mumbai into a happy city.” A large part of the speech was focused on improving happiness indicators such as speedy commute, pure water, and quality education and healthcare services. The Chief Minister had highlighted the same priorities in a BMC meeting as part of his Mumbai 2030 plan.

Though revenue receipts have dwindled (₹14,828 crore up to December 2019), the BMC has estimated higher revenue receipts (₹28,448 crore) for the next year. Based on these anticipated receipts, it has raised the allocation for capital expenditure from ₹11,480 crore to ₹14,637 crore to fund big-ticket projects. Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “We will focus on recovering pending property tax, an increase of at least ₹1,500 crore. The second source of revenue is development premium by way of compounding. A large number of properties have enclosed non-paid floor space index (FSI) which can be regularised by paying an additional amount.”

Mr. Pardeshi was referring to a BMC policy where, as per the Development Control Rules, conditional additional FSI/fungible FSI will be granted for regularisation of flower beds, decks, and lofts. The BMC will levy a compounding fees of 15% of the ready reckoner value on unauthorised use of FSI. It is hoping to raise ₹600 crore through this step.

Mr. Pardeshi said the third major source of revenue would be unused municipal properties. He said, “Even though lease rates are frozen, if there is change of use, we will charge extra, or gain from the redevelopment of such properties. Besides, vacant land tenancies can become regular lessees by paying the necessary charges. For breach of existing lease, we have increased the rates. They will also have to pay an additional FSI for regularisation. This will help old tenants living in dilapidated structures as the builder will have to pay lease premium, penalty premium and fungible FSI. The tenants will be shielded.”

Like last year, the civic body will draw ₹4,380.77 crore from its fixed deposits. In total, ₹52,635 crore in fixed deposits are tied to development projects and the remaining ₹22,000 crore to commitments such as the employees’ provident fund. The civic body had drawn ₹5,708 crore from its fixed deposits last year. The BMC plans to reduce revenue expenditure from ₹19,205 crore to ₹18,797 crore.

Feeling the pinch

Since municipal charges have not been increased in the past 10-15 years, a 5% hike in fees has been imposed on several services, such as issuance of trade licence, market licence and birth certificate, to keep up with the rate of inflation. However, the burden on general tax has not been increased. As part of property tax reforms, instead of water taxes and sewerage taxes, garbage, sewage and water fees will be collected.

In another first, the Municipal Commissioner has allotted ₹300 crore for wards so that they can take up development work without approaching the headquarters for funds. Development work such as improvement of footpaths, gardens, street signs, and public toilets will be carried out with the help of technical experts.

The budget also focused on acquiring reserved amenity plots as marked in the development plan by giving transferable development rights (TDR) or following the accommodation reservation policy. In case the plot is encroached upon, it will be acquired by way of TDR only as paying from the BMC’s coffers is unviable.

Meanwhile, in a blow to aspirants for government jobs, the civic body has put on hold recruitment to fill vacant posts till revenues show an upward trend. The civic body will hire apprentices for a period of six months to one year, but will not give them a permanent job. So far, the BMC has paid 50% of arrears as per the 7th Pay Commission and will disburse the remaining amount in three instalments.

367,2020/02/05,Auto Expo: 5 cars to watch out for,"Next-gen Hyundai Creta

The most important model from Hyundai will be the second-gen Creta, which will make its début at the Expo on February 6, 2020. Hyundai, however, will only showcase the exterior design of the new Creta, with the interiors and other details set to be revealed closer to its launch around mid-March 2020. Official design sketches confirm the second-gen Creta will retain most design cues seen on the new ix25 revealed in China, but it will get a few styling tweaks that will make it more appealing to Indian customers. In terms of powertrains, the all-new Creta will borrow its engine and gearbox options from the hugely popular Kia Seltos, and could also get the Seltos GT Line’s 1.4-litre turbo-petrol engine.

Tata H2X micro-SUV

Tata will have a total of 12 passenger vehicles at its Expo stand, with the production-spec H2X micro-SUV being one of the most important displays. The production H2X SUV (codenamed Hornbill) will slot in below the Nexon compact SUV. In terms of size, it will be around the same length as the Maruti Suzuki Swift, and nearly as tall as the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza. The second model to be built on Tata’s new ALFA platform, the Hornbill will get a 1.2-litre, naturally-aspirated petrol engine and no option of a diesel.

Maruti Futuro-e concept

A big attraction at Maruti’s pavilion will be the Futuro-e SUV-coupé concept. Billed as a design study, the Maruti concept previews a mid-size SUV from the brand that’ll rival the Hyundai Creta and Kia Seltos. Teasers reveal a coupé-like sloping roofline, along with a high bonnet and a bold, wide face to give it that tough SUV look.

The company is likely to ready a petrol engine for the production-spec model but one that could accommodate an electric powertrain. Maruti could also look at bringing back its 1.5-litre diesel with the production version of the Futuro-e, as most mid-size SUVs will continue to offer the option of a diesel engine even after April 2020.

Kia QYI compact SUV

In addition to launching the Carnival MPV, Kia will also reveal a compact SUV concept at the Auto Expo. The compact SUV (codenamed QYI) is likely to be launched by August 2020. In the build-up to the Expo, Kia released the first sketches of the compact SUV, which made it clear that the design and styling will be a far cry from that of the Hyundai Venue.

Details of the Kia QYI compact SUV are scarce at this point, but what we do know is that it will share its underpinnings with the Venue. Engine and gearbox options are expected to be identical too; so there will be petrol and diesel options, and the choice between a manual and dual-clutch automatic gearbox.

Expect prices to be in the range of ₹7-11.5 lakh.

Skoda Vision IN concept

The big draw at Skoda’s stand will be a concept that previews its much-awaited mid-size SUV. The Skoda Vision IN echoes the design of the Kamiq sold abroad, with styling bits such as the trademark Skoda grille — illuminated in the concept — split headlamps and crystal-like LED tail-lights. What’s different is that it sports a bolder, more upright nose, plenty of plastic cladding all around, prominent roof rails, and large 19-inch alloy wheels befitting a concept. Measuring 4,256mm in length, the concept has a 2,671mm-long wheelbase, and previews the first model based on the India-specific MQB A0 IN platform. The concept is powered by a 150hp, 1.5-litre TSI petrol motor, and a 1.0-litre TSI option is also expected on the production model. There will be no diesel engine on offer, but a CNG variant could be on the cards. The production-spec Vision IN will be launched sometime between April-June 2021. Also present at the Expo will be its sister model from Volkswagen, the Taigun.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/1960j3/article30741825.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bgmHyundaiCreta2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/5-cars-to-watch-out-for/article30741830.ece
368,2020/02/05,Volvo ups its game,"Volvo’s baby SUV arrived in India back in 2018 as a diesel-only model. This, however, changed late last year when Volvo launched the T4 petrol variant with a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine. The T4, which has arrived in a single, fully-loaded R-Design trim, effectively replaces the previously available diesel variants. Now, the diesel left us very impressed when we last drove it, so just how good is this petrol model?

To start with, the only difference between the petrol and diesel XC40 SUV is the badging — T4 as against the diesel’s D4. The front is typical Volvo, featuring the famous ‘Thor’s hammer’ design for the LED headlights and a gloss-black grille. Over to the side, you get the same 18-inch alloy wheels and a blacked-out roof that looks very cool. At the rear, the boomerang-like tail-lights are unmistakeably Volvo.

Inside, the cabin design is like all new Volvos — the design, build and overall feel exude premiumness, and you do get your money’s worth. The dashboard is dominated by soft-touch materials, subtle piano-black accents around the vents, and the nice-looking vertical touchscreen. Speaking of which, the 9.0-inch touchscreen is similar to the one we have seen before. It is responsive, high on functionality, and despite being the one-stop location for most of the controls, it is user-friendly too.

The steering and the fully-digital instrument cluster see no revisions, but the seats are now all black, as opposed to the bright orange theme that you could opt for with the older car. The seats themselves are superb, though — you get premium leather upholstery, electric adjustability, memory function for the driver side, and they offer excellent support in just the right areas. Unlike the older SUV, you no longer get a seat-heating function, which is a downer for those in the north.

The rear seat is not the best in its class, but you do get enough room here. The backrest is a tad too upright and the low-set seats mean that taller passengers tend to sit knees-up. Practicality is good, with plenty of storage throughout the cabin and a big 460-litre boot.

Coming to the equipment list, the XC40 R-Design gets tech and features seen on cars two segments above. The list includes radar-based safety assists like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, a collision mitigation system, six airbags, ABS with EBD, brake-assist, hill ascent and descent controls, and a lot more. You also get wireless charging, a tyre pressure monitoring system, front and rear parking sensors, and a reverse camera.

Powering the XC40 T4 is a BS-VI-compliant, 2.0-litre, turbo-petrol engine that makes 190hp and 300Nm of torque. On start-up, refinement levels are excellent; step on the accelerator, though, and you get a thrum that is boomy past the 3,000rpm mark and almost coarse near the redline. Progress, however, isn’t as swift, and the power delivery is linear throughout the rev range. The turbo kicks in around the 2,500rpm mark, which gets you a slight surge, but not exciting enough. You do get drive modes like Eco, Comfort, Dynamic and Off-road, but even in its most responsive, Dynamic setting, there is no punch from the engine. A lot of that has to do with the 8-speed automatic gearbox, which just isn’t responsive enough. Shifts are smooth, but slow.

The XC40, in its T4 iteration, is now also a front-wheel-drive vehicle; and while that has helped save some weight, it feels neither light, nor agile.

Handling is like you would expect in an SUV; and it isn’t a particularly enjoyable car to drive on a winding road. That said, body-roll is well-contained, the grip from the Pirelli P Zero tyres is good, and the steering is consistent and fluid. Also, the brakes are quite sharp, but progressive, and offer a strong bite. In terms of ride comfort, the XC40 impresses with its high-speed stability, but the ride does get a little bumpy at low speeds over broken patches of roads. The cabin is well-insulated, though, and you don’t feel too many of the jolts on the inside.

Priced at ₹39.9 lakh, the XC40 T4 is one of the more expensive SUVs in its segment. However, available only in one, fully-loaded R-Design guise, you do get a lot of car for the money. The design turns heads, the cabin is practical and it’s got the lengthiest features list.

Then there is the petrol engine which, despite not being the best in terms of refinement, has enough grunt to get you around. Yes, the backseat isn’t impressive and the aftersales experience is not as widespread as its German rivals, but it is a small price to pay in exchange for a well-sorted SUV that gives you almost everything you would want.

So, if you are in the market for a compact luxury SUV with a petrol engine, the XC40 T4 is an option worth serious consideration.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/xhi4a2/article30741552.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05bgmVolvoXC40petrol1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/volvo-ups-its-game/article30741558.ece
369,2020/02/05,Auto expo 2020: Renault unveils Triber Easy-R AMT,"Renault on Wednesday unveiled Triber Easy-R AMT, which will be launched in the first half of this year.

The new Triber comes fitted with the 'Energy' engine – a 1.0-liter petrol engine, offering a great balance between performance and fuel economy, with low total cost of maintenance.

“Looking at evolving customer preferences, the AMT technology is becoming a popular choice across segments and we are happy to build on our portfolio with the Renault TRIBER EASY-R AMT. We will continue our pursuit of growth in 2020, led by a strong product plan and a strategic and collaborative approach with all our partners,"" Venkatram Mamillapalle, Country CEO & Managing Director, Renault India Operations said.

Triber — outcome of a joint project between Renault teams in India and France, was specifically designed keeping in mind opportunities for innovative products in the Indian market.

With more than 28,000 TRIBERs already sold in India, Renault has commenced the exports of TRIBER to South Africa and the SAARC region, Mr. Mamillapalle added. He further stated that with the EASY-R AMT option, Renault will take forward the key USPs of TRIBER being a flexible, attractive & affordable offering.

""Renault TRIBER… gave us the opportunity to be present in the largest and the fastest growing segment of the Indian automobile market. It is very motivating to see the outstanding response from customers and today we will take another step forward in the TRIBER journey with the reveal of the Renault TRIBER EASY-R AMT,” Mr. Mamillapalle said.

The launch of Renault TRIBER together with the new Renault DUSTER and Renault KWID has ensured that Renault is progressing despite the challenging macro-economic environment in India, he said. In 2019, Renault sales grew 7.9% to 88,869 units.

Renault has also expanded its network reach to more than 370 sales and 450 service touchpoints, that include 257 service workshops and 215 locations covered through Workshop On Wheels.

With a developing product portfolio, increasing network and clear strategic direction, Renault is taking concerted efforts to grow the brand in India, which is an important market for the Group’s global expansion plans, the company said.",motoring,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/w6m28l/article30740002.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Triber-Easy-R-AMT,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/motoring/renault-unveils-triber-easy-r-amt/article30740001.ece
370,2020/02/05,Udaipur to host the World Music Festival this weekend,"Here, in this City of Lakes, where the morning sun colours marble pillars pink, men in colourful turbans gossip by old stone jetties and flocks of pigeons wheel over latticed parapets, musicians from Europe, Asia and Africa will descend for the fifth edition of the Vedanta Udaipur World Music Festival, conceptualised and produced by SeHeR.

The festival that began as a two-venue, two-day event, now spills over to three days and three venues — Manji ka Ghat, Fateh Sagar Paal and Gandhi Ground — with We Are The World: Unity in Diversity as the theme.

Sanjeev Bhargava, festival director and founder-director SeHeR (an imaginative initiative in the sphere of the performing and fine arts), first conceived the idea when he visited a festival in Fez, Morocco. Bhargava has been at the helm of festivals — Ananya, Bhakti Utsav and Delhi Jazz Festival, among others — since the 2000s. A student of Pandit Vinay Chandra Maudgalya who trained him in Hindustani vocal, Bhargava prefers to introduce a mix of old names and up-and-coming artistes to audiences, beyond the confines of closed spaces — concerts have been held at venues like Nehru Park and Purana Qila, Delhi. Five years ago, the Rajasthan Government supported his idea to design a thematic festival beyond the capital Jaipur, and Bhargava chose Udaipur for the inherent beauty of its Mewari architecture and its lakeside venues.

In a telephone interview, he says that he opens the festival to the public free of cost because “why should someone unable to pay not enjoy it? This is an extension of my passion for the Arts. My idea is to democratise culture.”

Bhargava says that the focus of the festival is to bring together two unlikely musicians, two different sounds and meld them. “I have introduced sarangi players to Brazilian musicians, who have then created their own unique style.” In this pursuit, Bhargava has brought together another unusual line-up this year. “I travel to smaller towns and villages to listen to the real sounds of a region. Sometimes, that’s where the purest form of music comes from. The musicians we’ve invited are not only cultural ambassadors of their genres but also custodians of a rare kind of music.”

At a glance Date: February 7-9

Musicians: Over 150 global artistes from 13 countries

Details: udaipurworld musicfestival.com

The festival will open with a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary, and feature among others “19-year-old Dalit singer Ginni Mahi from Punjab, whose music is a revelation; Habib Koite who plays West African blues and who I first heard in Senegal in 2010. It has taken me a decade to bring him here. He is a superstar in his country; music from Kurdistan and Karelian music from Russia are other rare finds.”

“I listen to their songs over and over again, have a long chat with the musicians and help choose their repertoire. But I don’t curb their creativity. This year, every one of them will address ‘unity in diversity’.”

With a footfall of nearly 50,000, the city’s lovely mix of the rural and urban, and pleasant weather this time of the year, Bhargava promises to have something for everybody at the festival. “If it is literature for Jaipur, it has to be world music in Udaipur.”",travel,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/7a9xak/article30742199.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/06mpudaipur1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/travel/udaipur-hosts-the-world-music-festival-this-weekend/article30742206.ece
371,2020/02/05,Not running a parallel government says Puducherry Lt Governor Kiran Bedi,"Denying charges of running a parallel government in the Union Territory, Lt Governor Kiran Bedi on Wednesday said she was a public servant bound to act as per law.

Taking questions from the media during a book release function at Raj Nivas, the Lt Governor said “I am not a full fledged Governor. I don’t have any immunity and any wrongdoing can invite punishment. My responsibilities on financial matters are much higher.” On her relationship with the elected government, she said “differences are bound to exist as each reads the rules (Union Territories Act and Business Rules) as it suits them.”

The case questioning the powers of the Lt Governor is pending in the High Court, she said adding “Let the independent agency decide on the issue. The final decision will be made by the apex court.”

Ms. Bedi said she was bound to refer matters on which the Lt Governor and Cabinet differed to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry in certain cases had concurred with the stand of the Cabinet and in others, with the Lt Governor, she added. Asked whether she had delegated more financial powers to the Ministers and Secretaries as directed by MHA, the Lt Governor said it has been done with riders for certain subjects such as authority to sanction funds for grant-in aid.

Earlier addressing the media after the release function, Ms. Bedi said “I am not permanent here or not to compete but only serve as per law and with objective to make UT better. It is one of best UTs. There is no ego involved in it.”

Ms Bedi launched a booklet, Tracking the News, a compilation of selected articles that appeared in newspapers about the UT on different issues, including the power struggle between her and the Cabinet.

372,2020/02/05,"State-run Bharathi Mill declares lay-off, sparks concern among workers","Even as the Narayanasamy-headed Congress government is making a move to prevent the closure of the century-old Anglo French Textiles (AFT) mills, the Industries Department has announced a six-month lay-off in another old textile mill -- Sri Bharathi -- causing concern among its 200 workers.

According to an official, “The move had been contemplated for quite some time since the accumulated loss of the mill had touched ₹123.12 crore. A techno-economic study of Bharathi Mills conducted by the South India Textile Research Association (SITRA), Coimbatore, had concluded that the mill is beyond any kind of financial revival.” The machinery in the mill is old and has to be replaced completely. The buildings are more than 100 years old and therefore, to house the new machinery,e new buildings have to be constructed by demolishing the old ones, the official said.

Trade Unions termed the lay-off move as a prelude to closing the mill on the lines of the AFT mill. A. Selvakumar, president of Bharathi Mill Workers Union said that Swadeshi and Bharathi mills, which once had a combined workforce of 4,500 workers had now a meagre 200 workers on their rolls.

“The mill has stopped functioning since March 2019 and no constructive steps were taken by the government to restart the mill. Even now, the workers have not been apprised of the move by the management while the trade unions got to know of the development only through a communication from the Labour Department. Workers are now caught in the crossfire between Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bediand and Chief MinisterV. Narayanasamy over the decision to close down the mill,” he said.

The Inspector of Factories has already made it clear that the mill cannot be run in its present condition as most of the machinery has become obsolete. The Inspector of Factories under Section 40 (2) of the Factories Act prohibited the use of the shop floor buildings, including the blow room, carding section, drawing section, simplex machine area, ring frame machine area, cone winding area, dye house, boiler house, yarn godown etc. as the buildings are in conditions that pose imminent danger to human life and safety.

The management has failed to disburse the salary for the last 13 months to the workers, while provident fund, gratuity and other benefits have remained suspended since 2013.

373,2020/02/05,Deficiencies found in Government Hospital,"The Public Estimates Committee has found glaring deficiencies in the functioning of Indira Gandhi Government General Hospital and Postgraduate Institute.

The committee during an inspection on Tuesday found the hospital lacking in specialist doctors, bed capacity, medicines and new machineries.

The Chairman of the committee, A. Anbalagan, told reporters that the hospital functioned without cardiovascular surgeons. Cardiac surgeries are performed by outsourced doctors from Chennai.

Lack of availability of specialist doctors puts patients who have undergone various procedures in difficulty. The government should appoint cardiovascular surgeons, he said. The hospital also functioned without adequate beds. Patients are compelled to sleep on the floor and sometimes two patients are made to lie on a bed for IV procedures, he said.

In the absence of MRI machine, patients are either sent to private labs or the Government Medical College.

Some patients have also complained about non-availability of essential medicines, he added.

The surgery equipment were found to be old and doctors have admitted on the need to replace the machinery for patients’ safety, he said.

Lack of ventilators

The hospital also lacked adequate ventilators. When the requirement for ventilators was around 30, the hospital has only 13 life supporting machinery. There was also urgent need to fill Group-D posts in the hospital, he said.

Other legislators who were part of the inspection team was DMK legislators R. Siva, Geetha Anandan and Congress member T.

The events held after a gap of 33 years saw participation of 32 colleges. Lt Governor Kiran Bedi inaugurated the fest at the Uppalam Sports Ground.

Complimenting Minister for Power R. Kamalakannan, who also holds the Education portfolio for re-launching the programme, Ms. Bedi said education was incomplete without sports.

Appealing to the Minister to declare Swami Vivekananda’s birthday as sports day, Ms. Bedi stressed on the need to organise sports events in schools and colleges annually. Prior to the annual programme, Ms. Bedi said the government should direct all schools and colleges to hold sports events.

She also directed Education Secretary A. Anbarassu to document and circulate sports policy to all educational institutions. “If you continue the sporting event annually, we will have a versatile, healthier and happier youth. There can be no youth without sports,” Ms. Bedi said. Mr. Kamalakannan in his address said the government was keen on promoting sporting activity among school and college students so that they become healthier citizens.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/oysop/article30737927.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH05PONDYSPORTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/four-day-college-sports-and-cultural-fest-begins/article30737928.ece
375,2020/02/05,Sri Aurobindo Society holds science meet,"Sri Aurobindo Society recently held a four-day experiential science learning workshop on ‘Gamification of science through role-plays’ as part of taking education to a higher level through innovative science teaching.

The project was supported by the National Council for Science & Technology Communication, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India in collaboration with the Department of Education, government of Puducherry.

Chairperson, NCTE, Satbir Bedi, noted that school education was targeting higher marks and higher education as a package.

Instead of this, teachers and parents should focus on happiness quotient of education rather on the marks quotient of education.

She interacted with some students in the gathering and asked them about their ambitions.

She said the role of teachers is to help students achieve their ambitions in life.

A workshop for science teachers was led by Anshumala Gupta and a team of subject experts from Joy of Learning Foundation, New Delhi. About 45 teachers from various schools of Puducherry are attending this programme.

The workshop aimed to cover the hotspots in science vis-a-vis learning and covering subjects like physics, chemistry and life sciences through innovative role-plays and fun experiments. The basic idea is to convey tough scientific concepts through games and other interesting activities arousing the curiosity of children.

Dinakar, State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha, Department of School Education, observed that the participants are a mix of experienced and new teachers, which would bring in considerable change in creating an eco-system for a more experiential and transformative learning process.

Vijay Poddar, Member Executive, Sri Aurobindo Society, in his address expressed the hope that the group of teachers would act as a core team to take science to the whole of Pondicherry.

He also said that this training programme should be a two-way route, the resource person to train the teachers and the teachers to share their own ideas with the resource persons.

Life skills

Rudra Goud, Director of School Education, said it is the responsibility of teachers to instil life skills, culture and values in children along with the regular syllabus.

Teachers should be trained in such a way that they have to identify the psychological needs of each and every child and act accordingly.

“Teaching science is interesting as well as challenging. Teachers should find out techniques to engage children to make them learn science at ease as well as internalise the fact that science should teach integrity and team spirit as well,” he said.

Only proper understanding of concepts and proper communication will help teachers to reach students easily. Ancient traditional knowledge system based on empirical observation was developed so much but we have lost the connect with the knowledge system and one of the challenges was to connect the students again with such system, he said.

The leak was detected in the morning on a joint in the cast iron pipe, the Kerala Water Authority (KWA) said.

Pumping from the 72-mld plant at Aruvikkara was halted from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday to enable repairs.

The Syndicate, which met here on Tuesday, approved the recommendation of a subcommittee to debar the faculty member from preparing question papers for five years. The BTech examination of the subject ‘Switching Theory and Logic Design’ that was held on January 1 was cancelled after it was found to bear similarities with a series examination conducted in the College of Engineering, Thiruvananthapuram. The teacher will also be required to bear the expenses for conducting the re-examination.

Relenting to the pressure exerted by the student community, the university has also decided to conduct a re-examination for those who “could not” appear for a final-year examination on December 17 on account of a Statewide hartal observed in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). Numerous students had wilfully chosen to boycott the examinations in solidarity with the cause.

378,2020/02/05,LIC employees stage walkout strike against stake sale,"The employees of the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) in the city on Tuesday observed a one-hour walkout strike in protest against the Central government’s decision to divest a part of its stake in the LIC.

The protest was part of a nationwide movement by various LIC employees’ unions.

At 12 noon, employees walked out of the buildings at the LIC office in Pattom, raising slogans against the stake sale that they alleged was a precursor to complete privatisation. The protests are being organised by a joint committee of most of the trade unions.

Planning Board member K.N. Harilal, who inaugurated the protest meeting, said the freedom the country gained after long years of struggle was being sold by the government.

Broad-based struggle

“This is not an issue that concerns just the employees of the LIC. Nor is it something that concerns the customers who have reposed their trust in the institution. Financial institutions such as the LIC are the biggest sources of strength of the government, which enables it to implement the wishes of the public. By privatising these, the public loses control over how this money has to be spent. The LIC is an institution that has pride of place in the country, owing to its consistent performance. There should be a broad-based struggle involving large sections of the population to resist this move,” he said. A. Sampath, Special Representative at Kerala House in New Delhi, said that India’s financial independence was being protected by such institutions. “It is easy for them to dismantle these institutions because none of their sweat, tears, or blood were spilled in winning our freedom or in building these institutions,” he said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/lic-employees-stage-walkout-strike-against-stake-sale/article30737929.ece

380,2020/02/05,A unique forest in the making,"The development of the State’s largest forest cover under compensatory afforestation is nearing completion on the premises of the Sainik School at Kazhakuttam.

The forest area, spread over 51 acres, has been developed by planting 38 indigenous tree species to compensate for nearly 4,700 trees cut down for the development of the National Highway 66 bypass stretch from Kazhakuttam to Mukkola in 2016.

The land will be handed over to the school in May, following which the school will take over the responsibility of nurturing the plants.

NHAI funds

The seedlings were planted using funds sanctioned by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI).

Developed by the Social Forestry wing of the Forest Department, the forest is home to diverse fruit-bearing, medicinal and timber species

They include ‘lakshmi tharu’ (paradise tree), ‘kambakam’ (Hopea parviflora), mango, neem, almond, Malabar tamarind, tamarind, rosewood, red sanders, ‘mandaram’ (dwarf white bauhinia), jamun, Ashoka, ‘kanikkonna’ (cassia fistula), gooseberry, mahagony and ‘kumbil’ (white teak).

The area will be cleared of acacia trees before being handed over to the school.

Head of Forest Force P.K. Kesavan, who led an inspection of the area, said another 35 hectares of land was being afforested to compensate for the 15,540 trees felled for the development of the Vizhinjam international seaport project.

A total of 1,250 seedlings had been planted across 12 hectares in the particular area in 2018.

The officer said that the compensatory afforestation drive was being led by the Conservators of Forests of the Social Forestry wing in the northern (Kozhikode), central (Ernakulam) and southern (Kollam) regions. The endeavour would be intensified in close coordination with various departments.

10 seedlings

Under the prescribed guidelines, each tree that is felled will have to be compensated by planting 10 seedlings by the department concerned.

The concept of compensatory afforestation has often remained on paper.

The paucity of vacant space has largely hindered its realisation.

The Forest Department has launched steps to assess the enforcement of the law.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/a-unique-forest-in-the-making/article30737921.ece
381,2020/02/05,Vanishing forests,"The State capital, which has been witnessing a spurt in infrastructure development, has found itself at crossroads. Going by the findings presented in the India State of Forest Report 2019, the district has seen a slight fall in its forest cover over the past two years. Presenting a development conundrum, the study throws up questions on the existing growth pattern and renews the debate on the need for a course correction.

While the forest cover of the district was 60.62% of the geographical area during the previous assessment in 2017, it has now fallen to 59.57%. Interestingly, while the area categorised as ‘very dense forest’ (tree canopy density of over 70%) remain intact at 57 sq.km., the ‘moderately dense forest’ (tree canopy density between 40-70%) and ‘open forest’ (tree canopy density between 10-40%) have shrunk during the period.

While the State government pressed ahead with improving the road network and realising many of its flagship infrastructure projects, several apartments and commercial establishments have come up in the city and its suburbs. Fearing the unforeseen consequences this unbridled building spree can throw up, environmentalists have called for steps to arrest the decline in the forest cover.

Spare a thought

“While aspiring to become industry-friendly, the State must also spare a thought for ecology. Hills are being razed down and trees felled indiscriminately for major infrastructure projects in various parts of the district. Besides, we appear to have surrendered to a consumerist culture wherein we have been witnessing an urge for an extravagant lifestyle, which has spurred numerous commercial establishments. Such factors have had an adverse impact on the environment,” laments Veena M., coordinator of Tree Walk, a tree lovers’ forum.

In recent times, the State capital witnessed much protests over the felling of around 5,000 trees for the development of the Kazhakuttam-Mukkola stretch of NH-66 bypass and the Vizhinjam international seaport. However, as part of compensatory afforestation programmes, seedlings numbering around 10 times the number of trees cut were planted on the premises of the Sainik School, Kazhakuttam.

Afforestation

Official sources point out while the practice of ‘compensating’ for the trees felled has been institutionalised by agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India, the system is seldom enforced by State-run departments and agencies. “Despite guidelines being laid down to replace trees that have been removed for various works with equivalent or more number of seedlings, such norms are rarely adhered to. Numerous trees are cut down for infrastructure projects undertaken by the Public Works Department and the Local Self-Government Department,” a source said.

Thanal Trust director Sridhar Radhakrishnan, a former member of the Tree Monitoring Committee under the Social Forestry wing of the Forest Department, is critical of the ‘outdated’ development pattern followed by government departments. “We need engineers who are capable of understanding the emerging climate and ecological issues. Sadly, most bureaucrats aspire to maintain status quo and hesitate to pursue uncharted techniques. We are in dire need of an environment-friendly growth pattern that strives for climate-resilient road and infrastructure development,” he said.

He called for greater emphasis on shade trees, which should be considered an essential infrastructure and made an integral component in road development. He also advocated wider use of the Miyawaki method of afforestation, considering the paucity of vacant spaces in the region.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/ou27pm/article30737917.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/deforestki05,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/vanishing-forests/article30737919.ece

Under the ₹64.13-crore comprehensive rejuvenation project of the lake to be funded by the Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB), the lake and the feeder canals from Kannammoola will be cleaned. Kerala Tourism has entrusted WAPCOS Limited, a mini ratna Public Sector Enterprise under the Union Ministry of Water Resources, with the work.

Blueprint

The blueprint for the work that use environmental-friendly methods and latest technology had been worked out by the Transitional Research and Professional Leadership Centre of the Government Barton Hill Engineering College here.

The priority was for making the lake clean and removing waterweed, Minister for Tourism Kadakampally Surendran said.

A small hillock formed by the accumulation of the dredged silt in the lake would be converted into a green island and natural water purification measures would be set up. The sandbars beneath the bridge would be removed and the lake dredged to enable the safe movement of boats.

Canals to be cleaned

The mouth of the Ulloor, Pattom, Pazhavangady and Medical College canals that led to the lake would be cleaned and the remaining stretches of these four canals would be cleaned under the Thiruvananthapuram Smart City project, the Tourism Minister said.

385,2020/02/05,AFC Cup | Bengaluru FC starts favourite,"Indian Super League champion Bengaluru FC will start as favourites when it takes on Paro FC of Bhutan in a preliminary round match of the AFC Cup here on Wednesday.

Bengaluru FC has been a regular feature in the AFC Cup knockout rounds between 2015 and 2018 and, having missed out of the continent’s second tier club competition last year, it is eyeing a return with a bang.

The first leg of the preliminary round 2 will be played at the Changlimithang Stadium. The second leg will be played on February 12 in Bengaluru.

The winner of this two-legged tie will be clubbed with reigning I-League champion Chennai City in Group E of the main round.

Carles Cuadrat’s side is going into Wednesday’s match after four wins from five games in the ISL and the 2016 edition runners-up side has come here early to acclimatise to the conditions, especially as the match is playing on an artificial turf.

“The weather is quite different here from what it’s like back in Bangalore. We’ve come in early to acclimatize,” captain Sunil Chhetri said ahead of the match.

“We’re very happy to be back in Asia. We didn’t play the AFC Cup last year, and that wasn’t very nice. We’ve represented India in four of the last five years and we’re happy to be able to do that again,” he added.

Cuadrat said his team has been preparing well and is ready for the match. “We love to play in this competition. The AFC Cup allows me to register 30 players and I believe we have players with good talent coming in from the youth teams. It will be nice for them to play a game like this.”

“I said to Sunil that now would be a good time for you to get some rest and he said ‘Mister, forget about rest. I want to go to Bhutan’ So yeah, that’s why he’s here,” the head coach added.

The home side, the Bhutan Premier League champions, will have a familiar face in Chencho Gyeltshen, who earlier played for Bengaluru FC.

Chencho, also called the Bhutanese Ronaldo, was part of Cuadrat’s Bengaluru FC side during ISL 2018-19 and played a role in the team winning the title last season.

Having worked closely with the nippy forward, Cuadrat and most of the Bengaluru team are well-aware of the considerable threat that the 23-year-old poses.

“Chencho is a great person and a great footballer. I’m happy to see him again. We’ve been in touch. He’s a great player for sure, but I hope that he won’t be at his best on Wednesday,” Cuadrat said.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/article14127514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/29isbs-chhetri_+29ISBS_SUNIL_CHHETR.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/afc-cup-bengaluru-fc-starts-favourite/article30737387.ece
386,2020/02/05,PSG move 15 points clear with tight Nantes win,"Paris Saint-Germain further strengthened their dominance of Ligue 1 on Tuesday with a 2-1 win at Nantes that moved the champions 15 points clear of the domestic rivals.

Goals in either half from Mauro Icardi and Thilo Kehrer were just about enough for Thomas Tuchel's side to stretch their lead over second-placed Marseille ahead of their trip to Saint-Etienne on Wednesday.

PSG extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to 20 matches despite a Presnel Kimpembe howler allowing Moses Simon to race through and pull one back in the 68th minute, setting up a nervy finish.

The capital club were dominant for long periods despite the absence of Neymar with a rib complaint, and it was Kylian Mbappe, starting following his touchline spat with Tuchel at the weekend, who created the opener.

World Cup winner Mbappe burst down the left flank before pulling back perfectly for Angel Di Maria, whose shot brushed fellow Argentine Icardi before nestling in the back of the net.

The three points looked to be sealed 11 minutes after the break when Kehrer headed home Di Maria's corner.

However, Kimpembe let Nantes back into the game 11 minutes later when his fluffed attempt at a flicked pass to centre-back partner Kehrer gave Simon his chance.

PSG had a series of good opportunities to go back two goals ahead, with Mbappe twice denied by fine last-ditch defending, but they failed to capitalise and had to thank Keylor Navas for twice saving the result in the final minutes.

First, he got out well to stop Simon as the Nigerian bore down on goal and in stoppage time got down brilliantly to push away Renaud Emond's close-range flick.

Earlier, Rennes missed the chance to go second after Loic Remy's early goal consigned them to a 1-0 defeat at Champions League-chasing Lille.

Remy struck in the fourth minute for the hosts when he collected Jonathan Ikone's pass before lashing home a long-range effort to move his fourth-placed side up to 37 points, three behind Rennes.

The away side remain a further three points away from Marseille, who would have been temporarily overtaken by Rennes had they won by two goals or more.

Monaco meanwhile won their first league match of 2020 1-0 over Angers thanks to Stevan Jovetic, who guided in Youssouf Fofana's long pass with his head to move Robert Moreno's side ninth, level on 32 points with four other teams.

The victory ends a four-match winless run in the league for Monaco that was made worse by last week's French Cup exit at the hands of Saint-Etienne last week.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/no2n8a/article30739245.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/05THPARISSAINT-GERMAIN,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/psg-move-15-points-clear-with-tight-nantes-win/article30739250.ece
387,2020/02/05,Liverpool youngsters reach FA Cup fifth round,"Liverpool's youngest ever team proved coach Jurgen Klopp was right to rest his stars as they reached the FA Cup fifth round with a 1-0 win against third-tier Shrewsbury on Tuesday.

Klopp and his entire first team were all absent for the fourth round replay at Anfield as part of the club's winter break.

The Liverpool manager was criticised for disrespecting the FA Cup, but his youngsters proved up to the task and their mature display was rewarded when Ro-Shaun Williams headed the decisive own goal in the closing stages.

Liverpool will face Chelsea in the last 16 at Stamford Bridge on March 5 as they remain on course for a potential treble of the Premier League, Champions League and FA Cup.

Klopp had turned over the responsibility of leading Liverpool to the club's under-23 coach Neil Critchley, who also took charge when the Reds played an under-strength side for their League Cup quarter-final defeat at Aston Villa earlier this season.

On that occasion, Klopp had a better excuse for his absence as Liverpool were in Qatar on course to win the Club World Cup.

This time, it was purely his decision to ignore the FA Cup, but resting Mohamed Salah, Virgil Van Dijk and company at least gave fans a glimpse of the next generation.

With an average age of 19 years and 102 days, it was Liverpool's youngest ever starting line-up in all competitions.

There were seven teenagers, including 16-year-old Harvey Elliott, while Pedro Chirivella was the oldest player in the team at 22.

Liverpool-born teenager Curtis Jones became the club's youngest captain at 19 years and five days.

There were first senior starts for 20-year-old defender Adam Lewis, 18-year-old midfielder Leighton Clarkson, midfielder Jake Cain, 18, and Liam Millar, a 20-year-old forward.

Liverpool had blown a two-goal lead in that original meeting, but several of these youngsters had helped stun Everton in the third round and once again they showcased their potential.

Despite dominating possession, Liverpool almost fell behind in the 58th minute when Shaun Whalley headed home, only to see VAR disallow the goal for offside against one of his team-mates in the build-up.

Liverpool made the most of that escape to win it in the 75th minute.

Neco Williams' long pass looked harmless but Ro-Shaun Williams tried to head back to O'Leary and, with the Shrewsbury keeper way off his line, the ball looped over him into the empty net.

388,2020/02/05,Police heave a sigh of relief,"The police heaved a sigh of relief on Wednesday as the Big Temple ‘kumbhabishekam’ passed off peacefully.

They had received alerts from intelligence agencies that anti-national could foment trouble in the wake of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests during the event. They had directed the police to be alert and step up vigil. Precautionary measures such as bringing history-sheeted persons under surveillance were adopted. Some of them were detained under the Goondas Act. People were asked to inform the police about movement of strangers, if any, in their locality and not to allow unknown persons to witness consecration from their rooftops.

The town was brought under security blanket for nearly a week where the town was divided into 15 zones and police patrolling was implemented. As the D-day approached, motorbike patrolling was introduced to bring even small streets under surveillance and police outposts were set up at more than dozen places to check movement of trouble mongers. State-level senior police officials visited and inspected the security arrangements in the town.

A people’s right group attempted to disturb peace by pasting posters demanding performance of the consecration in Tamil. The security was tightened on Tuesday night as intelligence reports trickled indicating that some groups that have extended support to the demand for conducting the ‘kumbhabishekam’ in Tamil had planned to enter the temple as devotees and stake their claim to perform the consecration in Tamil on Wednesday morning. Outstation devotees who preferred an overnight stay at the temple were evicted and the entire complex was scanned.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/police-heave-a-sigh-of-relief/article30745115.ece

390,2020/02/05,Cancer survivors felicitated,"Cancer survivors were felicitated during the World Cancer Day function organised by the Indian Medical Association - Tiruchi in association with Dr. G. Viswanathan Group of Hospitals here on Wednesday.

K. Govindaraj, Director, GVN Hospitals, said Tiruchi has improved a lot in cancer care and treatment. Mammobus, a mobile mammogram vehicle, launched by Dr. K. Santha Breast Cancer Foundation to screen women, especially in rural and inaccessible areas, has so far conducted over 17,000 mammograms and reached at least 50,000 women. Doctors aboard the bus organise awareness programmes.

He said he would wish to call them ‘cancer conquerers,’ not ‘cancer survivors,’ as they not only survived the condition but also came out stronger. ‘There are patients we have operated upon who did not even know that they had cancer, as the word itself has a stigma attached to it,’ he said. Around 10 ‘cancer conquerers’ were felicitated at the event.

K.N.Srinivasan, radiation oncologist, urged women, especially those over the age of 40 to conduct home screenings and learn to identify potential risks. ‘Early screening gives more time for diagnosis and treatment.

M. S. Ashraf, former national vice-president of IMA said institutions such as IMA in association with hospitals in the city must do their part to remove the stigma attached to cancer and ensure that individuals get themselves tested regularly.

Sivarasu has said.

The stretch forms part of bypass road that will run from Thuvakudi via Mathur and Panchapur and make a semi-ring connecting the highway branching out from Tiruchi to Thanjavur, Pudukottai, Madurai and Karur.

While construction of a bypass road between Thuvakudi and Panchapur was taken up by NHAI as part of widening and development of Tiruchi-Karaikudi NH 210, the section between Panchapur and Thindukarai was taken up as part of development of Tiruchi-Karur NH.

Work abandoned

However, the concessionaire of the Tiruchi-Karaikudi development project abandoned the work after completing about 75% of the work due to financial constraints. NHAI awarded a fresh contract paving the way for the resumption of the work on Thuvakudi-Panchapur stretch last year. The pending work on the stretch is being executed at a total cost of about ₹122 crore.

The road stretch running for a length of 12.70 km would include construction of a road over-bridge, a major bridge, six minor bridges, 12 box culverts and 10 pipe culverts. The stretch will be completed initially and thrown open for traffic, Mr.Sivarasu told reporters on Tuesday. The Mathur-Panchapur section would be completed within six to eight months after obtaining clearance from the Railways for the construction of a road overbridge.

Other section

Mr.Sivarasu said land acquisition for the other section of bypass road between Panchapur and Thindukarai on Tiruchi-Karur Highway will be completed in about six months and the stretch is expected to be laid within 18 months from the date of commencement of work. The work on this stretch was abandoned midway a few years back after farmers objected to the road being laid across irrigation tanks.

396,2020/02/05,Road overbridge on Fort Station Road to be widened,"The Tiruchi Corporation, which plans to widen approach roads of Road Over Bridge on Fort Station Road along with the Southern Railway, has submitted a preliminary report to the Southern Railway and the State government explaining important components of the scheme.

The road serves as one of the important links between Thillai Nagar and Woraiyur with the West Boulevard Road and College Road. Though the ROB continues to serve the public for several decades, the civic body and the railways decided to redo the project due to its narrowness. Since the onus of reconstructing the ROB is with the Southern Railway, corporation officials have initiated communication with the office of the Divisional Railway Manager a few years ago. The project has taken a concrete shape with the corporation joining hands with the Southern Railway to execute it.

“Since the project is to be executed by the Tiruchi Corporation and the Railways, we have shared the project details with the Southern Railways officials. We are working on the modalities for executing the project,” S. Sivasubramanian, Commissioner, Tiruchi Corporation, Tiruchi, said. The Railway would take care of construction of the bridge portion across the railway tracks, approach roads would be laid by by the Corporation.

According to a preliminary assessment, the project might cost about ₹50 crore. It was most likely to be executed on cost sharing basis between the Corporation and the Railways.

He said modalities of sharing the project cost would be known shortly. The preliminary report had been sent to the Commissionerate of Municipal Administration for taking the project to the next phase. The Detailed Project Report would be prepared soon.

The corporation understood the importance of time bound completion of the project as the road was an arterial one in the city. There would be a plan in place to minimise inconvenience to motorists during construction of the bridge.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/plan-to-widen-road-overbridge-on-fort-station-road/article30744069.ece

398,2020/02/05,"Discrimination against Tamil continues in conduct of rituals, says Maniarasan","The Thanjai Periya Koil Urimai Meetpu Kuzhu has alleged discrimination against Tamil in the conduct of consecration of the Big Temple in Thanjavur despite the High Court directive.

In a petition addressed to the Commissioner, Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment Department, coordinator of the committee, P .Maniarasan said that after hearing arguments over the writ petitions filed by him and others seeking a direction that the consecration of Big Temple should be performed in Tamil only, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court ordered that importance be given to both Tamil and Sanskrit citing affidavits filed by the respondents that equal importance was being given to both languages in the rituals and practices of Big Temple and the same would be followed in the consecration ceremony also.

However, during the consecration rituals, which commenced on February 1 in the temple, Tamil Othuvars and persons with Sanskrit knowledge were not allowed to enter the place where the divine images were kept at the kundam and vedigai in a separate enclosure at the yaga salai.

They were allowed to sit in front of that enclosure and recite the Thirumuraigal and Sanskrit slokas, respectively.

But at the same time, Sanskrit language was only used by the persons who were performing ceremonies inside the enclosure, which was a clear violation of the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench’s order, Mr. Maniarasan said.

Though this disparity was brought to the notice of the Joint Commissioner, HR and CE and the Assistant Commissioner, Thanjai Palace Devasthanam, on February 3 afternoon itself, curative action was not taken up by them leading to apprehension that Tamil would be avoided at the karuvarai, yaga salai and at gopura kalasam during the consecration to be held on February 5.

Hence, the committee requested the HR and CE Commissioner to intervene and ensure that the Saiva Samaya Aravor performed the rituals on par with Sanskrit at the yaga salai kundam, vedigai, Peruvudaiyar karuvarai, artha mandapam, maha mandapam, gopura kalasam as per the order of the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench order.

Response

Meanwhile, when asked for a response to the allegation from the committee, the organisers of the consecration claimed that the ceremonies and rituals at the yaga salai and in other parts of the temple were being carried out as per the affidavit filed by them before the Madras High Court, Madurai Bench.

Further, the organisers pointed out that court had dismissed the petitions moved by the Kuzhu and others after getting convinced that the arrangements made at the Big Temple for the conduct of the kumbabhishekam giving due prominence to the Tamil language as per the agama principles and as done earlier.

It had also observed that the Sanskrit language was not given any special status, particularly by ignoring the Tamil language, they added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/discrimination-against-tamil-continues-in-conduct-of-rituals-says-maniarasan/article30738367.ece

A meeting was organised at Homi Bhabha Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (HBCHRC) at Aganampudi here on the occasion of World Cancer Day on Tuesday.

They said it was unfortunate that despite the advances in treatment procedures and improvement in survival rates, new cases were increasing due to late detection.

404,2020/02/05,"Expert: balanced diet, regular exercise key to prevent cancer","Lack of awareness among women, especially those living in slums and rural areas, is responsible for detection of breast and cervical cancer at a late stage and is resulting in cancer deaths. How does one reach out to these women, who do not discuss such matters except with close confidantes?

The Hindu Future India Club and Omega Hospitals joined hands to create awareness among Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers, who act as a liaison to spread health awareness among these women, on the occasion of World Cancer Day, at Suryabaugh here on Tuesday.

The large hall was packed to full capacity as enthusiastic participants turned up in large numbers and listened in rapt attention as B. Ravi Shankar, medical oncologist and MD of Omega Hospitals, spoke on various aspects of breast and cervical cancer, the causes, the risk factors and preventive measures.

About 70% of cancers could be attributed to causes like smoking, irregular and improper diet, genetic and viral infections. Breast cancer symptoms include: swelling in breast, upper chest or arm pit, changes in size or shape of the breast, nipple discharge, rash or crusting, changes in colour or skin texture of breast.

Dr. Ravi Shankar explained that women, who do not maintain proper hygiene of their private parts, run a greater risk of getting cervical cancer. The other causes include: unsafe sex, promiscuity and bearing more number of children.

The symptoms of cervical cancer include: bleeding in post menopausal women, vaginal discharge, bleeding after sexual intercourse, inter-menstrual bleeding and prolonged bleeding. When these indications were seen, women should undergo a simple pap smear test. A vaccine to prevent cervical cancer was available and this would give 60 to 70 % protection.

He called upon ASHA workers to consider factors like age, family history, smoking, underweight or overweight and create awareness among women accordingly. They should impress upon the women on the need to have a balanced diet with inclusion of a good amount of green leafy vegetables and fruits in their diet, maintaining a healthy weight, regular exercise for at least 30 minutes a day, protection from sun and avoiding alcohol.

Replying to queries from the participants, Dr. Ravi Shankar said that the HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine should be taken after a girl attains maturity and again before marriage. To another question, he said that pancreatic cancer was difficult to diagnose early and the symptoms would be known through indications like jaundice, stomach pain and changes in bowel movements.

“We (AP Hospitals Association) have represented to Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy on the need to include HPV vaccination under Arogyasri for the benefit of poor and middle income groups and we expect a positive response on the issue,” he told another participant.

V. Pradeep, surgical oncologist, and Assistant Project Director Nagamani also spoke.

405,2020/02/05,Budget thrust is on achieving digital economy: Maple CEO,"Maple Software CEO and former AP chairman of CII G.S. Shiv Kumar on Tuesday said the Union Budget-2020 had laid emphasis on encouraging digital economy, MSMEs and strengthening of startup ecosystem.

Taking part in a session on post-budget analysis organised by the CII with technical partnership from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), he said as part of achieving digital economy, new technologies like Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, data analytics and quantum computing were being encouraged in the budget proposals.

He welcomed the initiative on abolition of Dividend Distribution Tax (DDT) and encouraging exports and indigenous production saying these measures would pave the way for making India a $5trillion economy. This would elevate the country from sixth to fourth largest economy in the world in the next few years. He said the decision to introduce new income tax regime would lead scope for more disposable money for many. He said this would also help the MSME employees who form a large chunk of workforce.

PwC Directors Ashish Nahar and Rajitha Boorugu respectively spoke on changes announced respectively in direct and indirect taxes.

406,2020/02/05,EC imposes 24-hour ban on BJP MP Parvesh Verma,"The Election Commission on Wednesday barred BJP MP Parvesh Sahib Singh from campaigning for the Delhi Assembly elections for 24 hours for making “vitriolic” statements against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. It issued a warning to Mr. Kejriwal for a separate Model Code of Conduct violation.

The West Delhi MP had earlier been barred for 96 hours starting 5 p.m. on January 30 for making statements about the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh that were found to be objectionable and in violation of the code by the EC.

In its Wednesday order, the EC said Mr. Singh’s statement to a TV channel referring to Mr. Kejriwal as a “terrorist” was a violation of the MCC. This was a repeat violation by the BJP leader, the EC said, while barring him from campaigning for 24 hours starting 6 p.m. on Wednesday. Campaigning for Saturday’s Delhi polls ends at 6 p.m. on Thursday.

Warning to Kejriwal

Meanwhile, the EC warned Mr. Kejriwal for his statement while addressing lawyers on January 13 where he promised to build mohalla clinics at court complexes if the land was provided. In response to the EC’s notice, Mr. Kejriwal’s lawyer submitted that the Chief Minister had attended the event organised by the Delhi Bar Association at Tis Hazari Court in his personal capacity, not officially.

The EC, however, said it found the statement to be made in his official capacity, and therefore a violation of the MCC. The “level playing field was disturbed,” the Commission said, adding that it condemned the statement. The EC said it “warns him to be more careful and exercise caution in future while making public utterances.”",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/dxn5jr/article30725702.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAIRAPARVESHPTI1312020000118A,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/ec-imposes-24-hour-ban-on-bjp-mp-parvesh-verma/article30744701.ece
407,2020/02/05,"Delhi Assembly election: BJP has no discourse, but desperate for a win, says Arvind Kejriwal","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on February 5 that he was seeking votes on the basis of kaam ki rajniti, or the politics of delivery, which had been demonstrated by his government.

A desperate BJP, he said, had been unable to find any shortcomings in the performance of his government in the areas of electricity, water, schools and education. It had, instead, started abusing him.

In an interview to The Hindu, Mr. Kejriwal said, “They are unable to find any shortcomings in our work. What they ferret out, it doesn’t stick…they want to divert attention from our work. Sometimes they bring Shaheen Bagh; sometimes they do Hindu-Muslim.”

The Chief Minister said his government’s honest intentions, or saaf niyat, set it apart from other governments in the country.

Edited excerpts from the interview:

Is this an election about AAP’s governance record versus the issues of identity and religion?

The work that has been done by AAP is extraordinary compared to what has happened in the last 70 years in the country. They [governments run by other political parties] ruined the services of electricity, water, schools and the hospitals. People had also lost all hope that a government can do anything. They [rival parties including the BJP] don’t have an answer to what we have done in the past five years. They are unable to find any shortcomings in our work. What they ferret out, it doesn’t stick. They don’t have any discourse. Now, they want to divert attention from our work. Sometimes they bring Shaheen Bagh; sometimes they do Hindu-Muslim.

You have been Delhi’s Chief Minister for five years now. If voted to power again, what is your vision for Delhi?

Our last five years has given hope to the entire nation — things can be done. If we have been able to fix government schools and hospitals, then it means they had been deliberately left in a poor shape. We had been kept poor and illiterate for the last 70 years. If all this could be done in five years, it could have been done in 70 years as well. This hope kindled in the country by AAP’s governance in the past five years, this is a big deal — actually, it’s a new kind of politics.

So, how were you able to accomplish this? Other governments have also tried to fix things.

Our niyat [intention] was saaf [honest]. The difference was only about intention. If you do something and the intention is to make money out of it, then you look at issues completely differently. And, if the intention is to do the job properly, then you look at it totally differently. Niyat is at the root of the difference. Since, our intentions were honest, we were able to accomplish so many things in the past five years. Electricity, water, education and health are the four success areas of my government.

You have been accused of giving freebies like waiving electricity bills or free rides to women on public buses in Delhi.

What is our fault? If I was giving things free and raising your taxes, [if] our budget was in the red, or [we] took loans to make things free, then it would be problematic. Our budget is positive. In other parts of the country, State government budgets are in the red. The Central budget, too, is in the red. Five years ago, that was the case in Delhi as well. We reduced taxes from 12% to 5%, we didn’t take any loans; what we did was to end corruption. That’s why we were able to save money. If I am using that money to give relief to the people, what’s the harm in it? What’s the problem?

When you say nothing was done in 70 years, you seem to exclude what Sheila Dikshit did in Delhi, which includes the metro.

She did improve infrastructure; brought buses and constructed the metro and flyovers. But all this was done at the time of the Commonwealth Games, in those two-three years. So, that was an extraordinary period.

The BJP has unleashed all its big guns against you — Prime Minister Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah, U.P. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Why do you think this is the case?

Nothing is working for them. First, Amit Shah collected all the parties against us. It’s for the first time that BJP, LJP, JD(U) and Akali Dal are all contesting the election together. That didn’t work. Then they brought 200 MPs. That too didn’t work. Then came 70 ministers and 10 Chief Ministers. That also didn’t work.

And, then they started their abuse. This shows that kaam ki rajniti [the politics of delivery] is very powerful. Electricity, water, schools, roads, nullahs, and streets — they have been unable to match this. Their entire politics is failing.

So, are you saying, you will be able to win this election on the basis of your performance?

I feel the people have made up their minds. People appreciate the work we have done.

At your public meetings, you raise the slogans of ‘Inquilab Zindabad’ and ‘Vande Mataram’ together. This is a new phenomenon in Indian politics. What is the message you are trying to convey?

Our party is the product of the [anti-corruption] Anna [Hazare] movement. This was a nationalist movement with wide acceptance — left, right and centre — all kinds of people were part of it. The country has to decide what is deshbhakti [patriotism]. Educating children is patriotism or dividing people in the name of Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Sikh, is patriotism? Is getting people medical treatment patriotism, or calling Kejriwal a terrorist, patriotism? Is making roads patriotism, or abusing Kejriwal, patriotism? Is providing electricity patriotism or saying ‘goli maro’ [shoot people], patriotism? The people will have to decide.

There are many people who say that it will be ‘Modi at the Centre’ and ‘Kejriwal in Delhi’. Does this show that Modi and Kejriwal have a common support base?

Everyone is part of our support base. I say I will teach your child. You tell me one person who will say ‘don’t educate my child’. I educate the Congress person’s child and the BJP person’s child. I teach a Hindu child and a Muslim child; everyone’s child. I get everyone access to treatment. This is real deshbhakti. From this, 21st century India will be created. Our country can become the most advanced in the world. Inside, I am convinced. Our people are so intelligent. The problem is that the systems in our country are bad. Our politics is bad. These need to be fixed. When I say these systems need to be changed, they say I am anarchist.

The country stands divided on the CAA-NRC. How do you see the politics around it playing out?

I have said again and again that 21st century India cannot be achieved through CAA and NRC. Such an India can be achieved when we have industry, shops will be opened, when people get jobs, where India moves ahead in science and technology, when we do research, only then will 21st century India become reality.

Your mohalla health clinics have found appreciation. In a possible second term, will you fix the Delhi-government run hospitals?

Our 35 hospitals have improved. Overcrowding is a problem, and we will fix this. Many new hospitals are in the pipeline. They will start in the next three-four years.

You came up with the odd-even scheme to check air pollution in the capital. But we still have terrible air quality. What is the plan to fix this?

We will do vacuum cleaning to curb dust pollution, improve transport facilities by bringing in new buses. We hope this will reduce two-wheeler use. We also need to know the real time sources of pollution. Without this, as an administrator, I can’t act. We are setting up a full lab from April 1, where I will come to know what is the real time cause of pollution at this time. Then we can close down this activity.

You got into some major conflicts with the Lieutenant Governor and the Centre over how Delhi should be run. After five years in power, do you think Delhi will ever get full Statehood?

I think the time has come to give Delhi full Statehood. The Centre should realise this and, in the larger interest, Delhi should be made a full State.

You supported downsizing the State of Jammu & Kashmir into a Union Territory. The Opposition Congress suggests this is a double standard when you seek full Statehood for Delhi.

I don’t think so. We thought this was in the country’s interest and took a decision [to support it].

Do you see the Congress as a contender in the current elections?

The surveys coming in suggest that the Congress is settling for two-three per cent of the vote share [in the 2015 Assembly polls, the Congress got 9.8% of the popular vote].

You have completed, against pretty formidable odds, a full term in office. How do you feel about it?

There’s no doubt that tackling those obstacles was extremely difficult. I hope that in the next five years, the Central and Delhi government will be able to work together. It’s made me more experienced and more patient.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/f30a28/article30650109.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH19ARVINDKEJRIWAL,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/bjp-has-no-discourse-but-desperate-for-a-win-kejriwal/article30743603.ece
408,2020/02/05,"Shaheen Bagh protests: Court seeks report from police on Brinda Karat’s plea for FIR against Thakur, Verma","A Delhi court on Wednesday directed the police to file action taken report (ATR) on a complaint by CPI (M) leader Brinda Karat seeking FIRs against Union minister Anurag Thakur and his BJP colleague and MP Parvesh Verma for their alleged hate speech in relation to anti-CAA protest at Shaheen Bagh.

Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Vishal Pahuja directed the police to file the report by February 11, the next date of hearing.

“Thakur and Verma had sought to incite people as a result of which three incidents of firing took place at two different protest sites in Delhi,” Ms. Karat told the court in here complaint.

“Let ATR be called from the DCP District New Delhi/DCP concerned,” the court said.

The complaint has sought lodging of FIRs under various sections, including 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), 153-B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national-integration) and 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the IPC.

It also sought action under other sections of the IPC, including 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation).

If convicted, the accused may get a maximum jail term for seven years.

Ms. Karat approached the court after her written complaints to the Commissioner of Police and the SHO, Parliament Street, failed to elicit any response, she told the court.

She had written to the Commissioner on January 29 and subsequently on 31, while the letter to the SHO Parliament Street was sent on February 2, she said.

At the Rithala rally here, the Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs had on January 27 urged the crowd to raise an incendiary slogan — “shoot the traitors” — after lashing out at anti-CAA protesters.

409,2020/02/05,Delhi polls: Kejriwal invites Amit Shah for public debate,"AAP supremo and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday invited Union Home Minister Amit Shah for a public debate on any issue, saying the people of the national capital wanted to know why should they vote for the BJP in the February 8 Assembly polls.

He also wondered why the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not clear the roads near Shaheen Bagh, where a public protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) is going on for nearly two months, and said the saffron party was doing “dirty politics” over the issue to grab power in Delhi.

The people of the national capital wanted to know what had the BJP done for Delhi in the last five years, Mr. Kejriwal said, seeking to know why the saffron party was opposing free schemes for Delhiites.

He said Mr. Shah was seeking people’s votes saying he will decide who will be the next chief minister of Delhi.

“How can the people of Delhi give you (Shah) a blank cheque? They are not fools,” the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convenor said.

“I want to invite Amit Shahji with an open mind and honesty for a debate on any issue before the people of Delhi to make democracy strong.... He can decide the time and place for the debate,” he said.

On Tuesday, Mr. Kejriwal had challenged the BJP to declare its chief ministerial face for Delhi by 1 pm on Wednesday and said he was ready for a public debate.

“I ask Amit Shah that if his party does not want to declare the name its chief ministerial candidate, he should at least tell the names of the likely candidates. Whether Smriti Irani, Manoj Tiwari, Vijay Goel, Hardeep Singh Puri are the likely chief ministerial candidates,” he told reporters on Wednesday.

“You (Shah) are telling people that the Centre has abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution and paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple. People have already voted you (BJP) to power for this (in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls),” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal added that the BJP had fielded 10 chief ministers of States ruled by the party and 70 Union ministers for campaigning for the upcoming polls to defeat a small person like him.

411,2020/02/05,WHO busts myths and fake messages on coronavirus,"Busting the myths and fake messages circulating on social media, the Public Health department of Maharashtra on Wednesday said consuming more garlic, curry leaves or cow’s urine would neither treat nor prevent one from the novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection.

The officials urged people to instead follow good hand hygiene, have coughing and sneezing etiquette and eat nutritious and well-cooked food.

“Messages claiming that garlic, curry leaves and cow’s urine can prevent or treat nCoV are being circulated in the name of doctors, medical institutions and the Health department. They are all false,” said Health Minister Rajesh Tope. “At present, there is no specific treatment for nCoV and patients are given only symptomatic treatment. While there is no reason to panic, people should not fall prey to such misleading messages,” he said.

Messages talking about superfoods and home remedies for prevention and treatment have no scientific basis, he said.

The World Health Organisation also took to social media to spread awareness and bust such misleading claims. On garlic, WHO said it is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial properties but there is no evidence that it has prevented people from contracting the 2019 nCoV.

On sesame oil, it said: “Sesame oil is delicious but it does not kill nCoV.” Some forwards have warned people against eating Chinese or preserved foods etc.

412,2020/02/05,Dr. Ravi Kannan: Facilitating equitable and accessible healthcare,"In December 2006, Dr. Ravi Kannan, a surgical oncologist, who had just left the Adyar Cancer Institute after 15 years of practice, got a call from Dr. Chinmoy Choudhury, then director and current chairperson of the governing body at the Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Silchar, Assam. He’d called to talk about a patient, but he also invited Dr. Kannan to head the centre. So Dr. Kannan and his wife, Seetha, went over for a weekend to explore the possibility.

“When we saw the conditions there, I knew I had received my calling,” he says, adding that it was Seetha who really took the decision, resigning from her job at the U.S. Consulate, “because she felt Silchar needed us more than Chennai. She volunteered at the community [and continues to] and we found help coming from various quarters to help us adapt,” he says. And so in 2007 began a journey of cancer treatment in Silchar. Here, the doctor, recently honoured with the Padma Shri, tells us more about his experiences.

What was the scenario when you reached Silchar?

For various reasons, mainly lifestyle, the maximum number of patients come from Assam. We did not have a roadmap to our problems, so we began fire-fighting as each issue cropped up, tackling it one at a time.

How did you fire-fight your way through?

Most of what I learnt comes from my mentors from school, medical college, post grad, and later the Institute, where we had been trained to deal with all issues, not just my area of specialization (head and neck). All those held me in good stead. I had no idea of administration, pharmacy, and so on, but we dealt it one day at a time.

What was the most important problem that you faced?

When I first came here, I followed the Institute policy: treat people for free, at low cost, or no cost. But, that didn’t seem to work. We tried out several options, but after several trials, meetings, and especially after a presentation at Kolkata, we began to look deeper into our problems trying to understand the why of it all. We found that out of every 100 patients who came into OPD, 58% never came for visit two, mainly because they worked for daily wages -- they were the sole bread-winners, with large families.

How did you addressthis?

We realised at that moment that if we did not pay attention to socio-economic dimensions, we could never deliver. Our treatment depended on solving the root of the crisis. We took two decisions: one, every patient would go back with a follow-up date and secondly, we began to provide ad-hoc jobs, like cleaning, cooking, gardening, which did not require skilled labour. Seeing the abject poverty that they lived in, we provided free accommodation and nutritious food too.

Did the situation improve drastically?

Not quite. When we did the audit, we found that 55% had completed prescribed treatment. But even as we began to feel cheerful, the situation sank in. Let me explain: Say in a city like Mumbai, when they say they are treating 50% of patients where they see 30,000 odd patients and most of them come from other states, they seek only diagnosis, or an opinion and usually go back to their home states for continuation of treatment. But, for me, in Silchar, I am the last stop, and so 55%, it is a failure.

What did you do to tackle this?

I heard Ms. Harmala Gupta in Delhi speak about home-care. Though we had been providing home-care facilities, it had not quite achieved momentum. Ms. Gupta was offering quality home-care for free and they were well-organised. That inspired us to adopt free home-care at Silchar too. We not only visited homes of patients who couldn’t come, but also those of patients who never came for a follow-up. So, that year, the medical compliance went to 70%. When we found that our patients had fear of treatment charges, we devised a plan: one-time payment of ₹500 that would include multiple visits for a life-time. This in turn reassured our patients. It was a confidence-building-measure that we aimed at, and it is that which defines us today.

Do you have separate slabs for those who can and those who can’t afford treatment?

If we were to hike up prices for the rich, then, instead of focussing on what the patient needs, we would then begin to focus on what the patient is capable of giving. The rich would slowly elbow out the poor. In order to avoid this, we decided to have uniformity that would facilitate equitable and accessible healthcare.

What does the award mean to you?

I think The recognition is not about me; it is about all my colleagues, the hospital, everyone who has helped us in big and small ways. If the recognition can help awareness of cancer in the region, where more people can access treatment, that will be great. From 23 members, we are a team of 350 members, each a hero in their own right, who own the hospital, making it what it is today.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/vjthah/article30741135.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Dr-Kannan,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/dr-ravi-kannan-facilitating-equitable-and-accessible-healthcare/article30741140.ece

Rani scored the goal in the 47th minute to give Indian the lead and eventually seal the match.

After winning its opening match of the tour against the hosts’ development squad, India had suffered two-back-to-back losses to New Zealand.

Ending the first half in a 0-0 stalemate, India made another PC attempt in the third quarter but could not make the opportunity count.

However, the team kept a good line of defence and continued to carry on an aggressive attack. It was not until the 47th minute when skipper Rani created space in the circle, netting a powerful shot past Britain’s goalkeeper.

“Towards the end of the match, we were under pressure but the team handled it well and even ensured a goal.

“The win is good for a morale boost ,” Marijne said.

“We now need to ensure fast recover in order to be ready for tomorrow’s match,” he added.
