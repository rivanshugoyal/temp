0,2020/01/17,Pranavi Urs wins Women’s Pro Golf Tour title,"Amateur Pranavi Urs made up for last week’s final hole disaster by winning the second leg of the Hero Women’s Pro Golf Tour at the Bombay Presidency Golf Club on Friday.

Pranavi carded one-over 71 for a total of five-over 215, while Ananya Datar shot 73 and lost by two shots.

Pranavi celebrated her win by turning professional. However, she got only a gift voucher this time, while Ananya, still winless on the Hero WPGT, got a cheque worth ₹1,50,000 and moved to the top of the Hero Order of Merit.

In-form Pranavi’s turning professional will make the competition more intense. Pranavi had a great start with three birdies in the first five holes, before she dropped a shot on sixth. On the back nine, she had some nervous moments as she bogeyed three times. Ananya, one of the three co-leaders overnight, was unable to capitalise on that.

Mistakes

On the back nine, as Pranavi made mistakes Ananya was unable to pull in birdies and played even par for the stretch with one birdie and one bogey. Pranavi dropped a shot on par-4 12th and another on par-4 14th but Ananya gave away a shot she had gained with a birdie on 13th by bogeying the 14th. At three behind, Ananya still had five holes to put pressure.

Pranavi dropped one more shot on par-5 16th and the gap was down to two. Over the last four holes, Ananya tried hard but could not hole any birdies as Pranavi won her second title on the Hero WPGT, while still being an amateur.

Earlier win

Pranavi’s earlier win on the Hero WPG Tour came in the ninth leg of the 2018 season. Tvesa began with a bogey but a birdie on fifth meant she was only two behind Pranavi till arriving at the eighth tee. She then dropped six bogeys against just one birdie in the last 11 holes and never had a chance to bid for the title.

However, back-to-back bogeys on eighth and ninth put her four behind Pranavi. At that stage Ananya, three-over for the front nine, was five shots back.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/pranavi-urs-wins-womens-pro-golf-tour-title/article30588737.ece
1,2020/01/17,"Viswanathan Anand wins Tata Steel Masters Chess Tournament, joins Magnus Carlsen and three others in sixth spot","Viswanathan Anand scored his first victory after producing a flawless performance to outwit USA’s Jeffery Xiong in 43 moves in the fifth round of Tata Steel Masters Chess Tournament on Thursday.

When the action resumed after a day’s rest, the only other winner was Alireza Firouzja who stunned Anish Giri to join Wesley So in the lead at 3.5 points. Anand, at 2.5 points, shares the sixth spot with Magnus Carlsen and three others.

Anand, facing Xiong’s French Defence, came out stronger in the rook-pawn ending after a series of exchanges. Anand’s well-placed central pawns and better-positioned rook proved decisive.

In Category ‘B’, overnight leader Surya Shekhar Ganguly drew with David Anton Guijarro in 40 moves. He was joined in the lead at 3.5 points by Pavel Eljanov, who defeated Anton Smirnov, and Erwin L’Ami, the conqueror of Dinara Saduakassova.

Nihal Sarin (2.5), the other Indian in the fray, however, lost his first game after running into Lucas van Foreest.

Fifth round results: Viswanathan Anand (2.5) bt Jeffery Xiong (USA, 2.5); Alireza Firouzja (FIDE, 3.5) bt Anish Giri (Ned, 2); Vladislav Kovalev (Blr, 1) drew with Wesley So (USA, 3.5); Fabiano Caruana (USA, 3) drew with Jordeen van Foreest (Ned, 3); Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 2.5) drew with Daniil Dubov (Rus, 2.5); Nikita Vitiugo (Rus, 2) drew with Yu Yangyi (Chn, 1.5); Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 2.5) drew with Vladislav Artemiev (Rus, 3).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/viswanathan-anand-wins-tata-steel-masters-chess-tournament-joins-magnus-carlsen-and-three-others-in-sixth-spot/article30587080.ece
2,2020/01/17,Carlsen sets a world record,"Magnus Carlsen set a world record of 111 unbeaten classical games after getting out of trouble against local Jorden van Foreest during their 45-move draw in the fourth round of Tata Steel Masters chess tournament here on Tuesday.

On a day when Viswanathan Anand drew with black pieces against China’s Yu Yangyi in 32 moves to reach 1.5 points, Carlsen’s record remained the talking point.

Carlsen, who last lost a game in July 2018 to Azerbaijan’s Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, broke the record of 110 games set by Russia’s Sergei Tiviakov in 2005.

Indeed, Carlsen’s performance came against a much higher quality of opposition that averaged over 2700 as compared to Tiviakov’s rivals, at 2476.

The record could have been Carlsen’s two games before but he declined to include two victories he posted in the recent Norwegian league by saying, “I’m all for it (the record), too. I consider my streak against elite opposition is 109 and against good opposition is 111 and I am happy about that.”

But after escaping some trouble against van Foreest and then drawing the game, Carlsen well and truly held another world record in his glittering career.

After four rounds, before Wednesday’s rest day, Wesley So led the field after beating overnight leader Alireza Firouzja in 47 moves.

In Group B, Surya Shekhar Ganguly defeated Dinara Saduakassova in 26 moves to lead with three points.

Compatriot Nihal Sarin (2.5 points), who also played black, recorded his first win after facing local Dutchman Max Warmerdam for 38 moves and shared the second spot with four others.

Fourth round results: Masters: Yu Yangyi (Chn, 1) drew with Viswanathan Anand (1.5); Wesley So (USA, 3) bt Alireza Firouzja (FIDE, 2.5); Jorden van Foreest (Ned, 2.5) drew with Magnus Carlsen (Nor, 2); Jeffery Xiong (USA, 2.5) drew with Fabiano Caruana (USA, 2.5); Daniil Dubov (Rus, 2) drew with Jan-Krzysztof Duda (Pol, 2); Anish Giri (Ned, 2) drew with Nikita Vitiugov (Rus, 1.5); Vladislav Artemiev (Rus, 2.5) bt Vladislav Kovalev (Blr, 0.5).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/kryoyp/article30578751.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17MAGNUS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/carlsen-sets-a-world-record/article30578752.ece

7,2020/01/17,Weekend Sport | Eight tennis storylines to keep an eye on in 2020,"Unprecedented bushfires have given the Australian Open a sobering backdrop. Practice schedules and qualifying matches have been affected by the smoke that has blanketed Melbourne. Once the skies clear, though, there is much to look forward to. Novak Djokovic and Naomi Osaka are the defending champions, but as Djokovic himself noted, there are no clear favourites. The season-opening Major can rarely be seen in isolation, however, for the tremors caused often extend deep. Here are eight plotlines that can define 2020:

Federer 20 vs. Nadal 19

Towards the end of 2016, when Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, battered and bruised, shut their seasons down ahead of time, the battle for the most Grand Slam titles was the last thing on their minds. Federer had fallen outside the top-10, Nadal was barely clinging on. Djokovic, at his peak, had clinched six of the 10 previous Majors to swell his tally to 12. During the same period, Federer (17) and Nadal (14) hadn’t won even one. In the off-season, when Federer joined Nadal for the opening of the latter’s academy in Mallorca, the two were said to have joked about their futures. Since then, the two have secured eight of the 12 Slams to set up a tantalising endgame to their storied rivalry. It is a race the protagonists attest to being least interested in. The fans, however, have different ideas.

Will the dominance of the Big Three continue?

Never before in tennis history have three men dominated an era the way Federer, Nadal and Djokovic have. The Big Three have won a whopping 51 of the last 59 Grand Slams, dating back to the 2005 French Open. Since the start of 2004, they have cornered two-thirds of all ATP Masters 1000s (96 of 144). In the last three years, there has been no let-up, with the trio sweeping all 12 Majors. It is, in fact, the second-longest Big Three streak, after the 18 in a row from the 2005 French Open to the 2009 Wimbledon. Stan Wawrinka was the last non-Big Three champion (2016 US Open). Will there be another this year?

Thiem, Zverev, Tsitsipas, Medvedev — the Next Gen race to break through first

The men’s tour is yet to witness a Major champion born in the 1990s, while the women’s welcomed one born in the 2000s ? Bianca Andreescu (2019 US Open). But the signs are that 2020 may well herald a Next Gen winner. Dominic Thiem is coming off a career-best season (five trophies, including three on hard-courts). The Austrian beat Federer to win Indian Wells, pinched a set off Nadal in the Roland Garros final and lost an ultra-tight title-decider to Stefanos Tsitsipas in the ATP Finals. It was Tsitsipas’ biggest triumph to date, but a ringing endorsement of his prodigious talent lay in the fact that he beat every Big Three member last season. Alexander Zverev has flattered to deceive since his 2018 Finals victory, but remains formidable. Daniil Medvedev, who came of age last fall, winning the Cincinnati and Shanghai Masters and finishing runner-up at the US Open, has the game to unsettle the best.

The Murray question

This time last year, a teary-eyed Andy Murray was preparing to play what he sensed could be his last match. His repaired hip had given way, and though he hadn’t officially called it quits, the overzealous media and the Australian Open retired him. Orchestrated tributes from even Federer and Nadal followed. Since then, however, Murray has had a second hip operation, finished rehab and won an ATP 250 tournament. The Brit even returned to the Davis Cup squad before pelvic trouble curtailed his involvement. He will not play the Australian Open, but his comeback from the brink, aided by his burning ambition, suggests his story isn’t over.

Serena’s quest for No. 24

Serena Williams has reached the final in four of the last six Slams. But she has lost all four, without so much as winning a set. It’s something the American has never experienced before; she lost just four of her first 25 Major finals. The underlying theme, ever since the 38-year-old returned to the sport after giving birth to her daughter, has been the quest for a record-equalling 24th crown. At Melbourne, the site of her last Slam victory in 2017, she seems primed for her best shot yet. In Auckland last week, she captured her first trophy after becoming a mother. It was crucial, for, after losing the Wimbledon final to Simona Halep, she had stressed on the need to somehow “win a final”. Now that she has, can she go all the way at a Major?

Will the WTA settle down?

Since Serena’s triumph at the 2017 Australian Open, the women’s game has seen seven first-time Slam winners. The perpetual flux has both admirers and critics. The many different winners, with an eclectic mix of playing styles, point to the field’s competitiveness, many claim. According to the other side, the absence of a clearly defined pecking order suggests decreased quality. But in 2019, the Tour showed signs of settling down, with two repeat champions in Naomi Osaka and Halep. Petra Kvitova and Garbine Muguruza, both former Major champions, have started well, while Ashleigh Barty, who clinched her maiden crown in Paris, is here to stay. Such is the depth that there is always the possibility of a first-time winner (read Karolina Pliskova). But 2020 could well be the year that novelty wears thin.

The brewing youth movement

Even as the jostling at the top of the women’s game continues unabated, a Next Gen is slowly taking shape, with players such as Andreescu, Amanda Anisimova, Coco Gauff and Sofia Kenin leading the way. Andreescu may have pulled out of Melbourne, but the manner of her victory in New York was stunning. Anisimova was the youngest player born in the 2000s to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam (French Open 2019). The 15-year-old Gauff’s irresistible run to the fourth round at Wimbledon, which included a victory in her first Major main-draw appearance over the legendary Venus Williams, was one of the season’s defining moments. Kenin was voted the WTA’s Most Improved Player in 2019, rising more than 40 places to peak at No. 12. She won three titles and famously defeated Serena at Roland Garros.

The Indian angle

As ever, the veteran doubles specialists are making headlines in an Olympic year: former No. 1 Sania Mirza has returned after a break following childbirth in rousing fashion at Hobart, even as Leander Paes prepares to bid adieu after close to three glittering decades at the top. Sania will partner Rohan Bopanna at the Australian Open, offering a sneak peek into what might follow at Tokyo 2020. In singles, both Prajnesh Gunneswaran, who played the main draw at all four Slams in 2019, and Sumit Nagal, who took a set off Federer at the US Open, haven’t qualified at Melbourne. For Prajnesh, who reached a career-high 75 last year, the upcoming months will be a test of his ability to grind his way back while Nagal will look to break into the top-100 soon.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/es9dgi/article30589365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/imaging-copy-3,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/weekend-sport-eight-tennis-storylines-to-keep-an-eye-on-in-2020/article30589366.ece
8,2020/01/17,Prajnesh Gunneswaran out of Australian Open qualifiers,"India’s top-ranked player Prajnesh Gunneswaran failed to make the main draw of the Australian Open men’s singles event after going down in straight sets to Ernests Gulbis of Latvia in the final round of the qualifiers here on Friday.

Gunneswaran, ranked 122nd in the world and seeded 17th in the qualifiers, lost 6-7 (2) 2-6 to Gulbis in his final round qualifying match.

Gunneswaran had earlier defeated local wildcard Harry Bourchier and Germany’s Yannick Hanfmann. It was a close first set which went into tie-break, where Gunneswaran faltered to hand early advantage to his opponent.

In the second set, Gulbis broke Gunneswaran in the first and third games to race to a 3-0 lead. From there on, the Indian found it tough as Gulbis held his serve to close out the contest that lasted for one hour and 20 minutes.

With Gunneswaran’s ouster, India’s campaign in the singles ended in the qualifiers. Earlier, Sumit Nagal suffered a straight-set loss to Mohamed Safwat of Egypt to crash out in the first round of the qualifiers on Thursday.

9,2020/01/17,Sania Mirza enters women’s doubles finals of Hobart International,"Indian tennis ace Sania Mirza extended her dream run on her return into the professional circuit after two years, as she made the doubles final with Nadiia Kichenok of Ukraine, beating Marie Bouzkova and Tamara Zidansek 7-6(3), 6-2 in the $275,000 WTA Women’s Tennis Tournament here on Friday.

In the final, Mirza and Kichenok, will play the second-seeded Chinese pair of Shuai Peng and Shuai Zhang who have got walkover in the quarterfinals and semifinals.

The Chinese benefited from Heather Watson’s injury in the quarterfinals, and it was the respiratory illness of Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium that put the duo in the final. In the $54,160 Challenger in Bangkok, Sriram Balaji and Jeevan Nedunchezhiyan were beaten 10-7 in the super tie-break of the semifinals by Sanchai Ratiwatana and Christopher Rungkat.

Zeel bows out

In the $15,000 ITF women’s tournament in Tunisia, Zeel Desai was beaten 7-6(1), 6-3 by the top seed Jodie Anna Burrage of Britain in the quarterfinals.

Prajnesh fails to advance

India’s top-ranked player Prajnesh Gunneswaran failed to make the main draw of the Australian Open men’s singles event after going down in straight sets to Ernests Gulbis of Latvia in the final round of the qualifiers here on Friday.

Prajnesh, ranked World No. 122 and seeded 17th in the qualifiers, lost 6-7(2), 2-6 to Gulbis in his final qualifying match.

10,2020/01/17,Andy Murray delays comeback as pelvic injury lingers,"Andy Murray on Thursday said he would have to further delay his comeback after failing to shake off a pelvic injury.

The 32-year-old former world number one, who hasn’t played since the Davis Cup Finals in Spain in November, had pencilled in a return at either Montpellier in France or the Dutch city of Rotterdam next month.

“I don’t want to rush anything or put a timeline on my recovery,” three-time major winner Murray was quoted as saying by British media.

“I’m going to listen to my body and step back on the court to compete when the time is right,” he said. “The bone bruising is taking longer to heal that first thought, so I won’t be playing in Montpellier or Rotterdam in February.”

The injury picked up at the Davis Cup had already forced him to miss the Australian Open which starts on Monday.

Murray, now ranked at 127 in the world, had hoped to make his return to Grand Slam action in Melbourne following a hip resurfacing operation last year.

But concerns over the fitness of the five-time losing Australian Open finalist were raised when he cancelled a scheduled block of training in Miami.

Melbourne Park was the scene of an emotional press conference 12 months ago where he suggested he might retire as a result of his hip injury.

Despite being less than fully fit Murray still played a gruelling five-set loss to Roberto Bautista Agut.

A fortnight later the double Olympic gold medallist, twice a Wimbledon champion and the winner of the 2012 U.S. Open, had hip resurfacing surgery.

He started his return to action at the Queen’s Club grass-court event in London in June where he teamed with Spain’s Feliciano Lopez to win the men’s doubles.

Victory over fellow three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka in the final of the ATP Tour event in Antwerp in October was Murray’s first singles title in two years.

However, he was injured during the Davis Cup and then watched from the sidelines as Britain went on to reach the semi-finals.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/kvoj4u/article29742393.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ANDYMURRAY,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/andy-murray-delays-comeback-as-pelvic-injury-lingers/article30582617.ece

13,2020/01/17,Downing of Ukraine airliner a bitter tragedy: Khamenei,"Iran’s Supreme Leader said on Friday that demonstrations at home over its accidental downing of a Ukrainian airliner were unrepresentative of the Iranian people and accused the country’s enemies of exploiting it for propaganda purposes.

Leading the main weekly Muslim prayers in Tehran for the first time since 2012, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the January 8 downing was a “bitter” tragedy but should not be allowed to overshadow the “sacrifice” of one of Iran’s most storied commanders, assassinated in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

‘Enemies were happy’

His sermon came after a traumatic month for Iran in which the country had appeared on the brink of war with the United States before mistakenly shooting down the Ukrainian jet with the loss of all 176 people on board. “The plane crash was a bitter accident, it burned through our heart,” Ayatollah Khamenei said in an address punctuated by cries of “Death to America” from the congregation. “But some tried to... portray it in a way to forget the great martyrdom and sacrifice” of Major General Qasem Soleimani, the assassinated head of the foreign operations arm of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards. Khamenei said Iran’s enemies had seized on the plane tragedy in a bid to undermine the Islamic republic.

“Our enemies were as happy about the plane crash as we were sad... happy that they found something to question the Guards, the armed forces, the system,” he said. The air disaster triggered scattered protests in Tehran and other cities, but they appeared smaller than a nationwide wave of demonstrations prompted by a fuel price hike in November. At least 300 people died in a crackdown by security forces after those demonstrations, according to Amnesty International.

On Friday, anti-riot police staged a massive deployment in Tehran, an AFP correspondent said. Ayatollah Khamenei said the protesters were unrepresentative of the Iranian people as a whole, who had turned out in their hundreds of thousands for Soleimani’s funeral. Praising the slain general, Ayatollah Khamenei said his actions beyond Iran’s borders were in the service of the “security” of the nation.

14,2020/01/17,Pakistan Islamists get 55 years in jail for protests,"A Pakistani court has sentenced 86 members of a radical Islamist party to 55-year prison terms each for taking part in violent rallies in 2018 over the acquittal of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case, a party official said on Friday. The verdicts, unusually harsh for Pakistan, were announced late on Thursday night by the court in Rawalpindi. The trial had lasted for over a year.

Pir Ejaz Ashrafi, a senior leader of the radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik party, said the sentences would be appealed. Among those sentenced was Ameer Hussain Rizvi, the brother of firebrand cleric Khadim Hussain Rizvi who heads the party. “Justice has not been done,” Ashrafi told . “We will challenge the verdicts.”

Asia Bibi case

The 86 were charged with damaging public property, beating people up and disrupting normal life by staging sit-ins against the acquittal of Asia Bibi earlier that year. Ms. Bibi was convicted of blasphemy in 2009 and sentenced to death on charges of insulting Islam.

Her case stemmed from a quarrel with fellow farm workers who refused to drink from the same water container used by a Christian. She consistently denied the charges against her.

The country’s Supreme Court overturned her conviction in 2018 but after hard-line Islamists staged nationwide rallies against the ruling, authorities continued to hold her in protective custody before she was allowed to leave for Canada last year to reunite with her family there. Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are often used to settle scores or intimidate followers of minority religions, including Shia Muslims. A charge of insulting Islam can bring the death penalty, and the mere accusation of blasphemy is sometimes enough to whip up vengeful mobs, even if courts acquit defendants.

In two related cases, Salman Taseer, the governor of eastern Punjab province, was shot and killed by one of his bodyguards in 2011 for defending Bibi. His assassin, Mumtaz Qadri, was celebrated as a martyr by hard-liners following his execution, with millions visiting a shrine erected in his honor near Islamabad. Later in 2011, Pakistan’s minister for minorities, Shahbaz Bhatti, was assassinated, also after demanding justice for Bibi.

Last year, authorities arrested Mr. Rizvi for leading incendiary rallies. He was later freed on bail on medical grounds pending trial.

Last month, in Multan, a court convicted Junaid Hafeez, a Muslim professor, of blasphemy, sentencing him to death for allegedly spreading anti-Islamic ideas. He was held for six years awaiting trial and spent most of that time in solitary confinement.

A prominent Pakistani lawyer, A.K. Dogar, criticised Thursday’s verdicts, saying they were mostly symbolic and that none of those convicted would spend more than 25 years in prison at the most, which is equivalent to a life sentence under Pakistani law.

Mr. Dogar was not involved in the case of the sentenced Tehreek-e-Labbaik members. “Imprisonments given by judges of more than 25 years are mostly symbolic,” he said. “The convicted person only spends a maximum 25 years in prison.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/g6zhxd/article30588913.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH18-PAKISTAN-CONVICTION,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/pakistan-islamists-get-55-years-in-jail-for-protests/article30588914.ece
15,2020/01/17,Phone scandal rocks Sri Lanka’s Opposition party,"A Sri Lankan politician’s alleged practice of recording phone conversations has led to a scandal, after some of the conversations were leaked on social media, putting several judges, police officers and politicians under the spotlight and delivering a huge blow to the main Opposition party.

Earlier this week, police arrested actor-politician Ranjan Ramanayake, a legislator with the United National Party (UNP), that suspended him following the phone call leaks.

The recordings reveal what appear to be the politician’s conversations, with senior judges, police and celebrities, pertaining to ongoing court cases.

On Thursday, the Judicial Services Commission suspended a magistrate court judge in connection with the leaked audio. The Attorney General has also directed the Colombo Crime Division to record statements from current and former judges reportedly heard speaking to the politician. A senior police investigator has been suspended pending an inquiry initiated against him.

High-profile cases

Most of the leaked conversations in Sinhala language have raised serious questions about possible political interference from the former UNP government in high-profile cases involving members of President Mahinda Rajapaksa’s administration that the UNP-led coalition unseated in 2015, promising good governance and rule of law. In the November 2019 presidential election, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa won a huge mandate, prompting the UNP to step down from the government.

Ministers and MPs of the new government, helmed by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, have slammed the opposition UNP for “politicising” the judiciary and police services while in power. It remains unclear who leaked the conversations on social media after police obtained hard drives and CDs, reportedly with one lakh call recordings, including some with indecent language.

Mr. Ramanayake, a former State Minister, was also heard criticising his party’s leadership, according media reports. Police have denied any involvement in the leak— that have been widely shared on traditional and social media.

Mr. Ramanayake, nicknamed ‘One Shot’ after one of his successful films, has in the past made news for his sensational phone calls. He once called a fellow MP during a press conference and put her on speaker phone, reportedly without her knowledge.

Meanwhile, the UNP is caught in an internal power struggle, a month after its candidate Sajith Premadasa — now Leader of Opposition — lost the presidential election.

16,2020/01/17,China birth rate hits lowest level since 1949,"China’s birth rate dropped last year to its lowest level since the Communist country was founded in 1949, adding to concerns that an ageing society and shrinking workforce will pile pressure on a slowing economy.

To avoid a demographic crisis, the government relaxed its one-child policy in 2016 to allow people to have two children, but the change has not resulted in an increase in pregnancies. In 2019, the birth rate stood at 10.48 per 1,000 people, down slightly from the year before, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Friday. The number of births has now fallen for three consecutive years, still, there were 14.65 million babies born in 2019.

He Yafu, an independent demographer based in southern Guangdong province, said the number of births was the lowest since 1961, the last year of a famine that left tens of millions dead. U.S.-based academic Yi Fuxian, senior scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that even though China has abolished its one-child policy, there has been a shift in the mindset of the population.

The protesters are asking their lawmakers to pressure India to repeal the CAA, Thenmozhi Soundararajan, a director at diaspora organization Equality Labs, told The Hindu. It is also a means to bring attention to the diversity of views in the Indian diaspora in the U.S., specifically the views of those who support a secular view of India and other South Asian countries. The majority of the diaspora, as per Ms Soundararajan, stands for a secular vision of their South Asian homelands.

18,2020/01/17,Brazil’s arts scene the latest target in Bolsonaro government’s war on culture,"Brazil’s government has drawn criticism after launching a project that aims to revamp the country’s arts scene, with a focus on nationalism and religion.

The project is part of the far-right administration’s answer to what it sees as decades of leftist hegemony in the cultural sphere — from art to education and family. Though cash-strapped, the government of President Jair Bolsonaro will spend $4.9 million to foment the production of literature, theatre, opera, music and other arts. It was announced by Mr. Bolsonaro, Education Minister Abraham Weintraub and Culture Secretary Roberto Alvim from a library of the official presidential residence in a Facebook Live video.

Mr. Alvim, the driving force behind the initiative, is a born-again Christian who found renewed faith while recovering from cancer. While the amount to be spent is a drop in the bucket compared to other arts funding, the project jibes with the government’s other efforts to overturn what Mr. Bolsonaro calls “cultural Marxism” and some of his Ministers say is undermining society’s morals. The leftist Workers’ Party governed Brazil for 13 years until 2016.

“When culture becomes sick, the people become sick, too,” Mr. Alvim said in the video beside the President. “Brazilian culture was deliberately sickened during the recent decades. Culture is the basis of the homeland.”

Over 57 million people — 55% of the voters in 2018’s election — embraced Mr. Bolsonaro’s anti-leftist campaign, in which he promised to fight corruption, violence and leftist ideology with the same energy. The government will stimulate film projects that focus on Brazil’s independence and historical figures, and be aligned with conservative values, Mr. Alvim said.

Cultural ‘crusade’ on multiple fronts

The cultural crusade in Brazil goes well beyond the arts. From school textbooks to teen pregnancy, from the walls of private museums to those of public institutions, the 2020 ideological push is shaping up on several fronts. And after a series of high-profile resignations and dismissals in year one, President Bolsonaro begins his second year in office with a new ministerial team to implement their leader’s conservative agenda.

“I’m back, ready for battle,” Mr. Weintraub tweeted January 5, calling his followers to support him in his fight against “oligarchs, corrupt individuals and the communist-socialist ideological wing.”

Mr. Bolsonaro has made education, especially in early childhood, one of his top priorities. On January 7, he and Mr. Weintraub — his second Education Minister in a year — spoke live on Facebook and accused previous administrations of turning the ministry of 300,000 employees into a factory of “militants.” The two announced a complete “clean-up” of children’s school textbooks.

Without presenting concrete examples, Mr. Bolsonaro previously described textbooks as an “embarrassment” with too much writing in them, and said parents only want their sons to be boys and daughters to be girls. “There are still some (textbooks) that we don’t like but a lot of filth has already come out,” Mr. Weintraub assured him.

Few specific proposals have been put forward as an alternative — an emphasis on family values, the national anthem (already included in textbooks by law), and a Brazilian flag on the cover.

For Claudia Costin, a former education secretary in Rio de Janeiro and senior director for education at the World Bank, the culture wars were a waste of precious time. Brazil ranked in the bottom third of the 79 countries and economies that took part in the 2018 Program for International Student Assessment conducted by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development. According to the test’s results, Brazilian students have stagnated in mathematics, reading and science. Public schools are performing particularly poorly.

“We have a lot of homework to do,” Ms. Costin said. “All this is a distraction from what really needs to be done.”

Conservatism and health

The government’s conservative agenda has also pushed into health matters. Damares Alves, the Minister of Women, Family and Human Rights, recently shared news of an approach to fighting teen pregnancy that would focus on advocating sexual abstinence.

The campaign, expected to be unveiled in the coming days, will target youths, but also parents, educators, and health workers, said Angela Gandra, the Scretary in charge of Family Affairs at Alvares’ Ministry. She stressed that the campaign is complementary to existing methods of contraception.

“We want to bring reflection to the parents and the children about what human relations are,” Ms. Gandra said at the ministry’s building in Brasilia. In 2017, the latest year for which data is available, more than 480,000 babies were born in Brazil to mothers aged 10 to 19, Health Ministry statistics show.

At the building next door, in the Culture Secretary’s office, Mr. Alvim’s promised crusade is under way. On Twitter, he regularly uses #DeusVult, or “God wills it,” echoing the Christian battle cry of Middle Ages crusaders. It’s also popular with white nationalists in the U.S.

Speaking in a recorded message released Thursday, with a wooden cross atop his desk, Mr. Alvim said he wants 2020 to mark a historic cultural rebirth to “create a new and thriving Brazilian civilization”. He sat beneath a framed picture of the President, and orchestral strings played lightly in the background.

19,2020/01/17,Ukraine PM offers to resign after leak of audio recording,"Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk offered his resignation on Friday after an audio recording suggested he had criticised the President, but then appeared to indicate that he might keep his job.

Speculation over Mr. Honcharuk’s position has grown this week after a recording of a man discussing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s purported lack of knowledge of economics was circulated on messaging channels, apparently at a meeting of the Prime Minister, Finance Minister and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) in December.

Mr. Zelenskiy is a former comic actor who had no political experience when he swept to power in an election last year on the back of public anger over high-level corruption. Mr. Honcharuk said on Friday the recording had been doctored and was made up of different fragments of what had been said at government meetings.

Mr. Zelenskiy asked law enforcement agencies to determine who was involved in making the recording and how to prevent such incidents from occurring in future.

Mr. Honcharuk announced his resignation in a message on Facebook where he also praised Mr. Zelenskiy as “a model of openness and decency”.

Mr. Honcharuk appeared in Parliament later on Friday and reaffirmed his respect for the President, adding that Ukraine must remain united in the face of what he called information attacks and manipulations.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/dm718n/article30584701.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/UKRAINE-POLITICS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/ukraine-pm-submits-resignation-letter-president-to-consider-it/article30584702.ece

21,2020/01/17,"Thailand finds second case of new Chinese virus, says no outbreak","Thailand has found a second case of a new Chinese coronavirus, authorities said on Friday, as they ramped up checks on Chinese visitors, nearly a million of whom are expected for Lunar New Year holidays next week.

The latest patient is from China's central city of Wuhan, which has reported 41 cases of pneumonia potentially linked to the new type of virus, with two deaths, as hospitals worldwide scramble to guard against any spread.

The 74-year-old woman, quarantined since arriving in Thailand on Monday, was found to be infected, health officials said.

“We're very confident that we can control the spread of this kind of diseases,” Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters, adding that the situation was under control and there was no outbreak in Thailand. “We're fully alert.”

The two Chinese patients were now safe but needed to go through a few more procedures before Thai authorities could let them return home, he added.

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Thailand, which is on high alert ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays, said on Monday it had found a 61-year-old Chinese woman carrying a strain of the coronavirus, the first time it was detected outside China.

Japan reported its first case of the infection on Thursday, after a Japanese man returned from visiting Wuhan, known for picturesque lakes.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has said the virus could spread and warned hospitals against it..

Thai health officials have stepped up monitoring at four airports receiving daily flights from Wuhan - Suvarnabhumi, Don Muang, Chiang Mai and Phuket - and others that receive charter flights from the Chinese city.

Since Jan. 3, Thailand has screened 13,624 passengers.

Health officials also asked Thai AirAsia and China Southern Airlines, which run direct daily flights from Wuhan, to halt boarding by those suffering from high fever and respiratory symptoms, and reschedule their flights.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/hgbkyz/article30567852.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/14THCORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/thailand-finds-second-case-of-new-chinese-virus-says-no-outbreak/article30584399.ece
22,2020/01/17,U.S. warship transits Taiwan Strait less than week after election,"A U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday, the island's defence ministry said, less than a week after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide on a platform of standing up to China which claims the island.

The ship sailed in a northerly direction through the sensitive waterway and Taiwan's armed forces monitored it throughout, the ministry said in a brief statement on Friday, describing the sailing as an “ordinary mission”.

“People can rest easy,” it added.

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial and diplomatic issue and Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The narrow Taiwan Strait which separates the island from China is a frequent source of tension.

Intimidation

China sailed its latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the waterway twice in the run-up to Taiwan's election last Saturday.

Taiwan denounced that as attempted intimidation.

The U.S. Navy said the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh had completed a transit of the Taiwan Strait, without giving details. The United States has been conducting sporadic missions through the strait in the last two years.

Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself and is its main source of arms.

Meeting the de facto British ambassador to Taiwan later on Friday, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said that the island would ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait.

“As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to dedicate itself to protecting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” the presidential office cited Ms. Tsai as telling Catherine Nettleton.

Under the Trump administration, the United States has made bolstering its defence and other ties with Taiwan a priority, in spite of Chinese anger.

The top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Brent Christensen, told a forum in Taipei on Friday that his office's theme for this year was “real friends, real progress”, and took what appeared to be an indirect dig at China.

“Perhaps this concept sounds simple, but it is important to consider its significance within the current context,” said Mr. Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan.

“Some use the cover of friendship to dominate and manipulate; promising mutual benefit but instead delivering extortion; exporting problems rather than solutions,” he added.

Mr. Christensen said the United States this year will seek to further Taiwan's engagement in the world, something the island has found difficult due to China blocking Taiwan's participation in most international organisations.

“The United States and Taiwan are members of the same family of democracies,” he added.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6jhfrj/article30583676.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-warship-transits-taiwan-strait-less-than-week-after-election/article30583632.ece

Russian Deputy Chief of Mission Roman Babushkin added that all S-400 air defence missile systems will be delivered to India by 2025. The production of S-400 missiles to be delivered to India has started, he said.

“Those having doubts over India’s approach on Kashmir can go there, we don’t have any doubt,” he said on not being invited to visit Jammu and Kashmir.

On China’s attempt to raise the issue of Kashmir at the Security Council, Kudashev said, “It’s a strictly bilateral matter to discuss between India and Pakistan based on Shimla Agreement and Lahore Declaration.

24,2020/01/17,Not ready for peace with India without resolving Kashmir issue in a just manner: Pakistan FM,"Pakistan is not prepared to pay any price for peace with India and certainly not without resolving the Kashmir issue in a just manner, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said.

Addressing the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) think-tank here on Thursday, Qureshi reiterated Pakistan’s demand that U.S. President Donald Trump should mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories on August 5, evoking strong reactions from Islamabad.

Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue.

“Our government wants peace in the neighbourhood. We want, we need peace in order to focus on achieving our domestic agenda for economic reform and development. But we are not prepared to pay any price for peace with India, certainly not our dignity and certainly not without resolving the Kashmir dispute in a just manner,” Mr. Qureshi said.

He alleged that instead of fighting poverty and hunger together, the “RSS-inspired BJP government has embarked upon the project of turning India into a Hindu Rashtra”.

“The adherence of Hindutva and an Akhand Bharat have established this ascendancy with disastrous consequences for all in India and the world to see,” he alleged.

Mr. Qureshi said on August 5 India tried to change the “disputed status” of Jammu and Kashmir and “alter” its demographic structure, breaking all relevant international laws and “violating” several UN Security Council resolutions in the process.

India has been seeking to break the will of the Kashmiri people by imprisoning them in their homes and imposing a communications blockade that continues to this day, he said.

“Indian narrative that Kashmir is India’s internal part is firmly refuted by its being on the Security Council agenda. If this were not the case, why would the French President raise it with the Indian Prime Minister?” he asked.

“We know that President Trump is profoundly worried by the Kashmir situation and we welcome his repeated offers of mediation in resolving the Kashmir dispute. The United States alone commands the moral authority and respect in South Asia to resolve the longest pending dispute on the UN agenda,” he said.

“We hope president Trump is successful in realising his goal and can make a lasting contribution to substantial peace in South Asia. That could be his enduring legacy,” Mr. Qureshi said.

Although President Trump has offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue in the past, New Delhi has told Washington that it is a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan and there is no scope for any third-party mediation.

On the sidelines of the G7 summit in the French town of Biarritz in August last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while interacting with the media alongside President Trump, categorically rejected any scope for third party mediation between India and Pakistan on Kashmir, saying the two countries can discuss and resolve all issues bilaterally and “we don’t want to trouble any third country”.

On a two-day visit to Washington DC, Mr. Qureshi is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien on Friday. On Thursday, he met lawmakers at the US Capitol.

In his speech, Mr. Qureshi referred to the recent arrest of an Indian police officer and joined the conspiracy theory about terrorist attacks in India.

“Meanwhile, we all followed reports of capture of Indian police officer, Davinder Singh, whose footprint is now being seen in some major terrorist attack, which India itself orchestrated and blamed on Pakistan,” said Mr. Qureshi.

“We have been consistently warning the world community about another false flag operation against Pakistan that Davinder Singh was accompanied by two militants on his way to Delhi in close proximity to Republic Day celebrations should not be lost on anyone,” the minister said.

Mr. Qureshi said that the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens were raising fundamental questions about the ideals like democracy and secularism that India’s founding father passionately advocated.

He said that every other day, military officials or politicians from India make veiled threats against Pakistan.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Qureshi met members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2pf6qg/article30583175.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PAKISTANINDIAKASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/not-ready-for-peace-with-india-without-resolving-kashmir-issue-in-a-just-manner-pakistan-fm/article30583176.ece
25,2020/01/17,"Menstruation huts destroyed in Nepal, where exile persists","Authorities are knocking down tiny huts in western Nepal where women have been exiled during menstruation and exposed to cold weather and threats from animals and even sexual assaults.

Government officials accompanied by police officers and local politicians were going to villages and towns in Kanchanpur district, tearing down the sheds mostly made of mud walls and covered by straw roofs, Chief District Officer Sushil Baidhya said Friday.

The custom of exiling menstruating women has persisted in parts of west Nepal though the Supreme Court banned it in 2005. A new law criminalized it last year, with violators who force women into exile facing up to three months in prison or a fine of 3,000 Nepalese rupees ($26).

Many menstruating women are still forced to shelter in huts or cow sheds until their cycle ends. The custom - called “Chhaupadi” - continues in many parts of the majority Hindu Himalayan country, especially in the western hills.

In the isolated, unhygienic or insecure huts and sheds, women can face bitter cold, illness, wild animals and the possibility of sexual assaults.

Several women and girls have died during their exile. A major cause of the deaths is smoke inhalation because they lit a fire to keep warm in the tiny huts in hilly or mountainous areas.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/e09x8t/article30458480.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/BreakNews,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/menstruation-huts-destroyed-in-nepal-where-exile-persists/article30583065.ece
26,2020/01/17,"Taliban open to 10-day ceasefire with U.S., talks with Afghan government: sources","The Taliban will implement a 10-day ceasefire with U.S. troops, a reduction in violence with Afghan forces and discussions with Afghan government officials if it reaches an agreement with U.S. negotiators in talks in Doha, two sources have said.

If an agreement is reached, the move could revive hopes for a long-term solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.

Taliban and U.S. negotiation teams met on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the signing of a peace deal, according to a spokesman for the Taliban office in Doha, Qatar.

The talks between the two sides were “useful” and would continue for a few days, the spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said in a tweet early on Friday.

The stop-start talks between Taliban militants and the United States to end the 18-year war in Afghanistan were called off in September by U.S. President Donald Trump after an American soldier was killed in an attack by the Taliban.

Talks that had resumed after Trump visited U.S. troops in Afghanistan in November were put on “pause” again the following month after the Taliban launched a suicide attack on a U.S. base outside Kabul killing two civilians.

However, two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the Taliban's top leadership had discussed and agreed to implement a 10-day ceasefire with U.S troops once an agreement was signed with U.S. officials in Doha, and “reduce” attacks against the Afghan government as well.

A senior Taliban commander said: “The U.S. wanted us to announce a ceasefire during the peace talks which we had rejected. Our shura (council) has agreed to a ceasefire the day the peace accord is signed.”

Once an agreement for the ceasefire is in place, the Taliban and Afghan government could meet face to face in Germany, said the commander. Previously, the Taliban had refused to engage in talks with the Afghan government.

“Our representatives have been meeting with the U.S. negotiation team in Doha and they persistently demanded a ceasefire which we had declined due to some issues,” the Taliban commander said. “Now most of our reservations have been addressed.”

Another source close to the talks confirmed the commander's version of events.

A date for the signing of the agreement with the U.S. side has not been fixed, but the Taliban commander said he expected it to be “very soon.”

Both sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

A U.S. State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter. The Pentagon referred queries to the State Department.

Officials in the Afghan Presidential Palace said they were unaware of any deal.

Violence in Afghanistan rose after the breakdown of talks in September. The spike in attacks has led many to fear that chances of a peace agreement had faded.

27,2020/01/17,Bangladesh says once-submerged island ready to house one lakh Rohingya refugees,"A Bangladeshi island regularly submerged by monsoon rains is ready to house 1,00,000 Rohingya refugees, but no date has been announced to relocate people from the crowded and squalid camps where they’ve lived for years, officials said Thursday.

Flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques have been built on Bhasan Char, or floating island, in the Bay of Bengal, officials said.

Bhasan Char is ready for habitation. Everything has been put in place, Bangladesh refugee, relief and repatriation commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder told The Associated Press.

The island is built to accommodate 1,00,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar.

About 7,00,000 people came after August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown against Rohingya in response to an attack by insurgents.

Global rights groups and the U.N. called the campaign ethnic cleansing involving rapes, killings and torching of thousands of homes.

Foreign media have not been permitted to visit the island.

Saleh Noman, a Bangladeshi freelance journalist who recently visited, described a community emerging there.

I saw a market with about 10 grocery shops and roadside tea stalls. Some were selling fish and vegetables, he said.

All is set there with a solar power system and water supply lines. Bangladesh is a low-lying delta nation. The island, 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland, surfaced only 20 years ago and was never inhabited.

The Bangladesh navy has been implementing a multimillion-dollar plan to bolster the swampy island, which is submerged for months during annual monsoon season.

International aid agencies and the United Nations have vehemently opposed the relocation plan since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.

Mostofa Mohamamd Sazzad Hossain, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangladesh, said Thursday the agency isn’t ready to endorse the relocation and is waiting for a chance to visit the island after a November trip was canceled.

“The UN has emphasized the importance of undertaking independent and thorough technical and protection assessments that consider safety, sustainability, and protection issues prior to any relocation taking into place. The assessment process should include onsite visits to Bhasan Char, Mr. Hossain said.

The current refugee camps near the beach town of Cox’s Bazar are overcrowded and unhygienic. Disease and organized crime are rampant. Education is limited and refugees aren’t allowed to work.

Still, most Rohingya are unwilling to return to Myanmar due to safety concerns. Government officials didn’t have an estimate of how many refugees would be willing to be relocated to the island.

On Thursday, two Bangladeshi contractors involved with development of the island described construction there. They spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.

We have built quality infrastructure. Bangladeshi villages have never seen such good work. This is like a modern township project, one contractor said.

We have built multifamily concrete homes, hospitals, mosques, schools, playgrounds and roads. There are solar-power facilities, a water supply system. We constructed raised concrete buildings that could be used as cyclone shelters. Many trees have been planted, he said.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly told the U.N. and other international partners that her administration will consult them before making a final decision on the relocation, and that no refugees will be forced to move.

Myanmar is defending itself in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, after the West African nation of Gambia brought a case backed by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Canada and the Netherlands.

Gambia in its submission said there was a serious and imminent risk of genocide recurring and called for emergency measures to prevent Myanmar from committing any further atrocities or erasing any evidence. The court is expected to deliver a decision on Jan. 23 on what measures should be imposed.

Kamal Hossain, Bangladesh’s top government official in Cox’s Bazar, said Thursday that discussions attempting to convince refugee families to move to the island are continuing. “We are ready. This is a continuous process,” he said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nq1xn2/article30270289.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY11ROHINGYA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-says-once-submerged-island-ready-to-house-one-lakh-rohingya-refugees/article30582706.ece

The world’s second-largest economy grew by 6.1% last year, its worst performance since 1990, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

The figure matches an AFP analyst forecast and is within Beijing’s official target of 6.0-6.5%. But last year’s growth was down from 6.6% in 2018.

The attack was retaliation for a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3 that killed Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.

President Donald Trump and the U.S. military had said there were no casualties after the strike on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq and a facility in its northern Kurdish region.

“While no U.S. service members were killed in the Jan. 8 Iranian attack on Al Asad air base, several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed,” Captain Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement.

As a measure of caution, some service members were taken to U.S. facilities in Germany or Kuwait for “follow-on screening,” he added.

“When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq.”

31,2020/01/17,Chinese president heads to Myanmar for crucial state visit,"China’s President Xi Jinping was heading to Myanmar on Friday for a state visit likely to deepen the countries’ already close bilateral relations at a critical time.

While the visit nominally marks the 70th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Myanmar, it comes with the prospect of significantly boosting China’s profile and investments in the future.

China’s ambassador to Myanmar Chen Hai told Chinese journalists last week that during Mr. Xi’s two-day visit, the two countries would sign agreements “covering politics, economy, livelihoods and regional cooperation.” Some of these are expected to expedite major infrastructure projects that will extend Beijing’s strategic presence all the way to the Indian Ocean.

A complicating factor is Myanmar’s general election, scheduled for late 2020, since too much wheeling and dealing with China could leave Aung San Suu Kyi’s government vulnerable to accusations by political opponents that it is selling out the country.

The trip will be Mr. Xi ‘s first to Myanmar and his first foreign visit this year. Jiang Zemin was the last Chinese president to visit Myanmar, when he signed several economic and border agreements in 2001.

Ambassador Chen said that Mr. Xi will meet Myanmar’s President Win Myint, State Counselor Suu Kyi, who is the country’s de facto leader, and military chief Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, as well as legislators and other opinion-makers.

Myanmar is a linchpin of China’s geopolitical ambitions, offering access to the Indian Ocean that would allow its sizable oil and gas imports from the Gulf to bypass going through the Strait of Malacca, and serving as a bridge to South Asia and beyond in Beijing’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to build railroads, highways, ports and other infrastructure connecting China with other points in Asia and into Europe and Africa.

China serves as a no-questions-asked ally to Myanmar, giving it diplomatic cover as the country faces widespread condemnation over its human rights record. The reaction to its brutal counterinsurgency campaign that drove more than 700,000 members of the country’s Muslim Rohingya minority to flee for safety in neighboring Bangladesh threatens it with economic sanctions from Western nations.

Last month a case charging Myanmar with genocide came before the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands, virtually ratifying the Southeast Asian country’s near-pariah status.

China for years has defended Myanmar in forums such as the United Nations, and Myanmar has returned the favor by following Beijing’s positions on issue such as China’s claims over territory in the South China Sea.

More importantly, China as a top investor and trade partner with Myanmar offers economic insurance if Western nations do impose sanctions.

Just days before Ms. Suu Kyi went to The Hague in December to lead her country’s delegation at the initial hearings of the International Court of Justice, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with her for talks. The court holds another hearing next week.

""Xi is visiting Myanmar at the very right time. And Myanmar wants to show the Western world that China is backing them. Just before the ICJ hearings in December 2019, China’s FM visited and now before issuance of provisional measures, Xi is going to visit,” Germany-based Rohingya activist Nay San Lwin told . “I think it is not a coincidence. Myanmar wanted to say to the West to be careful if you impose any sanctions.”

Beijing in recent years has waged a strong battle with Washington for influence in Southeast Asia.

China also uses it influence with various Myanmar ethnic rebel groups based along the countries’ border who are battling battle for autonomy from the central government.

While China has promoted peace talks between the the rebels and Myanmar’s government, its close ties with some of the rebel groups allows it to retain the option of threatening violence by using ethnic guerrillas as proxies.

What appears to be a mutually beneficial quid pro quo with China won’t necessarily play well domestically, a worry for Mr. Suu Kyi and her ruling National League for Democracy party as it faces new elections. There has always been a strong undercurrent of anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar, and it is boosted by sometimes heavy-handed implementation of Chinese-backed projects that run roughshod over local communities, provoking allegations of land-grabbing, environmental damage and selling out the country’s resources.

Even Myanmar’s previous military-backed government was forced by popular demand to suspend plans for the massive $3.6 billion Myitsone hydroelectric dam project in 2011, but it has not been canceled. Activists plan a protest against the project on Saturday outside the Chinese Embassy in Yangon.

It includes cross-border oil and gas pipelines that have been operating for years, and a major railway is planned, though its projected high cost has given pause.

Amnesty International is among the critics of the Chinese-assisted projects.

“With major economic and infrastructure agreements expected to be signed during President Xi’s visit, the absolute lack of transparency over such agreements is deeply disturbing,” the human rights group said in a statement Thursday. “Investment in infrastructure can help raise living standards and realize human rights through improved access to basic services and employment.”

""But these benefits are not delivered if those who bear the heaviest cost - the women, men, and children whose homes, health, livelihoods are be affected - are not adequately consulted before construction starts and protected from potential harm. Human rights, transparency, and consultation with communities should be at the heart of these projects.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/article21248991.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINAMYANMAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-president-heads-to-myanmar-for-crucial-state-visit/article30582559.ece
32,2020/01/17,Facebook sued in U.S. federal court for alleged anticompetitive conduct,"Four companies sued Facebook Inc in U.S. federal court on Thursday for alleged anticompetitive conduct, saying the social network inappropriately revoked developer access to its platform in order to harm prospective competitors.

The plaintiffs sought class-action status and unspecified damages, according to a filing at the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

“Facebook faced an existential threat from mobile apps, and while it could have responded by competing on the merits, it instead chose to use its might to intentionally eliminate its competition,” said Yavar Bathaee, a partner at law firm Pierce Bainbridge and co-lead counsel in the case.

The filing is an escalation of Facebook's battles with small app developers that had built companies based on access to its user data. Facebook cut off access for certain apps as far back as 2012, while still allowing access for others.

Thousands of pages of damaging internal emails have emerged from a similar lawsuit filed by Six4Three, the developer of a now-shuttered bikini photo app. Facebook has described the Six4Three case as baseless.

Facebook did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the latest lawsuit.

34,2020/01/17,Police: 2 gunmen injure 5 customers at Chicago barbershop,"Two gunmen fired through the window of a Chicago barbershop on Thursday evening, injuring three three juveniles and two adults who were getting their hair cut, police said.

Chicago police Deputy Chief of Patrol Ernest Cato told The Chicago Tribune that the gunmen had walked into the store in the West Garfield Park neighbourhood and looked around, moments before firing into the shop from the street.

Police said the victims — ages 11, 12, 16, 30 and 40 — all were expected to survive.

There was no motive given for the shooting.

Interim police Superintendent Charlie Beck, who was appearing at an unrelated event, said the victims were getting their haircut at the time of the shooting. All were taken to hospitals.

35,2020/01/17,Chinese President Xi Jinping likely to focus on Bay of Bengal during Myanmar visit,"Chinese President Xi Jinping is heading to Myanmar on Friday, to strengthen Beijing’s influence in the Bay of Bengal, and bring to focus the intersection between the China-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and India’s Act East policy.

President Xi has made it clear that his visit will focus on the full development of the Kyaukpyu port in the Bay of Bengal, as the gateway to southwest China. The initiative is part of the China Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), which is another spur of the BRI in the Indian Ocean.

China is already expanding its outreach in the Arabian Sea by developing Gwadar port under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

Analysts point out that China’s focus on the Indian Ocean feeds into its growing military rivalry with the United States. By developing ports such as the Gwadar and Kyaukpyu, China hopes to lower its strategic dependence on the Malacca straits — the vital trade link between the Indian and the Pacific oceans, which the Indo-Pacific command of the U.S. dominates.

In an article published in three newspapers in Myanmar ahead of his visit, President Xi—the first Chinese head of state to visit Myanmar in two decades — pointed out that Beijing and Naypyitaw needed to “deepen results-oriented Belt and Road cooperation and move from a conceptual stage to concrete planning and implementation in building the CMEC.”

President Xi focused on “three pillars of the CMEC” — the Kyaukpyu Special Economic Zone, the China-Myanmar Border Economic Cooperation Zone and the New Yangon City.

The article also disclosed that a joint CMEC committee has been formed to steer the development of the undertaking.

The CMEC already covers gas and oil pipelines that were built in 2013 and 2017. In future, there are plans to build a high-speed rail link that will link Ruili on the Chinese side of the border with Muse in Myanmar and head to the central city of Mandalay in the first phase. Eventually, it could be extended to Kyaukpyu on the Bay of Bengal.

India and Japan — two major external players in Myanmar — are expected to keep a close eye on President Xi’s visit. However, there is also an acknowledgement in New Delhi and Tokyo that the three countries, despite restrained rivalry, are unlikely to engage in a full blown zero-sum competition for influence in Myanmar.

“We are aware that for historical reasons, Chinese influence will remain strong in northern Myanmar while in southern Myanmar, Japan and India should remain major influencers,” a Japanese official who did not wish to be named told The Hindu. He pointed out that a “multilateral bank” has been engaged in dialogue on identifying and coordinating specific projects, with adequate buffers.

Separately, Manabu Fujimura, Professor at Tokyo’s Aoyama Gakuin University, had earlier said in an interview with the website Consult-Myanmar that it was likely that the Chinese economic influence in Myanmar will continue to radiate “from Muse (in Shan State on Myanmar’s border with China’s Yunnan province) to Mandalay and ‘upper Burma’ in general, while Japanese and Thai economic influence will continue to spill over from Myawaddy (in southeastern Myanmar) to Yangon and ‘lower Burma’ in general.”

While Beijing continues to expand its influence, especially after the squeeze imposed by the West on Myanmar on grounds of human rights violations following the exodus of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh, India and Japan are also engaging with Naypyitaw, especially in the construction of key infrastructure.

Japan and India are bridging gaps and repaving roads in the Indo-Pacific to establish a giant corridor that will link India’s northeast with Vietnam.

The gigantic effort will merge two parallel initiatives — the New Delhi led India-Myanmar-Thailand trilateral highway and the East West Economic Corridor (EWEC) marshaled by Japan in partnership with Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.

Doctrinally, the joint foray is a fusion of India’s Act East Policy and the Japan’s free and open Indo-Pacific strategy.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/3x8bth/article30579029.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/xijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/chinese-president-xi-jinping-likely-to-focus-on-bay-of-bengal-during-myanmar-visit/article30579025.ece
36,2020/01/17,Iran accuses EU of abandoning nuclear deal,"Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday three European nations — U.K., France and Germany — had succumbed to “high school bully” Donald Trump when they triggered a dispute mechanism in nuclear deal.

The three governments “sold out remnants of #JCPOA (the nuclear deal) to avoid new Trump tariffs,” Mr. Zarif charged.

“It won't work my friends. You only whet his appetite. Remember your high school bully?”

Germany's defence minister on Thursday confirmed a Washington Post report that the United States had threatened to impose a 25% tariff on imports of European cars if EU governments continued to back the nuclear deal.

“This expression or threat, as you will, does exist,” Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference during a visit to London.

Mr. Zarif said Europe's unwillingness to antagonise the United States made a mockery of its stated determination to rescue the nuclear deal.

“If you want to sell your integrity, go ahead,” Mr. Zarif tweeted. “But DO NOT assume high moral/legal ground.”

The European states triggered a dispute mechanism established under the deal, which allows a party to claim significant non-compliance by another party before a joint commission, with appeals possible to an advisory board and ultimately to the UN Security Council.

Since Washington pulled out of the agreement and reimposed crippling unilateral sanctions in 2018, EU governments have sought to find a way to allow European businesses to continue trading with Iran without incurring huge US penalties.

37,2020/01/17,5 indicted over Pakistan weapons programme,"Five men have been indicted in the U.S. for allegedly running a network that purchased U.S. products for Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme.

“The defendants smuggled U.S. origin goods to entities that have been designated for years as threats to U.S. national security for their ties to Pakistan’s weapons programs,” assistant attorney general John Demers said. The five, who live outside the U.S., were indicted by a grand jury in October. The indictment was unsealed on Wednesday and arrest warrants are pending.

The five were accused of operating a front company called “Business World” in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

They were identified as Muhammad Kamran Wali, 41, of Pakistan, Muhammad Ahsan Wali, 48, and Haji Wali Muhammad Sheikh, 82, both of Mississauga, Ontario, Ashraf Khan Muhammad of Hong Kong, and Ahmed Waheed, 52, of Ilford, England.

They were charged with conspiring to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the Export Control Reform Act.

“The alleged behavior of these five individuals presented more than a violation of US export laws,” said Jason Molina, a special agent with the Department of Homeland Security.

“It posed a potential threat to the national security interests of the United States and to the delicate balance of power among nations within the region.”

According to the indictment, between September 2014 and October 2019, the five procured US goods without export licenses for Pakistan's Advanced Engineering Research Organization and the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/5-indicted-over-pakistan-weapons-programme/article30578304.ece
38,2020/01/17,Japan reports case of mystery virus,"Japan has confirmed a case of a mystery virus that first emerged in China and is from the same family as the deadly SARS pathogen, authorities said Thursday.

It appears to be only the second time the novel coronavirus has been detected outside China, after the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed a case in Thailand.

Japan's health ministry said a man who had visited the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the apparent epicentre of the outbreak, was hospitalised on January 10, four days after his return to Japan. He reported a persistent fever.

Tests on the patient, who was released from hospital on Wednesday, confirmed he was infected with the new virus.

“This is the first domestic discovery of a pneumonia case related to the new coronavirus,” the ministry said in a statement.

“We will continue active epidemiological research while also coordinating efforts with the World Health Organization and related agencies to conduct a risk assessment.”

The outbreak has caused alarm because the new virus is from the same family as the pathogen that causes SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which killed 349 people in mainland China and 299 in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003.

Authorities in Wuhan said a seafood market was the centre of the outbreak. It was closed on January 1.

Japanese authorities said the man had not visited the market and that it was possible he had been in contact with a person infected with the virus while in Wuhan.

- Outbreak in Japan 'unlikely' -

Health ministry official Eiji Hinoshita told reporters that the risk of the disease spreading from the patient was considered low, with careful checks done on those who had been in close contact with him.

“At this point, we feel it is unlikely this will lead to a dramatic outbreak,” he said, adding that the patient was no longer suffering a fever and was recuperating at home.

Officials declined to give further information on the man, including his nationality, citing privacy concerns.

The health ministry urged people who develop a cough or fever after visiting Wuhan to wear a surgical mask and “swiftly visit a medical institution”.

Hinoshita said Japan would need to raise its guard ahead of the Lunar New Year, a popular travel period in China.

“It is expected that Japan will see many visitors from China,” he said.

It is not yet clear whether the mystery virus can be transmitted between humans, but on Wednesday authorities said it was possible it had spread inside a family.

The woman diagnosed in Thailand, who is in a stable condition, also said she had not visited the Wuhan seafood market.

And WHO doctor Maria Van Kerkhove on Tuesday said she “wouldn't be surprised if there was some limited human-to-human transmission, especially among families who have close contact with one another”.

The outbreak has killed one person so far, with 41 patients reported in Wuhan.

Hong Kong authorities on Tuesday said several dozen people had been hospitalised with fever or respiratory symptoms after travelling to Wuhan, but no cases of the new virus have so far been confirmed.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bwk134/article30578573.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH16JAPAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/japan-reports-case-of-mystery-virus/article30578574.ece
39,2020/01/17,Trump impeachment trial opens as watchdog faults White House on Ukraine,"The Senate impeachment trial on whether to remove U.S. President Donald Trump from office formally began on January 16 even as a congressional watchdog found that the White House broke the law by withholding security aid for Ukraine approved by Congress.

The assessment from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) was a setback for Mr. Trump, but it was unclear if it would figure in his trial in the Republican-led Senate given that key questions such as whether witnesses will testify or new evidence will be considered remain unanswered.

Democrat Adam Schiff, who heads a team of seven House of Representatives members who will serve as prosecutors, appeared on the Senate floor to read the two charges passed by the House on Dec. 18 that accused Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress arising from his dealings with Ukraine.

Chief Justice John Roberts, wearing his black judicial robe, took an oath to preside over the trial and then swore in the assembled senators who will serve as jurors. Roberts instructed them to raise their right hand, asking, “Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?”

The 99 senators present signed their assent one by one. One senator - Republican Jim Inhofe - was in his home state of Oklahoma to be with a family member facing a medical issue, according to his office, but was due to sign next week.

The Senate is expected to acquit Mr. Trump, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two-thirds majority. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.

Opening statements were due to start on January 21.

The abuse of power cited in the House articles of impeachment included Mr. Trump’s withholding of $391 million in security aid for Ukraine, a move Democrats have said was aimed at pressuring Kiev into investigating political rival Joe Biden, the president's possible opponent in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.

Congress had approved the funds to help Ukraine combat Russia-backed separatists. The money was ultimately provided in September after the controversy had spilled into public view.

“Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,” the GAO said on January 16, referring to the fact that Congress had voted to appropriate the funds.

The GAO's findings are not legally binding, but its reports are seen by lawmakers as objective, reliable and generally uncontested. It has no prosecutorial power.

A pivotal event leading to the impeachment was a July 25 call in which he asked Ukraine's president to investigate Mr. Biden and his son Hunter over unsubstantiated allegations of corruption and to look into a discredited theory promoted by Mr. Trump's allies that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016 U.S. election.

Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who sought the GAO investigation, said the findings undercut Republican claims that there was nothing wrong with Mr. Trump's action.

“The GAO is an independent, nonpartisan entity calling the balls and strikes as they see them,” he told Reuters. “Republican senators and the administration may try to dismiss it. But we now have a clear, lucid finding that the Trump administration violated the law and we know that the president ordered the administration to commit an illegal act.”

Witnesses or no witnesses

This is only the third impeachment trial in U.S. history and no president has been removed as a direct result of the process. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before the full House could vote to impeach him. The House impeached Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998, but the Senate did not convict them.

Crucial to how long the trial lasts is whether the Senate will consider new evidence and hear from witnesses, support for which is divided largely along party lines, though some Republican senators seemed open to the idea on January 16.

Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a news conference the GAO's conclusion “reinforces - again - the need for documents and eyewitnesses in the Senate.”

Mr. Schiff indicated that the House prosecutors are considering calling Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, if the Senate permits testimony in the trial.

Mr. Giuliani has said Mr. Parnas, a Ukraine-born U.S. citizen, helped him in investigating the Bidens. Documents released this week indicate Parnas was also involved in monitoring the movements of former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch before Mr. Trump removed her in May.

In an interview with MSNBC aired on Wednesday, Mr. Parnas said he was acting on Mr. Trump's directions: “President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all of my movements.”

An arm of Congress, the GAO is viewed as a top auditing agency for the federal government that advises lawmakers and various government entities on how taxpayer dollars are spent.

Its report said that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a president unilateral authority to withhold funds in the way that Mr. Trump did. Instead, a president has a “strictly circumscribed authority” to withhold spending only in limited circumstances expressly provided by law. Holding up money for a policy reason, which the Trump administration did in this case, is not permitted, the report said.

Republican Senator John Cornyn said that while there may have been a civil violation of the law, it was not a criminal matter and certainly not an impeachable act.

“The Constitution says you impeach presidents for treason, bribery, and high crimes and misdemeanors. And it's none of those things,” said Mr. Cornyn, a former judge, after taking the oath. “That's what it is, a civil violation of the Impoundment Act,” Cornyn added, mentioning the relevant federal law.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/a3gmys/article30580475.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TRUMPIMPEACHMENT-THNAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-impeachment-trial-opens-as-watchdog-faults-white-house-on-ukraine/article30580476.ece

43,2020/01/17,Facebook not to sell ads on WhatsApp: Report,"Facebook has reportedly decided not to sell ads on WhatsApp, a controversial plan that forced Brian Acton and Jan Koum, who founded the mobile messaging service, to quit nearly two years ago.

According to a The Wall Street Journal report, WhatsApp in recent months disbanded a team that had been established to find the best ways to integrate ads into the service.

“The team’s work was then deleted from WhatsApp’s code,” the report added, quoting people familiar with the matter.

There was no official statement from Facebook on the report.

WhatsApp co-founder Acton left the company in 2017, and CEO Jan Koum in August, over their differences with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who aimed to monetise on WhatsApp by introducing ads between chats.

Both Acton and Koum never wanted WhatsApp to become a platform full of ads.

In an earlier interview with Forbes, Acton explained that a disagreement on monetising WhatsApp was the reason he quit Facebook and gave up $850 million on the table.

“At the end of the day, I sold my company. I sold my users’ privacy. I made a choice and a compromise. I live with that every day,” Acton said.

44,2020/01/17,Women protesters are taking to the streets en masse to fight the CAA and police brutality,"Women. Suddenly, they are visible. Great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, teenagers, baby girls. They have slowly but surely reclaimed a corner of a public ground and pitched their tent. They have also reclaimed a tiny but visible corner of a balcony in a crowded shopping area where a hoarding has been placed and young children draw.

The protesting women have reclaimed a road — forcing the traffic to steer to the other side. This is Road No. 13A, in Shaheen Bagh, nestled deep in the belly of South Delhi, where houses are so densely packed that daylight struggles to make its way in. All around you are tiny shops and houses. The women under the tent have refused to budge, come rain or storm. It is a Gandhian satyagraha on display — peaceful, assertive, relentless and in its fourth week. The men don’t enter their space unless they are invited. They stand on the sidelines. “Hum yahin pe theek hain” (we are okay here), says a young man who has come from Muzaffarnagar. People looking for a religious sign or specific attire to stereotype a community, will find instead a proliferation of colours and a diversity of religions here. Ambedkar is back where he belongs. Amongst his people. So is Gandhi, and so is the tricolour.

On the evening of December 15, when the Delhi Police, which reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs, entered the Jamia Millia Islamia university campus, 2 km from Shaheen Bagh, and began to lathi charge the students, the mothers stepped out, appalled by the violence they saw on television screens inside their homes. “There was no tent that day but we decided to come out for the sake of our children,” says Sameena Khan. The tent came a day later. She says softly, “You banned notes. We didn’t say anything. You spelt out your verdict on Babri Masjid. We kept silent. Then, you attacked our children. That’s when we decided to come out. Our fight is not with the government, but we are citizens of this country along with everyone else.”

Here to stay

Sameena has been coming to Shaheen Bagh every day since December 16. Nothing seems to dampen the spirits of the women. They say in unison that the fight is for their children. “I will be gone in a few years when my maker summons me. But what about them,” asks Sarvari, who has been on a hunger strike. Saina, 33, quickly finishes her housework to reach Shaheen Bagh. Last Saturday, she came with buckets of soup. “I cannot stay at home when all of this happening,” she says. “My feet bring me here.”

Somebody has brought boiled eggs, someone else mathri (a savoury). Tea flows like water, made continuously by some mysterious persons. It’s a relay strike the likes of which the government has not seen before. Women finish their housework and come to the spot, relieving their sisters who must head home to complete their chores. None of them has ever done anything like this before. Cops stand in anticipation of trouble — one odd stone hurled could bring matters to a boil, allowing them to retaliate. But it doesn’t happen. And the women keep a close watch.

They are disappointed that nobody from the government has visited them, heard them, or spoken to them, but they are not discouraged. They have a simple question: if the PAN card is no longer proof of identity, if the passport is no longer proof, if ration cards are not accepted, and if Aadhaar has no value — what will convince the government of our Indianness?

The women of Shaheen Bagh are not alone. Across the country, women are coming out of homes and coming out of purdah to take to the streets. Significantly, they have the support of their families to do so. And their numbers are only growing.

Sitting amidst hundreds of people at a protest at Bengaluru’s Town Hall, 25-year-old Nidhi (name changed) is earnestly scribbling notes, jotting down the names of speakers. As an employee of a private company, this kind of involvement is novel and exhilarating. “I want to be better informed about these issues. I also want to connect people who want to be involved but don’t have any information,” she says. Over the past few weeks, she has been a part of five protests in the city, besides attending meetings and talks.

Nidhi admits that it has been a “struggle” convincing her family that the law is discriminatory and that she needs to register her protest. “My parents don’t live here, and have no idea that I participate,” she says. Nidhi and her colleagues are trying to negotiate with their HR team so that they can attend protests and work additional hours to compensate. “I want to show up because this is a devastating threat to so many marginalised communities,” says Nidhi.

I am not alone

Homemaker Vidya Narayan felt compelled to step out because she has been “extremely uneasy and disturbed” by the CAA. “Nobody around me was as disturbed as I was. There was nobody I could reach out to; and then I read a forward about a protest and called my friend and told her to join me.”

Since that first protest, there has been no looking back. She has been at more than eight protests so far. What motivates her? “I teach my children values like secularism and equality. With the present turn of events, it is as though I am telling my children to become good players on a pitch filled with thorns. I believe it is my duty to fight so that my children have a better future.” She tries to return home by the time her children are back from school, but she has also taken them to two protests. “I am glad my children are able to see that they have to fight for the rights that we sometimes take for granted.”

Mallige is with Mahila Munnade, a women’s rights organisation. She has been an activist for two decades now. Mallige says that the large number of women coming out for the anti-CAA protests reflects an accumulated anger and frustration; an undercurrent neither identified nor acknowledged by any political party. “Besides, social media and messaging platforms have made it possible to make connections,” she says. Among Muslims, there has been encouragement to get organised and to take part. It is an indication of the “upward mobility of women in the socio-economic as well as the political spheres.” Women are more ambitious and assertive now, and ready to fight for their rights, says Mallige.

When Bob Dylan sang ‘The Times They Are a-Changin’’ in the 60s, it was prophetic. Decades later, it is the women in Hyderabad who, as the bard put it, are shaking windows and rattling walls. They have been central in organising the guerilla Hyderabad flash mobs against CAA. On January 4, they converged in enormous numbers at the ‘Million March’, assembling within minutes of the attack by masked men on JNU students. All this, while juggling family and career and tackling patriarchy.

Arshiya Sayeed, architect and first-time protester, is discreet about who in her family she shares her protest plans with. “The government’s obnoxious move is to disenfranchise an already marginalised community. It is an institutionalised way of keeping Muslims out of spaces where they can develop an opinion or get a leadership role,” she says.

It was January 5, a day after the ‘Million March’. Khalida Parveen, 64, a social activist, was returning from Nirmal, a town in Telangana, when her WhatsApp began to be inundated with images of the violence at JNU. “Within 30 minutes, around 50 people reached the Ambedkar statue and we staged a protest for three hours. For me, these protests are not about one community. They are to save the country and its pluralistic nature,” says Khalida.

We are all Indian

So, what is it about these protests that has propelled women, especially Muslim women, to the streets? “See, this is not a community-specific issue. It is not about reservations, or triple talaq or Muslim personal law. It is about the very existence of Indians and the Constitution. If the Constitution is safe, so are Muslims, Hindus and Christians. The government has put the burden of proof on India’s citizens. That is why you see so many first-time protesters across communities and walks of life,” says Khalida.

A week after the JNU unrest, the United Muslim Action Committee, a body of faith leaders, gave a call for a ‘Tiranga Rally’. Tens of thousands responded, including many women. Saira Fatima, at the head of a contingent of women protesters, arrived at the vast Mir Alam Eidgah grounds with her mother, sisters, and cousins. The cause, she says, has united family. “The whole family, including my father, is here. This is a question of wajood (existence). Given these laws, tell us where will we go? To Pakistan or Afghanistan? We are Indians. We have everything here,” she says.

Holding aloft a ‘No CAA, No NRC, No NPR’ placard, Sumaira Syed, an MBA graduate and first-time protester, says, “This protest is not about being Hindu or Muslim. It is about equality. The Citizenship Bill should not have been passed. Every protest is important.”

We are at Mumbai’s Azad Maidan. The thousand-odd protesters are buzzing with excitement and solidarity. One speaker finishes his speech and passes the mic to a simply dressed young woman. She steps up, smiling slightly. The crowd cheers.

“CAA Murdabaad!” her voice rings out.

“Murdabaad! Murdabaad!” the crowd roars back.

This is Suvarna Salve, a member of Samta Kala Manch’s cultural wing, who has been part of the Ambedkarite movement for the past decade. “I am a singer and I have been singing songs about the struggles of revolutionaries like Ambedkar, Savitribai Phule and Bhagat Singh. The protests are an immediate reaction to something happening to someone else. It is our empathy, as women, that has brought us out of the door,” says Suvarna.

In Mumbai too, women have been at the forefront, putting their homes and jobs on hold for the cause. Lawyer and activist Lara Jesani says, “Women value human rights more because they have often been denied them in history. The CAA not only creates a communal divide but also is first going to impact women. Due to entrenched patriarchy, many young women are denied documents because their families believe they will soon get married anyway and their in-laws will take care of it. They often don’t have property documents even where they own land.”

Lara is a member of organisations like Mumbai Against CAB and Hum Bharat Ke Log, which have been organising protests in Mumbai. Sandhya Gokhale, a member of the Forum Against Oppression of Women, is busy organising resistance activities and meetings. Several others, not physically on the ground, have taken it upon themselves to keep the word alive, through tweets and posts and Insta shares. They are offering safe spaces, food, chargers and more.

Just like the fabulous women of Shaheen Bagh, women everywhere are simply digging their heels in. And that alone is a shout out for everyone to join them. The score so far: Women 1, Government 0.

45,2020/01/17,Simple but effective style,"A former botany professor and author of many books on the subject which are text books for several Universities around the country, Prof. K N Rao has taken upon the task of spreading Telugu literature worldwide by translating into English, select works of eminent and up-and-coming Telugu writers.

His mission was started at the age of 87 in 2011 during the centenary celebrations of Telugu short story. With his personal resources, Rao had brought out four volumes of the English translations of popular Telugu short stories written by various eminent authors. With his indomitable spirit, at 95, Rao brought out his fifth book titled, Moisture Trapped in a Stone.

Twenty eight stories from 17 authors — both veterans and new age writers — feature in this book, with themes ranging from the everyday lives of common people to societal issues, dealt with seriousness as well as satire and light banter. Rao’s forte was writing the critical issues in simple and effective style. It is interesting to note that the works of nine women writers find place in the book which was edited by Gita Rajan. The highlight is the glossary given at the end of the book with meanings in English for the Telugu idioms used in their stories by the original writers like veterans Madhuranthakam Rajaram, Ravi Sastri, Rentala Nageswara Rao, Kethu Viswanatha Reddy, Vasundhara, Kalipatnam Rama Rao, Mohammad Khadeer Babu, Kalyana Sundari Jagannath, Vasireddy Seetadevi, D Kameswari, Dwivedula Visalakshi, Volga, Jalandhara and the new-age writers like Radhika Nori, B Geetika, Kolipaka Ramamani.

As Mini Krishnan has written in her foreword, “This book has the power to reverse the condescending description of Telugu as ‘the Italian of the East’ and make people say ‘English is the Telugu of the West.’",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/5edmx1/article30586206.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf03MLNjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/simple-but-effective-style/article30586207.ece
46,2020/01/17,The sort of police deployment you see now is unprecedented: Sitaram Yechury,"CPI(M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury was president of the JNU Students’ Union in the post-Emergency period, and earned the distinction of obtaining former PM Indira Gandhi’s resignation as chancellor of the university. He speaks to The Hindu about his time at the university, and compares the Emergency era with today’s situation. Edited excerpts:

What were your first impressions of JNU when you enrolled as a young student?

My first impression was that the atmosphere was very free. The teachers expected us to address them by their first names. They encouraged all of us to be more creative, not to mug up the syllabus, but to go out and read. In fact, in my entrance interview, there were three very senior professors. Suddenly one them asked, “Do you smoke?” I said yes, so he said, “Then light one up.”

In 1975, two years after you started at JNU, Emergency was declared. What was life on campus like in the two years that followed?

Protests began in JNU the very day after the Emergency was announced. The vice-chancellor banned the students’ union, but we resisted, saying that the union was not part of the university’s statutes and thus could not be banned. Then came the admission season in July. As far as I can recollect now, 13 students were denied admission on political grounds despite their being academically qualified. So we held a big protest against that. The administration took action and rusticated a few of us. We then held a three-day strike against this action. It was the first instance anywhere in the country of students going on strike against the Emergency.

On the second day of the strike, Delhi Police entered the campus in civvies. Maneka Gandhi (then Maneka Anand), who was enrolled at JNU’s School of Languages, had been prevented from entering, which riled the police. They came to the School’s gate in order to arrest D.P. Tripathi, the student union president. As he had a beard at the time, the police arrested the first bearded person they found — Prabir Purkayastha! It was like a scene out of a Hindi film. The police Ambassador car raced out of the campus with its doors open, and one constable fell out. We took him to our makeshift office and gave him a thrashing! Within 20 minutes, the Police Commissioner had arrived, brandishing a gun. The police then came at midnight and surrounded our hostels, but instead of gheraoing the Periyar boys’ hostel where most of us were, they stood outside the women’s hostel, and rounded up 67 people from the other boys’ hostel. We had to use a lot of tricks to escape.

So was JNU shut down during the Emergency?

No, the academic work was not disrupted, although the vice-chancellor became more loyal than the king. Anybody found distributing pamphlets or protesting was rusticated or suspended. So we formed a group, ‘Resistance’. Distributing the pamphlets was a big job — all the hostels were under watch. Munirka at that time was a small village with only one cyclostyle shop. So we would go there in the middle of the night, wake up the shopkeeper, get the pamphlets copied, and smuggle them into the campus.

How does the situation on campus during the Emergency compare to today’s situation?

It’s much worse today. The sort of police deployment you see now is unprecedented.

Your greatest achievement as JNUSU president was obtaining Indira Gandhi’s resignation as chancellor of the University.

In October 1977, we launched a big agitation to “punish the guilty,” which included vice-chancellor B.D. Nag Chaudhary and chancellor Indira Gandhi. The day of the strike, we were standing at the administration gate when the VC’s car came in. I went up to it and stopped him from entering the campus. Very politely, I told him, “Sir, the university is out of bounds for you.” He turned the car around and went off. Then the orders came for sine die (indefinite) closure of the university, but the students and faculty together ensured that it continued to function as usual. The library was open 24 hours, all classes were held and the mess was running. This went on for about 40 days. There was a shortage of money. I remember, we sent students out to Sarojini Nagar market and Connaught Place with placards around their necks that read, “University is functioning, the VC is on strike” to collect money to run the university. Then we decided to broaden our agitation and demand the resignation of chancellor Indira Gandhi, who was holding on to the post even after her defeat in the Lok Sabha elections. So 500 of us marched to her house. Her aide said only five of us could go in to meet her. But when we insisted, she herself came out. We read out our resolution to her, which was full of litanies, but she heard us out stoically. I handed over the resolution to her and she took it politely too. She resigned a couple of days later.

On January 5, we saw masked goons enter the campus, with rods in their hands. In all these years, have you ever witnessed or heard of such an incident in JNU?

This kind of thing has never happened before, not even during the Emergency. It was a pre-planned attack — they knew which rooms to attack. Once in a while, outsiders may have entered and created a ruckus, but we have never seen such mass violence.

Why do you think JNU has been a target for the BJP government from day one?

It’s their mission to convert the secular, democratic Republic of India into a Hindu rashtra. For that project to succeed people have to accept it. And that acceptance can only come when you replace rationality with the irrationality, when you actually assault reason. JNU is singled out because of its critical approach to everything. The Congress party established JNU thinking it would produce a thinktank for the Indian ruling classes; on the contrary, it has produced the most reasoned critique of the ruling classes.

The ruling party claims that the recent events are the natural corollary to the Left’s domination of academic circles and squeezing out of everyone who doesn’t subscribe to their ideology.

If the Left ever dominated, it did so because of its reasoning and academia’s acceptance of the people. The Left was not making appointments or inducting people into universities. Reasoning it out with the Left and proving that they are wrong is the way to exercise your hegemony, not through this sort of goondaism.

Is the VC’s resignation the only cure for JNU?

It is an important element in the process of cure. The manner in which the entire administration has been sought to be infiltrated, and the authoritarian manner in which it is functioning, is crippling JNU. For three hours, the masked goons had a free run. Why were the police not called when we know for a fact that they were standing outside the gates?",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/nw3kdy/article30585926.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19SMsitaramjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/the-sort-of-police-deployment-you-see-now-is-unprecedented-sitaram-yechury/article30585927.ece
47,2020/01/17,GM to sell Talegaon plant to Great Wall Motors,"In a move to completely pull out of India after a disastrous performance, American automobile major General Motors (GM) has entered into an agreement with China’s Great Wall Motors (GWM) to sell its manufacturing facility at Talegaon near Pune for an unspecified amount.

The proposed deal is subject to requisite government and regulatory approvals.

Under a binding term sheet signed on Thursday, the GM India legal entity, which includes the Talegaon facility, will be transferred to GWM.

In 2017, GM stopped production and sale of its cars in India and sold its first factory at Halol in Gujarat to Chinese auto major SAIC, which is now manufacturing its Morris Garages (MG) range of vehicles in India, namely MG Hector.

In September 2019, GM India signed an agreement with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to transfer its Bengaluru based technology centre along with 1300 employees.

And now the Talegaon plant its sole asset and the Indian legal entity is being sold to Great Wall Motors which has ambitious plans to enter the Indian market with a big bang.

Liu Xiangshang, V-P, global strategy, Great Wall Motors, said the transaction would underpin the company’s plan to enter and invest in India.

“The Indian market has great potential, rapid economic growth and a good investment environment. Entering the Indian market is an important step for Great Wall Motors’ global strategy,” said Mr. Xiangshang.

“It is also an important measure to respond positively to the Indian government’s national strategy of vigorously advocatingMake In India, Digital India and a ‘strong focus on clean energy in India’ and building a new India vision,” he said.

“Great Wall Motors’ investment will create more jobs, including direct and indirect employment, further enhancing the skill level in the auto industry; promote the development of the local supply chain, R&D and related industries; and contribute more profits and taxes to the government of India and the government of Maharashtra,” Mr. Xiangshang added.

He said Great Wall Motors will officially debut its Haval brand and GWM EV at the Delhi International Auto Show, and launch its Indian market plan.

The outright purchase of GM’s plant will enable the Chinese company to have an immediate head start and it can roll out its products without waiting for another two years to build a new plant. Great Wall Motor has booked 3,500 sq.meters space to showcase its vehicles in the auto show.

Julian Blissett, senior V-P, International Operations, GM said the Talegaon manufacturing facility had delivered excellent vehicles for domestic and export markets.

“Since focusing the Talegaon plant on manufacturing for export markets in 2017, GM has been exploring strategic options for the better utilization of the site,” Mr Blissett said.

“Our decision to cease production at Talegaon is based on GM’s global strategy and optimisation of our manufacturing footprint around the world,” Julian Blissett, Senior Vice President, International Operations, GM, said in a statement.

“On behalf of GM, I also want to express our gratitude to the government of Maharashtra and the government of India for their supportive partnership ever since we began to make investments and build cars in India. We will work closely with the state and national governments to secure the required approvals so that GWM can elevate production at the plant even further and maintain Talegaon’s status as a vibrant vehicle manufacturing region,” he added.

GM will provide a separation package and transition support for impacted employees, as well as an orderly transition for partners. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020.

Since 2017, GM has been manufacturing Chevrolet Beat which is exported to markets in Latin America and this will soon stop.

GM said Chevrolet will continue to honour all warranties and provide after-sales support, including ongoing service and parts requirements for existing customers in India.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/i0eba4/article30589105.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18THBUGM,https://www.thehindu.com/business/gm-to-sell-talegaon-plant-to-great-wall-motors/article30589107.ece
48,2020/01/17,Amazon to create 1 mn new jobs in India by 2025: Bezos,"American multinational Amazon has announced plans to create 1 million new jobs in India by 2025 through continued investments in technology, infrastructure and its logistics network, the company said.

It said jobs which will be created both directly and indirectly, will be across industries such as information technology, skill development, content creation, retail, logistics, and manufacturing. This will be in addition to the 7 lakh jobs the company has enabled in India over the last six years.

“We are investing to create a million new jobs here in India over the next five years,” Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. He said that Amazon India would also add 10,000 electric rickshaws to its electric fleet. “We have seen huge contributions from our employees, extraordinary creativity from the small businesses we have partnered with, and great enthusiasm from the customers who shop with us.” He had, on Wednesday, said the firm would invest $1 billion to help bring 10 million traders and micro, small, and medium-sized businesses across India online, enabling $10 billion in cumulative exports by 2025.

The company said the Centre had prioritised job creation and skilling initiatives, including the training of more than 400 million people by 2022, in rural and urban areas. On this front, it would be committed to job creation and investment in traders and MSMEs.

It would complement these social inclusion and social mobility efforts by creating more opportunities for people in India to find employment, build skills, and expand entrepreneurship opportunities, it said.

Amazon’s investments will help create new jobs in hiring talent to fill roles across Amazon in India, including software development engineering, cloud computing, content creation, and customer support.

Since 2014, the American company has grown its employee base more than four times, and last year inaugurated its new campus building in Hyderabad, Amazon’s first fully-owned campus outside the United States and the largest building globally in terms of employees (15,000) and space (9.5 acres).

The fresh investment would support Amazon’s operations in India in areas like logistics, engineering and facilities management, packaging, and customer fulfillment. Amazon’s operations network has created inclusive job opportunities across the country, including hundreds of associates with hearing and speech impairment at its fulfilment centres, sortation stations, and delivery stations. Amazon also has an all-woman delivery station, along with a pilot internship program for individuals with autism and intellectual disabilities.

The company said it would invest to expand growth opportunities for the more than 550,000 traders and micro, small, and medium-sized businesses, including local shops through programs like Saheli, Karigar, and “I Have Space” and creating more ways for MSMEs to learn about digitising their businesses by investing US$ 1billion to bring 10 million new Indian businesse online.

50,2020/01/17,"RIL profit surges 13.5% on retail, telecom","Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) reported a 13.5% growth in its third quarter net profit to ₹11,640 crore, led by growth in consumer driven businesses of retail and telecommunications, even as petrochemicals, the core business, disappointed.

The profit came on a 1.4% drop in revenue to ₹1,68,858 crore due to a fall in revenue from refining and petrochemicals business.

Telecommunications and retail contributed 37% of the company’s earnings before interest, tax deprciation and amortisation (EBITDA), up from 27% last year.

Refining margins rise

Gross refining margins (GRMs) stood at $9.2 per barrel compared with GRMs of $8.8 per barrel in the year- ago period. This commands a 11-year-high premium of $7.6 per barrel over the regional benchmark, Singapore margins.

Mukesh Ambani, CMD, RIL, said, “The third quarter results for our energy business reflects the weak global economic environment and volatility in energy markets. Within our O2C chain, downstream petrochemicals profitability was impacted by weak margins across products with subdued demand in well-supplied markets.Refining segment performance improved in a difficult operating environment given our continuous focus on cost positions, high operating rates and product placement.”

EBIT from core business of refining grew 11.9% to ₹5,657 crore, petrochemicals EBIT fell 28.5% to ₹5,880 crore and oil and gas exploration and production reported a negative EBIT of ₹366 crore. On the consumer front, he said, “We saw consistent same-store sales growth and record footfalls across our stores driven by our compelling proposition of great shopping experience and superior value.

“Jio is expanding network capacity and coverage to keep pace with demand. We are making good progress on the value-unlocking initiatives announced earlier while building on sustainable growth platforms for our shareholders.”

On the deal with Saudi Aramco, Srikanth Venkatachari, joint CFO, RIL said, “Talks are on and it’s progressing well. It’s a large deal and won’t happen by the end of this fiscal.”

Reliance Retail reported a 58% growth in EBIT to ₹2,389 crore while Reliance Jio reported a 63.3% growth in its EBIT to ₹3,857 crore.

During the quarter, RIL invested ₹1,65,000 crore in Jio Platforms Ltd. (JPL) through optionally convertible preference shares (OCPS) and ₹4,961 crore in equity shares. JPL further acquired RIL’s investment of ₹64,450 crore in RJIL.

When asked for comments, investment adviser S. P. Tulsian told The Hindu, “Barring petrochemicals, [these are] excellent results from Reliance. The consumer-facing businesses are driving the show for the company. I anticipate, by end of this year, RIL will have market capitalisation exceeding ₹13 lakh crore from the ₹10 lakh crore now.”

The stock of the company closed at $1,451.70 on Thursday, taking the value to $1 trillion.

iPhone maker Apple was the first U.S. company to hit the $1 trillion threshold in 2018.

According to CNBC, analysts are bullish on the company’s newly appointed CEO Pichai.

Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin announced plans to step down in December last year, elevating Pichai as both Alphabet and Google CEO.

52,2020/01/17,Jet Airways to sell Netherlands business to KLM,"Bankrupt Jet Airways plans to sell its Netherlands business to KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, according to a regulatory filing.

The domestic full-service carrier, which shuttered operations last April, is undergoing insolvency resolution process.

The insolvency resolution professional managing the affairs of Jet Airways said various options are being explored for the “company’s resolution and maximising the value for its stakeholders”, as per the filing on Friday.

Providing an update, the company said there is a separate liquidation proceeding ongoing in the Netherlands and that the resolution professional has agreed a co-operation protocol with the Dutch trustee appointed by the local court.

“In this context, the company and Dutch trustee have entered into a conditional sale and purchase agreement with Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij NV, on January 13, 2020, for the proposed resolution of business activities of the company in the Netherlands as approved by the committee of creditors,” it added.

Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij NV is KLM, the flagship carrier of the Netherlands.

“The proposed resolution is subject to the completion of several conditions including statutory and regulatory clearances, both under Indian law and Dutch laws,” the filing said.

If completed, the transaction would only involve a sale of part of the Jet Airways business activities and would not impact the shareholding pattern of the company in any manner, it added.

Shares of Jet Airways were trading 4.92 per cent lower than their previous close on BSE at Rs 45.40 apiece.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/p1titz/article30583094.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/JETAIRWAYS-DEBTCOURT,https://www.thehindu.com/business/jet-airways-to-sell-netherlands-business-to-klm/article30583058.ece
53,2020/01/17,"Doubling Prime Video investment in India, says Jeff Bezos","Amazon’s global CEO Jeff Bezos says Amazon Prime Video is performing in India brilliantly, adding that they have decided to double down the investment for the streaming service in the country.

“It’s working great. The number of hours Prime Video is watched in India in the last two years has grown by six times. Prime Video is working well all over the world, and there is no place it is doing better than in India. It’s incredible,” Bezos said when asked by actor Shah Rukh Khan and Zoya Akhtar about the performance of the streaming giant in India at a starry event here.

“It’s good in terms of business as well. We also like the business results because it drives people to join Prime, and once they join they enjoy the fast shipping service, so they also buy a lot of products from us. So it’s a vehicle to make fantastic content, from the business point of view, as well. We have actually just made a decision to double down our Prime Video investments here in India,” he added.

Answering SRK on what changes he has seen in India in his various visits over the years, Bezos said that he has been visiting India for 11 years.

“There are no perceptible changes of any great magnitude. I noticed there are certain things that seem to me to be the same. And I love those things, one of the things I notice every time I come here is that there’s so much energy here and dynamism,” he added.

From drama, crime, suspense to thriller, Amazon Prime will be coming with diverse projects this year. Filmmaker Kabir Khan’s The Forgotten Army: Azaadi Ke Liye, Abhishek Bachchan’s Breathe 2, musical Bandish Bandits, Manoj Bajpayee’s The Family Man 2 and Pankaj Tripathi, Ali Fazal, Rasika Duggal’s Mirzapur 2 are some of the projects in the pipeline.

When Shah Rukh asked Bezos when was the last time he visited a grocery store, he responded: “I visited a small ‘kirana’ store today. It was an incredible experience.”

Bezos, who is ranked amongst top global billionaires, was on a three-day India visit starting from Tuesday.

In a major announcement showing Amazon’s support for Indian MSMEs, Bezos said that the company would invest $1 billion in digitising small and medium businesses (SMBs) on its platform in the country. He said that the 21st century will be the century of India.

“I predict that the 21st century is going to be the Indian century,” he said, adding that apart from the dynamism it has, India is a democracy, which is a major characteristic of the country.

Along with business, he is taking time out to explore the country.

The special leave petition against the December 19 dismissal was filed through advocate A.P. Singh. A five-judge Bench of the Supreme Court led by Justice N.V. Ramana had, earlier this week, rejected the curative petitions of two other Nirbhaya death row convicts, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh. On Friday, the President rejected Mukesh’s mercy plea.

55,2020/01/17,"Arbitrary Internet shutdowns violate fundamental rights, says plea in SC","Arbitrary and unreasonable Internet shutdowns by the government is a violation of the fundamental rights to information, education and free speech protected by the Constitution, said a petition filed in the Supreme Court on Friday. The petition filed by Ehtesham Hashmi, a Supreme Court advocate, said that access to Internet should be a fundamental right.

The petition said there were more than 100 instances of Internet shutdowns in 2019.

“Right to access internet is a fundamental right under right to education and the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution. Suspension and shutdown of the Internet and communication services is an infringement of the freedom and rights guaranteed and safeguarded under Articles 19 and 21,” the petition filed by Ehtesham Hashmi, a Supreme Court advocate, contended.

Mr. Hashmi’s petition comes shortly after the Supreme Court declared in a judgment in the Anuradha Bhasin case challenging the Jammu and Kashmir restrictions that free speech and expression on the Internet was a fundamental right and constitutionally protected under Article 19.

However, the judgment authored by Justice Ramana, restrained from delving into the question whether right to access Internet is a fundamental right under the Constitution.

It is this question which Mr. Hashmi’s petition brings to fore when he argues that access to Internet is merged with manifold fundamental rights like education, information, communication, free speech and expression, health among others.

He referred to how the country saw such shutdowns during the CAA protests.

Maximum shutdowns

Mr. Hashmi said the court should clearly declare arbitrary Internet shutdowns by the State as illegal. The court should also issue guidelines to prevent unreasonable and arbitrary shutdowns under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.

The petition said India has the maximum number of Internet shutdowns in the world. Between January 2012 and April 2018, the country has recorded 172 shutdowns across 19 States. The duration of the shutdowns vary from less than 24 hours to more than 72 hours, mode of restriction included restrictions on mobile, fixed line both the modes of connecting to Internet services.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/usc8or/article30588824.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17KASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/arbitrary-internet-shutdowns-violate-fundamental-rights-says-plea-in-sc/article30588825.ece
56,2020/01/17,"Citizens can skip question on place of birth of parents in NPR form, says Centre","Officials of non-BJP-ruled States on Friday asked the Registrar General of India (RGI) to remove the column on “place of birth of mother and father” in the proposed National Population Register (NPR) to be updated simultaneously with the Census exercise in April-September.

The RGI and the Home Ministry had convened a day-long conference to discuss the modalities to be adopted during the house-listing phase of Census 2021 and the NPR.

During the meeting, presentations were given on the objectives of the Census and the NPR exercises and their benefits and on the use of mobile app, which will be used in the Census for the first time.

RGI and other Home Ministry officials told the State representatives that respondents could skip the questions in NPR if they wanted and answering them was not mandatory but ‘voluntary’, a senior government official said.

West Bengal and Kerala, citing maintenance of ‘public order’ had earlier told the RGI that the NPR exercise should be halted.

Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy said no one will be pressured to collect details for the NPR.

“No documents are required to be shown by people during the NPR and Census exercise. People can give the details they want to. NPR should not be linked to the National Register of Citizens (NRC),” Mr. Reddy said.

The conference was inaugurated by Union Minister of State for Home Nityanand Rai.

Rajasthan Chief Secretary D.B. Gupta who attended the meeting said, “Many State governments objected to the new fields (in NPR) particularly the place of birth of parents. This is impractical. Sometimes in villages and even in cities people are not aware about their own place of birth. What is the purpose and objective of adding such a column? We asked them (Home Ministry) to remove the column. The Ministry officials replied that it was not mandatory for the respondents to provide information. If he or she wants they could deny or say that they are not aware. They cannot be forced to respond.”

The conference was attended by Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla, chief secretaries and census directors of many States.

A few States were represented by principal secretaries, instead of the chief secretary. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had announced that the State will skip the meeting but an official attended the session.

Mr. Rai said the data collected in the Census will help the country in framing policies for the welfare of the people.

57,2020/01/17,"Russia, China diverge on Kashmir issue","Russia and China gave divergent views on the Kashmir issue two days after the UN Security Council discussed the current status of the region.

Addressing the Indian media here, Russian envoy Nikolay Kudashev argued that Moscow considers Kashmir to be a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan, but an official of the China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasised the role of multilateral diplomacy in resolving the lingering issue.

“We were not in favour of bringing Kashmir to UN Security Council. It’s a bilateral matter between India and Pakistan,” Ambassador Kudashev said in his interaction with journalists here.

The crucial UN forum on Wednesday discussed the current situation in Kashmir where normal life has remained suspended since India ended the region’s special status on August 5, 2019

The drive to discuss the Valley was mainly boosted by China which worked in coordination with Pakistan to highlight the issue internationally. Under pressure from Beijing, UNSC met twice in the last six months to discuss it.

India urged China on Thursday to “refrain” from similar moves in the future.

The difference between the Russian and Chinese positions is evident from the fact that the Russian ambassador emphasised the ‘bilateral’ nature of the dispute but the Chinese highlighted the role of past UNSC resolutions while including bilateral Indo-Pak treaties in the formula.

Geng Shuang, Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Beijing said, China has a ‘consistent’ position on Kashmir. “During this review most Security Council members expressed concern on the current situation, called for restraint and de-escalation,” Mr. Geng said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/cmaxng/article30588671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/russiajpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/russia-china-diverge-on-kashmir-issue/article30588670.ece
58,2020/01/17,"Amit Shah, not Modi, running the show, says Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel","Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel talks to The Hindu about his government’s decision to challenge the NIA Act, his protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the divergent stand of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah on the issue.

What was the immediate provocation to challenge the NIA Act, a legislation which was brought in during the Congress-led UPA era?

Yes, the Congress government had brought in this legislation, but it was not brought in as an instrument to misuse and intimidate State governments run by other political parties. The BJP government has been misusing all investigating agencies from CBI, ED, DRI and even the Income Tax department.

We are seeing nationwide protests against the CAA and NRC. Do you believe that these protests have the potential to be the nemesis of the Narendra Modi government?

The entire country is anguished by the fact that they will have to prove that they are really the citizens of this country. There can be no bigger insult than this. And secondly, the PM and Home Minister are taking different lines on the issue which proves that all is not well between them. Mota Bhai (PM Modi, Mota in Gujarati means elder brother) in Ram Lila Maidan claims that NRC will not be implemented. While Chota Bhai (Home Minister Amit Shah) in Rajasthan asserts that the government will not back down even by an inch. This is essentially the fight between Narendra Modi and Amit Shah.

Are you alleging that the two are at loggerheads?

After hard work of five years Narendra Modi made a global image for himself. And today, he has been put in a such an embarrassing position that he is unable to even step out of the country. We are known for our inclusive culture, it is not only about the Muslims. It all began in Assam and to get out of the mess they spread the mess across the country. Out of the 19 lakh “ghuspatiye” (infiltrators) in the State, 15 lakh turned out to be Hindus and four lakh Muslims. Now, they should have handed over these 19 lakh people to Bangladesh from where they have reportedly come as per the NRC exercise. Instead of doing that, Mr. Shah announced a nationwide NRC. And Chota Bhai explained the “chronology” that CAA will be followed by NPR and then finally NRC. Now, Mota Bhai says that NRC has not even been discussed in the Cabinet.

What is your government’s stand on NPR?

All of it is related. Now in NPR, the government wants respondents to give date of birth and place of birth of their parents. In Chhattisgarh, for example, 40% persons are below the poverty line. They are landless and illiterate. How will such a person produce documents that the government wants. Now in Raipur alone, we have persons from the entire nation. To gather the documentary evidence, they will have to revisit the place of their ancestors. Everyone in the country will be running from pillar to post collecting the necessary evidence. Let them remove the clause on date of birth and place of birth of parents of a respondent in the NPR form, then we have no problem with the exercise. Then it’s only like the census that happens once in every decade. Why would we have a problem with that.

The Congress so far in the last six years has been attacking the government on demonetisation and faulty implementation of GST. Is NRC/CAA a far bigger issue than these two?

During the demonetisation exercise only one member per family was standing in the queues. With CAA/NRC, every member from eight-year-old kid to 80-year-old grandmother will have to stand in the queue and prove their citizenship. And how will the 80-year-old grandmother bring documents about her parents? Demonetisation and GST were Narendra Modi’s handiwork. The last seven months of the second term of the BJP government is actually Amit Shah’s government and not Modi’s. From revoking Article 370 and 35 A, CAA, NPR all these are Shah’s doing. Inside and outside the Parliament Shah is running the government’s narrative. And Mr. Modi is repeatedly being proven wrong. Actually, this is Mr. Shah’s attempt to entrap Mr. Modi and destroy his image.

You have repeatedly asserted that Rahul Gandhi should return as the president of the Congress party. Do you believe that the Congress can’t run without Mr. Gandhi at the helm?

I am not saying that the party can’t function without Rahul ji. The party existed and functioned even when Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi were not there. This is not what I am saying. I only mean that at present there is no leader other than Rahul Gandhi who can handle the position of president of the Congress party. He is the only one who is strongly fighting against this government.

The Union government has refused to procure additional paddy from Chhattisgarh. What is the way forward?

Our government is buying paddy at ₹2,500 per quintal. The Union Government refused to procure paddy from our State because we are paying bonus to the farmers. (There is a difference of ₹750 per quintal between the Union government’s MSP and the price offered by the Chhattisgarh government). We are selling paddy to the Union government as per their price and have paid ₹7,000 crore of bonus to the farmers. We will bring in a new policy on the lines of the Rythu Bandhu scheme of the Telangana government or the Kalia scheme of the Odisha government.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/8g5h1n/article30588587.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Baghel,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/amit-shah-not-modi-running-the-show-says-chhattisgarh-cm-bhupesh-baghel/article30588588.ece
59,2020/01/17,J&K to be no-social media zone for local broadband users,"The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has kicked off a humongous exercise to consolidate its technical muscle to stop access to all platforms of the social media in Kashmir, as the J&K administration plans to restore between 2,000 to 5,000 fixed line broadband connections in phases in the Valley this month.

A senior government official told The Hindu that all Internet service providers, including private players offering lease lines and the government-run BSNL, have been asked to work on generating “a technical muscle” and “firewalls” to stop access to all platforms of the social media like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Instagram.

“There are fears that locals will log on to these social media platforms and upload videos recorded in the past five months, posing threat to the current calm in Kashmir,” a senior police officer told The Hindu. “Besides, Pakistan may also use the social media to coordinate with militants.”

The MHA and the J&K police are working on a three-page list of websites, including those offering online Islamic courses, discussion platforms on Islam and several news platforms, that may be barred from any access to the over 1.25 crore population of J&K, which has over 60 lakh Internet users.

Around 5,000 applications, mainly from the offices of government-run departments, are pending before the BSNL for restoration of fixed line broadband service. The J&K administration is considering restoration of a section of it in the first phase in Srinagar and Budgam.

Security agencies have already issued dos and don’ts for the government departments, barring generation of wi-fi connections and “unhindered access to data to the security agencies.”

The security agencies have also expressed apprehensions that China-made mobile phones pose a security threat as they are difficult to trace unlike registered phones companies like Samsung, “in case a wi-fi connection is misused.” The new directions by the security agencies will bar access of Internet to unregistered cellphones on official wi-fi connections and will make it mandatory to change passwords on a weekly basis.

So far, the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and anti-insurgency cell, locally called Cargo, are nodal agencies to approve any application made for restoration of Internet in the Valley. The recent decision to restore Internet services at hospitals have been restricted to administrative matters and implementation of Central schemes.

“No academic activity is allowed on these broadband connections. In fact, no student is allowed to access the same,” a student of the Government Medical College, Srinagar, told The Hindu, on the condition of anonymity.

Sources said the J&K administration is averse to restoration of mobile-based Internet even though over five months have passed without the service. Fixedline broadband will be restored to sectors like tourism, hotel industry and varsity campuses, as these are priority areas for the government. Ironically, over 200 newspapers and other news bureaus function from a small government-run Media Facilitation Centre and may not see immediate restoration of Internet services in their offices.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ix0oy1/article30588514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18TH-KASHMIR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/jk-to-be-no-social-media-zone-for-local-broadband-users/article30588515.ece
60,2020/01/17,U.K. working on government-to-government format for defence deals,"The UK government is working on a government-to-government framework for defence deals in future given India’s preference for such an arrangement, Brig. Gavin Thompson, U.K. Defence Adviser in India said on Friday.

“We have worked very hard since April last year to get all departments in U.K. to get this mechanism. We are at a point where we can send this proposal to the Indian government,” Brig. Thompson said. The mechanism needs to be agreed to by both sides, he stated.

However, unlike the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) route of the U.S. government where the government levies a small service charge, Brig. Thompson said there are no overheads built into the contract.

“It is a lighter model,” he stated, adding U.K. presently does not have such a mechanism.

In the last few years, India has concluded multi-billion dollar deals through the Inter-Governmental route for Rafale jets, S-400 air defence systems and stealth frigates, among others.

During Aero India at Bengaluru last year, U.K. made a pitch to India for collaboration in the areas of aircraft carriers and development of 6th generation fighter aircraft technologies. In this regard, Brig. Thompson said the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers are 30% of the cost of the U.S. carriers, provide 60% of the sortie rate, and require only 25% of the manning compared to US aircraft carriers.

There is also interest in the Indian Navy on the U.K.’s progress in integrated electric-propulsion and have exchanged subject matter experts. Recently, HMS Defender, a Type 45 destroyer, was in Goa and 27 Indian Navy officers went onboard for interactions, the Defence Adviser stated.

There are three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) between the U.K. and India lined up, said Dominic Beales of Defence and Security Organisation in India. While a Defence Equipment Memorandum (DEM) was signed in April last year renewing an earlier agreement, the Logistics MoU has been discussed with Indian officials and “is about to formally enter the Indian system, and the Training MoU is in progress,” he stated.

“We are looking at collaboration, for co-development and co-IP sharing and exports,” Mr. Beales added.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/80f3x3/article29626469.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/rafalejpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uk-working-on-government-to-government-format-for-defence-deals/article30588418.ece
61,2020/01/17,"CAA should make an exception for free-thinker Muslims, says Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen","While terming the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) “very good” and “generous”, Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreen on Friday said that the law should make an exception for Muslim “free-thinkers, feminists, and secularists” from the neighbouring countries.

“It is nice to hear the religious persecuted minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan will get citizenship (of India). It is a very good idea and very generous one. But I think that there are people like me from the Muslim community, free thinkers and atheists, who too are persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan and they too should have the right to live in India,” said the author-in-exile.

Ms. Nasreen was speaking here on the second day of the Kerala Literature festival during a session titled “In Exile: A writer’s Journey.”

The CAA, which was passed in the Parliament on December 11 last year, grants citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities — Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Christians -- from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014.

The author gave an example of Muslim “atheists bloggers” who were hacked to death by suspected Islamist militants in Bangladesh a few years ago.

“Many of these bloggers, in a bid to save their lives, left for Europe or America, why cannot they come to India? India today needs more free thinker, secularist, feminist from the Muslim community,” said Ms. Nasreen, who is set to release her new book, “Shameless”, a sequel to her bestelling book “Lajja”, in April.

Ms. Nasreen had to leave Bangladesh in 1994 in the wake of death threat by fundamentalist outfits for her alleged anti-Islamic views. She has been living in exile since then.

Though terming the nationwide protest against CAA as a “wonderful” thing, she also took on the protestors for allowing “Muslim fundamenatalists” to be part of it.

The 57-year-old author told the audience that fundamentalism — be it from majority or minority community — is equally bad and must be condemned.

“Are these Muslim fundamentalists secular? Do they believe in secularism? No. So they [protestors of CAA] should separate out these people. The fundamentalists from the minority community and the majority community are the same. Because they are against progressive society and equality for women,” she added.

She also argued that the conflict that India is facing right now is neither new and nor between “Hinduism and Islam“.

“Of course, there is a conflict in India now. But the conflict is not between Hinduism and Islam, it is between religious fundamentalism and secularism, modernism and anti-modernism, logical mind and irrational blind faith, innovation and tradition, humanism and barbarism... this is not new and it is everywhere in the world,” she said.

Living in New Delhi on a residence permit since 2004, the author said she has never felt like a “foreigner” here.

“People tell me that you are Bangladeshi, you are a foreigner but I never feel like a foreigner here in India. Because my colour is like you, I speak in one of the Indian languages and our root is the same. I would live in india and India only as long as I can,” she said.

Ms. Nasreen, on many occasions, had expressed her wish to live in India permanently, especially in Kolkata. The writer had to leave Kolkata in 2007 following violent street protests by a section of Muslims against her works.

Historians such as Ramachandra Guha, William Dalrymple, novelists like Benyamin, Namita Gokhale, Chetan Bhagat and journalists Karan Thapar and Rajdeep Sardesai are among the many other writers who will be attending the four-day festival.

63,2020/01/17,"39 years after the 1981 Behmai massacre involving Phoolan Devi, verdict likely on Jan 18","A special court is expected to pronounce its verdict here on Saturday, January 18, 2020, on the massacre of 20 people in Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat district, allegedly by bandit Phoolan Devi nearly four decades ago.

In 1981, the 20 men belonging to that village were shot dead by Phoolan’s gang.

“We have hope that the trial court is likely to deliver its judgment in Behmai massacre tomorrow,” district government counsel (criminal) Rajeev Porwal told PTI on Friday.

Mr. Porwal said that defense counsel Girish Narain Dubey has submitted certain rulings of the Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court before the trial court with a request to take cognisance of those rulings while delivering its judgment against the accused.

The court is now expected to give its judgment on the role of the four surviving accused — Posha, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu.

While Posha is still in jail, Bhikha, Vishwanath and Shyambabu are out on bail.

Three other dacoits, including Man Singh, are still absconding.

Several twists

“Bandit Queen” Phoolan Devi, who later turned to politics, along with her gang members were accused of killing the 20 people belonging to the Thakur community at Behmai village in Kanpur Dehat on February 14, 1981.

The non-descript Behmai village, that shot into prominence after the killings, is 170 km from state capital Lucknow and over 400 km from New Delhi.

Phoolan Devi had stormed into Behmai in what was described as an attack to avenge her alleged rape there by two other bandits - Lala Ram and Sri Ram - both Thakurs, a dominant caste in the village.

Two years after the incident, she had surrendered to the Madhya Pradesh police in 1983 and went on to become a Lok Sabha MP from Mirzapur. She was shot dead outside her MP bungalow in New Delhi on July 25, 2001.

Initially, 35 people, including Phoolan Devi, were named as accused in the case. Eight of them were reportedly killed by police in separate encounters. Three others were reportedly absconding.

The prosecution had produced as many as 15 witnesses and seven of them were material witnesses. The process of prosecution producing evidence was closed in 2014.

The Behmai killings had led to a political fallout, with then U.P. chief minister V.P. Singh, who later became the country’s Prime Minister, resigning owning moral responsibility for the massacre.

As per the terms of her surrender under an amnesty scheme, the then Madhya Pradesh chief minister Arjun Singh agreed to keep her in the Gwalior prison, rather than being sent to a U.P. prison, as a result of which the summons and non-bailable warrants issued by a Kanpur court were returned unserved.

She spent 11 years in Gwalior and Jabalpur jails in Madhya Pradesh and was released in 1994 without facing trial as she kept fighting a legal battle against the U.P. police and the Kanpur court’s orders.

Charges against the four surviving accused were framed only in 2012. Phoolan Devi’s release was facilitated by the withdrawal of 55 cases by then U.P. chief minister Mulayam Singh Yadav’s government in “public interest“.

Mr. Yadav’s decision, however, was set aside by the Kanpur court, with the Allahabad High Court upholding the trial court’s decision. Even the Supreme Court had rejected her plea for dismissal of all cases against her in December 1996.

Phoolan Devi, however, evaded arrest and waged a legal battle against it in 2001.

The apex court directed her that if she wanted relief in the cases against her, she first needed to surrender to the trial court in Kanpur. However, in July 2001 she was killed outside her official residence in New Delhi.

She had won two Lok Sabha elections - in 1996 and 1999 - on Samajwadi Party ticket.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/t1q9f2/article30587098.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/phoolan-devijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/39-years-after-the-1981-behmai-massacre-involving-phoolan-devi-verdict-likely-on-jan-18/article30587097.ece

65,2020/01/17,"Statement on Amazon misconstrued, says Piyush Goyal","A day after he was slammed for his remark that Amazon did not do any favour to India by investing USD 1 billion, Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal clarified on Friday saying his statement regarding Amazon was misconstrued.

The Minister, however, stressed that the government welcomed all investments but they should adhere to rules and regulations of the country and they should not create unfair competition for small traders and businessmen in the country.

“We welcome all types of investments. But if the foundation of any investment violates law, then there will be a legal process. Some people think I said something negative against Amazon. If you look at the context of my statement, I said investment should come within the law and regulations. This process is followed across the world,” he told reporters in Ahmedabad when asked to comment on his statement that triggered widespread reactions.

“There are some laws regarding eCommerce India. We welcome investments that come under those laws. But this investment should not create unfair competition to small traders and retail businessmen in India,” he stated.

Speaking at the Raisina Dialogue 2020 in New Delhi, Mr. Goyal said Amazon was not doing a favour to India when they invested a billion dollars in the country.

“They [Amazon] may have put in a billion dollars but if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then jolly well will have to finance that billion dollar. So, it is not as if they are doing a favour to India when they invest a billion dollars,” he said.

Mr. Goyal had also said the Competition Commission of India (CCI) was probing the business model of Amazon and Flipkart following allegations of predatory pricing, deep discounting, exclusivity and preferential seller treatment amidst protests by small businessmen, retailers and traders.

On Wednesday, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos announced his plan to invest USD 1 billion or approximately Rs 7,092 crore in India and enabling USD 10 billion in cumulative exports in the next five years by digitally enabling micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and small traders in India.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/rq89cs/article30586773.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PIYUSHGOYAL-17jan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/statement-on-amazon-misconstrued-says-piyush-goyal/article30586744.ece
66,2020/01/17,Supreme Court disposes of wife’s plea for fair probe into Kalburgi murder case,"The Supreme Court on Friday disposed of a petition filed by Umadevi Kalburgi, wife of late activist and Kannada writer MM Kalburgi, for a fair probe into his murder in 2015.

A Bench led by Justice Rohinton F. Nariman closed the petition after it was apprised of the fact that a charge sheet was filed in the case.

In February last, the court transferred the Kalburgi investigation to the same special investigation team (SIT) probing the killing of journalist Gauri Lankesh. It also directed the Dharwad Bench of the Karnataka High Court to monitor the SIT investigation. The Kalburgi death was earlier investigated by the Karnataka CID.

Initially, the apex court contemplated having the Bombay High Court monitor the Kalburgi case along with the investigation into the murders of activists Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. A line of argument had been raised before the Supreme Court that all the four cases were inter-linked.

Umadevi had also sought a comprehensive, fair and coordinated probe into the brutal deaths of Gauri Lankesh, Dabholkar and Pansare.

Lankesh was shot dead in broad daylight in front of her Bengaluru residence on September 5, 2017. A Kendriya Sahitya Akademi awardee and anti-superstition activist, Kalburgi, was shot dead at his Bengaluru residence on August 30, 2015.

67,2020/01/17,Supreme Court asks government to respond to plea challenging NPR updation,"The Supreme Court on Friday asked the government to respond to a petition to declare a Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ notification of July 31, 2019 to update the National Population Register (NPR) as unconstitutional and violative of the fundamental rights of dignity and equality

The NPR exercise is scheduled to commence from April 2020. Rule 4 of Citizenship Rules provides for data collected for NPR to be used for National Register of Citizens (NRC).

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde issued notice to the Centre on a petition filed by 20 residents from across West Bengal led by Israrul Hoque Mondal, represented by Supreme Court advocate M.R. Shamshad.

The petition also challenges the implementation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), which fast-tracks the grant of citizenship process to all illegal migrants who have fled religious persecution from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh except Muslims.

The petition, which contended that grant of citizenship on the basis of religion was against the Basic Structure of the Constitution, would be listed on January 22 along with over 60 other petitions challenging the CAA.

This petition comes shortly after another one was filed by NGO Minority Front, which questioned the need to prepare an NPR if the government, as it claimed, had taken a policy decision to abort the nationwide NRC exercise. The plea highlighted the Prime Minister's speech on December 22 in this regard.

“When the Central Government has already taken a policy decision to not go ahead with the NRC (as mentioned by the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India in his speech dated December 22,2019 and as per the stand of the officials of the Ministry of Home Affairs – as per the media reports dated 24.12.2019), the preparation of the Population Register is nothing but a waste of time, energy and valuable resources of the nation,” the plea said.

President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four men convicted in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, sources said.

The rejection came soon after the Union Home Ministry forwarded the petition to the president on Friday morning.

“We are happy that the chances of them getting hanged have increased. We are assured that as soon as they file mercy pleas they will be rejected. Kal jo nirasha thi woh aaj asha mein badal gayi hai (Yesterday’s disappointment has turned into hope today),” he told PTI.

He said the news of the execution not happening on January 22 had disheartened them but Friday’s developments have heightened their hopes.

“There is a hearing at 3.30 p.m. at Patiala House Court and this development will have a positive impact on it,” he added.

70,2020/01/17,Women’s rights groups reiterate stand against death penalty in rape cases,"Women’s rights groups and feminists have reiterated their opposition to death penalty, asserting that it is not a deterrent against crimes.

“We understand the inexorable pain of the parents and other loved ones of women and children who are raped and, in many cases, killed. However, efforts by politicians and parties, courts and other vested interests to capitalise on their pain and make the case a matter of the nation’s honour, give false hope that the harshest punishment of death will prevent all such cases in the future,” reads a statement from 16 women’s rights groups including Saheli Women’s Resource Centre, The Feminist Collective and All India Progressive Women’s Association, among others.

Many well-known women’s rights activists and senior lawyers have also endorsed the petition, such as Mary E John, Nivedita Menon, Suneeta Dhar and Indira Jaisingh.

The petition was sent to the President before he rejected the the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh, who is on death row. He, along with three others — Akshay Kumar, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta — were to be hanged on January 22, though the Delhi High Court stayed the hanging after Singh sought mercy.

The petition says that a death penalty is a mere illusion of justice provided to divert attention from a failing criminal justice system.

“The only way to stop such crimes is the certainty that the criminal justice system will work with honesty, integrity, competence and fairness against every accused, irrespective of their social standing, power position, class, or caste. Instead, what the State is trying to do is to distract us by creating an ‘illusion of justice’, by selectively hanging people even as it protects others responsible for similar crimes.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/yitfno/article25725925.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-death-penalty,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/womens-rights-groups-reiterate-stand-against-death-penalty-in-rape-cases/article30584681.ece

The apex court in January and May 2019 had granted Karti Chidambaram permission to travel to foreign countries after depositing ₹10 crore each respectively with the registry.

74,2020/01/17,Rahul questions NIA probe against Davinder Singh,"Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday alleged that the Union government’s decision to ask the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe arrested Jammu and Kashmir police officer Davinder Singh was an attempt to ‘silence’ him, and questioned NIA chief Y.K. Modi’s track record.

“The best way to silence Terrorist DSP Davinder, is to hand the case to the NIA. The NIA is headed by another Modi, YK, who investigated the Gujarat Riots & Haren Pandya’s assassination. In YK’s care, the case is as good as dead,” he said on Twitter.

“#WhoWantsTerroristDavinderSilenced And why??,” he stated.

For three days now, Congress leaders have been alleging a larger conspiracy involving the tainted police officer, who was arrested with two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen militants.

The party reiterated its demand that there should be an impartial probe into his role in terror attacks, including the Pulwama attack last February as he was the Deputy Superintendent of Police of Pulwama area.

“Questions continue to haunt the country, questions continue to remain unanswered. How was so much RDX imported? How did it reach 180 kilometres into India? And he is also the same official who faces three FIRs in matters of extortion,” said party spokesperson Supriya Srinate at a press conference.

On Thursday, party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra pointed out that the tainted officer was in charge of security of the 17 envoys, including US Ambassador Kenneth Juster, when they visited Srinagar on January 9.

“DSP Davindar Singh’s arrest in JK raises disturbing questions critical to India’s national security. It seems rather odd that he not only evaded detection but was entrusted with extremely sensitive duties like escorting foreign envoys to J&K under the prevailing circumstances,” she tweeted.

“...Whose orders was he working under? A full investigation must be made. Helping terrorists plan attacks on India is treason,” she asked.

Mr. Gandhi too questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence over the matter and demanded his trial in a fast track court.

76,2020/01/17,Centre asks States to set up monitoring centres for vehicle tracking system under Nirbhaya Framework,"After observing little progress on setting up monitoring centres by States for implementation of vehicle tracking system, the Centre has stepped in to ensure effective implementation of the project under the Nirbhaya Framework with an assistance of ₹332 crore.

In a letter to Principal Secretaries and Transport Commissioners of States and Union territories, Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has asked them to apply for the assistance by February 15.

“Since very little progress could be achieved on setting up the Monitoring Centers, it was felt necessary to support the States under Nirbhaya Framework to set up Monitoring Centers at the earliest so as to effectively implement the vehicle tracking system and ensure safe commute to the women and children in public passenger transport vehicles,” the communication said.

The Ministry earlier had mandated vehicle location tracking (VLT) device and emergency buttons be fitted in all public service vehicle w e f from April 1, 2018, which was re-examined and it was decided to give exemption to all public service vehicles that were registered till December 31, 2018 (old vehicles) from these requirements till the time as notified by State/UT governments.

All public service vehicles registered on or after January 1, 2019 must be fitted with VLT device and emergency buttons, it has said.

However, little progress was observed on States’ parts, the communication said, adding under the project now 37 States / UTs have been divided into four categories, and the Centre would provide 60% assistance for States which do not fall in difficult terrain, while 90% to States under difficult terrains and 100% in case of UTs.

The total project, it said, will cost about ₹463.90 crore out of which central assistance will be to the tune of ₹332.24 crore.

“The objective of the project is to improve safety of women and children in public service vehicles through the implementation of CMVR (Central Motor Vehicles Rules) 125H.

Accordingly, all the specified public service vehicles will be equipped with VLT device with multiple emergency buttons for requesting emergency response,” the Ministry has said.

It added that the States and UTs will set up monitoring centres for watch out alerts and emergency buttons etc.

79,2020/01/17,"CBI files FIR against Adani Enterprises, NCCF officials","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked Adani Enterprises Limited, the then chairman and two other top former officials of the National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation of India Limited (NCCF) for alleged corruption and cheating in the award of a contract for supply of imported coal to the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO).

Among those named as accused in the FIR are the then NCCF chairman Virender Singh, managing director G.P. Gupta, senior adviser S.C. Singhal, Adani Enterprises and other unknown public servants. NCCF is a public sector undertaking.

The case has been instituted following a preliminary enquiry initiated in 2017 on a complaint from a deputy secretary to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. It pertains to a limited tender enquiry floated by APGENCO on June 29, 2010, for supply of six lakh tonnes of imported coal. The supplies were meant for two power stations at Vijayawada and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh.

The day the tender enquiry was floated, it was forwarded to PEC Limited, STC Limited, MSTC Limited, NCCF-Hyderabad, MMTC-Hyderabad, Coal India Limited and SCCL. The NCCF’s Hyderabad unit, on receipt of the enquiry, sent it by fax to senior adviser S.C. Singhal for further action.

It is alleged that the NCCF head office, instead of starting the process for floating an open tender to call for bids, selected Maharishi Brothers Coal Limited (MBCL) to supply coal at a margin of 2.25%. However, after APGENCO extended the due date for submitting the tender for a few days, and the work awarded to MBCL was cancelled on that pretext.

Stating that there was now sufficient time to go for an open tender, the top NCCF officials held a meeting and approved a draft tender notice, deciding that the Hyderbabad office would open the offers till 1 p.m. on July 10, 2010.

Anomalies in draft notice

As alleged, there were several irregularities in finalising the draft tender notice. No head office-level committee was constituted by the managing director; and the draft tender file was not sent to the finance division for concurrence. All decisions were taken as per the mutual understanding of the accused officials.

The Hyderabad office received bids from six contenders: Adani Enterprises, MBCL, Vyom Trade Links Private Limited, Swarana Projects, Gupta Coal India Limited and Kyori Oremin Limited. When the tender was opened, no representative of Vyom turned up.

Gupta Coal quoted the NCCF margin of 11.3% and MBCL quoted it as 2.25%. However, Adani Enterprises, Vyom Trade Link, Kyori Oremin did not quote any margin allegedly in violation of bidding conditions. Bids of Gupta Coal, Kyori and Swarana Projects were rejected as they did not fulfil tender requirements.

‘Undue favours’

It is alleged that the post-tender negotiation was also done by NCCF officials to give undue favours to Adani Enterprises, which was not qualified when the tender was opened. However, instead of cancelling its bid, the officials allegedly alerted the company — through its representative present at the NCCF head office on July 10, 2010 — that it also had to provide details of the margin on offer.

Subsequently, Adani Enterprises informed the NCCF that it had agreed to pay a minimum margin of 2.25%. The CBI alleges that the representative was also apparently told that MBCL, an eligible bidder, had quoted 2.25% margin.

The agency found that Adani Enterprises had given an unsecured loan of ₹16.81 crore to Vyom Trade Links in 2008-09. Bank guarantees of both the companies were issued by the same bank and at the same time. Therefore, the CBI alleges that Adani Enterprises had presented Vyom Trade Links as a proxy in the tender process. The second company withdrew its offer on a very flimsy ground, as alleged.

According to the FIR, when the issue of award of supply order to APGENCO came before the NCCF business committee, Mr. Gupta had misled it about the publication of tender notice in newspapers.

An Adani group spokesperspon said: “There is a news item about lodging of an FIR by CBI against National Cooperative Consumer Federation and Adani Enterprises Ltd. related to supply of imported coal. The subject matter is an old one. Adani Enterprises Ltd. has complied with the process, all formalities and relevant laws for the subject supply of coal. The company has not done anything wrong in supply of coal. It’s a preliminary investigation report only. The Company shall respond to the same and shall also put forth the factual position to the authority.”

80,2020/01/17,Merger of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha TV in last stages,"The merger of Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha Television is in its final stages, with the six-member Committee expected to submit its final report in two weeks time. There has been overwhelming demand that live transmission of the proceedings of the two houses should not be disrupted.

The Committee was constituted on November 7 and consists of Prasar Bharati Chairman Surya Prakash; Additional Secretary to the RS Secretariat A. Rao; the Lok Sabha Secretariat’s Ganpati Bhatt; Financial Advisor to RS TV Shikha Darbari; and CEOs of RS TV and LS TV, Manoj Kumar Pandey and Aashish Joshi, respectively. The mandate laid down for the Committee was “to work out the modalities and prepare the guidelines for pooling resources, manpower and technology for the merger of the two channels”.

The Committee is expected to submit its report by end of this month to Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla. The final decision will be taken by them.

Two options

According to sources, the Committee is weighing between two options. The first is to have a single channel and, during the Parliament sessions, to have a “variant” to broadcast the live debate of both the houses. The second option, according to sources, is to continue with the two channels but under an “integrated management” with a common pool of technical and human resources. “The Parliament is in session for close to 100 days in a year and for the remaining period, we don’t really need two channels,” an official said.

Rajya Sabha TV professionals, who get an year-long contract, have been given a six-month contract up to June this year, to ensure that no contractual problems arise when the two channels are remodelled.

Consultative process

The Committee has had several rounds of consultations, including one meeting with Parliamentarians from across political parties. The Parliamentarians have stressed that the live telecast of the proceedings of both the houses should be continued. “The channels need to highlight the working of democracy and be restricted to the Parliament itself. They need to hire talented professionals and increase the quality of telecast,” one of the MPs who attended the meeting said.

Lok Sabha Television was launched in 2006 by then Speaker Somnath Chatterjee. The Rajya Sabha TV followed this launch.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/merger-of-rs-and-ls-tv-in-last-stages/article30579026.ece
81,2020/01/17,Dual voter cards in way of settling border row with Assam: Meghalaya minister,"The tendency of people to possess dual voters’ identity cards in order to claim benefits from both Assam and Meghalaya governments has come in the way of settling border disputes, Meghalaya’s Revenue Minister Kyrmen Shylla has suggested.

Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as a State on January 21, 1972. But the boundary between the two north-eastern States has not been demarcated clearly.

Both the States had identified 12 areas of dispute covering a total of 2,765.14 sq km. The largest of the disputed areas are marked Block I and Block II comprising 356 villages. According to a petition filed by a retired Meghalaya-based forest officer in the Supreme Court, the Assam government had merged these villages with present-day Karbi Anglong district in 1951.

“It is hard to settle claims of people in border areas who want benefits from both the State governments. Instead of possessing two EPICs (electoral photo identity cards), the people should identify themselves as residents of either Meghalaya or Assam,” Mr. Shylla told newspersons in Shillong on Wednesday.

He also pointed out that possessing dual voter IDs was illegal.

“We want the people to cooperate with us in order to end the border disputes unsolved for so many years,” Mr. Shylla said, adding people in the border areas cannot claim to be residents of both states.

Officials in Meghalaya said on Thursday that the appeal has started taking effect. The residents of Ummat, one of the disputed villages, have decided to discard the EPIC issued by the Assam government.

The EPICs that the residents of Ummat possess show that the village falls under Baithalangso Assembly constituency in Assam as well as Mawhati Assembly constituency in Meghalaya.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/dual-voter-cards-in-way-of-settling-border-row-with-assam-meghalaya-minister/article30580463.ece
82,2020/01/17,"ISRO’s GSAT-30 satellite launched, to replace ageing INSAT-4A","The nation's latest communication satellite, GSAT-30, was sent to space from the Guiana Space Centre in Kourou at 2:35 a.m. IST on Friday.

The 3,357-kg satellite will replace INSAT-4A which was launched in 2005 and marks the first mission of the year for Indian Space Research Organisation.

The high-power satellite is equipped with 12 normal C band and 12 Ku band transponders.

ISRO quoted its Chairman K. Sivan as saying, “GSAT-30 will provide DTH (direct to home) television services, connectivity to VSATs (that support working of banks') ATMs, stock exchange, television uplinking and teleport services, digital satellite news gathering and e-governance applications. The satellite will also be used for bulk data transfer for a host of emerging telecommunication applications.”

He said its unique configuration provides flexible frequency segments and flexible coverage. ""The satellite will provide communication services to Indian mainland and islands through the Ku band and wide coverage over Gulf countries, a large number of Asian countries and Australia through the C band.”

P. Kunhikrishnan, Director of the U.R.Rao Satellite Centre, was at Kourou for the launch.

In a flight lasting over 38 minutes, European Ariane-5 space vehicle VA-251 released GSAT-30 in an initial elliptical geosynchronous orbit. The ISRO Master Control Facility picked up its signals immediately and found its systems healthy.

Over the coming weeks MCF engineers will gradually adjust it into a final circular orbit 36,000 km from earth and apparently fixed at 83° East longitude over the country.

Foreign launch

ISRO hired a foreign launcher as GSAT-30 is much heavier than the 2,000-kg lifting capacity of its geostationary launch vehicle GSLV-MkII.

As for the newer and more powerful GSLV-MkIII that can lift up to 4,000 kg, the space agency plans to save the two or three upcoming MkIIIs mainly for its first human space flight Gaganyaan of 2022 and two preceding crew-less trials, Dr. Sivan recently said. The first Indian crew-less test flight is planned later this year.

Mr.Kunhikrishnan said in a pre-launch video that GSAT-30 was built to last 15 years through the 2030s. It was realised using new and advanced technologies.

ISRO in recent years has been taking the support of a cluster of mid-sized industries to speed up building routine spacecraft at its premises.

A consortium led by Alpha Design Technologies Ltd. assembled GSAT-30 at the ISRO Satellite Integration & Test Establishment in Bengaluru, Alpha's CMD Colonel (retd.) H.S.Shankar said. This group has also worked on the earlier IRNSS-1H and 1I [ONE EYE] navigation satellites.

Arianespace, the European launch service operator, said it has now sent 24 Indian communication satellites to orbit over the last 30 years; the APPLE experimental satellite of 1981 was its first Indian contract. It last launched another replacement satellite, GSAT-31, in February 2019.

A European communication satellite called EUTELSAT KONNECT was the co-passenger of GSAT-30.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/9xyefy/article30582115.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/GSAT30-THNAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/isros-gsat-30-satellite-launched-successfully-to-replace-ageing-insat-4a/article30582116.ece
83,2020/01/17,Kerala’s thematic calendars showcase a new year in old stories,"Kerala Tourism and stakeholders in the State’s tourism industry have launched thematic desktop and wall calendars for “God’s Own Country” and its niche tourism products.

For a State like Kerala, with its origin steeped in the myth of Parashurama throwing his axe into the sea to raise new land, this retelling of fables and legends reflects the essence of its culture.

The ‘Land of Stories’ desktop calendar with 12 leaves highlights such tales from Kerala, including ‘the world’s richest God’ and the region’s erstwhile ruler Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma. Sketches accompany the brief write-ups on mythology and history.

Great stories

Veluthampi Dalawa, one of the first to rebel against the British East India Company’s supremacy; the story of classical Sanskrit scholar Sakthibhadran, who hailed from Adoor; and that of Nangeli, in a story that speaks to social inequality and injustice towards women, and whose death led to the annulment of breast tax system, are among the other stories featured.

Chieftain of the Oorali tribe, Chemban Karuvellayan Kolumban, who is said to have conquered nature; skilled sculptor and carpenter Perumthachan, whose story still holds the young and old in its magical grasp; and Guruvayoor Keshavan, the pious elephant revered across the State for having served the famous temple deity with dedication, have all found a place in the calendar.

Many tales

Under the ‘Avengers of Malabar’, the tale of Kunjali Marakkar has been retold. Naranathu Bhranthan, the rebel whose eccentricities still makes sense; Karinthandan, chief of the Paniya tribe in Wayanad; legendary warrior and true master of martial art Thacholi Othenan; and the tale of Kathivanoor Veeran of Kannur, which narrates the importance of faith and trust, are also included.

‘First time’

“This is the first time that such a thematic storyline is being used for the official calendar. It has been well accepted,” said a senior department official.

The wall calendar’s theme is ‘Human by Nature’.

85,2020/01/17,Data Protection Bill: JPC to invite views from all stakeholders,"The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Personal Data Protection Bill will throw open its doors for all stakeholders to express objections and point out loopholes in the proposed legislation, the panel decided at its first meeting held on Thursday.

IT Secretary Anshu Prakash gave a presentation giving details of the bill.

“Today was just a preliminary briefing, we didn’t go into the bill itself today. We asked him the purpose of the bill, whether privacy has been defined, how it is different from the Srikrishna committee’s report and so on,” one of the members told The Hindu.

The panel will issue an advertisement inviting the general public and the stakeholders to send in their suggestions. The stakeholders will be given four weeks to respond and the committee will meet later.

The Committee of 30 members has 20 from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha, and was formed after Union Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad moved motions in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha to refer the legislation to the JPC in December last year during the Winter session. The committee is headed by BJP MP Meenakshi Lekhi.

The Justice B.N. Srikrishna-headed expert panel had in July 2018 submitted the draft personal data protection bill after a year-long consultation process. It recommended that critical personal data of the citizens be processed in centres located within the country. However, it put the onus of deciding what is ‘critical’ data on the Central government. The draft proposed that personal data may be processed on the basis of the consent of the data principal, while processing of sensitive personal data should be on the basis of “explicit consent”.

However, following the introduction of the new bill, Justice Srikrishna said it was at variance with the draft Bill that the committee headed by him had recommended. Stating that the Bill gave autonomy to the government, he said, “If this is passed in its current form, it should be challenged in the Supreme Court.”",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/data-protection-bill-jpc-to-invite-views-from-all-stakeholders/article30579037.ece
86,2020/01/17,ED summons senior AirAsia functionaries,"The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has summoned senior functionaries of AirAsia, including its chief executive officer Anthony Tony Fernandes, for recording their statements in connection with a money laundering case, said a senior agency official on Thursday.

The ED had earlier registered the case on the basis of an FIR lodged by the Central Bureau of Investigation in April 2018. Mr. Fernandes, AirAsia India Limited (AAIL) and its director R. Venkataramanan, AirAsia Berhad (Malaysia) and others were accused of violating FDI norms and paying bribes in an attempt to get an international operations licence.

Tharumalingam Kanalingam of AirAsia Berhad; Rajendra Dubey, director of Singapore-based HNR Trading Pte Limited, and the company; Total Food Services (Mumbai) chairman Sunil Kapur; Deepak Talwar, aviation consultant, and principal-founder of DTA Consulting (Delhi) were also named.

Bid to get approval

It was alleged that unknown officials of the Ministry of Civil Aviation and the then Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) conspired with Mr. Fernandes and others to expedite the approval process and amend the aviation policies.

The AirAsia group also allegedly violated the FIPB norms in handing over the effective management control to a foreign entity by making AAIL a de-facto subsidiary, instead of a joint venture.

AAIL had earlier refuted the allegations, stating that it was cooperating with all the regulators and agencies to present correct facts. “In November 2016, AAIL initiated criminal charges against its ex-CEO and also commenced civil proceedings in Bengaluru for such irregularities,” it had said.

As alleged by the CBI, Mr. Venkataramanan lobbied with stakeholders in the Central government to secure necessary approvals. The controllers of AAIL allegedly pressured its then CEO Mrithyunjay Chandilya to ensure the desired changes in regulatory policies.

The agency alleged that attempts were made in the Civil Aviation Ministry to remove or amend the 5/20 rule ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha election. However, it could not be done as the polls were announced and the airlines did not get a licence for international operations. Under the 5/20 rule, which has now been replaced by 0/20 rule, a licence for international operations could be given to only those airlines with five years of domestic flying experience and a fleet of at least 20 aircraft.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ed-summons-senior-airasia-functionaries/article30580146.ece
87,2020/01/17,2020 will be an important year for Indo-U.S. relations: American official,"As U.S. officials finalise venues and dates of President Donald Trump’s likely visit, an official said the focus of the Indo-U.S. engagements this year would be to implement decisions taken during the 2+2 meeting between Defence and Foreign Ministers in December 2019 and on trade.

“This is going to be an important year for India-U.S. relations. Especially in the first half of the year, we expect to put into practice many of the decisions taken during the 2+2 talks,” a senior Trump administration official told The Hindu, while briefing journalists in Delhi. The official would not, however, confirm the dates of the visit, which has not been formally announced. The Hindu had reported earlier this week that officials are discussing a possible visit next month, around February 24, and the American security and administration officials are undertaking a series of reconnaissance visits over the next week

One of the major objectives of the 2+2 talks between Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mark T. Esper with Minister of External Affairs S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh was furthering cooperation on a “free and open Indo-Pacific”, said the official.

During the talks in Washington, both countries had agreed to “promote practical cooperation in infrastructure development, cyber security, counter-terrorism and regional connectivity”. To that end, the U.S. has launched a “Blue Dot Network” which has already taken Japan and Australia on board to encourage private investment in infrastructure projects. The network is “ratings mechanism” that would grade infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region on different parameters to ensure transparency and is planned as direct counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. However, unlike the BRI, the BDN would not offer public funds or loans for the project.

When asked, the official said he hoped India, which has refused to join China’s BRI, would join the U.S.-led BDN.

“India has as much a role as it wants on the Blue Dot Network (BDN) initiative. It is as open as a Michelin standard for restaurants. We are hoping to build support for this initiative to grade infrastructure projects on debt, environmental standards, labour standards, etc. These would apply to projects in any citizen-centric country where citizens would like to evaluate these projects,” the official said.

The U.S. has also aligned its concept of the “Indo-Pacific geography” with India, to stretch not just from its West Coast to India, “Hollywood to Bollywood”, and has included the Indian Ocean west of India to Africa, from “California to Kilimanjaro”, the official said.

The U.S. official is visiting Delhi at the same time as Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif addressed the Raisina Dialogue where Mr. Zarif had said Iran was no longer interested in “negotiating with the United States”.

When asked about India’s concerns about the impact of the U.S. threat of more sanctions on Iran and on plans to develop the Chabahar port, the official said Washington understood the concerns and suggested that India could play a role in convincing Iran to renegotiate the nuclear deal.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/w4virn/article19152921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Trump-and-Modi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/2020-will-be-an-important-year-for-indo-us-relations-american-official/article30579088.ece
88,2020/01/17,HAL has designs on a full LCA for Navy,"After playing a prominent supporting role in the Light Combat Aircraft naval prototype’s tricky landing and take-off debuts from a Navy ship last week-end, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd eyes the prospect of fully designing and developing a twin-engine fighter plane for the Navy if or when an occasion comes up.

Asked what the successful twin acts of naval protytpe NP2 mean for its manufacturer HAL, company Chairman and Managing Director R. Madhavan said the recent ship-based trials will, of course, not translate to business from the Navy unless a twin-engined fighter project formalises from the Force.

Mr. Madhavan said, “It is our desire that the twin-engine Navy project be given to us so that we can design LCA-Navy as required. Such a step will lead to speeding up the project.”

HAL has already been deeply involved in the ongoing deck trials of the two naval prototypes; it has produced them for the Defence Research & Development Organisation DRDO. The defence public sector company has contributed to designing sub-systems of the LCA project - a plane that was originally started for the Air Force.

The DRDO’s special arm ADA or the Aeronautical Development Agency in Bengaluru is tasked with designing and developing the LCA versions and future indigenous fighter planes.

Vital parts

HAL said many critical paraphernalia and support staff for the naval prototype were its contributions, both before and during the recent trials on the ship.

It contributed the arrestor hook system, a redesigned landing gear, a speed controlling device for landings, a drooped nose to give the pilot a good view, a stronger fuselage and the fuel dump.

“We anyway design the LCA structures. Our engineering is proven. If it is possible to extend it to the full project, it would speed up the R&D,” Mr. Madhavan said.

“If a twin-engine naval aircraft project should come up, then HAL can offer the Navy a deck-based aircraft.” With a design house each in Bengaluru and Nashik, he said HAL was up to taking up such a task.

The two Navy prototypes NP1 and NP2, seen as potential trainers, are derived from the IAF version of the indigenous light fighter. A production standard version called NP5 has also been considered.

All these are single-engine while the Navy indicated in 2016 that it needed only two-engined aircraft. With a double-engine LCA being some time away, more so for the Navy, it is an area of interest for its stakeholders.

Rare capability

The second LCA-Navy prototype LCA-NP2 achieved two technologically challenging feats. On January 11 it did an arrested landing on the relatively narrow decks of the carrier INS Vikramaditya and took off the next day ìn what is called the ski jump style.

Underlining the achievement, Mr. Madhavan said only 3-4 countries have such a technology to deploy or land their fighters from the limited confines of a carrier.

Currently HAL’s fixed-wing design house is working on the HTT-40 basic trainer aircraft.

About the scope for a naval aircraft fleet an informed person said its current fleet of Russian origin MiG-29Ks are expected to go obsolete around 2028-32. Another opportunity to replenish naval aircraft could arise if the country goes in for a third aircraft carrier around the year 2040 as envisioned for the long term",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/m4y7uv/article30579388.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hal-has-designs-on-a-full-lca-for-navy/article30579389.ece
89,2020/01/17,Congress questions govt. ‘silence’ on charge of favouring Adanis,"The Congress on Thursday questioned the ‘silence’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh over the allegations of ‘favouritism’ in the ₹45,000 crore 75-I Submarine project.

“The defence preparedness of India has been diluted and the Make in India made a platform of crony capitalism. Domestic production of Defence platforms compromised by PMO’s meddling and patronising Industrialist friends.The controversy and violation of procedures in Navy’s submarine project raises fundamental questions. PM cannot be above accountability,” Deputy Leader of the Congress in the Rajya Sabha Anand Sharma tweeted.

“PM’s & RM’s silence in the ₹45,000 Cr Submarines project is intriguing & raises further suspicion as to: 1. What is BJP Govt hiding? 2. Whay are PM/RM ‘mum’? 3. Why did Govt violate DPP,2016? 4. Why was ‘Empowered Committee’ of Navy overruled? 5. Is Govt batting for Adani Def?”asked Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala.

On Wednesday, Mr. Surjewala along with spokesperson Jaieer Shergil had addressed a press conference in which he alleged that the Union government was promoting crony capitalism in the defence purchases and accused the government of ‘promoting’ the Adani group to bag a multi-crore submarine manufacturing project even though the group had no prior ship building experience.

They charged the government with violating the Defence Procurement Procedure (DPP) of 2016 as well as over-ruling the recommendations of the ‘Empowered Committee’ of the Indian Navy that had been set up for the project.

The Congress leaders claimed that two key parameters set by the DPP were that the shortlisted company to manufacture the six submarines in the deal should be of Credit ‘A’ rating and the Ministry of Defence should approve a ‘Special Purpose Vehicle’ (SPV) set up for the project before applying for “request for expression of interest.”

Based on such criteria, the Empowered Committee of the Navy shortlisted the public sector unit Mazagon Docks Shipbuilders Limited and Larsen and Toubro from the private sector, claimed the Congress.

But the Opposition party claimed the government is all set to violate the Committee’s recommendations by allowing the private entity which neither has any experience in submarine manufacturing nor the required credit rating.

“Is zero experience criteria replacing the long technical criteria in Defence Procurement?”asked Mr. Shergil.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ggl9lv/article30579713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TH-ANAND,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/congress-questions-govt-silence-on-charge-of-favouring-adanis/article30579714.ece

The month-long celebrations are being organised by the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) in association with oil and gas companies to sensitise the people on the conservation of petroleum products. The PCRA will organise activities throughout the country to encourage behavioural change for sustainable development and environment protection.

Civil Supplies Commissioner Kona Sasidhar flagged off the publicity van of the PCRA. The publicity van will be used to spread awareness among the public in rural areas for various segments of users through audio and video presentations on fuels and energy-saving tips. The van will travel 1,800 km across the State for the next six weeks, covering about 40 km a day.

Mr. Sasidhar asked students to become ambassadors of conservation and spreading awareness on conservation. Consumer clubs at the school-level should be activated to spread the message of conservation. He also said that farmers can conserve fuel by following prescribed practices while using tractors and diesel pumps. The students can spread awareness amongst the households in their neighbourhood on good cooking habits, good driving habits like switching off engines of vehicles at traffic signals and car-pooling, he said.

At a press conference, the Minister shared a WhatsApp helpline number (8309887955) where passengers can report instances of excess fare being charged by private bus operators. The Minister said that stringent action would be taken in such cases.

Before Sankranti, Transport Department officials conducted raids, booked 3,132 cases and seized 546 buses for various violations, Mr. Venkataramaiah said, adding that the A.P. State Road Transport Corporation (APSRTC) had pressed additional buses into service to cater to the festival rush and advised people to make use of them.

Of the vehicles seized for violations, the highest number (202) was from Krishna district, followed by 198 buses in Visakhapatnam district. He said the surprise checks by the department would continue till Monday (January 20).

The Minister said that the government was aware of the fact that the private bus operators would fleece passengers during every festival, and so asked the Transport Department to conduct surprise checks and bring the violators to book.

The Minister urged people to give priority to safety and choose the APSRTC buses as their preferred mode of transportation.

Slams Pawan Kalyan

Referring to the alliance between Jana Sena Party (JSP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Minister accused JSP chief Pawan Kalyan of resorting to politics of opportunism. “Mr. Pawan Kalyan had criticised the failure of the TDP and the YSRCP governments to secure Special Category Status, denied to the State by the Modi government at the Centre.

92,2020/01/17,Dengue cases on the rise in Andhra Pradesh,"There has been a significant rise in the number of dengue cases in the State as compared to the previous year. While 2019 saw a total of 4,931 cases, 2018 had seen 3,972 cases.

Strikingly, the majority of dengue cases are being reported from urban areas, contrary to popular belief that the vector-borne disease is reported mostly from tribal and rural areas. Guntur, Visakhapatnam, and Kakinada stand at the forefront in urban areas where the maximum dengue cases were reported.

Visakhapatnam district alone made up for 1,201 dengue cases in 2019. East Godavari district reported 557 cases, while 894 cases were reported from Guntur district.

In 2017, there were 4,925 cases reported from across the State, similar to the scenario in 2019. Visakhapatnam consistently reported the most number of dengue cases, with 2,480 cases being reported in 2018.

“A door-to-door study conducted in Visakhapatnam revealed that there was stagnation of water in many houses. The stagnated water was found mostly in refrigerator trays and flower pots. In some other places in Prakasam district, water would be supplied only once in three days. This led to people storing water for many days. Areas where construction activity was picking up also saw a rise in dengue cases. These places became new breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The medical and health department has chalked out plans to work in coordination with line departments like Municipal Administration, Panchayat Raj and Rural Water Supply,” said an official requesting not to be named.

Focus on urban areas

The focus would be on information education and communication (IEC), water supply, mapping of cases, etc. As of now, daily reports from medical colleges are being pooled at the epidemic cell at the State office. The hotspots would be sent to the district collector, district medical and health officer (DMHO), and district malaria officer (DMO) concerned as and when the cases are reported. Special focus would be on urban areas in the near future, the official said.

In comparison, the number of malaria cases has come down significantly. While the total cases reported in 2017 were 16,972, it was 6040 in 2018. It has come down further to 2,940 in 2019, sources said. Based on the data of the last 10-12 years, the officials found that the malaria cases have come down to one-third of the cases reported a decade ago. There is a drop in the malaria cases from tribal areas too. This became possible due to many factors, including IEC. Both malaria and dengue are notified diseases.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/temcn0/article30589457.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18-VJ-DENGUEPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/dengue-cases-on-the-rise-in-state/article30589458.ece

The delegation told the Governor that people of all the 13 districts in the State were in favour of retaining the capital in Amaravati.

In a memorandum to the Governor, APS leaders A. Siva Reddy, Gadde Tirupati Rao and others stated that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s announcement in the Assembly that the State would have three capitals was a jolt to the people, and the recommendations of the expert committees only reflected the CM’s thinking.

‘Panic among farmers’

Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy’s statement created panic among the farmers who gave their valuable land for the construction of Amaravati, they said.

Protests against the three capitals move were going on for the last 30 days, they said. The police imposed curbs under Sec. 144 of the CrPC and Sec. 30 of the Police Act, notwithstanding the peaceful manner in which the aggrieved public were staging demonstrations for justice, they added.

Several persons had been arrested, and women were allegedly beaten up by the police, they complained.

The administration had been going on smoothly from Amaravati for the last five years, and the Chief Minister’s announcement created a lot of uncertainty, they observed.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/b9om6o/article30589404.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPG4-JAC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/aps-delegation-takes-capital-issue-to-governors-notice/article30589405.ece

Police Commissioner R.K. Meena said tight security would be in place for the programme. Traffic curbs had already been imposed on the Beach Road, which would be in force till the end of the programme, he added. Route maps were being prepared for the movement of VIPs, Mr. Meena said.

For a fool-proof security, entry and exit points would be arranged at several locations, it was learnt. Personnel of the Coastal Security Police (CSP) were also manning the entire coastal stretch in the district.

Committees constituted

Mr. Vinay Chand handed over the responsibility of making arrangements for the VVIPs to the Joint Collectors. He also constituted several committees to ensure a hassle-free and safe conduct of the programme.

“We have formed committees to take care of aspects such as welcoming the dignitaries, transportation, parking, seating, issue of passes, parade, high-tea, media, tableaux, sanitation, beautification, protocol, accommodation, etc. to make sure that the programme goes off well. All the committees will be headed by senior officials,” Mr. Vinay Chand said.

Mahender Reddy and general secretaries T. Siva Sankar and Bollisetti Satya, at the party office near Mangalagiri in Guntur district on Friday.

The meeting deliberated on how to take the alliance forward, starting with the ensuing elections to the local bodies and fighting over people’s issues, which was the objective of the regrouping of the former allies.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan said the party would extend all support to the activists who had been working for the party for a long time, and instructed that workshops be conducted for the active ones on important issues concerning the State from this month-end.

He directed the party leaders to prioritise the issues at the national and State levels to work along with the BJP.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/1gll8r/article30589384.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPG4-PAWAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pawan-discusses-the-way-forward/article30589385.ece
96,2020/01/17,Pawan a political freelancer: YSRCP,"YSRCP MLA and party spokesperson Gudivada Amarnath has questioned Jana Sena Party (JSP)’s political ideology and its president Pawan Kalyan’s commitment after he chose to align himself again with the BJP.

Addressing the media here on Friday, Mr. Amarnath siad that the JSP president had differed with the BJP after the 2014 elections and sailed with the Left parties and the BSP in 2019 elections.

After declaring that his ideologies matched with that of the Left parties, he entered into an alliance with the BJP unconditionally.

“One is at a loss to understand where the JSP stands,” Mr. Amarnath said, and termed Mr. Pawan Kalyan a “political freelancer.”

Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy implemented 70% of the poll promises and his regime had so far not attracted any charges of corruption, Mr. Amarnath said, and accused Mr. Pawan Kalyan of alleging family rule and corruption.

“Perhaps, he is under the impression that the TDP is still in power,” Mr. Amarnath said, and added that the JSP was working for TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu.

“With the firming up of an alliance with the BJP, the JSP is a closed chapter,” he observed.

Mr. Pawan Kalyan, by unconditionally joining hands with the BJP, was admitting that he gave up the demand for Special Category Status (SCS) and other issues pertaining to the State, Mr. Amarnath said, and claimed that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had been pursuing the issue of SCS with the Union Government.

‘Politics or films, choose one’

People had given a decisive mandate to the YSRCP in the 2019 elections, and Mr. Pawan Kalyan’s talk of third alternative held no water with his defeat in two constituencies, he asserted, and challenged the JSP president to contest for an MPTC or sarpanch post in the local body elections.

His allegation that Mr. Jagan Mohan Reddy had an understanding with the BJP also proved hollow with the JSP striking an alliance with the saffron party, Mr. Amarnath said.

The YRSCP leader advised Mr. Pawan Kalyan to choose between acting and politics, and not take up politics between shooting for films.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/fbulel/article30589372.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJPG4-AMARNATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pawan-a-political-freelancer-ysrcp/article30589373.ece
97,2020/01/17,Kadiyam railway station in Vijayawada meets electrical demands through solar energy,"The Kadiyam railway station in Vijayawada division has earned the rare distinction of becoming the first energy-neutral station in the South Central Railway (SCR) by meeting all its electrical demands through solar energy.

A roof-top solar energy plant, with 10 KWP on grid capacity, with bi-directional and net metering, has been installed in the Kadiyam station.

“On similar lines, Dwarapudi and Godavari stations in the Rajahmundry section in the division have been developed as energy-neutral stations with sufficient capacity to match its energy consumption,” said Vijayawada Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) P. Srinivas. He complimented the electrical and mechanical section officers and staff for the achievement.

Win-win situation

In the Kadiyam station, the entire electric load is taken from the solar power plant during day and the excess units generated from the plant is given to the Discom through net metering. During night, power is drawn from the Discom, which will be deducted from the energy supplied to the company during day. The power bill paid to the Discom is ‘zero’ from the Railways, the officials said.

The three stations have been equipped with all energy efficient equipment such as LED light, brushless DC electric motors, fans, star rated pumps and other material to minimise electrical consumption.

SCR General Manager Gajanan Mallya along with Principal Chief Electrical Engineer A.A. Phadke recently visited the Kadiyam railway station.

Vijayawada railway division has successfully converted three stations into energy-neutral ones as against the target of one station, for the year 2019-20, by harnessing solar energy, the DRM added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/l6et75/article30589339.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18VJRJKADIYAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kadiyam-station-blazes-a-new-trail/article30589340.ece

The institute was established by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) in 1939 to decipher and publish rare manuscripts. It was subsequently handed over to Sri Venkateswara University upon its establishment in 1956. From an impressive track record, the institute’s patronage touched a new low in recent decades in the form of dwindling number of takers for its enviable array of manuscripts.

At present, only 25 % of the 18,000-plus manuscripts are available in the digital format. “This means we have a lot of scope on the digitisation front and bring the manuscripts within the reach of researchers, publishers, litterateurs, Vedic and Sanskrit scholars,” T. Surendra Reddy, who took over the ORI as its Director, told The Hindu on Friday.

Soldiering on

Surprisingly, the last notification for the regular post of ORI Director was issued by the university in 2005 and it has ever since remained under the guidance of in-charge heads. The institute has just two regular faculty members, two research assistants and a curator-cum-librarian.

In spite of the faculty shortage and paucity of funds, it is bringing out a journal every six months.

99,2020/01/17,Govt. will go by people’smood on capital: Botcha,"While asserting that the government would take people’s aspirations into consideration on the development of the capital city before taking a final decision, Municipal Administration Minister Botcha Satyanarayana said Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy would not do injustice to the farmers who had parted with their land for the construction of Amaravati.

In fact, the Chief Minister wanted to extend more benefits to the farmers than what they were entitled to under the agreements signed by the previous government.

The government was not averse to talking to the farmers, Mr. Satyanarayana said, pointing out that he had allayed the apprehensions of farmers who met him earlier and complained that the annuity and pensions being paid to them were inadequate.

Responding to claims that the purported observations of IIT-Madras on the vulnerability of Amaravati to flooding were wrong, Mr. Satyanarayana said people could send emails to it (IIT-M) and get things clarified, and he would look into the issue as it kicked up a controversy.

Agriculture Minister K. Kanna Babu said a professor of IIT-M had, in fact, sent a communication to the chief engineer of the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) with regard to floods.

Speaking to mediapersons after attending the high-power committee (HPC) meeting chaired by Mr. Jagan at his camp office on Friday, Mr. Satyanarayana said members of the committee had apprised the Chief Minister of the manner in which the unified State of Andhra Pradesh had evolved since Independence, the developments after bifurcation, the regional imbalances that plagued it thereafter and the need to set them right.

HPC report today

The HPC would submit its report at the Cabinet meeting on Saturday (January 18). All issues would be discussed threadbare during the three-day Assembly session scheduled to commence on January 20.

On the possibility of Amaravati being flooded, Mr. Satyanarayana said the government had taken note of the reports of the expert committees (G.N. Rao and Boston Consulting Group).

The current location, where the bus depot stands, has in course of time turned busy with the unprecedented increase in the vehicular traffic.

On an average, about 5,000 private vehicles are estimated to reach Tirumala every day in addition to a fleet of RTC buses and local cabs numbering more than 700, doing multiple up and down trips to Tirupati.

The pilgrims are either forced to take a diversion or a long route to reach their destinations. The plight of the pilgrims hiring cabs is even worse as the paid taxis are not allowed to ply on the main routes during the peak hours by the traffic police.

The management, which took cognizance of the growing inconvenience caused to the pilgrims hiring private vehicles, had in 2011 resolved to go in for the construction of an outer ring road which remains incomplete till date.

110,2020/01/17,Lone elephant goes on a rampage near Chittoor,"A lone elephant, which strayed away from a herd of 15 jumbos from the neighbouring Tamil Nadu forests, kept trampling standing crops of paddy and groundnut at Dalavaipalle village of Yadamarri mandal, 15 km from here, on Friday morning. This has lead to panic among the farmers.

One youth injured

According to information, a huge male jumbo was spotted emerging from the fog at dawn today from the thickets and entering the fields. A big gathering of farmers and youth made an effort to drive it back into the thickets. But the elephant began charging at the crowds leading to a big commotion. Some youth armed with sticks went after the pachyderm, which took a turn and raced at them. In the melee, one youth fell down and was injured. However, the youth limped to his motorbike and fled the scene, thus saving himself. Later, the jumbo retreated into the thickets.

Forest officials from Chittoor and Palamaner rushed to the spot, and are overseeing the operation to track the elephant and drive it back into its habitat.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/lone-elephant-goes-on-a-rampge-near-chittor-in-ap/article30583081.ece

In a statement, CPI(M) State secretary P. Madhu said JSP president Pawan Kalyan, who had ridiculed the BJP in the past, had now formed an alliance with that party saying that he was doing so in the larger interests of the people in the State.

Pointing to the raging protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) across the country and attacks on students in universities by “fascist” forces “because of the policies of the BJP government at the Centre,” he said it was unfortunate that the JSP chose to align with such a party.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpim-slams-jsp-for-joining-hands-with-bjp/article30580106.ece
112,2020/01/17,Wild elephants give sleepless nights to Chittoor villagers,"Different herds of wild elephants from Koundinya Wildlife Sanctuary, and from the bordering forests of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, are raiding the standing crops of paddy at the villages of Bangarupalem and Yadamarri in western parts of Chittoor district for the past couple of days, giving sleepless nights to the farmers.

According to information, a 14-member herd was spotted along the forest fringe villages of Bangarupalem mandal a couple of days ago. The same herd has reportedly split into groups and is wreaking havoc in the fields in half a dozen hamlets abutting Bodabandla area. Similarly, farmers complained that a separate herd of two elephants - sub-adults - was giving them a harrowing time, lingering in the crops through the night, and retreating into the thickets at dawn. Their efforts to scare them away had failed.

Fog cover

Farmers at Bodabandla said the elephants are coming in large numbers after a hiatus of a couple of years and are raiding their crops. With fog engulfing the fields and forests, the farmers are finding it difficult to sight the animals both at dawn and dusk, making their night vigils in the fields risky. “We are not sure if the crop raiding elephants are from the Koundinya Sanctuary, or from the forests of the neighboring states,” the farmers said.

Moreover, it is learnt that once a herd strays from its habitat and moves into the fields, it would be a big challenge for the forest officials to drive them back. Sometimes, the operation takes weeks. Farmers suffer huge crop losses in the meantime.

At Yadamarri mandal, several farmers are in the grip of fear with wild elephants trampling their fields. Generally, the mandal would be safer from the crop raiding animals, since such instances were reported sporadically. However, this year, repeated sighting of the pachyderms have put them in a fix.

Efforts in vain

From January, the agriculture activity would pick up with lush, standing paddy and sugar cane crops. The wild elephants are known for their liking for paddy and sugarcane. Though forest officials had repeatedly sought the farmers to go in for alternative crops, the latter chose to ignore the same as they maintain that technically and economically, it would not be possible.

Forest personnel’s efforts to track the prowling elephants and drive them back into the thickets took a break with the ongoing Sankranti festival mood.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/j69pfv/article30580045.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-CHITTOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wild-elephants-give-sleepless-nights-to-chittoor-villagers/article30580047.ece
113,2020/01/17,Sailajanath is APCC president,"The appointment of Sake Sailajanath as president of the Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) has come as a shot in the arm for the party that has been getting weaker and voiceless for the past five months.

A vacancy was created after N. Raghuveera Reddy quit the post owning up responsibility for the very poor performance of the party in the general elections.

The decision of the leadership, based on the the recommendation of AICC general secretary Oommen Chandy, is being seen as timely.

The APCC, under Dr. Sailajanath, is also expected to thwart BJP’s machinations in the State.

Dr. Sailajanath, who had been elected twice from the Singanamala (SC) constituency in 2004 and 2009, is known as a strong Dalit leader. He is younger when compared to aspirants such as former Chief Minister N. Kiran Kumar Reddy, former Union Minister M.M. Pallam Raju and former MP Chinta Mohan. Dr. Sailajanath is also seen as a fighter when compared to the mild senior members.

Active Congress leader Kolanukonda Sivaji said that Dr. Sailajanath, being close to former Chief Minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, was an asset to the Congress in the present political climate.

APCC vice-president N. Tulasi Reddy, who has been the strongest voice of the party after the elections, was made the working president. Similarly, former MLA and minority leader Sk. Mastan Vali was made the second working president.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/sailajanath-is-apcc-president/article30580025.ece

Youths from nearby mandals, with their bulls in tow, gathered at the villages to participate in the event. Film actor M. Mohan Babu and his family members arrived at A. Rangampeta to witness the event.

Unlike in the last few years, the event was free of violence or casualties. A few youths sustained minor injuries in the melee.

115,2020/01/17,Tributes paid to farmers who died after move to shift capital,"As part of the ‘One State, One Capital’ campaign of the Save Amaravati Joint Action Committee, its members, comprising mainly those from the TDP and the CPI, paid tributes to the 18 farmers who had given their land for the capital and lost their lives.

Led by former District Grandhalaya chairman J. Ghouse Moiddin, they took out a rally and stood at the NTR Circle denouncing the YSRCP government’s proposal to shift the capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam.

They said that 28,000 farmers had sacrificed their lands for the State to have a world-class capital, but the government was not taking forward the construction activity and proposing to shift the capital, which would adversely impact the capital region farmers in Amaravati.

The activists lighted candles and paid tributes to the 18 farmers, who had lost their lives till date reportedly unable to put up with the uncertainty and other reasons.

The JAC leaders made an appeal to Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy to continue the capital in Amaravati and develop the other regions of the State.

“We are not against decentralised development. But the legislature and executive functions must be from one place. All heads of departments must sit at one place so that decisions can be taken without delay,” said CPI leader Sriramulu.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/tributes-paid-to-farmers-who-died-after-move-to-shift-capital/article30579940.ece
116,2020/01/17,No stone-pelting at Bojjanakonda this year,"For the fourth year in a row, a stone pelting ritual by villagers at the famous Buddhist site of Bojjanakonda was stopped on Thursday, thanks to efforts by heritage lovers, district officials and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).

Located at Sankaram village near Anakapalle, about 40 km from here, the Buddhist holy site would be pelted with stones and bricks on the third day of the Sankranti festival by villagers who believed that the site was the belly of a demon.

Several Buddhists and a few heritage enthusiasts visited the site on Thursday. The district administration and ASI also deployed a large number of people to prevent any attempt at continuation of the stone pelting ritual in the rock-cut caves.

The site shot into fame for its votive stupas, rock-cut caves, brick-built structural edifices, early historic pottery and Satavahana coins dating back to the 1st century AD. A large number of images of Buddha can be seen at this place. Lingalametta, located nearby, is also famous for its rock-cut monolithic stupas.

Aggrieved over the defacing of the historically important site, INTACH had sought the support of the district administration this time to prevent the practice of stone pelting. “We are very happy that due to sensitisation, the villagers are not indulging in pelting of stones,” INTACH Vizag chapter convener Mayank Kumari Deo told The Hindu.

“With the active participation by ASI and the district administration, not a single unpleasant incident was noticed on Thursday,” Jayashree Hatangadi, a heritage enthusiast, said.

The Tourism Department has plans to develop a Buddhist circuit to attract tourists from various parts of the world. The district is known for geological sites like Erra Matti Dibbalu (which is one of the 34 national geo-heritage sites recognised as important geological features in the country by the Government of India), Natural Arch in Visakhapatnam beach, Borra Caves and Buddhist sites of Thotlakonda, Bavikonda, Appikonda, Pavuralakonda and Bojjannakonda.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ijdmq/article30579923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17-VJ-BOJJANAKONDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/no-stone-pelting-at-bojjanakonda-this-year/article30579924.ece
117,2020/01/17,Ambati makes light of JSP-BJP alliance,"Making light of the tie-up between the Pawan Kalyan’s Jana Sena Party (JSP) and the BJP, YSRCP MLA Amabati Rambabu has said that the actor-turned-politician need not be taken seriously as he is known for his political instability.

The BJP and the JSP have not influenced voters in the elections, and such alliances are quite common before the elections.

“Our party does not respond to such issues. It will, however, respond to comments on our government,” Mr. Rambabu told reporters at Tadepalli on Thursday.

Mr. Rambabu also questioned Mr. Pawan as to why he had been silent on the issue of Special Category Status (SCS) to A.P.

“Instead of asking for SCS, why did Mr. Pawan go with the BJP?” he questioned.

“Did he not say that the BJP had given stale laddus to A.P.? Did the BJP give him fresh laddus now?” he wondered.

Stating that Mr. Pawan, along with TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu, had been trying to malign the government, Mr. Rambabu said that the YSRCP would not be cowed down by such “unholy alliances.”

Earlier, Mr. Naidu had sent MPs Sujana Chowdary and C.M. Ramesh to the BJP, and now he sent Mr. Pawan to that party, said Mr. Rambabu.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ambati-makes-light-of-jsp-bjp-alliance/article30579892.ece
118,2020/01/17,"BJP, Jana Sena revive alliance without TDP","The wheel has turned full circle for the BJP and Jana Sena Party (JSP) in Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) five years after bifurcation as they have revived their alliance sans the TDP with a joint victory in the 2024 elections as its primary objective. While regrouping, the BJP has clarified that it is not going to have any relation or understanding with the YSR Congress Party (YSRC) or the TDP.

Calling it a turning point, BJP State president Kanna Lakshminarayana said the two parties would together contest all elections from the ensuing polls for local bodies to general elections and fight the “anti-people policies” of the YSRCP government and take to legal recourse on substantive issues such as shifting capital city from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, if the situation warranted.

Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, Mr. Lakshminarayana said both the YSRCP and the TDP had pushed the State into dire straits by taking arbitrary decisions.

Kanna warns govt.

He said he was not considering January 20 when the proposal to shift the capital was likely to be cleared in the Assembly, as the deadline because the government took many controversial decisions such as the review of renewable power purchase agreements but it could not implement them. The government should, therefore, not think that it could act as per its whims and fancies, he observed.

JSP chief Pawan Kalyan said it was due to a communication gap that the two parties got separated earlier, but had in the last few months sorted out the differences in the interests of the State.

The JSP-BJP alliance was aimed at fighting against caste, corruption and dynastic politics in A.P. as both the YSRCP and the TDP had treated the State as their fiefdom, Mr. Kalyan said, asserting that it would emerge as a strong third alternative to the regional parties in A.P. and that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah have supported it.

BJP A.P. affairs in-charge Sunil Deodhar said the alliance was for the betterment of people of A.P. and the Central party conveyed its best wishes to it. BJP leaders G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, Daggubati Purandeswari and Somu Veerraju and JSP political affairs committee chairman Nadendla Manohar, former MLC Kandula Durgesh, and former Chief Secretary of Tamil Nadu P.

The occasion was used by the farmers at Annambotlavaripalem, Parchur, Karamchedu and other places to express their resentment over the YSRCP government’s three capitals move, leaving in the lurch their counterparts in Amaravati, who had sacrificed their land for the sake of the State.

Taking out protest marches, they demanded that Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy retain Amaravati as State capital.

“The district administration has ensured speedy justice to 10,071 petitions of the total 28,995 petitions received during the ‘Spandana’ programme. The rest of the pleas are being processed quickly,” says the Collector.

Vizianagaram district has secured the first rank among the districts in the State by disposing of 98.57 % of the total petitions, followed by West Godavari (97.93%) and Anantapur (97.36%), the Colletor say.

Mr. Jawaharlal says that the exclusive State-level workshop conducted in Vizianagaram had helped the officials understand the government’s commitment to redressing people’s grievances.

Follow-up action

“The petitioners need not do the rounds of government offices any more. They need to explain the issue to the officials at the Spandana Desk. They will be informed about the follow-up action taken within a stipulated time,” the Collector says.

The district administration has also undertaken several initiatives to ensure speedy justice to the petitioners.

The mandal level officials have been instructed to explain the reasons if satisfactory action could not be taken in certain cases.

The administration has observed that many petitions are related to revenue issues.

Many farmers have complained that they could not get the receive the benefits of loan waiver scheme for the delay in updating of their passbooks.

Occupation of individual properties, lack of roads, poor sanitation, insufficient infrastructure in hospitals and schools are also being brought to the notice of senior officials during the ‘Spandana’ programme.

121,2020/01/17,Flat owners expecting a spike in rental income in Vizag,"With the capital buzz generating a lot of heat, flat owners in the city are expecting a steep rise in the rental income.

Till recently, it was a problem of plenty for them. Due to boom in the construction of apartments, several flats, including those in the gated communities, were lying idle. The water problem during summer further complicated the problem, and many flat owners found it difficult to get tenants.

With the market experiencing a prolonged slump following economic slowdown, the realtors stayed away from taking up new ventures. But those already owning ready-to-occupy flats were at their wits’ end as most of them had been lying idle.

“With the proposal to set up the Executive capital in the city, somewhere near the Bhimili area, the sector is witnessing a boom, particularly in the areas such as Madhurawada, Kommadi, Anandapuram and Tagarapuvalasa,” CREDAI city chapter president B. Srinivas told The Hindu.

Speculation is rife that the process to shift the Secretariat and other important offices to Visakhapatnam will commence after the Assembly session on January 20.

The Millennium Towers, the Incubation Tower (erstwhile Startup Village) and the vacant buildings of IT companies at Rushikonda will be used to locate the HoD and other offices, government sources say.

“Amid hectic speculation, sites have unofficially been identified for allotment of plots to the Secretariat and other government employees at Mudasarlova, Simhachalam, Madhurawada and Anandapuram. This will lead to a spurt in house rents,” says Laxman Reddy, a builder who has taken up several middle income group (MIG) apartment ventures.

Flats vacant

There are about 1,500 to 2,000 vacant flats at Rushikonda, Yendada, Madhurawada and Kommadi, which will be close to the Secretariat and other offices if the Executive capital is established in the city.

Besides the VMRDA row houses and Harita apartments, many gated communities have several ready-to-occupy flats.

“Negotiations have already started, albeit unofficially, to book flats in bulk on lease. Owners of flats at the Lakeview Layout in Madhurawada, who found it difficult to get ₹10,000 per month for 3BHK, are now expecting ₹25,000 per month,” says a flat owner.

“Incidentally, the surge in demand for flats for employees and others after the Executive capital decision is taken may lead to shortage of housing for the IT employees in the vicinity,” says Rushikonda IT Park Association vice-president O. Naresh Kumar.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/6l9rza/article30579738.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VJPG4-ROWHOUSES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/flat-owners-expecting-a-spike-in-rental-income/article30579739.ece
122,2020/01/17,KRRS to stage protest today,"Is the Mandya district administration ‘unnecessarily’ releasing water to Tamil Nadu in an attempt to regain the charm of picturesque Gaganachukki waters falls of Cauvery, downstream Krishnaraja Sagar, to organise the ‘Jalapathotsava’ (festival of waterfalls)? This has been the cause of worry of farmers in the Cauvery basin ahead of Jalapathotsava, the two-day cultural festival of dance and music which will commence next to the waterfalls from Saturday. The quantum of water being discharged to Cauvery from KRS near Srirangapatna in the past few days has raised eyebrows. It is suspected that the purpose of augmenting the discharge was to revive the glory of the waterfalls near Malavalli of Mandya district for the festival.

The Gaganachukki falls are known for their breathtaking beauty and attract thousands of tourists every year. Nevertheless, it achieves its glory only during monsoon. The water from KRS was being discharged at the rate of 1,167 cusecs on January 13, 2020. It rose to 2,137 on the next day, 2,803 on January 15; 4,527 on January 16 and 4,550 cusecs on Friday. Surprisingly, according to sources at the Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Ltd. (CNNL), of the discharge, around 2,800 cusecs were for Visvesvaraya Canal.

Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) has accused the district administration of ‘illegally discharging’ water to revive the glory of the falls, and indirectly helping Tamil Nadu get water.

On Friday, KRRS members blocked Bengaluru-Mysuru highway to question the organisers. “The district administration has been taking ‘foolish steps’ to artificially rejuvenate the waterfall to conduct the festival,” Shambhunahalli Suresh, district president, KRRS, told The Hindu on Friday.

According to him, farmers were denied water to save crops during the crucial period in May last year in spite of holding protests for 10 days continuously. However, a huge quantum of water was being released to make the falls come alive now. Most of the crops are at the harvesting stage. Most of the water flowing in Visvesvaraya Canal for the past three days will also reach Tamil Nadu, he said.

Karnataka Pranta Raitha Sangha (KPRS) and Malavalli Taluk Paddy Growers’ Committee too staged protests outside the office of tahsildar in Malavalli and condemned huge sums being spent on the event. The State government and district administration have failed to procue paddy under the support price, KPRS president N.L. Bharat Raj told presspersons. Has the district administration obtained permission from the Cauvery Water Management Authority (CWMA), which is mandatory, before releasing water from the reservoir, asked Mr. Suresh.

K.M. Sathish Kumar, District Health Officer, at a press conference, here on Friday, said 872 booths would be set up to administer polio drops to 1.26 lakh children on the day. “We have estimated the number of houses to cover to be 4.47 lakh in the district.

To ensure children among migrating communities are also covered, he said his staff had estimated that there could be around 3.91 lakh people from different places. “We have identified 27,153 children among migrating families. We have worked out a plan to reach all these families,” he said.

K.P. Kantharaj, officer-in-charge of Reproduction and Child Health, said there had been no case of polio in the country since 2011. WHO declared India a polio-free country in 2014. “There are instances of polio in Pakistan and Bangladesh.

125,2020/01/17,Arkalgud residents to intensify protest against toll collection,"Residents of Arkalgud taluk have resolved to intensify their protests against toll collection on Hassan-Arakalgud-Periyapatna State Highway, citing that the road construction was technically flawed. They have put pressure on the district administration and the people’s representatives to stop the collection of the toll till all the lacunae in the work were attended to.

Maradi Somashekhar, retired executive engineer with NHAI and resident of Arakalgud, at a press conference here on Friday, said the road was technically flawed and it did not merit a user fee. The 73-km road was developed after spending over ₹243 crore by KRDCL. However, the work did neither reduce travel time nor offer comfort to travellers.

“On the 30-km stretch from Arkalgud to Hassan, there are about 150 rumblings. At every crossing, there are rumbling strips only to avoid accidents. With the experience of working as a technical advisor for road construction to Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I can say there is no other stretch of 30 km with so many strips,” he said.

He pointed out that the road should have been upgraded into a NH long ago. However, it was not upgraded for political reasons. “Now the KRDCL wants us to pay the user fee for the poor quality road,” he said.

S.P.Yoganna, president, Arkalgud Taluk Raitha Sangha, said a majority of the road users were farmers. “We have opposed the toll and continue to protest against the toll. Following our protest, the Hassan DC held a meeting and instructed officers to improve quality. We will intensify the protest if our demands are not fulfilled,” he said.

TruJet has launched its Belagavi-Mysuru-Belagavi flight under the Union government’s regional connectivity scheme UDAN (Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik). It has brought areas of northern and central Karnataka closer to Mysuru and surrounding regions.

A bus journey between the two cities takes nearly 12 hours. Besides, with the flight fares subsidised under UDAN, a flight now costs less than a luxury bus fare. Hence, the authorities are confident that the public patronage for the flight on this sector will be high.

The inaugural flight left Belagavi at 9.35 a.m. and reached Mysuru at 11 a.m. It was accorded the customary water cannon salute on landing. There were nearly 40 inbound passengers. In the return direction, the flight from Mysuru departed at 11.20 a.m. and reached Belagavi at 12.45 p.m. Again, there were almost 40 passengers on board the 72-seater aircraft.

The passengers on the inaugural flight were greeted with a rose from the stakeholders, including representatives of the hospitality sector, local industries, Arpitha Simha, wife of Mysuru MP Pratap Simha, and Mysuru airport MD R. Manjunath.

It had initially been announced that the same flight from Mysuru would fly to Kolhapur in Maharashtra, thus providing direct connectivity to the pilgrim centre. However, TruJet has deployed the flight on the Belagavi-Hyderabad sector, said Mr. Manjunath. With the launch of the flight to Belagavi, all the new routes sanctioned to Mysuru under UDAN-3 have become operational. The routes allotted under the third round of the UDAN scheme last year included flights from Mysuru to Goa, Kochi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Belagavi. Bidding for new routes under UDAN-4 has already commenced, and the authorities are hoping that Mysuru will get additional flights.

However, there is a temporary suspension of flights to Kochi as the airport runway there is being re-carpeted. In addition to these sectors, there is flight connectivity to Chennai and Kalaburagi as well, and now efforts are on to provide air connectivity from Mysuru to Coimbatore, Mangaluru, Tirupati, and Shirdi, said Mr. Manjunath.

Expressing happiness over the flight operations, Bhaskar Kalale, chairman of CII, Mysuru, said regular flights to the city would have a positive bearing on business and trade. It will help create jobs and facilitate the region’s growth, he said.

Stakeholders from the hospitality sector expressed similar views and said that flight connectivity had given a fresh push to the tourism sector.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/tn1epi/article30589348.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGMYSURUFLIGHT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-belagavi-flight-takes-off/article30589350.ece

128,2020/01/17,"Flybus from Mysuru airport to Ooty, Madikeri soon","The authorities are planning to introduce a Flybus service from Mysuru airport to Ooty and to Madikeri in Kodagu for the benefit of tourists. This is based on an extensive survey and public feedback. Talks are on with the KSRTC to introduce the service, according to Mysuru airport director R. Manjunath.

He said that a meeting was scheduled with the KSRTC authorities next week after which the Flybus services are expected to be launched from the city airport. It will benefit tourists coming to Mysuru and wanting to go directly to either Ooty or Madikeri, he added.

With regard to connecting the city with the airport located at Mandakalli, Mr. Manjunath said there is an arrangement with the KSRTC for a service coinciding with the arrival of flights. As the Mysuru airport has received traction under UDAN with 16 flights movements a day – both inward and outward –, the security apparatus is set to be beefed up.

Karnataka State Industrial Security Force (KSISF) will be inducted to the airport. Pratap Reddy, ADGP (Internal Security), held a discussion with the airport authorities in Mysuru recently. Mr. Manjunath said they expect about 50 KSISF staff to be deployed at Mysuru airport in due course. “We already have nearly 45 to 50 security personnel drawn from the Police Department and the KSISF will decide on how many can be retained out of them,” he added.

The airport has also procured a bomb suit to be worn by trained staff while diffusing explosives. The airport is fully secure but the latest in terms of equipment are being procured to handle any emergency, said Mr. Manjunath.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flybus-from-mysuru-airport-to-ooty-madikeri-soon/article30589328.ece
129,2020/01/17,"State identifies 30,000 acres of land for industrialists","Karnataka has identified 30,000 acres of land across several districts for industrialists and it has also taken the final steps to acquire 12,000 acres of it, under Land Acquisition Act, according to Industries Minister Jagadish Shettar.

Speaking to the media here on Friday, Mr. Shettar said his government was also planning to recover unutilised industrial land from investors to build a fresh land bank for potential investors.

As a precursor to this, he said, the government was in the process of conducting an unused-land survey across the State. The State is also planing to introduce a special clause and a new industrial policy.

As per Mr. Shettar, this year’s edition of Global Investors’ Meet, scheduled in November this year, is likely to bring in fresh investors and investments to several tier II and tier III cities of the State.

“We have been asking industries to invest in secondary cities as suitable land parcels are already available in Mysuru, Mangaluru, Hassan, Hubballi-Dharwad, Belagavi and Kalaburagri,” said Mr. Shettar.

Responding to a media query on the conversion of the lease of 3,667 acres of land to JSW Steel in Ballari into a sale deed, he said the government was still examining the matter and a final decision would be taken at the Cabinet meeting.

“We are yet to decide the land rate for JSW Steel. We are reworking on the earlier agreement and will take a legal opinion before announcing the final final decision,” Mr. Shettar added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/state-identifies-30000-acres-of-land-for-industrialists/article30589223.ece
130,2020/01/17,Pulse polio vaccination drive in Karnataka tomorrow,"A Statewide pulse polio vaccination drive will be taken up for children below the age of five in a single round on Sunday.

Announcing this at a press conference in Bengaluru on Friday, Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu said the drive would target 64,65,561 children in the State. It will be taken up from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The Health Department has set up 33,021 booths to administer polio drops. In addition to this, as many as 1,09,554 workers, 7,105 supervisors, and 977 mobile teams are geared up to take up the drive, the Minister said.

Appealing to parents to make use of the opportunity, he said volunteers and Health Department staff would also take up door-to-door visits for three days after the completion of the vaccination drive to identify children who missed out and administer polio drops to them.

The drive will focus on districts such as Bidar, Kalaburagi, Raichur, Yadgir, Koppal, Chitradurga, Ballari, Davangere, Haveri, Gadag, and Vijayapura, particularly the slums, hilly areas, construction hubs, brick kilns and tribal areas there, he said. There will be drives at railway and metro stations and at bus stands and airports.

People can identify the nearest vaccination centre using the Android app ‘Nearby Vaccination Centre, Karnataka’, Mr. Sriramulu said.

Saying that several schemes would be announced in the State Budget to improve health services, the Minister said there was a proposal to introduce a “pink bus” scheme on the lines of the 108 ambulance scheme.

‘State considering bringing back Yeshaswini’

Mr. Sriramulu on Friday said the State government was considering reintroducing the Yeshaswini health scheme.

He said discussions were on about the possibility of reintroducing the scheme, which was popular with farmers in particular. Yeshaswini is now merged with the Ayushman Bharat scheme. Admitting that people were facing inconveniences because of glitches in the Ayushman Bharat scheme of the Centre, Mr. Sriramulu said the anomaly would be rectified in 15 to 20 days when a new software is put to use.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/pulse-polio-vaccination-drive-in-karnataka-tomorrow/article30589038.ece
131,2020/01/17,Karnataka ranks sixth in justice delivery: report,"Karnataka ranked sixth in the country’s first-ever ranking on justice delivery, “India Justice Report 2019” supported by Tata Trusts.

Daksh, a city-based organisation working on research in judiciary, a partner with Tata Trusts in bringing out the report, released the Karnataka scorecard in the city on Friday. The report evaluates justice delivery as a function of performance of four pillars — police, prisons, judiciary, and access to legal aid over the last five years.

Karnataka ranks third in prisons and sixth in police. But it ranks 16th in judiciary and seventh in legal aid, bringing down the overall ranking to six, among 18 large and medium States. Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, and Haryana rank ahead of the State in that order. Each of these pillars are evaluated on six parameters including budgets, human resources, diversity, infrastructure, workload, and trends over the last five years. Non-utilisation of funds, vacancies and lack of infrastructure in rural areas, that have emerged as trends across the country, ails the State as well.

The judiciary in Karnataka ranks 16 among 18 medium and large States. On a score of 10, Karnataka is 3.76. On the performance of judiciary, only Bihar and Uttar Pradesh rank below the State. The report finds the Karnataka High Court functioning at half its sanctioned capacity, as on 2016-17, the data considered for the report. It also finds that “over five years, vacancies and cases pending at both High Court and subordinate court increased even as case clearance rates fell.” The State fared poorly in coverage of legal service clinics across villages and jails.

Responding to the report, Justice R.V. Raveendran, former Supreme Court judge, said while the report had done a good job in data collection, he said the ranking could not be done based on the limited criteria considered. “Karnataka judiciary is one of the best in the country. And a ranking of 16 among 18 States does not reflect the reality. Vacancies in the High Court may have led to drop in ranking, but people will take it as a larger reflection of the State of judiciary and its integrity,” he said.

On policing, it notes that one out of five constable posts were vacant and the vacancies have only been increasing over the last five years. Only 27% of the police modernisation funds had been used in 2016-17, the last available data. The bright spot in police performance has been that it is the only State to have nearly met all its diversity targets, except gender. As against a declared target of 20% women composition of the force, the State has been lagging in the last five years, the report said. The State may rank third in prisons, but only two of three correctional staff positions had been filled and one correctional officer looked after 7,500 inmates, the report found.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/dnlrsq/article30588870.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGPRISON,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/karnataka-ranks-sixth-in-justice-delivery/article30588871.ece

The committee has been constituted at a time when questions are being asked about the delay in initiating action against land sharks based on the A.T. Ramaswamy committee. The committee had been formed during the JD(S)-BJP coalition regime in 2006. The committee had submitted its interim report in February 2007 and final report in July 2007.

The Cabinet also gave administrative approval for increasing the capacity of Hemavati canal in the stretch of 0 to 70 km from 1,200 cusecs to 2,400 cusecs at a cost of ₹475 crore. In the first phase, works to the tune of ₹250 crore would be taken up, said Mr. Madhuswamy.

It also decided to build special godowns in all 30 district centres to house EVMs and VVPATs at a cost of ₹123 crore. Such a decision had been taken as per the advise of the Election Commission of India, Mr. Madhuswamy said.

The Cabinet decided to extend the term of the special task force that had been formed by the Lokayukta to probe illegal mining cases by one more year.

136,2020/01/17,To have or not have 4 working presidents turns tricky for KPCC,"Although the Congress high command is said to have more or less finalised the name of D.K. Shivakumar as KPCC president, the issue of whether or not to have four working presidents has delayed the process of a formal announcement, according to sources.

Sources in the party told The Hindu that former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has suggested that four working presidents in KPCC would be a good idea to balance caste equations and regional representation.

However, All India Congress Committee (AICC) interim president Sonia Gandhi is not in favour of four working presidents as it would mean creating parallel power centres. “She is apprehensive as a similar arrangement in Delhi had failed. But as the suggestion has come from Mr. Siddaramaiah, she is wary of ignoring it,” sources said.

Sources said that Mr. Siddaramaiah during his recent meeting with the high command had suggested that four candidates from prominent communities — SC, ST, Minority and Lingayat — representing four revenue divisions of the State be appointed as working presidents.

He suggested that it is desirable to continue the incumbent working president Eshwar Khandre, who represents the Lingayat community. He is also learnt to have recommended the names of former Chamarajanagar MP R. Dhruvanarayan or former Minister H.C. Mahadevappa (representing SC community) Satish Jarkiholi (ST) and B.Z. Zameer Ahmed or U.T. Khader (Minority) for three additional working presidents. Besides, he also recommended former Minister M.B. Patil for the post of Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader, sources said.

“However, there is a difference of opinion on the issue between the original Congressmen and Mr. Siddaramaiah’s faction. Several senior leaders, Mr. Shivakumar, who is the frontrunner for the president’s post, are opposed to the idea,” said sources in the Congress.

“All the names suggested for the posts of working presidents are from Mr. Siddaramaiah’s faction. If at all there should be any additional working presidents, original Congressmen should be accommodated. Anyone appointed as KPCC president should be given a freehand, and having more working presidents will further create differences in the party. The focus should be on strengthening the party now,” said a senior leader.

Mr. Siddaramaiah had earlier recommended Mr. Patil’s name for the president’s post. If he is not chosen for the president’s post, he should be made CLP leader, Mr. Siddaramaiah is learnt to have suggested. “The high command may not want to totally set aside the suggestions made by the former Chief Minister. This is why the situation has become really tricky and is further delaying the resolution of leadership issue,” the sources added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nvniml/article30591416.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGCONGRESSOFFICE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/to-have-or-not-have-4-working-presidents-turns-tricky-for-kpcc/article30588335.ece
137,2020/01/17,Policemen penalised for registering FIR under non-existent law,"The High Court of Karnataka has imposed costs of ₹10,000 each on a police inspector and an assistant sub-inspector for registering a First Information Report (FIR) against a woman under a non-existent provision. She was charged under the Information Technology Act for posting on her Facebook page a letter containing a forged signature of the then Home Minister M.B. Patil.

Justice P.S. Dinesh Kumar passed the order while quashing the criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioner, Sharada D.R. alias Sharada Diamond, a resident of K.R. Puram.

Police inspector Ravi Patil and assistant SI M. Somanna will have to pay the costs to the court’s registry. Both officers had tendered an unconditional apology to the court for registering the FIR under Section 66A, which was struck down by the apex court in 2015.

The Srirampura police in the city had, on April 25, 2019, registered the FIR based on a complaint by J. Saravana, who alleged that the petitioner had posted the fake letter on Facebook on April 16 and written some comments against Mr. Patil to tarnish his image.

Though the police only entered the complaint on April 17 in the non-cognizable register, a week later an FIR was booked quoting the non-existent provision of the law. According to the petitioner, the police acted under “political pressure”.

The court termed the conduct of the two officers “nothing but a clear abuse of the process of law and harassment of [a] citizen”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/policemen-penalised-for-registering-fir-under-non-existent-law/article30588279.ece
138,2020/01/17,KMF faces uphill task to keep both customers and farmers happy,"The Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) is trying to juggle keeping farmers happy while not burdening its customers. For, the Centre has conveyed its unhappiness over the grant of ₹5 per litre as financial assistance to farmers, which has made the already cash-strapped State government wary of increasing the assistance, according to top KMF sources.

The State government is yet to notify the additional ₹1 hike announced by the previous Janata Dal (S)-Congress government, and KMF sources say that it is very unlikely that the BJP government will do so. On the other hand, the federation is under pressure from milk unions and farmers to get the hike implemented.

“The Centre has informally expressed unhappiness over the financial assistance being given to farmers. Its argument is that such a mechanism does not exist in any other State milk federation. We are not confident of the government agreeing to the ₹1 hike announced by the earlier regime,” a KMF source said.

Sources said that instead of depending on government support, the federation was now asking for a price hike of ₹3 per litre, with ₹1 being transferred to farmers. “This will take the financial assistance to ₹6 per litre,” the source said.

Cattle insurance

Meanwhile, a proposal to insure cattle or compensate their death, expected to cost the exchequer about ₹120 crore a year, has also been made to the government. This is also not expected to be accepted. According to sources, the issue was discussed at an informal meeting between the KMF chairman and the Chief Minister, but the federation is not hopeful of it being cleared.

“The ₹3 hike is keenly awaited by the KMF because it will not only help pass on the additional ₹1 to farmers, but will also create a fund to secure them in case of cattle death. Of the ₹3 hike, 50 paise could be used to create a pool to provide a compensation of ₹50,000 to ₹60,000 in case of a cow death,” a source in KMF said.

There are about 25 lakh head of cattle belonging to farmers who sell milk to the federation, and about 20,000 cattle deaths are reported each year.

There are plans, sources said, to utilise the rest of the money by giving 50 paise per litre to village-level milk societies, which occupy an important role in milk procurement. A similar amount will be used to increase the commission of agents who sell milk and milk products in the market. “The federation will keep 50 paise for its operational costs. Every one in the value chain benefits,” the source said.

Decision on hike

A decision on hiking the price of milk could be made in a couple of days as the KMF board, which met on Friday, authorised chairman Balachandra Jarkiholi to discuss the matter with Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa.

After the board meeting, Mr. Jarkiholi told The Hindu that he, along with the KMF managing director and the Secretary of Animal Husbandry, would discuss the issue before taking it up with the CM. “He has assured us of arriving at a decision in a couple of days,” Mr. Jarkiholi said, adding that milk price hike was inevitable.

He said that the hike demand from 14 district milk unions varies from ₹2 to ₹4 a litre.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kjp3yb/article30588001.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGKMF,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/kmf-faces-uphill-task-to-keep-both-customers-and-farmers-happy/article30588002.ece
139,2020/01/17,"Concerns raised over effects of CAA, NRC","Speakers at a seminar on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens ( NRC) here on Thursday have expressed apprehensions of them harming large sections of society.

In his address, retired professor of Hampi Kannada University Chandra Poojary said that they would harm the interests of Muslims as well as the unorganised sector workers.

“NRC enumerators will seek details on domicile, date of birth and place of birth of the parents and grandparents. In India, there are six crore nomadic, 12 crore tribals, and 20 crore landless people. How can they show their documents? This apart, people would be forced to roam from pillar to post to collect documents,” he said.

S. Sasikanth Senthil, former IAS officer, said: “By invoking the CAA and the NRC, the government is applying a rule of fascism in the country. They will create an illusionary world and people will fall prey to this fascism. Those raising voice against it will be portrayed as villains”.

Earlier, inaugurating the programme, veteran trade union leader K.S. Sharma said that the time is ripe for people to evaluate the BJP’s administration.

“The country is being divided on the religious lines which is unlawful. Anti-CAA rallies should become a people’s movement and all the suppressed classes should get united,” he added.

Addressing presspersons here on Friday, Mr. Shivashankar said that unnecessary issues were being brought to cover up the Union government’s failure on different fronts, including creation of jobs.

Mr. Shivashankar said that the Union government had totally neglected social security and job security and had introduced bonded labour in the name of training under National Employability Enhancement Mission (NEEM), Regulations, 2017.

Under these regulations, the workers had been deprived of facilities like ESI, Provident Fund, Gratuity and others, he alleged.

Mr. Shivashankar said that TUCC was holding its 10th annual conference at Gokul Garden in Hubballi on Saturday and Sunday [January 18 and 19] and various issues related to the workers of unorganised sectors would be deliberated upon.

He said there were lot of labour issues and the workers were being exploited by the industrialists particularly those owned by by big industrial houses and corporate houses.

To a query, he said that the conference was a continuation of the nationwide strike by trade unions held recently.

A list of 12 main demands will be passed after deliberations during the conference, he said.

Mr. Shivashankar pointed out that the municipal administration in Hubballi did not give them permission for displaying TUCC flags on the road leading to the venue of the conference citing a High Court order.

“However today we see BJP flags and buntings on important roads of Hubballi. This is nothing but a dual policy and efforts to snub democratic voices,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/centre-brought-in-caa-nrc-to-divert-focus-from-peoples-problems/article30587518.ece

“India is reeling under economic slowdown, poverty and unemployment. The atrocities on Dalits, women, Adivasis and working masses have phenomenally increased. The BJP-led government at the Centre has completely failed to address these issues. That is why it has come up with unconstitutional CAA and NRC simply to divert the attention of the masses. It is not just the divide and rule policy inherited by the British, it is also a divert and rule devised by the BJP itself,” R. K. Hudgi, an activist-intellectual, said.

145,2020/01/17,Migrant workers to be vaccinated against Kyasanur Forest Disease,"The Department of Health and Family Welfare has decided to issue a direction to the arecanut cultivators in areas affected by Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) to get migrant workers vaccinated.

Five positive cases of the disease have been reported in Tirthahalli taluk since January 1. This includes two migrant workers, one from Tarikere and another person from Assam. They were hired for arecanut harvesting in a plantation in Sindhuwadi village in Mandagadde Grama Panchayat limits.

The officials of the Department of Health and Family Welfare have said the plantation was located in the forest fringe in Sindhuwadi where they have come to contact with the ticks that spread the disease from monkeys to humans.

The workers arrived in Sindhuwadi in third week of December. The locals here were vaccinated against the disease. However, as the personnel from the department in charge of vaccination were not aware about the presence of the migrant workers in the village, they could not be covered under the vaccination drive.

In the wake of the incident, the department has decided to issue direction to the arecanut cultivators in the affected areas to take measures to ensure that the migrant workers in their plantations get vaccinated against KFD. The cooperation of Department of Horticulture and local gram panchayat will also be taken to reach out to the plantation workers.

Since January 1, as many as seven positive cases of KFD were reported in the district of which one person has died. The health condition of the remaining six patients is being closely monitored.

Meanwhile, blood sample of a woman from Hagare village in Sagar taluk, who was hospitalised on Monday with high fever and pain in the joins, has tested negative for KFD.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/migrant-workers-to-be-vaccinated-against-kfd/article30582744.ece

Members of the Bar association had announced last week that they would not appear for the woman on the grounds that her action was anti-national in nature. She had taken part in a protest to express solidarity with the students of Jawaharlal Nehru University and had carried the “Free Kashmir” placard and later regretted her act.

Reacting to the Bar association's decision, the progressive groups made an appeal on Thursday and, citing relevant sections of the law, sought to remind the Mysuru Bar association members that every citizen of the country had a right to be represented by a lawyer in the court of law.

The event is attracting a large crowd, primarily children who are enjoying the festival of flowers and fruits with their friends and families.

As against the attendance during the day, there is a large crowd in the evening till close to 10 p.m. enjoying the show of flowers and fruits.

The three-day event, which will end on Friday, is being held not only to provide recreational facility to the locals here but also to promote government schemes. “It was a long pending demand of the people here to host such an event which is being done in several districts. But for some reasons, we could not organise it. However, this time, we decided to organise it without fail to coincide with the ongoing Siddeshwara Jatra which is a major event in the district,” said Deputy Director, Horticulture Department, Santosh Inamdar.

Speaking to The Hindu, he said that the decision was taken just about a fortnight ago and preparations were made for the event.

“Since the decision was taken late, we could not organise the event on a grand scale. However, since we wanted to resume the event that was stopped years ago, we decided to do it on a smaller scale. We thought that it could be arranged on a grander scale from the next year,” he said.

Mr. Inamdar said that ideally, the preparations should start at least two months in advance where flowers and grass could be grown locally.

“Cultivation of flowers and grass saves a lot of money against purchasing flowers from the market. This time, we used government funds of around ₹ 5 lakh and also some donations of around ₹ 2 lakh from local businessmen,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/qco4ks/article30580172.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGVIJAYAPURAFLOWERFRUITS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/flower-fruit-exhibition-draws-large-crowd/article30580174.ece

151,2020/01/17,HKCCI expresses apprehensions over someareas being transferred to new railway zone,"Hyderabad Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HKCCI), a body of industrialists and traders from Kalyana Karnataka region, has expressed reservations on the formation of the South Coastal Railway Zone of the Railways with its headquarters in Vishakapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. It has expressed apprehensions over some of the railway areas in Kalyana Karnataka region being transferred to the new zone.

In a letter to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday, Amarnath C. Patil and Shasikanth B. Patil, president and secretary of HKCCI, respectively, have said that they feared that places such as Nalwar, Yadgir and Raichur, among others, in Kalyana Karnataka region would get transferred to the newly formed zone based at Vishakapatnam which is far away at a distance of 850 km from the region.

“It is unfortunate that Kalyana Karnataka region gets divided into four Railway zones resulting in non-development of railway infrastructure in the region. Also, it will result in the region having left with the most neglected areas from the point of view of railway development. We strongly oppose the shifting of Nalwar, Yadgir and Raichur and other places of Kalyana Karnataka region to the jurisdiction of the newly formed South Coastal Railway Zone at Vishakapatnam as it is against the railway interests of the people of this region and request you to withhold such transfer forever,” they said. Reminding the Railway Minister of the long-pending project of setting up a new Railway Division with its headquarters in Kalaburagi (the project was sanctioned in 2014 and the foundation stone was also laid in the same year at Wadi Junction by the then Railway Minister in the presence of the Chairman, Railway Board and Chief Minister of Karnataka), they requested the Minister to exclude the areas that were supposed to be part of the already sanctioned Railway Division at Kalaburagi from the newly formed South Coastal Railway Zone.

“It is a pity that Kalyana Karnataka region in the map of the Railways is fragmented among four Railway Divisions and a railway commuter has to run between these four Railway Divisions spread in four directions, for redressal of any railway grievances. That apart, all the district headquarters such as Kalaburagi, Bidar, Raichur and Yadgir within the jurisdiction of Kalyana Karnataka region are geographically located at the tail end of the Railway Divisions and are deprived of any railway amenity,” they said and demanded that the Kalaburagi Railway Division Project be implemented putting all the railway stations in Kalyana Karnataka region under it.

“The Railway Division at Kalaburagi was recommended by the Sareen Committee along with other Railway Divisions across the country, as far back as 1984. All the Railway Divisions recommended by this committee have been established and made functional leaving the Railway Division at Kalaburagi high and dry. It was in 2014 that the Government of India sanctioned the Kalaburagi Railway Division and also a foundation stone was also laid. Further, this was followed by acquisition 42 acres of land at Kalaburagi for the establishment of the Kalaburagi Railway Division. The Railways has taken possession of the acquired land and has fenced it for the purpose of establishment of the Railway Division,” they said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/hkcci-expresses-apprehensions-over-someareas-being-transferred-to-new-railway-zone/article30580141.ece

The organisers, led by Congress leader Ashfaq Kumtakar, Babajan Mudhol, activist Siddu Teji and others, had planned to launch a campaign against CAA and NRC and wanted to paste stickers outside houses in Ganeshpet locality. The protesters had come armed with stickers with the words “No CAA, No NRC”. However, the police did not allow them to go ahead with the campaign or distribute the stickers.

Addressing the protesters, the speakers said the Centre was trying to divide the country on religious lines. They said with CAA, the burden of proving one’s citizenship will fall on citizens. They said the Union government was trying to divert the attention of the public from real issues such as unemployment and economic slowdown.

The protesters subsequently staged a demonstration by the roadside. They also urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah not to visit Hubballi for his pro-CAA rally, scheduled on Saturday, and raised slogans against him.

A few days ago, the District Congress Committee had announced that it planned to launch a counter-campaign and stage a black flag protest against Mr. Shah’s proposed visit.

153,2020/01/17,Mandya district administration draws flak for using rental bikes at rally,"Nearly 70 people participated in the ‘Bullet Rally’ (Royal Enfield motorcycle) organised here on Thursday to promote ‘Gaganachukki Jalapathotsava’ (festival of waterfalls), a two-day cultural festival of dance and music that will be held next to the picturesque Gaganachukki waterfalls of Cauvery, near Malavalli, from Saturday.

K. Annadani, MLA for Malavalli, Mandya Deputy Commissioner M.V. Venkatesh, Additional Deputy Commissioner T. Yogesh and others inaugurated the rally by riding bikes. The ‘Mandya to Gaganachukki bike rally’ was to promote the event, Mr. Anandani said.

Most of the bikes were from motorcycle-renting firms and the fuel expenses were borne by the district administration. This move received criticism from various sections of society.

The authorities concerned had organised the bike rally ahead of the event, in which a majority of the participants used rental vehicles despite the district having a good number of similar bikes, said theatre artist Yogesh. The main aim of the rally was to promote the bike rental company and the brand. Unfortunately, the authorities spent the public’s money for this, said Ravi, an avid biker from Chamundeshwari Nagar. “The MLA, DC and others inaugurated the rally by riding the bikes. It was too unfortunate. Instead of promoting private vehicle companies and their bikes, they could have organised a vintage vehicle rally,” he added.

Vintage vehicles

According to some other bike owners, the rally was an extravagant display of such bikes. Instead, riders from the district who own similar bikes or people having vintage vehicles could have been given an opportunity.

Harish, Assistant Director of the Department of Tourism, told The Hindu that the mistake would not be repeated.

154,2020/01/17,"Medical professionals take to the streets in Kalaburagi against CAA, NRC","Thousands of medical and paramedical professionals and students took to the streets in Kalaburagi on Thursday, protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Holding placards and banners that displayed slogans against CAA and NRC, the protesters gathered at SVP Circle at 11 a.m. and formed a human chain before marching to the district administrative complex, where they staged a demonstration.

Dr. Irfan, one of the organisers, said the people who were agitating against CAA had read and understood it, and then come out to protest against it, as it was communal in nature and violated Articles 14, 15, 21 and 25 of the Constitution.

He also saluted the “brave” students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and other universities who were fearlessly taking to the streets against the Act that “sought to discriminate and divide people along communal lines”. As he said this, the large number of protesters responded with the slogan “we are with you, brave students”.

Rahul Tamann, a paediatrician, said CAA and NRC were not just anti-Muslim, but also anti-people as a whole. “There is a conscious attempt to project CAA and NRC as anti-Muslim so that the community can be isolated and the rest of the communities, particularly the Hindus, be polarised against Muslims. The fact, however, is that CAA-NRC combined is anti-people as it affects the poor sections of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes as well. After the NRC exercise in Assam, 19 lakh people could not prove their citizenship as they were unable to provide the required documents. Of them, only five lakh were Muslims; the majority were Hindus,” he said.

Mr. Tamann also claimed that the Union government was diverting the public’s attention from real issues such as poverty, joblessness, illiteracy and economic crisis with this row. “BJP leaders had made tall promises about the development of the country and the welfare of its citizens. On failing to fulfil their promises, they have now triggered the CAA-NRC debate to take the spotlight away from their failures,” he said.

Dr. Shakeel Khan read out a memorandum before the agitators and then handed it over to a representative of the Deputy Commissioner’s office. The memorandum lists many demands such as conducting a judicial inquiry into the police action against anti-CAA protesters across the country, particularly in universities such as JNU and AMU, apart from the repeal of CAA.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/512u3b/article30579876.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGKALABURAGIPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/medical-professionals-take-to-the-streets-in-kalaburagi-against-caa-nrc/article30579877.ece

A release said SWR was given the target of commissioning VSS in nine stations in the first phase — Ballari with 33 cameras, Belagavi (36), Vasco da Gama (36), Bengaluru Cantonment (21), Bangarapet (36), Hassan (36), Krishnarajapuram (25), Shivamogga Town (24), and Sri Satya Sai Prashanti Nilayam (20). They are all in place now. SWR is the first zone in Indian Railways to have completed work under phase 1, according to the release.

The Integrated Security System comprising CCTV cameras and baggage scanner at entry points was already put in place at Bengaluru, Mysuru and Yeshwantpur before the provision of VSS. CCTV cameras were earlier functional at Hubballi with 54 cameras, Hosapete (19), Koppal (8), Londa (13), Castle Rock (10), Vijayapura (6), Dharwad (6), Gadag (2), Bengaluru (71), Yeshwantpur (35), and Mysuru (34). Now, with the completion of phase 1 of VSS, SWR has functional CCTV systems at 20 stations, the release said.

Second phase

In the second phase of the project, VSS is planned in 21 more stations — Arsikere, Bagalkot, Banaswadi, Bhadravati, Vijayapura, Birur, Gadag, Harihar, Haveri, Hindupur, Hosapete, Hosur, Koppal, Londa, Mandya, Thorngallu, Tumakuru, Yelahanka, Davangere, Dharwad, and Kengeri. Work is expected to be completed by 2020-21.

The release said security personnel can monitor these cameras 24x7, not only from station control rooms but also from the Divisional Central Security control rooms located at the divisional headquarters at Hubballi, Mysuru and Bengaluru. This system has the features of video surveillance, face detection, detection of leftover luggage, among other things. Footage from all the cameras will be stored in a hard disk for up to 30 days and can be retrieved at a later date for analysis, the release said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gxwp7f/article30579834.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGRAILWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/upgrade-for-security-apparatus-at-railway-stations-across-state/article30579835.ece
157,2020/01/17,"Ranitidine not banned, claim doctors","A group of doctors from prominent government hospitals in the city came forward on Thursday to clear “misconceptions” about Ranitidine, an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) used in drugs to treat gastric acidity.

Following a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warning about the presence of low levels of carcinogens in Ranitidine, there are a lot of misconceptions about its use, said the doctors from Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Indira Gandhi Institute of Oncology, and Bhagwan Mahaveer Jain Hospital.

On September 13, the U.S. FDA issued an alert for patients and healthcare professionals stating that Ranitidine medicines contain low levels of a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA). “NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests,” it said.

Ranitidine is an H2 (histamine-2) blocker, which decreases the amount of acid created by the stomach. It is also prescribed for ulcers of stomach and intestines, gastroesophageal reflux disease etc.

Claiming that Ranitidine has not been banned, T.R. Raghu, Professor of Cardiology at Jayadeva Institute, said none of the key pharmaceutical regulators such as the US FDA, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) /CDSCO have asked for a ban. “The recall by a few manufacturers in India was purely voluntary. The US FDA tested numerous Ranitidine products and found levels of NDMA similar to levels one would be exposed to if they ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats,” he said.

Purushottam Chavan, Assistant Professor, Head and Neck Onco-Surgeon at Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology said: “US FDA has clearly stated that a person taking a drug that has NDMA below the acceptable limit every day for 70 years is not at an increased risk of cancer. Also, Ranitidine is usually prescribed for short duration.”

Karnataka State Drugs Controller B.T. Khanapure also said that the drug has not been banned. “There is no intimation from the Drug Controller General of India to stop the sale of Ranitidine-based drugs. We have also not got any complaints about any adverse effects of the drugs so far,” he told The Hindu.

Meanwhile, the presence of a representative from one of the companies manufacturing a Ranitidine-based drug at the media interaction created doubts if the doctors were being “influenced” by the pharma company. However, Dr. Raghu denied there was any commercial interest. “This is one of the cheapest drugs and we have been using it for last 40 years in government hospitals,” he added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ranitidine-not-banned-claim-doctors/article30579547.ece

In the video, which has been shared widely on social media, a student is seen struggling to pronounce the word “puliyogare.” The teacher is seen asking her to repeat it, even as her classmates burst into laughter mocking her wrong pronunciation.

159,2020/01/17,Hoardings: High Court fiat to govt.,"The Karnataka High Court on Thursday directed the State government to decide within a month the requirement of issuing directions to all types of panchayats to adopt the Karnataka Panchayat Raj (Gram Panchayat Control over Erection of Advertisements and Hoardings) Model Bylaws, 2013.

A Division Bench, comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar, issued the direction during the hearing on PIL petitions related to illegal advertisement hoardings, banners, posters in Bengaluru city and panchayats surrounding Bengaluru.

The Bench noticed that the model bylaw, notified on February 16, 2013 under the Karnataka Panchayat Raj Act, was required to be adopted through a resolution by the respective gram panchayats, taluk panchayats, and zilla panchayats for implementation of the bylaws in their jurisdiction.

And, as the State government under Section 316 of the Karnataka Grama Swaraj and Panchayat Raj Act has the power to direct panchayats to adopt bylaws, the Bench directed the government to consider issuing directions to all panchayats, which have not adopted this bylaws.

Meanwhile, the government has filed a report, stating that as per earlier directions of the court, communications had been sent to the commissioners of all city corporations and city municipal councils, and chief officers of all the town municipal councils for implementing the provisions of the Karnataka Open Spaces (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act, 1981.

160,2020/01/17,I-T search on Rashmika Mandanna’s house,"Income Tax Department conducted search-and-seizure operations at the residence of multilingual actor Rashmika Mandanna in Kukkloor village, Virajpet, Kodagu on Thursday.

Father questioned

The searches began around 7.30 a.m. with the arrival of a group of 10 I-T officials from Mysuru. Sources said her father, Madan Mandanna, was alone at home at the time. I-T officials served a notice directing her to return home and join the search operation. However, she could not join the probe as she was out of town. She appeared before the Income Tax Department officials late on Thursday night, sources said.

Sources in the I-T Department said Ms. Rashmika had recently acted in several big budget Telugu films.

She is suspected to have suppressed her true extent of income. On Thursday, I-T officials not only searched the actor’s residence but also other properties, including a community hall owned by the family in Virajpet.

Ms. Rashmika, 23, debuted in 2016 with the Kannada film Kirik Party.

She has acted with well-known Kannada actors, including Puneeth Rajkumar in Anjaniputra, with Darshan in Yajamana, and with Ganesh in Chamak. She later acted in several Telugu films, including ones with leading stars Mahesh Babu, Vijay Devarakonda, and Allu Arjun.

161,2020/01/17,"George appears before ED, submits assets list","Senior Congress leader K.J. George appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday and submitted a list of assets owned by him and his family members. He was questioned by ED officials for over three hours.

The ED which has registered a case against him for suspected violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, based on a complaint by anti-corruption activist Ravi Krishna Reddy, had summoned the former Minister to appear before the agency and submit details of his assets. FEMA violation is a civil offence and not a criminal offence.

In his complaint, Mr. Reddy alleged that Mr. George’s family members had several immovable assets abroad, especially in New York that he had not declared either before the Lokayukta or the Election Commission.

“I have cooperated with the ED and provided all documents that were sought and will subject myself to any inquiry in the future as well,” Mr. George told mediapersons after coming out of the ED office. He alleged that it was a conspiracy to tarnish his image. “A person not only lodges a complaint but also holds a press conference making serious allegations against me. Media broadcasts it as if it is proved. I have filed a criminal defamation against the person. Just because ED probes some allegations, it does not mean I am guilty,” he said.

A senior ED official told The Hindu that the probe was in a very preliminary stage. “We will now compare the assets list submitted by Mr. George with allegations made by the complainant. Owning an asset abroad is not a crime, but that asset needs to be bought through proper channel and money paid through bank accounts, which is what we will look at,” the official added.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/6bdl71/article30579497.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BGGEORGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/george-appears-before-ed-submits-assets-list/article30579498.ece

163,2020/01/17,Maoists bring out pamphlet against govt.,"The Wayanad Press Club on Friday received a pamphlet from the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) criticising the government for what it termed a nominal hike in wages of plantation workers.

Many commissions had been appointed by the State government to study issues of plantation workers. But, no decision had been taken in favour of the working class. Whereas it had taken many decisions in favour of estate owners, Ajitha, spokesperson of the Nadukani Dalam (squad) of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), said in the letter.

While the government had exempted agriculture income tax and land tax for the corporates, it only made a nominal increase of ₹52 in wages for the workers in the sector, she said.

Such a decision was only to protect the vested interests of the capitalist class. The life of workers in the sector was in crisis now as prices of essential commodities had increased manifold since 2015, she said.

Now, the corporates were bringing workers from other States providing low wages to bargain with the workers in the State.

The government was cheating the working class. The pamphlet demanded land, house, and minimum wages of ₹800 a day for the workers. A group of people, suspected to be Maoists, had vandalised a newly constructed service villa at Anakkunjimoola, near Attamala, in the district a few days ago.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/maoists-bring-out-pamphlet-against-govt/article30589544.ece

165,2020/01/17,No Constitutional hitch: Yechury,"Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has said there is no Constitutional hitch in the State government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Speaking to the media here on Friday, Mr. Yechury said an elected government had the Constitutional right to move court in the interests of the people and the State. The Governor was appointed as per the Constitution and not on the basis of the Rules of Business of the government. Clearance of the Governor was not mandatory in this case.

The Governor could not seek a report from the Chief Minister and he could only report the issue to the President. Governor Arif Mohammad Khan did not seem to have a clarity about his intentions. He said the party would take a call on the ways for strengthening the agitations against the Centre.

The violence being unleashed against the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 was sponsored by the Central government.

Onus on Cong.

The unity of parties against the Act need not be seen as an electoral tie-up. The idea is not to form a front. The Congress should clarify why it was unwilling for a joint agitation against CAA in the State.

Mr.Yechury said he did not know the reason for the Congress retracting from the agitation after joining it in the first phase.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamta Banerjee did not have a valid reason for staying away from the Opposition platform. Though she had warned against protests, the general strike was a big draw in the State and that might be the reason for her fury, he said.

With in rights: Kanam

CPI State secretary Kanam Rajendran told reporters here that the State government has moved the Supreme Court on the CAA on the basis of its rights and powers. There was no dispute about the fact that the Governor was the head of the State, but it had not been specified anywhere that the State government should seek his clearance for exercising an authority vested on it by the Constitution.

There was no rule that the Acts passed by Parliament should not be challenged in court. Many Acts had been challenged and the apex court would make a final review on the CAA too, he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/no-constitutional-hitch-yechury/article30589505.ece

Speaking to journalists in New Delhi, Mr. Khan said two Ministers had met him to discuss the Ordinance. “I shared my doubts with them. Their responsibility was to clear them. Instead, they chose to go to press first,” he said.

He said he needed to be satisfied that the government did not use the ‘power of the Ordinance for extraneous purposes.’ The government has now decided to introduce the amendment as a Bill in the budget session of the Assembly.

168,2020/01/17,"Prevent obstructions on footpaths, HC tells Govt.","The Kerala High Court has observed that the government and local authorities should ensure that encroachments on road margins and pedestrian facilities, including footpaths, are prevented.

Justice Anil K. Narendran, while dealing with a case relating to construction of a bus shelter on the footpath at Uduma Junction in Kasaragod, observed that once a public road was laid as per the required standards and guidelines, it has to be maintained as such without encroachments of any nature or in any form, either temporary or permanent, on the right of way or on the pedestrian facilities as per the guidelines and standard.

Not for parking

The court said footpaths and other pedestrian facilities along public roads were not intended for parking of vehicles or for traders or shop owners to keep their articles.

Any obstruction on footpaths and pedestrian facilities along public roads would force pedestrians to walk in unsafe conditions, adversely affecting the mobility and safety of pedestrians, including those with disabilities, and reduced mobility.

The court also observed that in terms of the law, constructions on public streets, including footpaths, causing obstruction to users of the street was legally impermissible.

Observations

The court made these observations while hearing a petition filed by A.V. Sivaprasad, secretary of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) Uduma block committee, seeking to review a judgment directing to demolish the bus shelter constructed by the DYFI at Uduma town.

Hosdurg tahsildar had reported that the bus shelter was causing traffic congestion.

It also protruded into the bus bay.

In fact, two new bus shelters had been constructed by the Kerala State Transport Project on the road margins about 30 m from the bus shelter.

The court said since the bus shelter constructed by the DYFI posed a serious safety threat to bus passengers and pedestrians, non-compliance with the directive and allowing the public to use the shelter had to be viewed seriously.

Affidavits sought

The court directed the authorities concerned to file affidavits explaining the reasons for not demolishing the bus shelter as directed by the court.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/prevent-obstructions-on-footpaths-hc-tells-govt/article30589488.ece

The pulse vaccination drive will be the latest in a series of concerted efforts against the deadly polio virus in the country.

As many as 2,200 booths have been arranged in the district for pulse polio vaccine administration. Besides, 68 transit booths, five mela or bazaar booths, and 100 mobile booths have been set up. “We hope to reach out to the maximum number of children,” said District Medical Officer K.P. Reeta.

She said nearly 7.5 lakh houses in the district would be covered under the pulse polio drive. According to her, efforts are being made to reach out to the children through anganwadis, schools, and health centres. Special booths will be set up at bus stands, railway stations, festival venues, and other places where children tend to go. The Sunday drive will be followed up by volunteers visiting houses with vaccine on Monday and Tuesday.

173,2020/01/17,Tech varsity gets tough with colleges,"Falling standards and long-standing deficiencies in several engineering colleges have prompted APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University to mull stringent measures, including withdrawing affiliation and imposing restrictions in sanctioning new courses.

When a recent academic audit classified the colleges on a scale of 1 to 5, as many as 37 engineering colleges figured in the 'average' category and 10 institutions fell in the lowest band.

Most of the self-financing colleges fell in the 'average' and 'below average' categories. While none of the 142 affiliating colleges were rated as 'excellent', most government and aided colleges figured in the ‘very good’ category. All others were graded as ‘good’.

Flouted guidelines

The colleges that fared poorly were found to have flouted various guidelines laid down by the All India Council for Technical Education, including the teacher-student ratio of 1:20. Besides, only a few among the teaching faculty were found to satisfy the mandatory qualification of MTech. These institutions were also found lacking in infrastructure.

The Academic Council of the varsity decided to seek an explanation from the institutions that fared poorly. The colleges that did not have the prescribed faculty qualification index will be directed to address the shortcomings immediately.

A delegation of university officials, led by the Vice Chancellor, will soon inspect the 10 ‘below average’ colleges.

The council also decided that the colleges that continue to fare poorly and fail to rectify the deficiencies need not be recommended for extension of affiliation.

The council also decided to impose strict norms while sanctioning new courses. Applications of colleges that have obtained National Board of Accreditation (NBA) accreditation for at least one of their courses will only be considered. Only 30 colleges have NBA accreditation in the State now.

Besides, new courses will be sanctioned only for those colleges that have admissions to at least 50% of total seats in the past three years. For new MTech courses, the corresponding BTech course will have to be accredited.

Justice A. Muhamed Musthaque passed the directive when a pending petition of George Alexander, managing director of the company, seeking police protection for the employees willing to work came up for hearing.

Observer and High Court lawyer Liji J. Vadakkedam submitted that a meeting held on January 14 could not reach a consensus on certain matters. The next meeting would be held on January 20.

176,2020/01/17,Tension at CMS College following student clash,"CMS College here witnessed tense moments after a section of students and teachers clashed with a group of alleged SFI workers who unleashed violence on the campus and attacked a couple of students here on Friday.

Three SFI workers, identified as Ananda Krishnan, Arjun Mohan and C.S. Sreejith have been suspended pending inquiry. In the wake of the prevailing tension, the college will remain closed till Tuesday.

According to students, the clash on Friday was the continuation of a scuffle during an industrial visit by the final-year undergraduate students (Physics) recently. Following the incident, two students had been suspended from the college, who were later assaulted by a group of alleged SFI workers.

The episode triggered a wave of protests in which a section of students came up demanding withdrawal of the disciplinary action and seeking action against those who unleashed violence on the campus. The protest led to a violent clash between the protesters and the SFI activists. With the situation going out of control, teachers and other students came to the rescue of the protesters.

In view of the escalating tension, police resorted to mild caning to disperse students.

College’s stand

Meanwhile, the college authorities lodged a complaint to the District Police Chief seeking action against those who attacked students.

The CSI Church, which runs the college, attributed the episode to unilateral action by a particular student organisation, which had brought goons from outside to unleash violence on the campus.

SFI version

The SFI district leadership, on the other hand, accused some Campus Front workers and students associated with drug mafia of triggering troubles.

The college authorities should intervene in the issue to restore peace on the campus and ensure an atmosphere for learning, the organisation demanded in a press release.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/tension-at-cms-college-following-student-clash/article30589367.ece
177,2020/01/17,Milma to make 5-year plan for dairy sector,"The Thiruvananthapuram region of the Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union (Milma) will conduct Milma Gramolsavam 2020 to collect ideas and suggestions from dairy farmers, milk societies, technical experts, people’s representatives and the public.

“The recommendations will be later catalogued to form Milma 2025, a five-year plan for the comprehensive development of the sector. Attaining self-sufficiency in milk production and economic stability of dairy farmers and strengthening of milk societies will be the major objectives of the plan,” said Kallada Ramesh, regional chairman, at a press meet here on Friday.

ISO certification for village-level bulk chilling centres, a ₹40-crore loan scheme in association with South Indian Bank for buying cattle, product diversification and training for dairy farmers at Anand, Gujarat, are the other projects to be implemented this financial year.

Haritha Milma

Moreover, Milma will launch Haritha Milma, an initiative to promote organic farming, and Milma Cow Bazar, a mobile app for buying and selling cattle. Dairy farmers will be encouraged to start organic vegetable farming and 11 farmer groups will be formed in the four districts under the region.

“As part of the ₹25-lakh project, the farmers will be provided everything from vegetable seeds to fertilizers to start farming,” he said.

The Milma Cow Bazar has been conceived as a measure to help the farmers who often are duped into buying unproductive cows from markets outside Kerala. The mobile app will function as an authentic platform for the farmers to trade their cows. “It will have all the details of the cows, but only milk society secretaries will have the access to contact owners. This feature was added to keep agents and traders away as it is a facility for the farmers.”

Plastic-free

Milma has also prepared an action plan to go plastic-free in the future. In the first phase, five milk ATMs will be opened at five centres in Thiruvananthapuram city. Meanwhile, the Green Kerala Company will be in charge of collecting Milma covers from customers on a daily basis.

178,2020/01/17,Former Mizoram Governor Kummanam Rajasekharan moves SC on Kerala suit against CAA,"Former Mizoram Governor and BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan on Friday moved the Supreme Court seeking the dismissal of an original suit filed by Kerala against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.

Mr. Rajasekharan and a Kerala-based activist, Ajikumar, filed a joint application in the apex court to implead them in the suit filed by Kerala. The application said the suit wrongly attempts to convey that the entire people of Kerala are against the CAA.

Mr. Kummanam said ""here the situation is totally different. Majority of the people of the State are supporting the Act"".

He argued that the unanimous resolution passed in the Kerala Legislative Assembly to abrogate the CAA was designed to give the impression that the people of the State were against the new law.

""But it is to be noted here that the members of the Legislative Assembly has not sought the mandate of the people of Kerala by projecting the issues involved in the impugned Act. The election to the Kerala assembly has taken place in the year 2015 and the impugned Act was passed in the year 2019. So in affect the pretext in which the plaint is filed to the effect that entire State of Kerala is against impugned Act is against facts,"" the application said.

The application finally said there was no dispute if law and fact between the State of Kerala and the Centre which led to the filing of an original suit under Article 131 of the Constitution.

179,2020/01/17,CPI(M) planning broad front against Centre,"The Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] central committee that began its three-day session here on Friday would initiate discussions for forming a broad front against the Central government.

The committee would lay out a course for enlisting the support of all parties that are willing to join the fight against the Centre, mainly the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, economic policies, and majority appeasement policies.

The committee is likely to work out a plan to further augment the unity of trade unions that was witnessed in the general strike and bring to a common platform the 20 parties that were part of the anti-CAA agitation. The CPI(M) is planning to form a broad front comprising all parties that are willing to join the agitation.

The United Democratic Front (UDF), mainly the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), may not have a serious problem in joining hands with the CPI(M) in the anti-CAA movement. Since the CPI(M) and the Left Democratic Front (LDF) had been in the forefront of the agitations and this model may be emulated in a scaled up manner.

180,2020/01/17,KASP mismanagement likely to hit patient care,"Mismanagement of the Karunya Arogya Suraksha Padhati (KASP), Kerala’s integrated health financing scheme launched in alignment with Ayushman Bharat last year, is draining the exchequer as the authorities continue to look the other way.

Insurance contract

The government’s failure to meet the terms of the insurance contract it signed with Reliance General Insurance Company Ltd. (RGICL) and pay the premium amount on schedule had resulted in the latter writing to the KASP authorities that they were “compelled to defer current and future claim payments for KASP” till the pending premium is received.

RGICL has not been honouring any insurance claims submitted by hospitals since December 26 last, sources said.

But even as the KASP administration continues to lay the blame at the door of the insurance company, the government has not sought any explanation why ₹150 crore, part of the ₹252 crore released by the Finance Department from the treasury on December 14 towards a much-delayed payment of insurance premium instalment, is being allowed to languish in the zero interest escrow account of a private bank for the past one month. Finance Department sources point out that this is a clear violation of government rules which do not allow funds released from the treasury to be kept unused in another account.

Parked in bank

The money has been parked in HDFC Bank (it should have earned interest up to 9% in the treasury) without releasing it to the insurance company.

This is at a time when the government is struggling to even clear small bills for ₹5-10 lakh.

Of the ₹252 crore released, ₹102 crore was handed over to the insurance company only on January 15. In November last, the KASP had unnecessarily held back ₹102 crore released from the treasury towards premium payment for two more weeks in the escrow account before releasing it to the insurance company.

Owned by State

The KASP is almost fully owned by the State. Out of the total payable premium of more than ₹691 crore, the Central share is only ₹137 crore.

“There seems to be a deliberate attempt to systematically derail the State’s own programme. This will only show Kerala in a poor light and serve the agenda of the National Health Agency, which is driven by private consultancy firms,” a public health expert said.

According to the agreement between the State government and RGICL, the government should have paid a premium of ₹620 crore plus (1st and 2nd instalments), out of the KASP’s total premium payable (₹691 crore) by September 30 last.

With just two months left in the current year’s KASP contract, the government has only paid ₹401 crore to the insurance company so far, while the total claims raised by various empanelled hospitals under the KASP has crossed ₹458 crore (till December 31).

Patient care

Patient care is likely to be hit as empanelled hospitals would soon find it difficult to offer free and cashless treatment to the beneficiaries.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/lluyyd/article30589423.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tv-Karunya-Arogya-Surakshacol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kasp-mismanagement-draining-exchequer/article30588299.ece
181,2020/01/17,Oppn. to challenge SEC decision on voters’ list,"Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala has said that the United Democratic Front (UDF) will challenge the State Election Commission (SEC) decision to use the 2015 voters’ list as the data base for the local body elections later this year.

Addressing a press conference here on Friday, Mr. Chennithala said the State government’s move on delimiting local body wards were politically motivated and intended to give the CPI(M) an upper hand in the electoral outcome.

He said the Opposition had approached the Governor because he was about to sign the ordinance related to the delimitation of wards. The decision came late in the date. Besides, it went against the Census operations. He had pointed out in his letter to the Governor the pitfall in signing the ordinance and the illegality.

This had nothing to do with the CAA issue. The Opposition strongly deplored the Governor’s stand on the CAA and his action of engaging in public discourse in the media. “As head of the State, it was not appropriate for the Governor to indulge in such actions,” he said.

With regard to the voters’ list, he said that using 2015 voters’ list would mean enrolling an estimated 40 lakh new voters.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/oppn-to-challenge-sec-decision-on-voters-list/article30587808.ece
182,2020/01/17,SC declines to intervene in burial row,"The Supreme Court on Friday declined to intervene in a dispute regarding the burial of Jacobites in cemeteries of churches controlled by the Orthodox faction of the Malankara Church.

A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra orally said the vicar, and not the court, was concerned with burials. Justice Mishra, however, remarked that the court would not allow the dead to be insulted.

The court also did not interfere with an Ordinance promulgated by the State government -- Kerala Christian Cemeteries (Right to Burial of Corpse) Ordinance of 2020 -- to legally facilitate the burial of Jacobites in their family cemeteries located in churches administered by the Orthodox faction. The ordinance provides Christians the right to bury their loved ones in the cemetery where their ancestors are buried.

The Orthodox faction had filed a contempt petition against the Kerala government for promulgating the Ordinance. In its reply, the State explained that it was compelled to promulgate the law in view of several cases of delay and obstruction of the timely burial of Jacobites. The delay and obstruction were having severe religious and social impact and amounted to a denial of human rights. The government had received many petitions for police protection to conduct religious burials. The government denied acting in contempt.

The court, however, said that its intervention so far, and the judgment that it had pronounced on July 3, 2017, was restricted only to maintaining peace, law and order. It did not want to enter any other domains in the case.

On a personal note, Justice Mishra said that as the judge heading the Bench which heard the case, he had been able to resolve only half the problems. Justice Mishra said the other would probably be resolved by the judge who comes in his stead after his retirement.

On a personal note, Justice Mishra said that as the judge heading the Bench which heard the case, he had been able to resolve only half the problems. He added that the other would probably be resolved by the judge who comes in his stead after his retirement.

The apex court struck a sober note in the hearing, quite different from when it had pulled up the Chief Secretary last year for not being able to implement the 2017 judgment. Justice Mishra had then said the State was “making a mockery of the justice delivery system”.

On July 3, 2017, a Bench led by Justice Mishra had upheld the 1934 constitution of the Church and dismissed a dozen review petitions filed by the Jacobite faction in a decision which had impacted over 2,000 parish churches and 30 million followers of the Malankara Church across the world.

The Bench had, with their July judgment, brought a finality to the over 100-year-old dispute between the factions with allegiance to the Patriarch of Antioch in Syria (Jacobites) and the Catholicos of the East - the two powerful factions of the Malankara Church, believed to be established in AD 52 by St. Thomas the Apostle.

The apex court had twice previously intervened in the dispute between the two groups – once in 1958 and the second time in 1995. On both occasions, the apex court had upheld the validity of the 1934 constitution to administer the parish churches.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/sc-declines-to-intervene-in-burial-row/article30587519.ece
183,2020/01/17,Row over delimitation may upset poll process,"The row over delimitation of local body wards is likely to impede and slacken the process and derail the poll schedule.

Local Self-Government Department sources told The Hindu that the tenure of all local bodies had been fixed for five years since the date of the first meeting of the elected councils.

The incumbent committees of panchayats as well as the councils of Corporations and municipalities had their first meeting after the last elections on November 12, 2015, and hence the newly elected councils should come into being on November 12, 2020.

The controversies over delimitation and the Opposition’s decision to move the court are likely to derail the delimitation and election schedule. The State Delimitation Commission will be able to initiate the process only after the government takes a decision on the strength in each local body. The recurring disputes and political wrangling are feared to delay the first step itself. And that will have a cascading effect on the entire procedures.

The commission will have to rush through a slew of procedures that are integral to delimitation, including public hearings in districts to finish the task within a set deadline. Since the time is fast running out, completing the procedures without giving room for fresh disputes will be a challenging task for the commission.

Section 6 of the Panchayati Raj Act as well as the Municipalities Act has delegated ample powers to the government to fix the size and upgrade local bodies and redraw their boundaries with population as the benchmark.

Top priority is usually attached to ensure a balanced development of all regions and an equitable devolution of funds within a local body. The row over the government decision to add one ward each to all local bodies is unfounded since the government was acting within its ambit. Moreover, it has been clarified that the administrative boundaries for the 2021 census will not be redrawn or upset.

As per the census norms, the boundaries of district, taluk and village (panchayat) are the administrative boundaries and altering the limits of a ward will not affect the process. Since the government had clarified that such boundaries would remain unaltered, the arguments against the proposed delimitation process would stand on a shaky premise, sources said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/row-over-delimitation-may-upset-poll-process/article30587140.ece
184,2020/01/17,SC refuses to stay trial against Dileep,"The Supreme Court on Friday refused to stay the trial against Malayalam actor Dileep in a case of abduction and molestation of an actress in which he is one of the accused.

The actor wanted the trial to be frozen till he got a report from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) about the authenticity of a memory card containing certain visuals allegedly of the attack on the victim. Dileep, represented by senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, contended that his right of defence would be crippled without the report as the ‘whole case revolves around the memory card.’

The Bench ordered the examination-in-chief of prosecution witnesses to continue. It said the cross-examination of the witnesses in court would only begin after Dileep gets the CFSL report.

Senior advocate Ranjit Kumar and advocate G. Prakash, for Kerala, said the plea by the actor was only a ploy to delay the trial.

The court asked the CFSL, Chandigarh, to expedite its examination and complete the report.

The Supreme Court, in a judgment in November, had allowed Dileep to either personally inspect in court the contents of the memory card or seek a second opinion about its genuineness and credibility from an independent agency like the Central Forensic Science Laboratory. The court had upheld the actor’s argument that the card should be considered a ‘document’ under the Evidence Act.

The plea for a stay of trial came a few days after charges were framed against him and nine other accused for the incident which occurred in 2017.

186,2020/01/17,"Indian thought is vibrant, diverse: Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said the Indian way of life offers rays of hope in a world seeking to break free from mindless hate, violence, conflict, and terrorism.

Inaugurating via videoconferencing the three-day international conclave on Globalising Indian Thought (GIT) organised by the Indian Institute of Management, Kozhikode, (IIM-K), on Thursday, Mr. Modi said the Indian way of conflict avoidance was not by brute force but the power of dialogue.

“Indian thought is vibrant and diverse. It is constant and evolving. Broadly, there are certain ideals that have remained central to Indian values. They are compassion, harmony, justice, service, and openness,” he said.

“For centuries, we welcomed the world to our land. Our civilisation has prospered when many could not. Because one finds peace and harmony here,” Mr. Modi said.

In the 20th century, Mahatma Gandhi championed these ideals and this contributed to India’s freedom, he noted. At the same time, he said, the Indians gave strength to millions outside. “It is no coincidence that we are talking about globalising Indian thought at a time when a life-size statue of Swami Vivekananda finds a special place on this campus. Who can forget the contribution of Swami Vivekananda in globalising Indian thought,” he asked.

Vivekananda’s speech

Swami Vivekananda, the Prime Minister said, had given a glimpse of India’s ethos during his iconic speech in Chicago on September 11, 1893. “As we all know, the moment he began his speech ‘Sisters and Brothers of America’, there were loud claps,” he said, adding that these “magic words” were not just the words but a display of India’s conviction and commitment towards universal brotherhood.

The Prime Minister said the IIM community was one of the brightest and one of the busiest groups of people. The excellent work prospects also bring with it stressful routines. “I would urge them all to devote time to yoga. You will see the positive difference it brings in,” he said.

Even while most western countries took decades to give voting rights to women, the makers of the Indian Constitution ensured women had voting rights from the very first day, Mr. Modi said. “Where there is openness, respect for different opinions, innovation is natural. The innovative zeal of Indians is drawing the world to India,” he added.

“Indian thought has given a lot to the world and it also has the potential to contribute even more. It has the potential to solve some of the most leading challenges our planet faces,” Mr. Modi said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/o8fomn/article30579601.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVIIMK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/indian-thought-is-vibrant-diverse-modi/article30579602.ece
187,2020/01/17,‘Just Mercy’ movie review: Spotlights a much-needed victory against a corrupt system,"Most folks in Just Mercy’s Montgomery (Alabama) are keen that visitors stop by Harper Lee’s To Kill a Mockingbird museum. It’s the late 1980s, and the Alabama town has been a centre of the Civil Rights Movement. The irony doesn’t go unnoticed then when African American Harvard-educated attorney Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan) is stripped, searched and told to bend over by a white guard while visiting his clients on death row. Civil rights may have been granted, but racial prejudice is just as prevalent.

After receiving a federal grant, Stevenson and Eve Ansley (Brie Larson) are an idealistic duo hell-bent on helping those who need it most. In Destin Daniel Cretton’s film, based on true events, Walter McMillian (Jaime Foxx) is wrongfully convicted of the murder of an 18-year-old white woman. The black pulpwood worker is sentenced to death a year before his trial. This, in spite of having several witnesses from his community testifying to Walter’s presence at a gathering when the murder took place. All appeals to stay the death penalty have been rejected.

Just Mercy Director: Destin Daniel Cretton

Cast: Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Foxx, Brie Larson, Rob Morgan, Tim Blake Nelson, Rafe Spall

Storyline: Walter McMillian is sentenced to death for a murder he didn’t commit and Harvard-educated attorney Bryan Stevenson is out to get the innocent man the justice he deserves

As Just Mercy’s ramrod linear narrative plays out, it’s arrestingly evident that McMillian’s story and not a powerful script moves the audience. Injustice, of any kind can stir spirits but it’s particularly heart wrenching when an innocent man faces death because of prejudice and the ineptitude of authorities. Sadly, the weight of the American incident reverberates all across the world, even in 2020, calling to mind ‘terrorist’ Afzal Guru’s execution in India.

For his part, Cretton’s faithful retelling of history elicits the required response, even if he’s unable to architect sufficient context for characters beyond his protagonists. Foxx as a faithless man on death row is a quiet powerhouse as is the earnest sincerity of Jordon’s pursuit of justice. But it’s unfortunate when an actor like Larson gets short-changed. Her character’s contribution — majorly significant if not as equal as the real-life Stevenson’s — is unmemorable.

Thankfully, as Stevenson’s work bore fruition in reality, Cretton’s film spotlights a much-needed victory against a corrupt system. A win, we all need to be reminded of in this day and age.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/iixebg/article30587215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bm-Just-MErcy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/just-mercy-movie-review-spotlights-a-much-needed-victory-against-a-corrupt-system/article30587216.ece
188,2020/01/17,‘Dolittle’ movie review: A vapid outing that squanders its talented actors and voice cast,"The best thing about being an armed forces child was the library (okay, one of the best things). Long summer days were spent browsing the library and stumbling upon books that you would never find anywhere else. It was in camp libraries that I read about Jennings and his bestie Darbishire, the adventures of the fat owl of the remove, Billy Bunter, and tales of Dr Dolittle and his jolly menagerie of animals. I was fascinated by the pushmi-pullyu, a two-headed gazelle/unicorn.

Dr Dolittle started his print life in illustrated letters written by Hugh Lofting to his children from the trenches during World War I as the reality of war was too horrible to write about. The simple illustrations and the idea of a doctor who could talk to animals was irresistible and vacations sped by in the company of Polynesia the parrot, Gub-Gub the pig, Jip the dog and of course pushmi-pullyu who ate with one mouth while talking with the other, thus not being rude.

And so we come to the good doctor’s latest screen outing, Dolittle, with Iron Man Robert Downey Jr., in the lead. Eddie Murphy played the doctor last time around in Dr Dolittle (1998) and the sequel, Dr Dolittle 2 in 2001.

Dolittle Director: Stephen Gaghan

Cast: Robert Downey Jr. , Antonio Banderas, Michael Sheen, Jim Broadbent

Voice cast: Emma Thompson, Rami Malek, John Cena, Tom Holland, Ralph Fiennes, Selena Gomez, Marion Cotillard

Storyline: An eccentric doctor who can speak to animals has to undertake a perilous voyage to save the queen

Runtime: 102 minutes

Despite the traumatic production history of the 2020 version with extensive reshoots, rewrites and test audience hating the movie, Dolittle is not completely terrible. It is not great, but it is harmless — you definitely don’t want to poke your eyes out or bite your arm while watching it.

Returning to its Victorian roots, Dolittle tells the story of a brilliant doctor/veterinarian who can talk to animals. When Queen Victoria becomes seriously sick, Dolittle has to stop being a recluse, get a haircut and go on a perilous journey to find a cure on a hidden island.

The movie is lovely-looking and all the CGI animals do proper animal things — even though sometimes their paws do not seem to be touching the floor so much as skimming it. Dolittle is a star-studded extravaganza starting with RDJ and his weird accent. There is also Antonio Banderas who is hilarious as the pirate king, Michael Sheen as the villainous Dr. Blair Müdfly (don’t forget the umlaut) and Jim Broadbent as Lord Thomas Badgley, another bad guy.

The voice actors are equally big names from Emma Thompson (Polynesia), Rami Malek (Chee-Chee the gorilla), John Cena (Yoshi the polar bear who looks like Iorek from His Dark Materials) and Octavia Spencer (Dab-Dab the duck) to Tom Holland (Jip), Ralph Fiennes (Barry the tiger) Selena Gomez (Betsy the giraffe) and Marion Cotillard (Tutu the fox).

189,2020/01/17,‘24 Days’ is the realisation of the celluloid dreams of two Merchant Navy officers,"What if their film is released in just one theatre in the state and has just one show? Sreekanth EG and Adith US are not cribbing. For these two Merchant Navy officers it was a dream-come-true when their film, 24 Days released in the capital city on Friday (January 17). “Independent filmmakers have never had it easy,” says Adith, who plays the protagonist and has co-written the story and script with Sreekanth, the director of the movie.

The film zooms in on the life of Stephen, an unemployed, selfish youth who goes on an impulsive road trip to the Himalayas with a riders’ group. But he gets expelled from the group and meets with an accident, which turns out to be life-changing, making him a better person, at peace with himself.

Sreekanth, who hails from Kannur, and Adith, a native of the city, had met at a naval institute in Pune. “Love for cinema brought us together. We took part in a mobile movie contest that won us the first prize, thus boosting our confidence. We also made a docu-fiction on our institute,” says Adith. They’ve shot two short films, “during their vacation from onboard training” — Will You Be Me? and I Am Flying. It was our interaction with several film personalities at the Cochin International Film Festival that inspired us to think big and make a feature film,” Adith adds.

Since funds were short, help came from the Merchant Navy community itself. “It is a friends-funded project,” he says. They went on a one-year break from work to shoot the film and later took turns to take leave to finish the post production work.

“We learnt and did everything on our own. Thankfully we could use the best of facilities at Chitranjali studio although many people had tried to dissuade us. And when it came to releasing the movie, Kerala State Film Development Corporation was ready to give us a slot,” says Sreekanth.

The film has already won recognition at film festivals in Chile and Switzerland and was among the 20 films shortlisted at the Kerala State Film Awards 2019. “That was a big achievement considering we have had no experience or connection in the industry. We have worked with the best crew, be it camera, background score or sound design,” says Sreekanth.

Plans are on to release the film in theatres in Kannur and Kochi. “We want many to watch our work. We have made this out of our love for cinema and not to make money,” Adith says.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/7e2jld/article30585611.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvmfilm,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/24-days-is-the-debut-project-of-two-merchant-navy-officers/article30585613.ece
190,2020/01/17,Bollywood actor and casting director Abhishek Banerjee on how Rajinikanth inspired him,"Abhishek Banerjee is not someone who can be described by one adjective. What defines his abilities as a new age casting director and prolific actor, is his command over characters and a knack for experimentation. His characters in recent hits have certainly brought a unique flavour to those films which had mass appeal and were critic friendly.

Inspired by Rajinikanth’s stardom

What brought this Delhi boy to cinema? “I grew up in Chennai and was very much influenced by Rajinikant’s stardom and importance of cinema in Tamil culture. My story is similar to every ordinary Indian boy’s tale. My father wanted me to become an engineer or a professional but I was sure that I have to be in the Hindi film industry. I joined college through the quota for extra curricular activities but I am still not a graduate,” he chuckles.

His film career started with a small appearance in “Rang De Basanti” when he was in his final year of college before joining as a casting assistant to his mentor Gautam Mirchandani on “Dev D”. “I went there to give an audition but he asked me to give cues to the actors and that happened in “Chak De” too. Later, I assisted a few other casting directors before starting it full time to sustain myself in Mumbai.” The success of “No one Killed Jessica” and “The Dirty Picture” brought him his share of limelight and he is doing casting director’s “job” happily.

The last decade has seen the rise of casting directors as important stakeholders in the film industry as ‘content driven’ cinema has created a huge requirement of talent which was otherwise not seen by the audience. “It started happening when people started seeing themselves on screen ,” says Abhishek who runs the casting company Casting Bay with Anmol Ahuja.

Distinct flavour

As an actor, he has been applauded for his roles in recent hits including “Stree”, “Bala”, “Dream Girl”, and Amzaon Prime’s web series “Mirzapur”. His choice of characters echoes his sensibilities as a person and he insists on bringing his own flavour to whatever is offered to him. “All my characters have their own political thoughts of the world around. If it is not in the script, I put it into them so that they become rooted to the local flavour. Mahender from ‘Dream Girl’ sees the world in a rosy way but he is righteous in deciding his position on a situation. Ajju from ‘Bala’ is not confused when people make sexist remarks on Yami Gautam’s character when she leaves Bala,” he explains.

Along with Aparshakti Khurana, he has emerged as the new ‘friend’ of the Hindi film protagonist. He puts it as a writing issue. “The friend in a film acts as a shadow of the lead. If you omit that character, the main actor has to speak to himself. It will not be interesting. There is no other reason for a friend to be there in the film. I think writers should create characters who are human and have a character arc of their own.”

He believes that a school of thought is necessary for an actor to voice opinions and have own approach towards craft. “I come from Kirorimal College’s theatre society called Players which is equivalent to any other acting institute. It corrected my existing thoughts and gave me a direction. It allowed me to be open to change and question everything like my own personality, characters, putting thoughts in front of the director or into the script, which, I think, is required for growth,” he relates.

Channelling his existing knowledge of theatre to the medium of cinema required a lot of unlearning and he waited for that to happen over a period of time considering the requirements the medium poses. “Theatre is about your body. Your synchronised body movements and the amount of voice thrown at the audience play a big role as you have to perform for everyone. But in films, you perform for camera that opens the opportunity for a lot of other gestures to emote the feelings of the character. You have to pay attention to the way you speak as sometimes it becomes theatrical which people take as melodrama,” he explains.

As someone who trains and cultivates new talent, he believes in training and workshops for actors. It is said long rehearsals diminish unpredicted surprises and unrehearsed acting is labelled as ‘subtle’. Abhishek differs, “I agree performances which remain with you are those which are felt at the time of the shoot. This is why spaces are important and the environment around your film set has a bearing on your performance. If the set is in Benaras or Agra, you cannot imagine that in a workshop in Mumbai but some kind of chemistry building workshops for actors to build a rapport with them is necessary to build a base before they go to the ‘real’ setting,” insists Abhishek.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/9h2w3t/article30586546.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG5602-copy,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/bollywood-actor-and-casting-director-abhishek-banerjee-on-how-rajinikanth-inspired-him/article30586547.ece
191,2020/01/17,"1971's 'Bangaru Thalli', the Telugu remake of 'Mother India'","Not every day an actor gets to play such an intense character that travels from being compassionate to being impenitent, but assertive throughout, taking control of things despite facing calamities. Citing this reason, going against the advice of her well-wishers, Jamuna signed to play Annapurna in Bangaru Thalli, a remake of the cult Hindi movie, Mother India. “In my opinion, a true art should reflect various facets of life. Such acting not only brings out the best in the actors but also earns them permanency,” wrote Jamuna in an article in Vijayachitra in 1971.

With a fervour to produce movies of substance, Chegondi Hari Rama Jogaiah (billed in the titles as Chegondi Hari Babu) and Nachu Seshagiri Rao, founded Babu Pictures. The duo acquired the Telugu remake rights of Mehboob Khan’s 1957 classic, Mother India which in fact was a vastly improvised version of Mehboob’s 1940 production, Aurat. Jamuna was their first and only choice to enact the mother’s character which Nargis took to cult status. Tapi Chanakya was signed to direct the movie.

The story

To perform the marriage of her son Rajaiah (played by Jaggaiah) with Annapurna (Jamuna), Seethamma (Nirmala) takes a loan from the cunning money lender Papaiah (Nagabhushanam) whose dubious ways lead Rajaiah to further debts. Annapurna suggests that they cultivate the land that is not under pledge to Papaiah. While digging for a well in that land, Rajaiah loses both his hands. Unable to bear the insults thrown at him by Papaiah, Rajaiah leaves home. His mother dies in shock. Left alone to tend her three sons, Annapurna struggles to make both ends meet. Her third son, a toddler dies in cyclone. Years pass by. With the support of her two grown up sons, the soft natured Ramu (Sobhan Babu), and the rebellious Ranga (Krishnam Raju), Annapurna turns the corner. But Papaiah still collects interest from her with deceitful accounts. This irks Ranga. When he confronts Papaiah, the money lender’s goons beat him. When Ranga hides in the hay stacks, Papaiah’s men burn the stack. Ranga escapes but returns with his gang of armed men, kills Papaiah and kidnaps his daughter Dhanalakshmi (Ramaprabha). When Ranga refuses to leave the girl, Annapurna shoots at him. He dies in her lap. The story is narrated through a flashback when Annapurna recollects her past while she is invited to inaugurate a new canal in the village.

Cast and crew

While recreating the sequences for Bangaru Thalli, Tapi Chanakya faithfully followed the original version structured by Mehboob and writers Wajahat Mirza and Ali Raza. In doing so he missed out on the nativity factor. Mother India was set in Uttar Pradesh where several decades ago dacoits on horseback terrorised people but horseback thugs were unknown to the Telugu land.

Pinisetty Sriramamurthy’s dialogues were largely inspired by Wajahat Mirza’s lines from the Hindi version. Some of Pinisetty’s dialogues were well received. When Annapurna offer her jewels to Rajaiah to clear the debts, Rajaiah refuses to take them and he tells her, appu leni rythu uppu leni koora yekkadaina vuntaayaa (Can you find anywhere a farmer without debt and a curry without salt). Also before firing the rifle at Ranga, Annapurna says, Nenoo aadadaannera tana gowravame naa gowravam. Kaavalante naa kodukunu bali pedathaanu gaani saati aadadaani maanaabhimaanaalu bali kaanivvanu (I am also a woman, her honour is my honour. If necessary I will sacrifice my son but not the honour and dignity of a fellow woman).

Veteran cinematographer Kamal Ghosh made brilliant use of light and shade enhancing the scenes shot in outdoor locations in West Godavari district as well as on the sets at AVM Studios. K A Marthand edited the movie.

Jamuna’s earthy portrayal of the struggling single mother won her many admirers. “The character Annapurna had many shades carrying different emotions. It was mentally and physically exhausting. In the night I read the dialogues thoroughly and practised in front of the mirror before going to the shoot the next day,” wrote Jamuna in her autobiography, Jamunatheeram.

It was Krishnam Raju’s 19th starrer and the up-and-coming actor impressed with his perfect portrayal as the rebel Ranga.

S Rajeswara Rao composed the music and the popular songs were — Yenthaina baruvu ee brathuku (lyrics: Devulapalli Krishna Sastry, singers: Susheela, Vasantha, Latha) and Palleseema mana pantaseema (Dasarathi; Ghantasala, Susheela, Pithapuram Nageswara Rao, Swarnalatha).

Trivia

Jamuna watched the movie at Vinoda Talkies, Vijayawada and was overwhelmed at the audience response to her acting.

Nargis was 28 when Mother India was released in which she played mother to Sunil Dutt and Rajendra Kumar who were of her age. Jamuna was 35 when she acted as mother to a 34 year old Sobhan Babu and 31 year old Krishnam Raju.

Krishnam Raju’s role of the rebellious Ranga established him as an actor in aggressive characters which later earned him the moniker, ‘Rebel Star.’

However, comparisons were inevitable and Bangaru Thalli failed at the box office, unable to meet the standards set by the lavishly made and well- enacted Technicolor film, Mother India which had many reruns till 1970 across the country, including the then united Andhra Pradesh.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/qwq7rd/article30586290.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf17bangaru-tallijpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1971s-bangaru-thalli-the-telugu-remake-of-mother-india/article30586292.ece
192,2020/01/17,‘Big Brother’ movie review: Even die-hard Mohanlal fans wouldn’t endure this mess,"Writing the kind of lines no one else would even have imagined is a dream for anyone who has picked up the pen. Big Brother, written and directed by Siddique, is filled with such lines, placed in situations in which one would never imagine them.

The best of the lot comes early on, when Satchidanandan (Mohanlal), comes out of jail after 24 long years, having completed a double life sentence, for the murder of his step-mother’s abusive ex-husband and a policeman. One would expect an emotional sequence on seeing his younger brother Manu (Sarjano Khalid), who fought a long battle for his release, waiting outside eagerly. But, the very first thing Manu says is: “Oh brother! How handsome you are!” Even considering the fact that it is mandatory to praise the looks and intelligence of the superstars in all their films, this was quite an absurd placement of that customary line.

If that sequence wasn’t enough, we are taken to the next one where the whole family is waiting for him at home, to break into a tacky dance song, in which a reluctant Satchidanandan gets dragged onto multiple colourful dance sets. An attempt is made to create some humour with his awkwardness in dealing with social situations, conditioned by years behind bars, a topic which should have been portrayed sensitively. These scenes, and the latter attempts at humour by the protagonist’s sidekicks does not evoke much humour.

Big Brother Starring: Mohanlal, Arbaaz Khan, Honey Rose

Direction: Siddique

Not that the ‘serious’ parts are any better. The fact that one of the villains is named ‘Shetty’, the scientific name for all villains in 90s Malayalam cinema, tells one a lot about the amount of thinking which has gone into making the film. The one previously-unseen touch is that the protagonist is endowed with night-vision capabilities, although no explanation is provided for the same!

While Satchidanandan plans to settle down to a peaceful life with his family, he is forced to get involved in many a conflict, after an IPS officer (Arbaaz Khan) launches a hunt against the drug mafia. Now, that is an excuse for the hero to fly in the air, single-handedly bashing up all the goons... who unfortunately have no night-vision capabilities. At one point, Satchidanandan and his sidekicks kidnap Shetty’s daughter Arya (Mirnaa Menon) so intelligently that she thinks that she is on a package tour. Being a fun trip, it has one song sequence, the whole duration of which the 20-something girl stares lovingly at the protagonist. Later, when he punches a bunch of goons, she shouts, “Yes!” and jumps up and down in celebration.

The twist in the tale is so evident for anyone who has watched the trailer, except of course for Satchidanandan, who gets it only at the end of the movie. The rest of us have to endure almost three hours of sheer agony, to be shown that big reveal, which we had known right from the beginning. Even die-hard fans of Mohanlal would find it hard to get excited by even a single sequence in Big Brother.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1tdklx/article30586198.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/big-brother,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/big-brother-movie-review-even-die-hard-mohanlal-fans-wouldnt-endure-this-mess/article30586199.ece
193,2020/01/17,An open letter to Deepika Padukone,"Dear Deepika,

I used to be your fan. Piku was my favourite film. I loved its patriotic theme: a fearless exposé on Bengalis, and their adamant refusal to listen to reason or accept sanskari values on account of their chronic constipation.

But of late, you have been behaving more like Prakash Raj’s daughter than Prakash Padukone’s.

As a badminton player, your father brought many laurels to our ancient civilisation in modern times. (Badminton, BTW, was invented in pre-Vedic India by Sage Sindhusaina. It was originally called padmanthan and played with a ball of cow dung with peacock feathers stuck in it.) Pity he gave up at that stage. Had he continued working hard, we have no doubt that he would have been promoted to being a tennis player, but that’s another story.

My question, young lady, is what in heaven’s name are you doing with these tukde-tukde fellows of JNU? Don’t you know what the JN in JNU stands for? Isn’t that alone reason enough for you to avoid these people?

If you want to be an activist, why don’t you follow the many role models from your own industry, my child? It is not too late.

For starters, Hemaji. She is a good place to begin. After all, you did play Dreamy Girl in your debut film. When it comes to taking up burning issues before you can so much as say ‘Basanti’, none can beat Hemaji.

Not too long ago, Hemaji, moved by the plight of Mathura’s myriad monkeys, demanded a monkey safari to ensure their safety. And the planting — on a war-footing — of fruit-bearing trees in forests. Why? Because the wretched monkeys had picked up the food habits of humans, and instead of eating fruit, were demanding hot-hot samosas and kachoris, and insisting on washing them down with chilled Frooti.

Now that’s a good cause to pick up, don’t you think? Bringing monkeys back to a meat-free paleo diet, perhaps encouraging them to do some gym work even. No one likes a jowly, pot-bellied monkey checking the Swiggy app on its phone. It is not good for tourism. Our country is known for super-fit monkeys.

No? How about emulating Juhi Chawla, then?

“There is only one person who has not taken a leave in the last five years, not a single day off. That is our PM,” she said. “He thinks about the people round the clock. Do we think in this way?”

She also said “Thank God, apun ke underwear ka naam ‘Dollar’ hai. ‘Rupee’ hota to baar baar girta raheta!”

If you ask me, either cause is worth taking up.

I like Akshay Kumar, too. He is a good man. I’m blushing as I say this but he is kind of my muse. Why not take a leaf out of his Canadian edition of Exam Warrior? If Hemaji has dedicated herself to weaning Mathuran monkeys away from kachoris and Juhi is planning on contributing her accumulated leave to our leader while simultaneously trading underwear in the Forex market to boost the economy, Kumar has turned the focus towards India’s much neglected fruit, the mango.

Who can forget his riveting interview of our PM?

I’ll tell you what’s best, though. What will totally ensure you aren’t sent back to Copenhagen. Follow the greatest of them all, Amitabh Bachchan. After all, he did say “Hum jahan khade ho jaate hain, line wahi se shuru hoti hain.”

That way you could be standing behind Aamir, Salman, Shah Rukh and a whole lot of obedient Bollywood children. With your finger on your lips.

195,2020/01/17,"‘1917’ movie review: Digging deep into the trenches, dazzling with each step","If there is one image from Sam Mendes’ 1917 that has lingered on, it’s that of the trenches. Narrow, winding, unified, alike, never-ending, stretching way till the horizon. Like the interminable war itself and the eternal human misery that comes in its wake. They are the hideouts, refuge and resting grounds as well as spaces for conflicts and attacks; proxy homes for the soldiers but suffocating in the way homes should never be.

Roger Deakins’ camera moves and leaps through these constricting furrows with an urgency that speaks as much for the monumental endeavour when it comes to the craft behind making 1917, as for the key that the film pivots on: a message that needs to be delivered with uncommon alacrity by two soldiers wading past many more of their kin crowding out the foxholes.

Sam Mendes comes to the point fast in the film that is based partly an an account he heard from his grandfather. The year is 1917, it’s World War I, the Germans have pulled back from a sector on the Western Front in France and the British have planned an attack on the retreating Germans. But aerial intelligence has it that it’s a sly, tactical move on part of the Germans to eventually attack the British with artillery. The telephone lines are cut and there is no other way left for General Erinmore (Colin Firth) but to have two young soldiers, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), hand-deliver the message to Colonel MacKenzie (Benedict Cumberbatch) of the second battalion of the Devonshire Regiment to call off the attack that would cost lives of 1600 soldiers, including Blake’s own brother Joseph (Richard Madden).

1917 Director: Sam Mendes

Starring: George MacKay, Dean-Charles Chapman, Mark Strong, Andrew Scott, Richard Madden, Claire Duburcq, Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch

Run time: 119 minutes

Storyline: Two young British soldiers during World War I are assigned the mission to deliver a message which warns of an ambush on a British battalion after a tactical German retreat

As the two cross the no man’s land, more trenches follow. The German ones now, collapsing, dotted with tripwires, filled with the stench of dead horses and human bodies. It’s a surreal, stark, utterly depressing and devastating wasteland of a landscape within which the film situates itself. The lost human touch is visible in the abandoned homes and farmhouses, rendered mere structures without any sign of life inside. The throbbing of a heart, if there is one, lies deeply concealed, like a young French woman in hiding with an infant whose parents she knows nothing about.

The film dazzles at each step, one encounter and adventure after another shot like a set piece, complete in itself with MacKay’s stoic presence adding to the pathos and poignancy. He lives the film’s adage: “He travels the fastest, who travels alone”. Much has been and will be written about the long takes that make the entire film appear like one continuous shot. Or the climactic sprint of Schofield across the battlefield as the charging British infantry is bombarded by the German artillery.

But the most haunting and heartbreaking sequence remains the one in which Schofield eventually reaches the Devonshires through the agency of a song, heard faintly from a distance, and gradually growing audible, clearer and sharper, enveloping in its sheer poetry, but also smothering us with the underlying pain and weariness of the soldiers. Wayfaring Stranger plumbs the depths of melancholia, especially in one simple, seering line, “I’m just going over home”.

True to the spirit of the song, as we move along in 1917, invested and also on the edge of our seats, it becomes a human journey than just a soldier’s mission. It’s about doggedness and bravery, forgiveness and treachery and faith and continuities in the long road to survival. It all boils down to a familiar narrative, oft-stated but perhaps always in need to be expressed more and more: the loss of young lives, families torn asunder and those waiting in anxiety and hope and the overwhelming longing for home. Home where there is the Christmas turkey, the chicken dinner, the new-born puppies and the cherry blossoms in the orchard, all waiting for you. Eventually any good war film can’t be about anything but the futility of war.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/3c4j5f/article30585735.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1917,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/1917-movie-review-digging-deep-into-the-trenches-dazzling-with-each-step/article30585736.ece
196,2020/01/17,From Freddie Mercury to Pope Francis: What’s in a biopic?,"Why do celebrities do what they do? This never ceases to intrigue us, whether it is Deepika Padukone’s brave show of solidarity with JNU students or the tragic life of Amy Winehouse. Several films in the past year have attempted to deconstruct the enigmatic lives of public figures in the hope of understanding and humanising them, but there’s one film that stood out for its empathetic and unusually therapeutic gaze: the Shia LaBeouf-starrer Honey Boy.

Written by LaBeouf and based on his own childhood, Honey Boy must have been a cathartic experience for the actor, who has notoriously been in rehab for drug addiction. In the film, he steps into his father’s shoes by playing the alcoholic and abusive parent to 11-year-old Otis (Noah Jupe), who works as a child actor and provides for the family. Going between the past and the present, the film delicately uncovers how a traumatic and loveless childhood has a long-lasting impact on your life, in ways you may not even be aware of. In several interviews before the film’s release, LaBeouf, who was diagnosed with PTSD in rehab, revealed that the genesis of the film lay in his therapy sessions. Through a fictionalised account of his life, LaBeouf reaches out to the audience for the affection and sympathy that he seldom got from his father.

Much before selfies, self-portraits have been a way for artists to immortalise themselves, through the course of art history. But in cinema, it’s not often that we see filmmakers and actors chronicling their own lives. Belgian-French filmmaker Agnès Varda is a noted exception. Last year, a month before she passed away at 90, she wrote her own eulogy on celluloid. In her documentary, Varda par Agnès, which premièred at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival, she talks directly to the camera, as if preempting her final days. It’s a self-portrait that barely gives a glimpse of her life outside her art, but through the dismantling of her work, we understand how personal her cinema, photography and visual art are, and her fascination with real time.

Still from Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am

Art and identity

“Inspiration, création, partage (Inspiration, creation, sharing),” are the three words that drive her as a filmmaker, she says. Discussing a few films in her expansive career, Varda par Agnès is largely about ‘partage’: she shares her insights, choices and her journey from analogue to digital. Unlike LaBeouf, Varda maintains a distance from her life, in a way that is intimate yet critical. In her earlier and rather charming documentary, Faces Places, she traverses the French countryside with street artist JR, and presents her carefree and affable self to us. In Varda par Agnès, she is measured and fully aware that this may be her last.

This sense of finality permeates Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am as well, which was released a couple of months before the Nobel laureate in literature passed away last year at 88. The documentary is reverential towards Morrison but also welcomes the uninitiated. In present-day divided America, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders’s documentary underlines the significance of Morrison’s racial identity in her oeuvre: the novelist never shied away from it in an attempt to appease white readers or critics, even as she was dismissed for “restricting her writing” to the black experience. Morrison hit back even harder with novels like Sula and Beloved, and speaks about it unequivocally, demonstrating how an artist’s identity influences their work.

Identity informs art in Dexter Fletcher’s Rocketman too. This film, about musician Elton John, shows how John’s sexuality shaped him as a musician and made for a rather colourful public life. The advantage of making an authorised biography with the subject as one of the producers is the access, but there’s also the threat of self-censorship, obscurantism and sanitisation. While exploring the sex and drug-fuelled life of John, Rocketman toes the line between the two carefully, unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, which casts a rather prudish and heteronormative gaze on Freddie Mercury’s queerness.

Blind spots

The popstar’s bisexuality was an open secret, although not confirmed by the singer himself. Directed by Bryan Singer (who has denied multiple accusations of sexual abuse), the film never fully understands Mercury’s sexual fluidity but pushes for an either-or identity, while feeding into the belief that HIV is divine punishment for being sexually liberated.

Still from ‘Bohemian Rhapsody’

Public figures do have blind spots. Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles tries to understand the goings-on behind closed doors in the Vatican in The Two Popes, while following the rise and fall of Pope Benedict XVI and Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio aka Pope Francis. Using documentary aesthetics to blur the lines between fiction and reality, and armed with spot-on casting of Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Pryce as Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis, respectively, the Netflix film navigates complicated issues of morality, modernity, tradition, faith, financial malfeasance and the sexual harassment scandals plaguing the Catholic church.

Meirelles isn’t neutral while dealing with the politics of the Church and the military dictatorship in Argentina in the 1970s. While his sympathies clearly lie with Pope Francis, he humanises Pope Benedict XVI almost literally. “You’re only human,” Bergoglio says to Pope Benedict XVI in a lofty tone. The film is an apt reminder that a biopic, even if it’s a self-portrait, is an interpretation of a life lived, rather than the life itself.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/fpf2b8/article30584970.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/19SM1ROCKETMAN8jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/from-freddie-mercury-to-pope-francis-whats-in-a-biopic/article30584975.ece
197,2020/01/17,‘Jai Mummy Di’ movie review: What was the joke?,"Jai Mummy Di is a cake that just refuses to rise. The basic problem is the thin and flimsy idea that it is built on. A young couple — Puneet (Sunny Singh) and Sanjh (Sonnalli Seygall) —have to work around their constantly bickering mothers, Pinky and Laali (Poonam Dhillon and Supriya Pathak Kapur), to finally get married.

To begin with, it’s difficult to wrap your head around the fact that something so simple can be so gargantuan and irresolvable an issue. In a bid to keep it a secret till the end (which is no big deal) no ground is laid for their animosity; in fact, it is barely dwelt on. What should have been the focus is given a short shrift, made a convenient device when it could have been the source of some stimulating situations and sharp dialogue to make one remain engrossed in the proceedings. Both these elements go entirely missing. Instead a loudness looms large: be it the setting, characters, colours, everything. We just keep going round and round in a tiring, boring, humourless circle than things leaping forward with a sense of fun and urgency. The choppy ride gets even more uneven with needless, randomly thrust-in song-and-dance numbers.

Jai Mummy Di Director: Navjot Gulati

Starring: Sunny Singh, Sonnalli Seygall, Supriya Pathak Kapur, Poonam Dhillon, Danish Hussain

Storyline: Puneet and Sanjh have to find a way around their constantly bickering mothers to get married

Run time: 103 minutes

The camera remains trained on the couple that one doesn’t feel anything for because there is nothing simmering and sizzling between the two, nor in them individually either. Sunny Singh keeps sporting a dull, hangdog expression throughout the film and Sonnalli Seygall is plain bland, much like the film itself.

Jai Mummy Di has got the one big selling point of most recent Hindi films: a strong set character artistes. Unfortunately it is unable to do them justice, reducing each of them to mere caricatures. Poonam Dhillon scowls, Supriya Pathak Kapur goes through the motions mechanically and Danish Hussain looks distracted, as though he is thinking that he should have been elsewhere. Much like how the audience also feels.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/owyido/article30584025.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/jai,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jai-mummy-di-movie-review-what-was-the-joke/article30584026.ece
198,2020/01/17,Arvind Swami is all swagger as MGR in ‘Thalaivi’,"On the occasion of MG Ramachandran’s 103rd birth anniversary, the makers of Thalaivi have unveiled the first look poster of Arvind Swami as MGR. Thalaivi is an upcoming biopic on the life of the former AIADMK supremo, J Jayalalithaa.

Arvind Swamy as MGR in ‘Thalaivi’

In the movie starring Kangana Ranaut in the titular role, Arvind Swami will be essaying MGR, who was instrumental in Jayalaithaa’s political career. Directed by AL Vijay, Thalaivi has music by GV Prakash Kumar and is eyeing for release later this year. A teaser of the actor as MGR from the film has also been released, in which the resemblance looks even more uncanny.

199,2020/01/17,"‘Darbar’ doesn’t work, but it proves brand Rajinikanth still can — and how","The last Rajinikanth film I liked was ‘Padayappa’ and that’s two decades old.

The graph has been sliding steadily downhill after a couple of upward spikes: like portions of ‘Sivaji’ and ‘Endhiran’. ‘Padayappa’ had all the ingredients you expect from his movies in the right proportions mixed to perfection by a director who knew how long to let it simmer. The antagonist was female, but what she lacked in muscle was compensated for with guile and cunning. It had respect, love, obsession, betrayal of trust and good eventually triumphing over evil. The performances were terrific with the protagonist and antagonist ageing gracefully and their final verbal face-off eliciting deafening applause. I also suspect it’s the last film Rajini sported his own mane, as the young Padayappa.

January 12th this year, marked the 25th anniversary of the epochal ‘Baashha’, which sent the superstar’s fans into an unparalleled frenzy. Loosely based on the Hindi blockbuster ‘Hum’ in which Rajini too co-starred Amitabh, the transformation of a seemingly timid auto driver when his family is provoked and the unravelling of a violent past is still the reference point for most aspiring directors. Any script with slight similarities reminds you of ‘Baashha’.

KS Ravi Kumar and Suresh Krissna are two of the very few directors who’ve directed Rajini and Kamal quite comfortably and successfully. If Suresh had ‘Sathya’ (Debut), and ‘Indhiran Chandiran’ with Kamal, he made ‘Annamalai’ and ‘Baasha’ with Rajni. Likewise, Ravi Kumar directed ‘Avvai Shanmughi’ and ‘Tenali’ with Kamal and ‘Muthu’ and ‘Padayappa’ with Rajni to name a couple. They directed turkeys too like ‘Baba’, ‘Lingaa’ and ‘Aalavandhan’ but their success rate was terrific. Of course, the only director who effortlessly elicited first-rate performances from Rajini and Kamal without compromising on his cinematic sensibilities was Mani Ratnam. A section of Rajini’s fans were disappointed that he had to play another star’s underling, but the superstar loved the experience and even told Mani he was eagerly awaiting another offer.

Well, coming to the point, it’s not easy directing a film with a superstar, especially someone like Rajini with a fanatical fan-following. They don’t expect him to do anything drastically different, but know exactly what they want. For them change is not a constant but a concern. Every wannabe director worth his megaphone dreams of directing the Superstar, but when he does get the chance seems unable to write scenes which would evoke shrill, appreciative whistles. The anxiety to deliver is both overwhelming and frightening. Now here’s a star whose films are looked forward to with unwavering, even growing enthusiasm 45 years since he made his debut. The fire K. Balachander saw in his eyes may be flickering, but is still enough to evoke fear in the most dreaded filmi foe. His remuneration has steadily increased and is at a record high of 100 crore if reports are true, and that too after a string of flops by his standards. But as far as his fans are concerned, they just can’t get enough of him. The onus is on the director to deliver which hasn’t happened in the recent past.

Even A.R. Murugadoss who’s churned out money-spinners with other superstars and claimed it was his dream to direct Rajini (he was saying that about Kamal too), falters and fails miserably. He’s known to have a large think tank of writers but what they have concocted for the superstar is mostly unpalatable. After ‘Kabali’, ‘Darbar’ was the Rajni starrer that had fans waiting with bated breath because Murugadoss dangles a contemporary social ill which the protagonist fights while vanquishing the perpetrators.

But ‘Darbar’ just doesn’t have a strong premise. Seriously, the Superstar’s shrewd selection of scripts has been suspect in the last decade, at least most of them. Murugadoss shows scant respect for the sensibilities of Rajnii’s fans and since he claims to be his biggest admirer, ‘Darbar’ is an insult. Logic is not the only thing missing. It’s sheer common sense and a total lack of understanding of the machinations in the police force. You can see the eagerness to inject situations that appeal and also keep the ambiguity about his age intact.

What is lacking in the film is a straightforward, engaging plot. We get to endure a contrived rather than convincing fare. A gang of goons armed with guns of various sizes does not shoot, while a police commissioner confronts and slices them with Samurai swords. He locks up, threatens and coerces a Human Rights official into giving a favourable report. The press calls him a mad cop, but nobody even admonishes him as he goes trigger-happy shooting gangsters in public. He cracks a kidnapping, annihilates the drug mafia and busts a prostitution ring with elementary sleuthing skills. He has a daughter who wants him to marry because he’ll be lonely when she weds and leaves. So we have puerile attempts at wooing a beautiful lady who approaches the commissioner’s office to report a stalker. There’s an accident involving the father and daughter where their cab is mowed down by a truck. With only a couple of Band-Aids to show external wounds, an elderly doctor tells the girl she’s suffered subdural hematoma and calmly advises her to spend her last couple of hours with her father, who is lying unconscious. There are no suggestions of an emergency surgery or efforts of any kind to try and save her. The father regains consciousness to find his daughter dead and goes crazy which is the explanation for his mindless shooting. The improbable proceedings plod on till a tame confrontation in the climax.

This is Rajini’s most physically-strenuous film in recent years. I can’t remember him shaking a leg in so many songs with his trademark ‘karate’ steps. His presence is still magnetic, be it his graceful panther-like gait or the streak of mischief he infuses in the light scenes. He’s still a much better actor than the pretenders to his throne. Watch him in the scene where his beau’s cousin visits him and gently warns him about trying to impress her considering his age. In fact, it’s the best-written scene in the film. Then there’s his reaction when he watches his daughter conveying in a recording about a mild pain in the back of her scalp before she dies.

Rajini still can. I’d say his age is an advantage. He needs a director who can write a script where he uses his heart and brains, rather than just senseless banter and brawn. It’s time, there’s more soul than style.

“We created Apple TV Plus as a home for stories that matter and believe The Banker, inspired by the brave actions of Bernard Garrett Sr. and Joe Morris, two African-American businessmen who brought about positive social change, is one of those stories,” Variety.com quoted an Apple spokesperson.

“We wanted to take the time to understand the situation at hand — and after reviewing the information available to us, including documentation of the filmmakers’ research, we have decided to make this important and enlightening film available to viewers,” the spokesperson added.

201,2020/01/17,What is Goethe-Institut’s ‘60 German Filmabende 1960-2020’ all about?,"It has been 60 years since the foundation of Goethe-Institut Chennai. While the Institut technically turns 60 only on August 20, the celebrations leading up to its anniversary are already in place. To commemorate its Golden Jubilee year, the Goethe-Institut presents 60 German Filmabende 1960-2020, an ongoing film programme, with a focus on capturing the essence of German cinema.

Putting together a list of 60 landmark movies, chronicling six decades of German cinema, might come across as a laborious task. But it is a challenge that Helmut Schippert, director of the Goethe-Institut Chennai, took upon himself. Schippert says that the list would act as a handy guide to anyone who is serious about German history and its culture.

Cinema, in fact, became a significant part of Goethe-Institut from as far back as the ‘80s, informs Schippert in a telephonic chat. “We wanted to reflect upon the past — not looking historically but looking at the essence of what is still relevant for the future,” he says, adding, “Films have been a strong part of every programme we organise. The idea behind these screenings is to show what has changed in the arthouse landscape of German cinema.”

Your watchlist Hunting Scenes from Bavaria (1969)

The Legend of Paul and Paula (1973)

The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974)

Bagdad Cafe (1987)

Train Birds (1997)

Run Lola Run (1998)

In the Fade (2017)

Schippert comes from a small village in Germany, where cinema was not centralised unlike in the cities back then. He was initially drawn to Western movies from the silent era and was fascinated by the works of Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and cowboy movies, in particular. He recounts the time in the late ’60s when he popped a cigarette to masquerade as an adult, to catch Blow Up, which was an R-rated movie. These little nuggets of teenage memories are what helped him in the curation. “I was looking at four to five different threads while curating these movies. We have quite a bit of movies from the German Democratic Republic, which ceased to exist after the Fall of the Berlin Wall,” he says about the process, adding that the protagonists of German cinema — Frank Beyer, Alexander Kluge, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Werner Herzog — formed the dominant part of the selection.

Schippert admits that there were certain themes, like alcoholism post-Berlin Wall and the sexual lives of elderly people, that were not suitable for the Indian public. “Since I have been in Chennai for a long time, I was able to understand the mindset of the public here. So, I looked at movies from a more entertaining and humouristic point of view, as German cinema is usually considered ‘serious’,” he adds.

Over 120 movies made it to the final list, of which 60 were filtered, “It was not an easy choice to make. For example, there is a 16-hour movie which didn’t make it to the list. Because we are mostly targeting at younger audience, especially women,” he says.

60 German Filmabende 1960-2020 is open to all. There will be a screening at Goethe-Institut throughtout the year.

203,2020/01/17,"Well-intentioned schemes for tribals can fail if the community is not kept at the centre of the process, says former Kerala Chief Secretary","The most well-intentioned developmental schemes for the tribal community can end up disenfranchising them further if the community is not kept at the centre of the process, said S.M. Vijayanand, former Chief Secretary of Kerala and Head, Sixth State Financial Commission, Kerala.

In an interaction on ‘Mental Health, Identity and Culture: Focus on Indigenous Groups in India’ organised by The Banyan Academy of Leadership in Mental Health as part of the Sundaram Fasteners Lecture Series on Mental Health and Social Development on Monday, Mr. Vijayanand said that schemes that did not accommodate the culture of the tribes were susceptible to issues of alienation and maladjustment.

Mr. Vijayanand, who has worked closely with the tribal population in Attapadi, a reserved forest area in Kerala, cited examples from the schemes implemented in Kerala. “As a result of land reforms in Kerala, people from the plains were given land which traditionally belonged to the tribes. Even in mid-day meal scheme, the food served is not what the tribals traditionally consume, because of which their health parameters get affected,” he said.

“They receive education in a language they do not understand, they are economically vulnerable ... and there is strong othering,” he added. Arguing that such interventions had strong implications on their mental health, he said some surveys by tribal activists have found that mental health problems are unusually high in Attapadi. “Some of the main reasons are alienation, inability to adjust, disorientation, sense of inferiority, mistrust, discrimination and self exclusion,” he said.

Pointing out that Kerala was planning to revise its Mental Health Care Act, he expressed hope that the amended Act would include special provisions for tribal people.

He said that post Independence, tribals were the only social group who lost more than they gained. “They (tribals) make for excellent research fodder, using which any theory of development or underdevelopment can be tested, innovative bureaucrats can implement pet strategies on them, environmentalists can extol their way of life, revolutionaries can spit false promises on them, activists and non-governmental organisations can propose outlandish solutions, respected politicians can drown them with doles, distant friends can shed tears at their plight, and unfriendly neighbours can exploit them endlessly, yes, they can be everything to everybody, as passive timid targets,” he said.

Andrew Wilford, Professor, Cornell University, who has worked with the Irula and Kurumba tribes in the Nilgiris, stressed the need for participatory action and cultural humility in steps taken for the welfare of tribal people.

204,2020/01/17,Two die at Alanganallur Jallikattu,"A bull rearer and a spectator died at the Jallikattu event held in Alanganallur, on Friday.

V. Sridhar (27) who was attempting to lead a bull through the vaadivasal -- the entry point of the arena -- was gored to death by his own bull while he was trying to ensure it got out of the narrow path between the holding area and the entry point.

The patient suffered deep puncture wounds above the stomach and below the chest, said Government Rajaji Hospital Resident Medical Officer, A. Srilatha.

Another patient M. Chellapandi (35) was brought dead to the GRH after fainting while watching the event, the doctor added.

The Jallikattu started early on Friday morning, with the people of Alanganallur sounding songs, cheers and whistles, when the first bull was released at 7.47 a.m. through the vadivasal.

Revenue Minister R. B. Udayakumar, MLAs from Madurai, District Collector T. G. Vinay and Retired Principal District Judge C. Manickam who has been appointed by the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court as Chairman of the organising committee for jallikattu in Avaniyapuram, Palamedu and Avaniyapuram, inaugurated the event.

After an initial inspection of the arena by officials from the District Administration and the Police department, various stakeholders including the players took an oath to play the sport ethically.

Many bulls could not easily get out of the vadivasal as it was difficult to remove the noose tied around their neck and nose. Only around 30 bulls were released in the first round according to the members of the organising committee. A total of 75 players entered the arena in the first round. At the end of the third round, a total of 220 bulls were released.

Chandru, retired judge of Madras High Court as the chairman of a fee-fixation committee for private agricultural colleges in the State. His name was nominated by Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi.

Apart from the chairperson, the committee comprises of a Member Secretary and seven other members. Agriculturist OVR. Somasundaram of Odayakulam in Pollachi Taluk of Coimbatore district has been named as one of the members.

According to a Government Order issued by the Agriculture Department on January 7, the Supreme Court had, in August 2003, ordered the constitution of committees headed by retired High Court judges to fix fees for students admitted in private professional educational institutions.

Subsequently, by virtue of Section 2(e) of the Tamil Nadu Admission in Professional Educational Institutions Act of 2006, the government, in May 2007, notified all courses in agriculture as well as allied subjects in undergraduate level as professional educational courses. The Tamil Nadu Admission in Agricultural Institutions Rules of 2007 were also framed. Accordingly, the government had now constituted a committee to fix the fee structure for students studying in institutions affiliated to Tamil Nadu Agricultural University in Coimbatore.

Its chairman, Justice Chandru, had served as a judge of the Madras High Court from July 31, 2006 to March 8, 2013. In less than seven years, he had disposed of more than 96,000 cases of which judgements delivered in over 1,500 cases were reported in law journals.

207,2020/01/17,Jallikattu held amid heavy security in Tiruchi; 29 injured,"The first Jallikattu event of this year’s season in Tiruchi district was held in Periya Suriyur amid a heavy police presence, and was monitored by officials. As many as 29 people sustained injuries. A dry waterbody was chosen for the event, which was flagged off by Collector S. Sivarasu, in the presence of Superintendent of Police Ziaul Haque and other officials.

This time, the age criterion for the tamers was fixed at 21 years, with the revenue team ensuring adherence by checking their Aadhaar card and other documents.

A police team used breath analysers to check if the tamers had consumed alcohol. The weight and blood pressure of the tamers were checked by medical teams deployed at the venue. The tamers, who were provided with tee shirts of different colours, were sent in batches during the course of the event.

A senior Animal Husbandry Department official at the venue said every bull was examined to ensure that it was not fed alcohol or any other drugs through a chemical test carried out on the spot before allowing the animal to enter the arena through the vaadivasal. The health certificate of each bull was required to be produced, the official said, adding that teams were also deployed at the collection point.

Lack of galleries

Though the event attracted several people from nearby villages and other parts of the district, there was no gallery for them to sit and watch the event this year.

“I make it a point to come and watch the event every year. But this time, the organisers have not erected galleries to enable visitors to sit and watch the event,” said Krithika, who had come from Lalgudi. Her point was echoed by Monica, also from the same town. However, the lack of seating arrangements for visitors did not dampen their spirit. Many climbed atop lorries parked on either side of the arena to witness the event. K. Kumar, a carpenter based out of Tiruchi, said “Jallikattu has blended into Tamil culture and tradition”, and he had never missed the event being held in the district.

Double barricades were erected on either side of the arena as a safety measure to prevent onlookers from entering the ground.

The bull owner, Murugan, 40, hailing from a village near Denkanikottai, was leading his bull to participate in the erudhattam in Vannathypatty when the alarmed animal jumped the leash and dragged him down. According to sources, Murugan reportedly lost his grip and the bull stomped on his chest. Murugan died of injuries soon after. Perumal, 65, was injured in the incident.

In Tiruchi, 29 persons, including a woman, were injured during a jallikattu at Periya Suriyur. Eight of the injured were referred to the K.A.P. Viswanatham Government Medical College Hospital and private hospitals in Tiruchi, said police sources.

Among the seriously injured were six spectators, a bull tamer and a bull owner. The others were treated by medical teams at the spot. The woman, Jothilakshmi, suffered injuries in her leg after being hit by a bull while she was watching the event from outside the arena.

As many as 610 bulls were released through the vaadivasal during the jallikattu. About 340 tamers took to the arena.

The plazas are located at Krishnagiri, Vikravandi, Omalur, Kaniyur, Samayapuram, Palayam, Paranur, Moratandi, Thirumandurai, Kodai, Vaikuntham, Sengurichi and Vijayamangalam. The Krishnagiri plaza witnesses over 30,000 vehicles a day, Palayam, Kaniyur and Omalur plazas see over 25,000 vehicles. All the 13 plazas see over 20,000 vehicles a day.

The Central government had permitted additional cash lanes at plazas for a month till January 15 since radio frequency-based ID card FASTag coverage is still not universal in the State. However, Tamil Nadu has one of the highest coverage of such tags stuck on the front windscreen of vehicles. “In other plazas, non-FASTag vehicles would be charged double if they enter designated lanes for FASTag vehicles,” explained an official of the National Highways Authority of India.

On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, all the 42 toll plazas on the National Highways witnessed heavy vehicular traffic with toll operators managing the rush by allowing more cash lanes. A cash-back scheme of 2.5% is available on FASTag payments till March 31, for eligible customers.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/additional-cash-lanes-to-stay-for-one-more-month/article30579836.ece
210,2020/01/17,HC to the rescue of mother of woman with disability,"The Madras High Court has come to the rescue of a widow, who wanted her daughter suffering from cerebral palsy to benefit from the provisions of the National Trust for the Welfare of Persons with Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Mental Retardation and Multiple Disabilities Act of 1999.

Disposing of a writ petition filed by C. Indira of Choolaimedu, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan directed the Chennai Collector to expedite the processing of an application made by her way back on October 22, 2018 to get appointed as a guardian of her daughter under the Act.

The judge ordered that the application be disposed of on or before February 15 after affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioner.

“It is hoped that the respondent would take into consideration the fact that the Act has been passed with a welfare objective. The respondent may adopt a broad-minded approach by keeping in mind the object of the Act and discharge the responsibility as an authority under the Act,” the judge said.

The petitioner stated that her daughter was suffering from cerebral palsy since birth. The government institute of rehabilitation and medicine at K.K. Nagar in Chennai assessed her and issued a certificate stating that she was suffering from 80% permanent disability.

Therefore, the petitioner wanted to get herself recognised as the guardian under the 1999 Act, whose object was to enable and empower the mentally challenged to live as independently and as fully as possible and as close to the community to which they belonged and to strengthen facilities required for them.

The national trust was formed with a one-time grant of ₹100 crore allotted by the Centre and it was authorised to receive bequests of movable property from any person for furtherance of the objectives of the Trust.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-to-the-rescue-of-mother-of-woman-with-disability/article30579812.ece
211,2020/01/17,High Court asks tahsildar to cancel legal heir certificate,"Tahsildars cannot include the names of parents of a deceased Hindu woman in the legal heir certificate if the latter was survived by her children, the Madras High Court has ruled.

The court pointed out that the properties of a Hindu woman, dying intestate, shall devolve firstly upon her children (including children of any pre-deceased son or daughter).

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan said only in the case of a deceased Hindu male, the names of his children, widow as well as mother could be included in the legal heir certificate.

However, the procedure was a little different in the case of a deceased Hindu female if one goes by the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act of 1956.

He pointed out that Section 15(1) of the Act states that the property of a female Hindu, who died without executing a will, would devolve firstly upon her sons and daughters (including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter) and the husband. Secondly, it would devolve upon the heirs of the husband and only thirdly upon her parents.

Further, Section 15(2)(a) of the Act states that even properties inherited by a Hindu woman from her father or mother shall devolve firstly on her children or grandchildren (in case of a pre-deceased son or daughter).

Only if she had no children or grandchildren, those properties would devolve upon the heirs of the father of the deceased woman. Section 15(2)(b) goes on to explain that any property inherited by a Hindu woman from her husband or father-in-law would devolve, in the absence of any son or daughter (including the children of any pre deceased son or daughter), not upon the heirs referred to in 15(1), but upon the heirs of the husband.

Banda Venkata Ramanadha Krishna alias B.V.R. Krishna of Chennai filed a writ petition protesting against the inclusion of his mother-in-law’s name in the legal heir certificate issued by the Aminjikarai Taluk Tahsildar.

Accepting his submission, the judge directed the Tahsildar to cancel that certificate and issue a new one showing the daughter of the deceased and the petitioner as legal heirs of the deceased woman.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/high-court-asks-tahsildar-to-cancel-legal-heir-certificate/article30579785.ece
212,2020/01/17,Congress keen on truce with DMK,"The Congress appears keen on a truce with the DMK though the latter has taken a hard stance against the national party after TNCC president K.S. Alagiri and Congress Legislature Party leader K.R. Ramasamy publicly accused the Dravidian party of not adhering to “coalition dharma” in the recent rural local body polls.

DMK treasurer Duraimurugan had on Wednesday matter of fact said that the Congress could leave the alliance it desired to.

However efforts are under way to assuage the senior ally. On Pongal day, former TNCC president K V Thangkabalu met DMK president Mr Stalin to greet him as well as discuss the current strains in the relationship between the two parties. “The alliance is very firm and it will continue. The alliance was built by Sonia Gandhi and Karunanidhi. Rahul Gandhi and Stalin have made it more comfortable and strong,” he insisted.

He said the leadership of both parties was very clear that the alliance should continue. “The Congress is endeavoring to consolidate nationalist and secular forces. Mr Stalin is the leader of the secular alliance in Tamil Nadu. There might be issues here and there, but all these can be sorted out if we sit and talk within four walls,” Mr. Thangkabalu told The Hindu.

Another former TNCC president Su. Thirunavukkarasar too echoed his views. “The alliance had 100% success in the Parliament elections. Local body polls involve thousands of seats. Things like this will happen. This should not end the alliance,” he said.

Mr. Thirunavukkarasar said some leaders in the DMK were giving counter-statements to the letter issued by the Congress leaders to save the party’s image. “But, it is important to continue the alliance in the interest of both the parties. This tussle should stop now and we have to proceed to prepare for the [2021] Assembly elections. Forget the past, sit and talk,” he said adding that individually he preferred that a team be formed at the Central level and hold seat sharing discussions with the DMK.

Kanniyakumari MP Vasantha Kumar said Mr. Stalin was the leader of the alliance and the Congress would go by what he wanted. “He has not said anything. Does Mr. Duraimurugan have more powers than Mr. Stalin? Does he have the rights to decide on issues? If Mr. Stalin says we should leave, then we will decide what to do,” he said.

However, Congress MP from Virudhunagar, Manickam Tagore said some in the DMK were acting in a manner to prevent Mr Stalin from becoming the Chief Minister. Targetting Mr. Duraimurugan, he said no one needs to teach the Congress about coalition unity.

Sources in the Congress also said that contrary to claims made by some DMK leaders that Mr. Alagiri had written an apology letter to Mr. Stalin, no such letter had been given. Some leaders felt Mr. Alagiri was well within his rights to raise the issue of seat sharing in the rural local bodies keeping in mind the Congress cadres’ wishes. “Ultimately, as president of the State unit, he has to keep the interests of the party’s cadres as well. Where’s the question of issuing an apology letter,” a senior leader asked.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/congress-keen-on-truce-with-dmk/article30579670.ece
213,2020/01/17,HC orders installation of CCTV cameras in recreation club,"The Madras High Court has directed a recreation club at Pallavaram to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in areas earmarked by the police inside the club and furnish the footage to the police authorities whenever required if the club does not want men in uniform to visit the club frequently to keep a check on its activities.

Justice C.V. Karthikeyan issued the direction while disposing of a writ petition filed by D. Loganathan, who runs Sai Recreation and Sports Club in Old Pallavaram. Claiming that members of the club use the premises only for playing cards without any element of gambling, the petitioner urged the court to restrain the police from interfering with its affairs.

The petitioner relied upon an order passed by the High Court in 2014 in a case filed Masti Health and Beauty Private Limited, restraining the police from conducting raids as a matter of routine and without any basis, and urged the court to pass similar orders with respect to his club too by preventing the police from making frequent inspections.

Accepting the plea, the judge ordered that there should not be any interference by the police as long as the activities of the club were not in violation of any provisions of the law. If the police had any doubt or credible information regarding illegal activities, the club could be raided after recording reasons in the General Diary maintained in the police station concerned.

“The police authorities shall not otherwise unnecessarily disturb the activities of the club of the petitioner under the guise of inspection... The petitioner shall comply with the requirements of the police authorities to install CCTV cameras at the locations earmarked and shall furnish the footages to the police authorities whenever required,” the judge ordered.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/hc-orders-installation-of-cctv-cameras-in-recreation-club/article30579578.ece

215,2020/01/17,A ‘Jallikattu’ for women,"Jallikattu, the bull-taming spectacle that has become synonymous with the harvest festival of Pongal, is widely perceived as a sport that exhibits a man’s physical strength and courage. But a youth club in Namakkal has been organising a Jallikattu-like event exclusively for women for 10 years and counting.

In ‘Navina Jallikattu’, as it is called, it’s not a bull that has to be stopped in its tracks, but a hen.

Big draw

Women of all ages get to take part in the event, organised by the Nandhavanam Ilaignyar Narpani Mandram in Nandhavanam near Thiruchengode. Every year, Navina Jallikattu witnesses enthusiastic participation from local residents.

“We wanted to have an event exclusively for women, and that’s why we started this. A big circle is drawn, and one of the legs of the hen is tied to either leg of the contestant [using a rope]. The contestants are blindfolded, and should catch the hen without stepping on the rope or going out of the circle,” said S. Devendran, the president of the club.

“It has the thrill of playing an adventure sport. The winners are usually presented with utensils,” he said.

D. Surya, a contestant, said, “It’s quite thrilling. Though challenging, it doesn’t seem physically exhausting.

216,2020/01/17,Nizam-era water filter bed quietly flows into history,"Hardly anyone in Adilabad took cognisance of the fact that the old filter bed which supplied filtered and safe drinking water in the town for over 70 years has quietly become part of history.

About three months ago, the filter bed which was synonymous with the drinking water supply system in Adilabad Municipality — the oldest urban local body in the former composite Adilabad district — was closed completely with Mission Bhagiratha scheme taking over.

“No one seems to have time to ponder over the development though local people had a deep attachment to it. In all the past elections, the filter bed used to be a point of debate among voters as it was an important source of water supply in town,” laments Md. Nazeer, an elderly voter from Bhuktapur when informed about the closure of the old filtration plant.

Thirst-quencher

It was in the 1940s under the rule of the last Nizam of Hyderabad that the drinking water supply system came into being.

It incorporated construction of the Mavala Tank from where water was drawn through a 7-km underground pipeline by gravity to the filter beds located close to the district collectorate.

Known as the The Candy Rapid Gravity Filtration Plant, it was set up by the Candy Filtration Company Ltd., London, and became operational in 1947. The cost of the plant, however, is not known now.

Engineering marvel

“It supplied 1.5 million litres of water per day all these years,” recalls in-charge of Mavala water supply in town, T. Ganga Reddy, who retired about six months ago. “The system required no expenditure for maintenance except for the cost of 18 to 19 tonnes of alum and bleaching powder every year,” he adds, hinting at the ingenuity in planning and executing the water supply system which is nothing short of an engineering marvel.

The water supply scheme was actually designed for a population of 20,000 in the 1940s when Adilabad town got almost all its infrastructure as the district headquarters. The first civic election in 1952 saw the scheme being handled by the municipality.

“It was after the phenomenon of rapid urbanisation that the filter plant faced some problems. Construction activity resulted in damage to the pipeline as the town kept expanding in the 1970s,” Mr. Ganga Reddy recalls.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/157ehn/article30589683.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17-ADILA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/nizam-era-water-filter-bed-quietly-flows-into-history/article30589622.ece
217,2020/01/17,CBI court rejects Jaganmohan’s plea,"The CBI special court here on Friday dismissed a petition filed by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, who is facing a batch of quid pro quo cases, to stall hearing of five charge-sheets filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against him.

Principal special judge of the special court B.R. Madhusudhan Rao, who had earlier heard the contentions of counsel of Mr Jagan and the ED, passed the order on the plea of AP Chief Minister. The judge agreed with the arguments of ED’s counsel that hearing of the charge-sheets filed by both ED and CBI could be carried out simultaneously.

Mr. Reddy filed the petition under Section 309 of Criminal Procedure Code, praying that the trial in cases related to the ED be kept in abeyance. Mr. Reddy, who had attended the CBI special court during the previous hearing on January 10 for the first time in his capacity as AP CM, did not turn up before the court on Friday. He had filed a petition seeking exemption from appearance before the court, stating that he was occupied with the High Power Committee meeting related to the State administration. Exempting him from appearance, the court posted the matters related to the ED for January 24.

The special court judge also declined to allow another petition filed by the AP CM, requesting the court to simultaneously hear the discharge petitions regarding five CBI charge-sheets against him in quid pro quo cases and the other charge-sheets filed by the CBI. Mr. Reddy filed the petition under Section 223 of Cr.P.C. CBI counsel opposed the petition, contending that the charge-sheets had been filed nearly eight years ago.

CBI counsel argued that Mr. Reddy and others had been trying to get the trial delayed by citing different grounds and presenting petitions. In this background, the trial of the charge-sheets and hearing of the discharge petitions should be conducted separately, CBI counsel argued.

Former Minister and presently YSRCP MLA from AP Dharmana Prasada Rao and Telangana Cabinet Minister Sabitha Indra Reddy, against whom the CBI had filed supplementary charge-sheet over alleged investments made by Penna Cements group in some companies floated by Mr. Reddy, appeared before the court on Friday. Along with Mr. Rao and Ms. Sabitha Indra Reddy, both of whom were colleagues in the Cabinet of Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy in the undivided AP, IAS officer Sri Lakshmi, retired IAS officer Samuel, former director of Mines V.D.

218,2020/01/17,"CAA is like Israeli citizenship, says Yogendra Yadav","A meeting on citizenship and social justice with Yogendra Yadav and Radhika Vemula turned into a debate over the contours of Indian democracy and a tribute to the University of Hyderabad scholar Rohith Vemula who ended his life on January 17, 2016. “Four years back Rohith wrote about how he was reduced to an identity, a number, a voter. Today, things have become even worse — they are trying to exclude people even from getting a vote and a number,” said Radhika Vemula, mother of Rohith Vemula.

“I had withdrawn from public life going back to making a living. But when I saw how children were beaten in JNU and other universities, the brutality rattled me. That’s the reason I have come to this meeting,” said Ms. Vemula. She said she is planning a yatra under the banner ‘Mothers for the Nation’ to save the basic principles of Ambedkar’s Constitution.

Earlier, setting the tone for the meeting, Asma Rasheed of English and Foreign Languages University said that the poor, marginalised and the disadvantaged will be the most affected as they may not be able to produce documents.

“The CAA is a signalling device like Israeli citizenship based on religion. It hits the very idea and soul of India. Instead of equal citizenship we are moving towards categories of citizenship. This violates the principle of our freedom struggle,” said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj Abhiyan.

He remarked how a new leadership has emerged during these protests which has pushed aside traditional leaders and political wheeler-dealers. “Women are in the forefront of this movement. There is warmth in Shaheenbagh protests which cannot be found elsewhere. Youth from different campuses are now at the head of the movement which is no longer against NRC-NPR-CAA,” said Mr. Yadav.

“The youth are interested in their present and their future. They are not interested in the past,” said Mr. Yadav who spoke about asymmetry in the information warfare as social media’s reach is just 2%.

The Bench instructed the Principal Secretary of Agriculture and the Chief Engineer of Minor Irrigation to examine the FTL area of Pulikunta and present a report to the HC by February 17. The Bench also ordered to serve notices to Nirmal District Collector and other top officials of Agriculture and Revenue departments.

221,2020/01/17,"Signature campaign against CAA, NPR and NRC","Scores of people signed a petition on Friday demanding the Telangana government bring a resolution in the Legislative Assembly against the implementation of Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 and National Population Register in the State.

The signature campaign, which was initiated by city-based activists and concerned citizens, took off in Jama Masjid Darul Shifa in Darul Shifa, Azizia Masjid in Humayun Nagar, Masjid-e-Ghous-us-Saqlain in Kalapather and Masjid-e-Mirmomin in Meerpet.

According to S. Q. Masood, one of the activists, permission from the management of mosques was sought before launching the signature campaign there. After permission was obtained, volunteers explained to those either entering or leaving the mosque about the campaign.

Discriminatory law

“The name, signature, neighbourhood and mobile phone number of the signatory is noted on a proforma. Not only are we demanding that a resolution be brought in the Assembly, but we are also asking the State government to challenge Constitutionality of the Act in courts of law as it discriminates based on religion,” Mr. Masood said, adding that in Assam 19 lakh people were not on the NRC, and around 5 lakh Hindus and people from other communities too did not find their names on the list. If implemented across the country, the number of Indian citizens who do not have documents would be out of the NRC and the number would swell.

“The CAA linked to the NPR would cause immense grief and relegate several as second class citizens,” he said.

Explaining the process of the signature campaign, Mr. Masood said that it would be taken up in a phased manner. Management of a larger number of mosques would be engaged with. Further, faith leaders too are likely to be roped in.

“After we have sufficient signatures, we will submit the signature lists with a representation to the CM, demanding his intervention,” he said.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/lyy9de/article30588243.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18DARULSHIFAMASJID,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/signature-campaign-against-caa-npr-and-nrc/article30588244.ece
222,2020/01/17,State’s own tax revenues show improvement,"The Telangana government, which is worried over the significant fall in its revenue growth rate, seems to be recovering with the boost given by the festival season starting with Dasara and Deepavali.

The State’s own tax revenue growth compared last fiscal that was just below 3% till November-end, has now climbed to 9.1% by the end of December 2019, mainly due to hike in liquor sales during the festival season and through the New Year.

The State now hopes to end the financial year 2019-20 by registering about 10% increase in its own tax revenue. It will still be an achievement when the nation’s economy is growing at only 5%. The Goods and Sales Tax growth is also expected to be around 10%.

Telangana was among the few States that clocked GST growth rate of over 14% and peaked to 21% after the new tax regime was introduced in 2017 till this financial year when its growth rate fell steeply. The State thus became eligible for GST compensation for the first time since inception of GST and so far ₹1,900 crore was released to the State in two instalments.

Revenue earners

Against the State’s own tax revenue target of ₹75,000 crore by end of March, the State has so far realised ₹51,500 crore. On account of recovery in the last two months the gap could be narrowed, according to sources.

The revenue generating departments like Transport registered 8% growth till December-end over that of corresponding period last year while Stamps and Registration revenue grew at 10%, excise at 23% and Commercial Taxes at over 6% resulting in an average growth of over 9%.

Loan repayments

Meanwhile, sources said that the negotiations of the State with the RBI officials to reschedule the repayment of loans raised through market borrowings will not bring down the interest burden as interest has to be paid every quarter for all the loans, including fresh loans. The benefit in rescheduling of loan repayment lies in the principal repayment amount being spread uniformly across the year instead of ballooning of loan repayments during some months and enable the State to plan its expenditure on its programmes and projects through out the year. “The State seeks to calibrate its repayment of its principal component so that it can spread its resources uniformly ensuring harmony between loan repayments without affecting its committed expenditure,” sources said.

The States are allowed by the RBI to avail 75% of loans they are entitled to under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management norms before nine months and the rest of 25% in the last quarter. Since many States will also be seeking loans in the last quarter, each State has to schedule when it will raise market loans through auction of bonds at a reasonable interest.

Finance Secretary went to Mumbai to attend meetings with RBI officials apparently to discuss the above issues.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/states-own-tax-revenues-show-improvement/article30588137.ece

The Congress-CPI-CPI (M)-TDP have entered into a strategic alliance in some of the wards in the Kothagudem municipality to put a joint fight at the hustings, sources said. The BJP is contesting the elections alone.

Lack of cohesion between the new entrants and some old-timers in the TRS in the Kothagudem town unit has become a cause of concern for the TRS contestants in quite a few wards, according to political observers.

In Yellandu, the disgruntled TRS ticket aspirants, including a few former municipal councillors, remained in the poll fray in the ULB comprising a total of 24 wards.

The party leadership is understood to have entrusted the task of winning both the Kothagudem and Yellandu ULBs to the MLAs of the coal belt region, who switched over to the TRS from the Congress last year.

Khammam MP Nama Nageswara Rao along with Kothagudem MLA Vanama Venkateswara Rao conducted a whirlwind electioneering drumming up support for the TRS candidates in Kothagudem on Friday.

According to TRS sources, Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar and former Khammam MP Ponguleti Srinivas Reddy are scheduled to address election rallies in Wyra and other election-bound municipalities on Saturday and Sunday.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-faces-tough-challenge-from-opposition-rebels/article30587979.ece
226,2020/01/17,TRS manipulated poll process: Uttam,"Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy on Friday said that the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi had manipulated the municipal poll process, and used police force to intimidate Congress contestants to withdraw candidatures — the reasons behind the party not fielding candidates in all seats.

Terming the process by the State Election Commission as “erratic and illogical”, he blamed lack of sufficient time interval between the dates of notification and nominations for Opposition parties being unable to field strong candidates in all the wards, while it was to the advantage of the TRS as it knew ward reservations in advance, he said.

“It is not for Congress’ weakness that we could not field candidates in at least 500 seats, but because of TRS manipulation,” he said, condemning TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao’s statements on the subject.

Addressing various poll meetings in Huzurnagar on Friday, the senior Congress leader and Nalgonda MP also alleged that TRS leaders with the police help, either lured or intimidated its contestants in various places to withdraw candidatures.

“TRS does not contest, but manages polls. It did not deliver fully even 10 promises of the 500 major promises it made since 2014. It remained a copycat of Congress policies and schemes,” he said.

The many irrigation projects, the Hyderabad airport, Outer Ring Road, the Metro Rail, all major infrastructure, which are now painted pink, including schemes such as the GHMC ₹ 5 meal scheme, have originally been launched by the Congress, he said.

Mr. Uttam Kumar Reddy reiterated that the government is yet to roll out the promised unemployment allowance scheme, among other promises and schemes, and said the municipal poll results would be a shocker to TRS.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/p33r11/article30587950.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18UTTAMKUMARREDDY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/trs-manipulated-poll-process-uttam/article30587951.ece

Thanking people for electing two corporators unanimously in Karimnagar town, he appealed to voters to elect TRS candidates only for developmental works to continue. “I will be responsible if the TRS corporators fail to discharge their duties efficiently sans corruption,” he pointed out.

Ridiculing the BJP leaders’ allegations that TRS had colluded with MIM, he asked how could the MIM secure the Mayor post by contesting from eight divisions. He pooh-poohed the Congress and BJP parties for fielding candidates only from 42 and 46 divisions respectively in the town against a total of 60 divisions.

Reacting to a query about who would be their Mayor candidate, he said that the party high command would decide that after the elections.

230,2020/01/17,BJP charges Owaisi with instigating people,"BJP Greater Hyderabad city president and MLC N. Ramachander Rao on Friday said that provoking and instigating people not to cooperate with government officials visiting households for gathering census data is equal to “radicalising” the general public.

Talking to presspersons at the party office, Mr. Rao strongly condemned the speech of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen president Asaduddin Owaisi asking people not to show Aadhar and other documents to the census officials. “In the name of opposing Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Citizen Register (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR), Mr. Owaisi is radicalising people as he asking them not to cooperate with the government,” he charged.

“First Mr. Owaisi should stop instigating people against the government to suit his own political interest and then comment on de-radicalisation,” he said and sought to point out that the census data to be collected would be ultimately useful for people to receive government benefits.

The BJP leader alleged Mr. Owaisi has been trying to “politicise army” also by making comments against Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat. The CDS was only commenting on the experience of the armed forces in the Kashmir Valley where it has lost lot of men in the battles there, he said.

Mr. Rao appealed to the Muslim community not to get “mislead by such radical leaders” and “cooperate with the census officials for registering their names in NPR for getting government benefits”.",telangana,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/i57mjq/article30587604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY18BJPRAMACHANDERRAO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/bjp-charges-owaisi-with-instigating-people/article30587605.ece
231,2020/01/17,Problems galore at IDA Bollaram,"Busy roads with heavy traffic greet one to this mini-India-like town — Bollaram — located in Sangareddy district on the outskirts of the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The roads are narrow and if two heavy vehicles have to pass each other on the main road, one has to wait to give way to the other.

On another side of the town, women walking alongside the Kudikunta cheruvu on their way to work in a bulk drug industry located on the outskirts have to bear the stink emanating from the tank which was filled with garbage and debris of old buildings. As there is no dumping yard in the town, the garbage is being thrown into tank.

There are several industries located in and around the town and in Patencheru. They provide employment to people from different parts of the country — Assam, West Bengal, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand.

Srinivas Reddy, a resident of the town, says the ground water here is, actually, not fit for even bathing as it causes itching and allergy but they were accustomed to using it for the past several years.

“We do not have any drinking water source; so we purchase water. But the town is providing us employment. Hence, despite heavy pollution, we are staying here,” said Pandari, a native of Odisha.

“I hail from this place. I was born and brought up in this house,” Mr. Sunder points out as he tries to justifiy his bid to contest as an independent candidate as councillor of ward number 30 in Adilabad Municipality which mainly encompasses Ambedkarnagar and Khanapur slums.

“The place is no different from the one I left behind 35 years back. It needs to be developed and I think I can do that,” the retired official asserted as he hosted five other contestants, his rivals from the ward at an informal get together at his old house on Friday.

‘Lack of discipline’

But the party had given ticket to a loser,” he charged. He also alleged the lack of discipline in the district unit of the party. “I had made several calls to the party high command in Hyderabad for redressal of grievance but in vain,” he asserted.

Expressing concern over indiscipline in the party, he said that the party would not grow in the district. To a query, he said that he had not taken any decision to join any political party as of now.

Addressing a press conference at the State office here, Mr. Sharma reiterated that CAA was only meant to provide citizenship to Hindu ‘minorities’ of three Islamic neighbouring countries for having religious persecution and have been living in India as “illegal migrants”. CAA was not meant to take away citizenship of Indians irrespective of religion, he said and affirmed that 130 crore people of the country were Indians.

Those opposing CAA were not “well-wishers” of the country and they wanted to create hurdles in the way of development of the country, he said and questioned how can the Congress and other Opposition parties oppose the law which was passed by the parliament. “Do they consider themselves above the Constitution and democracy?,” he questioned.

Mr. Sharma accused Majlis president Asaduddin Owaisi of trying to mislead the Muslim community while the Congress and other parties like BSP and SP were vying each other to become “leader of this vote bank”. Official spokesperson N V Subhash was present.

TRS obstructing BJP

In a separate press statement chief spokesperson K.Krishna Saagar Rao charged the TRS party of “stooping a new low” in the municipal polls by resorting to “threatening, kidnapping and physically attacking BJP candidates across the State to obstruct them from even filling candidate nominations”.

The BJP candidates were also being forced to withdraw their nominations too. “The TRS party has become worse than TMC party in West Bengal.

It is learnt that the college management might give attendance in some cases such as on days when college programmes are held and if student was part of organising it.

Four days ago, the medicos protested alleging that heads of different medial departments of the college submitted list of 260 students to Kaloji Narayana Rao University of Health Sciences (KNRUHS) for having attendance below 75%, without issuing any notices to students or parents.

The list includes 176 students of MBBS third year who are not eligible to take Community Medicine exam, and the rest of the 84 are a mix of MBBS second and third-year who are not eligible to take final exams of various subjects.

Charge denied

A few of them alleged that attendance records were not displayed on notice boards two-months before exams -- which is a rule.

However, the college’s administration denied the allegations.

Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) members submitted representation to higher officials in Health department.

Report submitted

A fact-finding committee has submitted a report on the issue to Director of Medical Education (DME) Dr. K. Ramesh Reddy, who has directed the college’s administration to re-assess attendance records of the students.

A college council meeting was held on Thursday and re-assessment of the records was taken up. The revised list might be finalized by Friday.

The DME said that their intention was not to make students have backlogs.

Open letter

Capt. Amarinder bluntly told his party colleague that it was “none of his business” to question the appointment of Atul Nanda as Punjab’s A-G after Mr. Bajwa wrote an open letter to the Chief Minister accusing him of nepotism.

“Nepotism is against the interests of the State and the appointment of Shri Atul Nanda as Advocate General, Punjab, is a perfect example of the same, as his appointment had been solely guided by his proximity to you,” Mr. Bajwa, who headed the Congress in Punjab earlier, said in his letter.

Mr. Bajwa posted his ‘open letter’ on his Twitter handle, listing out seven instances in which he alleged the A-G could not protect Punjab’s interest.

“The incompetence of the Advocate General to defend the interests of the State effectively is reflected in the repeated failures faced in the courts in various critical cases,” he said.

Hitting back, the Punjab Chief Minister said of the seven cases cited by Mr. Bajwa, the A-G had handled only one case.

‘Not competent’

“You are neither competent nor equipped to judge Atul Nanda’s competency, and have no business commenting or interfering on matters of which you have absolutely no knowledge,” said the Chief Minister in a statement.

Objecting to the ‘open letter’, Capt. Amarinder termed it a sign of the former Punjab Congress chief’s “desperation to grab political limelight”. “I have full faith in the A-G,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amarinder-bajwa-spar-over-a-g-appointment/article30589308.ece

Electronic voting machines were used for the first time for panchayat polls in the State.

243,2020/01/17,Noted Kathak dancer stopped from performing to qawwali,"Noted Kathak exponent Manjari Chaturvedi was in for a shock when her performance with qawwali was stopped midway by officials of the Uttar Pradesh government during an official cultural programme at a Lucknow hotel on January 15.

“I was scheduled to give a 45-minute performance called Ishq Ke Rang (Colours of love) to recorded music at a three-day event where legislators were present. As it was recorded music, there was no way I could have crossed the time limit. When I was into my third segment, a qawwali, the music stopped. I thought there was a technical glitch. But three officials came in front of the stage and one of them said, ‘Yahan qawwali nahin chalegi’ (Qawwali will not be played here),” Ms. Chaturvedi told The Hindu.

The anchor, she said, announced the next performance.

“I took to the podium and said this was not what Lucknow was known for. It is a city where I grew up and imbibed the Ganga Jamuni tehzeeb,” narrated the artiste, known for popularising Sufi-Kathak, a blend of classical and Sufi tradition.

‘Plea unheard’

Ms. Chaturvedi said when she left the stage nobody came to assuage her. “My technicians later told me that they pleaded with the organisers that only two segments were left, but they didn’t listen to them.”

Before the qawwali, she said, she performed a Kathak piece on the love of Radha and Krishna, followed by a performance to a piece by Gauhar Jan, the first recorded artiste of India.

“The qawwali that I performed to was ‘Aisa Banna Sanwarna Mubarak Tumhe’, which was made popular by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. It is in shringar rasa and talks about the beauty of a woman. It has no religious overtones. The performance was intended to portray flavours of love through different mediums. Anyway, India is the birthplace of qawwali. If Sufi devotional music is not played here, who will patronise it? I have performed in 35 countries, have never come across such an experience,” she said.

On Friday, Ms. Chaturvedi said, she got a call from senior officials of the U.P. government who said that the behaviour of their colleagues was “not intended”. “They invited me to perform to a qawwali on U.P. Diwas on January 27 in front of the Chief Minister,” she said.

‘Damage control’

Describing it as “damage control” after the news spread in the media, Ms. Chaturvedi said she was ready to give the State government a chance to redeem its “insensitive behaviour”.

“As citizens and artistes, we should not fall for divisive forces and retain sanity in times when it seems hating the ‘other’ is easier than embracing him.”

245,2020/01/17,"Assam farmers power anti-CAA fight, sell paddy to fund AASU","Farmers in the Sasoni-Merbil area of Dibrugarh district usually grow paddy for their own consumption. A few who cultivate “that much more” sell the extra paddy at two markets nearby or in Naharkatiya town about 12 km away.

But the farming families of 85 villages in the area have broken a tradition to sell a part of their produce virtually at their doorsteps – at the centrally-located Sasoni-Merbil Rajohuwa Khelpathar, or local public playfield, on Saturday.

The reason: they want the proceeds from the sale to go into a fund for the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) to challenge the jaatidhwangshi, meaning ‘race-destroying’, Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) in the Supreme Court next week.

“Farmers here are dhaan dhoni (rice-rich) and they decided to donate a part of this wealth for the movement that we think is crucial for the existence of the indigenous Assamese people,” Sasoni resident Rakesh Bora told The Hindu on Friday.

The villagers decided to collect one doon, equivalent to 4 kg, of Sali or winter rice per family.

“We have so far collected more than 600 sacks of paddy with each sack containing an average of 49 kg. These have been deposited in an elongated shed the villagers built at the playfield where AASU leaders, intellectuals and local people will converge for an anti-CAA rally tomorrow (Saturday),” Mr Bora said.

Moni Manik Gogoi, a former extremist turned social entrepreneur, said some local traders have volunteered to buy the paddy during the rally. “The movement here has not been under the banner of any political party or organisation. They read about others donating money for the battle against CAA and decided to contribute what they have,” he said.

Each family in Sasoni-Merbil owns at least 6 bighas (14,400 sq ft to a bigha) of farmland. Some have up to 30 bighas.

The current market rate of local varieties of paddy, mostly the sticky kind, is ₹1,200 per quintal, or 100 kg. Mr. Bora said the standard price on the “historic day” would be decided during the rally.

“The gesture from the people of Sasoni-Merbil has encouraged us to maintain the tempo of our agitation. They give us hope and strength in our fight against the unconstitutional CAA,” AASU general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/18r4qa/article30588963.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200117-WA0017,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-farmers-power-anti-caa-fight-sell-paddy-to-fund-aasu/article30588964.ece
246,2020/01/17,"Bru settlement deal may set bad precedent, caution activists","The agreement to settle some 35,000 Bru tribal people in Tripura and not in Mizoram from where they were displaced, could encourage the creation of ethnocentric States in the northeast, rights activists have said.

The move, they feel, has set a bad precedent but is the “State-level variant” of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s “national policy of keeping minorities under pressure”.

Others agree the “solution” has the potential of creating conflicts between the Brus and indigenous communities of Tripura, but addresses the insecurities of a tribe that survived and fled violence.

More than 40,000 Brus have been living in six refugee camps in northern Tripura’s Kanchanpur sub-division since 1997 when they escaped ethnic violence in adjoining Mizoram. Only about 7,000 refugees returned to Mizoram after nine phases of repatriation till November 30, 2019.

Most of the Brus declined the Centre’s rehabilitation packages citing insecurity and poor living conditions in Mizoram and had demanded the creation of an autonomous council for the community as a precondition for vacating the relief camps.

Financial assistance

The agreement on Thursday among the Centre, the governments of Mizoram and Tripura and leaders of Bru organisations allowed those who have stayed back to be resettled in Tripura. The rehabilitation package offered included financial assistance of ₹4 lakh and land for construction of a house for each family.

“This is not only a bad step but is encouraging the north-eastern States to be more ethnocentric and push out minorities. With this settlement, I am sure all other Brus in Mizoram will either come to Tripura on their own because of the incentives or be driven out because it has given the dominant community the idea that they now have the license to throw others out,” Suhas Chakma of the Delhi-based Rights and Risks Analysis Group said.

The northeast has had a history of ethnic conflicts — not only between the “indigenous” and “settlers” but inter-tribe too — and issues could also arise within smaller sub-groups within the same tribe, he said. For instance, the Rongmei Nagas, most of whom are based in Assam, are deprived of Scheduled Tribe status in Nagaland. Meghalaya meanwhile, has proposed an amendment to the Sixth Schedule for stripping tribes other than the dominant Garo, Khasi and Jaintia from benefits.

“By trying to be large-hearted, you are actually creating conflicts. Questions will arise whether Tripura would accommodate the Chakmas, also being targeted in Mizoram. The Bru decision is basically legitimising at a State-level what the BJP wants at the national level with Muslims,” Mr. Chakma said.

President of the Central Young Mizo Association Vanlalruata said it was improper to label the Mizos as xenophobic.

“Our people and the government gave the Brus several opportunities to return. We have welcomed those who came back. The Brus cannot live in transit camps forever. We have no issues with those identified by the government as Mizoram inhabitants even if they return now in spite of the Tripura rehabilitation offer,” he told The Hindu from Mizoram capital Aizawl.

Guwahati-based Walter Fernandes of the North-Eastern Social Research Centre said the decision has provided the Brus with a solution.

“This is humanitarian from their point of view as they were apprehensive about going back to Mizoram. From another viewpoint, this could lead to a set of people being pushed out of a place and told to resettle elsewhere,” he said.

Impact on citizenship

He added that the decision could also throw up questions of citizenship, specifically in Assam where a process is on to define who is indigenous and who is not. Assam-based activists said the move on the Brus legitimises the settlement of foreigners under Citizenship (Amendment) Act too, creating conflicts with the indigenous people as well as communities that settled earlier.

There are already signs of such conflicts in Kanchanpur area of Tripura where the Brus are expected to be settled. Mr. Fernandes, whose research team worked among the displaced Brus a year ago, said indigenous tribes of Tripura were not keen on sharing resources with the refugees. The non-tribal Bengali people of Tripura felt uneasy too.

Communal clashes had broken out between the Bru refugees and the Bengali people on December 10. The local Reangs — cousins of the Brus — also joined in resulting in at least 90 Bengali families having to take refuge in a relief camp set up by the local administration.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/o1h3c4/article30577151.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16IN-BRU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/bru-settlement-deal-may-set-bad-precedent-caution-activists/article30588708.ece

The elections are expected to be notified on January 25.

Panchayat elections were held in the former State of J&K in 2018 and a total of 27,281 panches and sarpanches were elected.

As many as 36 Union Ministers will visit the Jammu region and the Kashmir Valley in January 18-23 as part of an outreach initiative, a first since August 6, when the special status of J&K under Article 370 of the Constitution was revoked and the State was bifurcated into Union Territories.

Minister of State for Home G. Kishan Reddy, who will visit the Valley this week, said the objective was to make people aware of the various initiatives taken after Article 370 was revoked.

“I plan to go to schools, colleges and hospitals in the Valley to get a first-hand feedback from the people. We will tell them about the development projects taken by the administration in all these months,” he said.

Earlier this month, the Centre arranged the visit of 15 foreign diplomats to Srinagar and Jammu.

“These seats could not be filled in 2018; the by-elections could be fought on party lines also. Security is an issue that will be discussed,” said a senior government official. Several sarpanches elected from south Kashmir are still living in hotels and government accommodation in Srinagar in the wake of threat to their lives.

On October 24 last, elections for 310 blocks were held, out of which 27 candidates were elected unopposed. The elections of BDC chairpersons, held on party lines, were indirect and they were elected by panches and sarpanches of a panchayat falling within a particular block.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/hbfsa8/article30588169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/PANCHAYAT-JampK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jk-panchayat-by-elections-likely-in-february-march/article30588170.ece

Mr. Kumar accorded a warm welcome to the exiled Buddhist monk, and presented him with a bouquet and ‘angavastram’, following which they posed for pictures, the sources said.

The Dalai Lama thereafter offered prayers before a ’Bodhi tree’ at the Chief Minister’s 1, Anney Marg bungalow along with other Buddhist priests, praying for all-round peace and prosperity.

The ‘Bodhi tree’ at the CM’s official residence is a sapling of the Mahabodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, under which Lord Buddha had attained enlightenment more than 2,000 years ago.

252,2020/01/17,Last NDFB faction in Assam calls truce,"The last faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) has called a truce. But two of its most-wanted top guns remain at large and within “sniffing distance.”

On Thursday, the Central and Assam governments and the NDFB’s Saoraigwra faction, or NDFB-S, signed a tripartite agreement in New Delhi for the cessation of operations. The NDFB-S is the third and last faction of the outfit that was formed more than three decades ago for establishing a sovereign homeland for the Bodos – the largest plains tribe in the northeast.

The truce was signed within a week of 50 members of NDFB-S crossing over to India from their hideouts in Myanmar.

Security forces officials entrusted with law and order in areas along the India-Bhutan border, where the NDFB-S had carried out some of the deadliest activities, say peace could be elusive unless the outfit’s army chief G. Bidai alias Bishnu Goyari and his deputy Batha alias Binod Mushahary come on board too.

The security forces had come close to capturing Bidai and his loyalists during an encounter inside the Manas National Park bordering Bhutan on May 8, 2017.

“We are hopeful of Bidai and Batha joining the peace process. We have reports that the two have been changing locations along the India-Bhutan border,” Hiren Nath, Inspector-General of the State police’s Special Branch, told The Hindu.

Bhutan used to be the base of the unified NDFB until December 2003 when a joint India-Bhutan military operation flushed their cadre out, along with those of the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO).

“The peace deal with NDFB-S leaves the ULFA-Independent as the only recognised extremist group in Assam. There are very few members of KLO still at large with their leader Jiban Singh, while the PDCK is more of a group of miscreants,” Mr. Nath said.

The ULFA-Independent is headed by Paresh Baruah, who is believed to be operating from the Ruili area on the Myanmar-China border.

The People’s Democratic Council of Karbi Longri (PDCK) has some presence in central Assam’s Karbi Anglong district. The outfit is led by Ingti Kathar Songbijit, a Karbi tribal who used to head the NDFB-S once.

Songbijit’s luck with the primarily Bodo tribal organisation ran out in 2016 when he quit and formed the PDCK miles away from the NDFB-S domain. The outfit he left behind continued to be called the NDFB-S as B. Saoraigwra, a former leader of the All Bodo Students’ Union, took over as chairman.

Saoraigwra, whose real surname is Basumatary, hails from Dangsamari village in western Assam’s Chirang district. The village is close to the border with Bhutan.

The NDFB-S metamorphosed from the NDFB (Anti-Talks Faction) in 2009 when the outfit split into two. The pro-talks faction called itself the NDFB-Progressive, which is now headed by B. Sungthagra.

The anti-talks group continued to be headed by NDFB founder D.R. Nabla or Ranjan Daimary and came to be called the NDFB-R after him. Songbijit became powerful following Daimary’s arrest in 2012 and the faction carried out attacks against migrant Muslims and Adivasis.

The NDFB-S carried out the massacre of more than 80 Adivasis in north-central Assam’s Sonitpur district in December 2014. Songbijit, intelligence officials then said, had entrusted Bidai and Batha with the carnage.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/uilhen/article30585386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NDFB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/last-ndfb-faction-in-assam-calls-truce/article30585388.ece
253,2020/01/17,"Repeal CAA, Punjab urges Centre in House resolution","The Punjab Legislative Assembly on Friday passed a resolution, urging the Union government to repeal the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and terming the ideology behind the amended Act as “'inherently discriminatory”'.

Chief Minister Capt. Amarinder Singh later told journalists that the State government, like Kerala, would approach the Supreme Court on the CAA issue.

In the Assembly, the resolution was moved by Parliamentary Affairs Minister Brahm Mohindra during the second day of the special session of the House. It was supported by the Congress, the Aam Aadmi Party and Lok Insaf Party (LIP) MLAs Balwinder Singh Bains and Simarjit Singh Bains .

The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and BJP members opposed the resolution. The SAD, however, maintained that Muslims should be included in the CAA for granting citizenship.

During the discussion in the House, the Chief Minister termed the controversial legislation as ‘inherently discriminatory’ and a negation of the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based. He compared the CAA with ethnic and religious cleansing of Hitler’s Germany. “Clearly, no lessons had been learnt from history,” he said.

Capt. Amarinder said, “What happened in Germany under Hitler in 1930 is happening in India now. Germans did not speak then and they regretted it, but we have to speak now so that we don’t regret later,” he asserted. He urged the Opposition, particularly the Akalis, to read Adolf Hitler’s Mein Kampf to understand the ‘dangers’ of the CAA.

The resolution urged the Centre to put on hold the National Population Register (NPR) work till forms-documents associated with it are amended suitably, in order to allay apprehensions that it is a prelude to a nation-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC) and designed to deprive a section of persons from citizenship of India and implement the CAA.

The resolution pointed to the omission of Muslims and such other communities as Jews from the ambit of citizenship under the CAA and asked for its repeal “to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality before law for all religious groups in India.”

Finance Minister and senior Congress leader Manpreet Badal said granting Citizenship under the CAA should not be based on religion, which was against the basic feature of the Constitution. “Why the CAA does not have provision to give citizenship to those from Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Burma [Myanmar]? ,"" he quipped.

SAD MLA Bikram Singh Majithia said the party was against any move to implement NRC.

Outside the House, Capt. Amarinder said the Centre would have to make the necessary amendments to the CAA if it had to be implemented in Punjab and the other States opposing it. “Like Kerala, my government would also approach the Supreme Court on the issue,” he said.

In response to a question, he made it clear that the census in Punjab would be conducted on the old parameters and the new factors added by the Centre for the purpose of the NPR would not be included.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/60h8m3/article30524567.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AmarinderSinghaddressingmediapersons,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-assembly-moves-resolution-against-caa/article30584806.ece

256,2020/01/17,SC lifts EC suspension on Goa Mopa airport,"The Supreme Court on Thursday lifted its suspension of an environmental clearance given for a greenfield airport at Mopa in Goa after the concessionaire, GMR Goa International Airport Limited (GGIAL), undertook to adopt a “zero carbon programme” for both constructing and operating the airport.

The purpose of a zero carbon airport operation is to eliminate anthropogenic carbon emissions reaching the atmosphere completely or to the minimum extent possible.

The court directed the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) to oversee the compliance of the undertaking, saying the project required the oversight of a specialised body like NEERI.

The environmental clearance (EC) was granted on October 28, 2015. On April 23 last year, the Supreme Court had found the clearance flawed and suspended it on an appeal filed by a resident of Mopa, Hanuman Laxman Aroskar. The court had asked Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the union environment ministry to re-visit its EC.

Thursday’s judgment records the submissions made by senior advocate Anitha Shenoy, for Mr. Aroskar, that the EAC hardly has the domain expertise for the specialised job. Mr. Aroskar alleged the EAC chairman was a former director of the Council for Social Development and its members were retired officers from Central and State Pollution Control Boards. He alleged that the EAC minutes read like facsimile of the concessionaire’s presentation.

There are 35 proposed reserved forests around the project area and no primary data was collected as required through the Airport Guidance Manual, the judgment recorded the petitioner’s contentions.

He alleged that there was no study on the impact of the airport on the Western Ghats, which is home to the 1172 species of flora and fauna along with tiger and elephant corridors. There are 10 villages in the area and their vulnerability is not known. Mr. Aroskar said the impact of tree-felling on the 42 forests surrounding the site is unknown. He said “compensatory forestation cannot replace a natural forest”.

The union ministry had countered that the impact of the project on the eco-system was already assessed and mitigation measures proposed. “The EAC took due cognizance of the presence of forest land and also observed that though a significant number of trees were required to be felled, this was a requirement in the wake of an identified project site,” the judgment recorded the arguments of Additional Solicitor General A.N.S. Nadkarni.

The judgment recorded that 54,716 trees were felled. But Mr. Nadkarni assured that three lakh trees would be planted at the site and in nearby villages within 15 km. This would be supervised by the Biodiversity Board. Besides this, another 2.5 lakh trees would be planted and monitored by the Director General of Civil Aviation.

The judgment notes that the proposed greenfield airport would have a capacity to handle 4.4 million passengers in the first phase, followe by 13 million passengers in the second phase and 30 million assengers in the phase three annually. The project area of the proposed Mopa airport is spread over 2,131 acres. The construction of an airport at Mopa Goa has been on the drawing board for nearly two decades. As on January 2019, approximately 14.06 per cent of the project work was completed. At one point of time, approximately 1,500 workforce were gainfully engaged at the project site along with requisite plant and machinery.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/sc-lifts-ec-suspension-on-goa-mopa-airport/article30580464.ece
257,2020/01/17,Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy hits out at fact-checking website for busting fake video,"Tathagata Roy, the Governor of Meghalaya, described fake news busting and fact checking website AltNews as “biased and motivated”, after the multi-platform digital site challenged veracity of his recent tweet regarding alleged attacks on Hindus in Pakistan.

On Wednesday, Mr. Roy posted a video on Twitter, where two women are seen being assaulted by two men. Mr Roy claimed that one of the women in the video, a Hindu, is “being picked up by Muslims in Pakistan in front of her mother and child.”

“However, stupid Hindus are opposing NRC (National Registration of Citizens). There are 55 Islamic States for 150 crore Muslims. 69 countries for 250 crore Christians and no country for 150 crore Hindus,” Mr. Roy tweeted in Bengali.

Alt News ‘debunked’ the video claiming it is an old one and got nothing to do with the Hindus in Pakistan.

“Alt News had earlier debunked the same video in December 2019 when it was shared with the claim that poor women were lifted in public eye and raped by men in Rajasthan. The video is at least two years old and is from Rajasthan’s Jodhpur district,” Alt News claimed. “One of the men in the video is the husband of the girl they try to abduct. The elderly woman is the mother of the girl.”

Quoting a newspaper report, Alt News also noted that it is a family dispute in Dhani village of Rajasthan and has nothing to do with the attack on the Hindus in Pakistan, as claimed by the Governor.

Mr. Roy however was irked by the Alt News’ argument and said that he “does not accept” the website’s claim.

“Some so-called fact-checking websites are traipsing all over social media. The ‘checking’ and the resultant dishing out of information that they do is false, biased and motivated. One might as well fact-check with ISI Rawalpindi,” he tweeted.

258,2020/01/17,ACB arrests former J&K Minister’s son in bank fraud case,"The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on Thursday arrested National Conference (NC) leader and ex-Finance Minister Rahim Rather’s son Hilal Rather who was taken into custody in a bank fraud case.

An ACB spokesman said the bank fraud case was connected to the Paradise Avenue Township Project, in which “loan amounting to crores of rupees was siphoned off.” The spokesman said there was alleged misappropriation of crores of rupees from term loans running into ₹177 crores sanctioned by the Jammu and Kashmir Bank “for his ambitious township project known as Paradise Avenue at Narwal Bala Jammu in 2012.”

“The funds diverted have been used to purchase properties abroad and holidaying abroad with family and friends. All the loan amounts availed by Mr. Rather... have become NPA. Further investigation is in progress,” said the spokesman.

Paradise Avenue is a partnership concern of Rather, Dr. Rizwan Raheem Dar, Ghulam Muhammad Bhatt of Baramulla in Kashmir and Daljeet Wadhera and Deepshikha Jamwal of Jammu.

The sanctioned loan was for ₹74.27 crores in the first phase and in a relaxation of the credit policy of the bank, which restricts loan to a partnership firm at ₹40 crore, the loan was approved by the Board of Directors of the J&K Bank even as Rather had already entered into a one-time settlement with the State Financial Corporation in the past. The remaining loan amount was granted by the board, despite the fact that the repayments of the first loan taken was not complete, the spokesman said.

Rather owns Simula Group of Companies and was being questioned for the last few months by the ACB. The spokesman said he was was not forthcoming with details of property raised and other transaction “related to siphoning of funds meant for construction.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/acb-arrests-former-jk-ministers-son-in-bank-fraud-case/article30579615.ece
259,2020/01/17,"Braving chilly winds, anti-CAA protesters assemble daily in Jaipur","Taking a cue from Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters have been assembling for two hours everyday outside the iconic Albert Hall Museum here since January 2. The protesters have drawn attention of Indian and foreign tourists visiting the 130-year-old museum built in the Indo-Saracenic architecture style.

Braving chilly winds, women and children have joined the protest in large numbers every evening, raising slogans and waving banners and placards with messages against CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens. The participants select a theme of poems, songs, slogans and speeches everyday to make the protest attractive.

“Our emphasis remains on the Constitution and its principles of justice, equality and secularism. We explain in simple terms that citizenship is everyone's right, regardless of caste, creed and religion,” Mujahid Naqvi, Rajasthan High Court's lawyer and a leader of All India Milli Council, said. Interestingly, the protest has been organised by a loosely held group of civil society organisations.

The protest concludes everyday with a reading of the Preamble to the Constitution. Yasmeen Farooqui, convener of women's wing of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said a peaceful protest was the only option available to the vulnerable sections targeted by the BJP government through its “anti-democratic and illegal” move to enact the CAA.

On Thursday, activists holding the copies of Constitution and portraits of B.R. Ambedkar chanted the slogans such as “Red salute to Shaheen Bagh”, “Inquilab Zindabad (long live the revolution)” and “Kala Qanoon Waapas Lo (take back the draconian law)”.

Dalit activist Pavan Dev said the protesters were inspired by the prolonged agitation at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and had distributed kites carrying messages against CAA and NRC to celebrate Makar Sankranti. The groups represented at the protest venue include Nagrik Manch, Rajasthan Samagra Seva Sangh, Bhim Army and the Association for Protection of Civil Rights.

Nagrik Manch general secretary Basant Hariyana said a long march would be held from Shaheed Smarak to Raj Bhavan here on January 24 to submit a memorandum to Governor Kalraj Mishra with the demand for immediate repeal of CAA.

260,2020/01/17,Women in Rampur demand release of their kin arrested after anti-CAA protests,"For the last three days, hundreds of Muslim women are sitting in Rampur’s Jama Masjid, demanding the release of their husbands, brothers and children, who were arrested after the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turned violent on December 21, 2019.

“Their demand is that the protest was called by the ulemas of Rampur and they should intervene now to get the 34 people out of the jail,” said Shaila Khan, advocate and president of the Rampur Chapter of the Indian Lawyers Association. She said the protesters went out of control because their leaders were forced to stay at home by the district administration.

FIR registered

A First Information Report was registered by the police against 116 named protesters and around 3,000 unnamed protesters after the protest, in which one person was killed with gunshot injuries. Many of the women say their kin were innocent and were lifted just to fill the list of unnamed protesters.

Rizwana and Nazma, mothers of cousins Shahnawaz and Sharooz, said their 17/18-year-old sons were picked up when they were having their meal. Ms. Rizwana said her husband had suffered a haemorrhage after this happened.

Shabnam, whose husband Pappu was also picked up by the police, said he was the only earning member in the family and she had not been able to feed her one-year-old child properly since his arrest.

Placards reject CAA

The women are holding placards that reject the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), and this has possibly irked the clergy as its senior members suggest that a mosque was not a place of protest. Ms. Khan said there was a sense of fear among the clergy, too, as they felt that the police could detain them as well.

Qualifying the protest as an appeal to get their men released, Muqarram Inayati, secretary of the Jama Masjid told The Hindu that the appeal for a protest on December 21 was taken back by the ulemas on the evening of December 20 under sustained pressure from the district administration. “However, the message could not reach everybody, and people gathered on December 21 to protest. The administration had to call the ulemas to request the protesters to return.”

He said Maulvi Mehboob Ali and other members of the clergy had met the District Magistrate on Wednesday, and he had promised a “positive outcome” in 3-4 days.

‘Court’s decision’

Arun Kumar Singh, Additional Superintendent of Police, Rampur, said 34 persons are under judicial custody. “The investigation is on. We can’t give a timeline. It is for the court to decide,” he said.

Ms. Khan, who fought the election to the post of Municipal Corporation Chairperson on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket, clarified that her support to the women protesters was only as a lawyer and social activist, and had no political motive.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/f0gd4o/article30421512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH29RAMPUR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/women-in-rampur-demand-release-of-their-kin-arrested-after-anti-caa-protests/article30579419.ece
261,2020/01/17,3 Bangladeshis convicted for living illegally in U.P.,"A special court in Lucknow on Thursday convicted three Bangladeshi natives for allegedly living illegally in a madrasa in Saharanpur without valid documents, police said.

The three were awarded five years imprisonment and also fined ₹19,000.

They were convicted for cheating, criminal conspiracy, forgery of valuable security and section 14 of the Foreigners Act.

According to the police version, the three were allegedly living in India illegally and had entered the country from Bangladesh without any visa or passport.

Identified as Mohammad Imran, Faridudeen and Mohammad Firdaus, the three, natives of Jessore in Bangladesh, were residing at Madrasa Talimul Quran in Deoband, Saharanpur, police said.

The three persons were arrested by the UP Anti-Terror Squad in 2017 for possessing fake Aadhaar cards and living illegally in India. They were apprehended at the Lucknow Railway Station while they were boarding the Howrah-Amritsar Express, police had said then.

262,2020/01/17,Punjab to bring White Paper on SAD-BJP power agreements,"The Punjab government will bring out a White Paper in the monsoon session of the State Assembly to expose the alleged fraud committed by the Shiromani Akali Dal with regard to the controversial Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with private players during its previous regime.

“The White Paper will reveal all the documents signed by the previous SAD-BJP government in the State, as well as the power plants set up by them, which had caused undue burden on the State,” said Chief Minister Amarinder Singh while talking to journalist here after the Governor’s address on the first day of the two-day special session of the Assembly.

“After messing with the State’s economy through various destructive measures, including the PPAs, the Akali Dal was trying to use the issue against my government to promote their vested political interests,” he said.

The Chief Minister asserted that his government was committed to protecting the interests of Punjab and its people, and will ensure that nothing detrimental is done to them.

Earlier, during Governor V.P. Singh Badnore’s address, members of the Aam Aadmi Party and the Akali Dal raised slogans against the Congress government, accusing it of not fulfilling its promises.

Legislators of the Akali Dal and AAP later staged a walkout from the House. Leader of the Opposition in the House and AAP MLA Harpal Singh Cheema said they walked out in protest against the denial of permission to move the private member bill in the Assembly, seeking termination of the PPAs.

Outside the Assembly, Mr. Cheema termed the Governor’s speech a “bundle of lies”, saying the government had again tried to put words in his mouth. “Captain [Amarinder Singh] government has failed to fulfil even a single promise listed in the party manifesto. Promises made to all sections of society, including the Dalits, elderly, traders and youth, debt-ridden farmers and farm labourers, have remained unfulfilled so far,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jvva2q/article30580363.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17AKALI1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-to-bring-white-paper-on-sad-bjp-power-agreements/article30580365.ece
263,2020/01/17,Unhappy Congress asks BJP to introspect Sena MP’s remarks,"Even as Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut withdrew his statement about former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi meeting gangster Karim Lala, the Maharashtra Congress said such remarks will not be tolerated in future.

“It, indeed, was a wrong statement and we will not tolerate such a statement. Nobody should make such a statement. Mr. Raut should also not make such a statement which criticises great personalities. But since he has withdrawn the statement, the matter is over for us,” said Maharashtra Congress president and State revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.

“We are disappointed with the statement. We have spoken to the Chief Minister on the issue,” he added.

During an interview to the Lokmat media group at its award function in Pune on Wednesday, Mr. Raut said that “Indira Gandhi used to meet Karim Lala in Pydhonie (in south Mumbai).”

On Thursday, he withdrew his comment saying, “If someone feels my statement hurt Indira Gandhi’s image, or someone’s feelings, I take it back.”

“Kareem Lala was a leader of the Pathan community, he led an organisation called Pakhtun-e-Hind. It was in this capacity of the leader of Pathan community that he met several top leaders including Indira Gandhi. However, those who do not know the history of Mumbai, are twisting my statement,” said Mr. Raut. He added that he never shied away from praising Indira Gandhi as an iron lady who took decisions with an iron fist. “Surprisingly those who do not know the history of Indiraji are shouting at the top of their voice,” he said.

Earlier on Thursday, BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis also joined those who sought an explanation from the Congress and wondered whether the Congress was funded by Mumbai’s underworld.“Sanjay Raut has made a major expose about late PM Indira Gandhi. Why was she visiting Mumbai and whether the Congress was funded by the underworld of Mumbai? Was it the beginning of criminalisation of politics?” he queried.

Mr. Thorat slammed Mr. Fadnavis and said the latter met a notorious goon at his official residence Varshaand everyone has seen this. “Fadnavis who protected a goon like Munna Yadav by appointing him on corporation should not talk about criminalisation in politics,” said Mr. Thorat.

“Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis also should give up his habit of making a mountain of a mole. He should not try to insult Bharat Ratna late Indiraji Gandhi to make up for loss of face the BJP suffered for insulting Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/unhappy-congress-asks-bjp-to-introspect-sena-mps-remarks/article30580301.ece
264,2020/01/17,"Many thought I will retire from politics, it’s not happening anytime soon: Sharad Pawar","Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, considered the force behind the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government, said on Thursday that while many people thought he would retire from active politics, the people of the State, especially the youth, did not let it happen.

“At the time of the Assembly polls, many thought I would retire [from politics]. But that did not happen… The people of Maharashtra, especially the youth, did not let it happen and I don’t think I shall be retiring anytime soon,” said the NCP supremo, speaking after the inauguration of a four-day agriculture expo ‘Krishik’ in his bastion Baramati.

The event witnessed the participation of Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who was in Baramati for the first time to inaugurate ‘Krishik’ along with Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar. Also present were Bollywood actor Aamir Khan and MP Supriya Sule.

During his address, Mr. Pawar noted the increase in production owing to changing agricultural practices across the world coupled with new innovations.

“Given the centrality of agriculture in a highly populous country like India, there is a need to usher in changes in agricultural practices and stimulate research,” said Mr. Pawar, a former Union Agriculture Minister.

In this context, he rued the restrictions imposed on the research of genetically modified (GM) crops.

“The chief reason behind it is the Supreme Court’s restrictions on conducting research in this field. While I cannot speak on whether it is the judges’ job to clamp such restrictions, it is better they don’t look into such issues,” Mr. Pawar said, adding that while he had no objections if something harmful was halted, it was not right to stop something that could maximize productivity.

He recalled how some years back, research on a variant of genetically modified sugarcane that could be cultivated using minimum water could not be carried out owing to restrictions on GM crops.

“There is a lot of talk about sugarcane cultivation and excess water use. But because of drip irrigation, sugarcane cultivation is possible even with minimum use of water as is being practiced in Baramati,” said Mr. Pawar.

He further observed that as ordinary farmers could not afford the investments in drip irrigation, the government ought to provide them with funds and subsidies to encourage them to adopt this technique.

Prior to the inauguration, Mr. Thackeray sought to downplay the controversy sparked off by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut’s comments calling Mr. Ajit Pawar a “stepney” during the latter’s brief, notorious dalliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Amid much bonhomie, Mr. Thackeray was seen seated alongside his Deputy Chief Minister as the latter drove him for a while in a golf cart across the sprawling, 110- acre Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Baramati.

Before getting into the golf cart, Mr. Thackeray metaphorically remarked that “the steering wheel (of the MVA government) was in the hands of Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar”.

At an event in Pune on Wednesday, Mr. Raut had referred to Mr. Pawar as a ‘stepney’ (spare tyre) during the latter’s defection to the BJP which resulted in a brief, 80-hour government with Devendra Fadnavis as Chief Minister and the NCP leader as Deputy Chief Minister.

Mr. Raut had said: “The BJP didn’t know it was dealing with a stepney (or spare) tyre, and that other ‘tyres’ [other NCP MLAs who refused to join Mr. Pawar] were intact. However, the Sena MP, praising Ajit Pawar, added to his remarks by stating: “now, Ajit Pawar is one the four main wheels of the Maha Vikas Aghadi alliance’s ‘car’”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/wl2omm/article30580265.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16bmCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/many-thought-i-will-retire-from-politics-its-not-happening-anytime-soon-sharad-pawar/article30580266.ece
265,2020/01/17,Satara observes bandh over Sanjay Raut’s ‘proof’ remark against Bhosale,"A day after Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Raut demanded ‘proof’ of BJP leader Udayanraje Bhosale’s claim of being a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, incensed supporters of Mr. Bhosale observed a shut down in Satara.

Mr. Bhosale’s supporters demanded an immediate apology from Mr. Raut for daring to demand such ‘proof’.

Photos of Mr. Raut, along with that of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and State Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad, were tied to the necks of donkeys and a procession taken out across Satara city where Mr. Bhosale has great influence.

“Who does he [Mr. Raut] think he is? What does he hope to prove by his over smart remarks? His arrogance knows no bounds. Chief Minister and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray ought to restrain him. We will not let him enter this city unless he publicly retracts his remarks against Udayanraje,” said a BJP leader and supporter of Mr. Bhosale.

There was heavy police deployment in the city through the day to avert any untoward incident.

BJP activists held protests against Mr. Raut in Mumbai, Ahmednagar and other parts of the State while BJP MLA from Ghatkopar, Ram Kadam, demanded that the police lodge a case against Mr. Raut and arrest the Sena MP.

“His [Mr. Raut’s] remarks are truly unfortunate given that the Sena has played politics in this State using Shivaji’s name for the past 50 years… First Sanjay Raut jettisoned his ‘Hindutva’ ideals because of his greed of power [by allying with the ideologically opposed Congress-NCP], then he remained silent on the Savarkar row and now he has forsaken his love for Shivaji and hurt the sentiments of legions of Shivbhakts by casting aspersions on whether Mr. Bhosale is indeed a descendant of the Chhatrapati or not,” said Mr. Kadam, and demanded that Mr. Raut take back his statement and apologise publicly.

Pro-Maratha outfits, too, came out in Mr. Bhosale’s support by lashing out at Mr. Raut.

Aabasaheb Patil, chief coordinator of Maratha Kranti Thok Morcha, demanded an apology from Mr. Raut within the the next 24 hours.

“Instead of criticizing Goyal, he [Mr. Raut] is needlessly and in a most disrespectful manner attacking the house of the Chhatrapati…we will not forgive anybody who insults a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji in this manner,” Mr. Patil warned.

He further urged Chief Minister Thackeray to rein in his party leaders, else pro-Maratha outfit would be compelled to take to the streets in protest.

Mr. Raut’s remarks against Mr. Bhosale, said to be the 13th direct descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, were made at an event organised by a vernacular newspaper in Pune on Wednesday. With this statement, Mr. Raut, who is editor of Sena mouthpiece Saamana, has kept alive the row over the book Aaj ke Shivaji: Narendra Modi penned by BJP leader Jai Bhagwan Goyal.

Soon after the release of this controversial booklet likening Mr. Modi to a ‘latter-day King Shivaji’, Mr. Raut had questioned the ‘silence’ of Chhatrapati’s descendants.

Mr. Bhosale, while criticising Mr. Goyal’s book, tore into the Sena, questioning why the Sena founder, Bal Thackeray’s photo was placed above that of the Maratha king at Sena Bhavan, the party’s headquarters, in Dadar.

Mr. Bhosale had also said that when the Shiv Sena leaders had named their party, they had never bothered to ask Shivaji’s descendants. Mr. Bhosale also said that the Sena ought to drop ‘Shiv’ from their party name and rename it as ‘Thackeray Sena’.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ia96zv/article30580214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMRAUTPROTEST1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/satara-observes-bandh-over-sanjay-rauts-proof-remark-against-bhosale/article30580219.ece
266,2020/01/17,Protest by Muslim women continues,"It’s noon and chants of azadi — freedom — rent the Park Circus ground in the heart of Kolkata, with protesters seeking freedom from the set of acronyms easily recognised across the country today: CAA, NRC and NPR.

The protesters are all Muslim women — most of them homemakers living in and around the Park Circus area — who have been camping here for 10 days now, taking turns to keep the sit-in round the clock. From time to time they also shout slogans like “Hindustan zindabad” and “Hindu-Muslim bhai-bhai.”

“As you can see, many of the women are wearing purdah — they are the kind who hardly step out of their homes. It is heartening to see them come out openly in protest against the CAA,” said Shampa Sirin, one of the activists egging on the protesters with slogans.

“I have seen countless protest marches and meetings but have never seen a more determined lot. In the past 10 days many of them have even learned how to raise slogans,” Ms. Sirin said.

Banners and posters bearing pictures and quotes of Rabindranath Tagore, Maulana Azad, Mahatma Gandhi, B.R. Ambedkar and Subhas Chandra Bose hang at the site. Volunteers go around distributing biscuits and water, and their recipients include policemen keeping an eye on the protesters.

NRC fear

Even though the sit-in is primarily against the CAA, or Citizenship (Amendment) Act, what the protesters actually fear is an Assam-like National Register of Citizens (NRC) being replicated in the rest of the country. “Who stays, who goes — who knows,” says Afroja Khatun, who teaches Bengali at the Surendra College for Women and who has to the venue to “show solidarity” with the protesters.

Golam Haider, an elderly man watching the women raise slogans, says: “Today it is CAA, tomorrow they will bring in NRC and NPR and start asking us for documents to prove our identity. We cannot trust the BJP. Narendra Modi says one thing, Amit Shah says something else.”

Park Circus-resident Noor Jehan, who is 58 and a homemaker, says: “Kolkata has seen so many upheavals, people have been forced to change homes, how do you expect them to retain all documents?

267,2020/01/17,Ajit Pawar to head panel on loan waiver scheme details,"Days after announcing the Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Farmer Loan Waiver Scheme, the Maharashtra government has formed a seven-member committee to finalise the benefits to farmers with a crop loan of more than ₹2 lakh as well as to those who pay loan installments regularly.

Deputy Chief Minister and Finance minister Ajit Pawar will head the committee while Principal Secretary (Cooperation) will be the member secretary. The members are Eknath Shinde (Urban Development Department Minister), Balasaheb Thorat (Revenue Minister), Ashok Chavan (Public Works Department Minister), Dadaji Bhuse (Agriculture Minister) and Balasaheb Patil (Cooperation Minister).

Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, while announcing the crop loan waiver scheme in the Maharashtra Assembly in Nagpur, had declared that a special incentive scheme for those with crop loans above ₹2 lakh and those who regularly pay installments will be in place. The CM made the statement after the State government published the rules and regulations of the crop loan waiver scheme.

Several farmer organisations and leaders had expressed displeasure over the scheme and demanded amendments. The government, however, stuck to its original plan and said the new measures will soon be announced.

“The committee will study all the details about past loan waivers and suggest incentives. The cabinet sub-committee will submit its report within a month,” said an official from the cooperation department.

A week ago, Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with State-level bankers’ committee on crop loan waiver. The government has begun preparations to ensure all farm loan accounts are connected with Aadhar. It had said that unlike the previous government, no farmer will have to go to the government office in an attempt to prove his identity; nor will he need to fill a form.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ajit-pawar-to-head-panel-on-loan-waiver-scheme-details/article30580160.ece
268,2020/01/17,AASU to start work on new party soon,"The Assam Assam Students’ Union (AASU) has announced that it would start working on a new political party in about a month’s time.

The union, spearheading a movement against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), since December 9 last, had made a New Year resolution to form a political alternative to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its regional ally Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) as well as the Congress.

The AGP had ironically evolved from the AASU and other organisations that had steered the Assam Agitation from 1979-1985 for ejecting illegal migrants from Assam. That agitation ended with the signing of the Assam Accord on August 15, 1985.

“We are keen on taking steps to initiate the new political alternative from February,” AASU president Dipanka K. Nath told newspersons on Thursday, almost 24 hours after copies of the CAA were burned at Bhogali or Magh Bihu bonfires.

Effigy burned

A 13-headed effigy symbolising Ravana, the demon king in the epic Ramayana, was also burned on Wednesday to coincide with the customary burning of meji during the Bihu.

Photographs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and other BJP and AGP leaders were pasted on the heads of the effigy in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh.

According to the AASU, the AGP has ceased to represent the people of Assam by “toeing the Hindutva line” of the BJP. Many AASU leaders, such as Mr Sonowal, have switched over to the BJP during the past two decades.

“A majority of the people of Assam are against the CAA and are disgusted with how the BJP-led Assam government has let New Delhi push its divisive agenda in the State. Our intellectuals and artistes have been encouraging us to go for the political alternative to defeat this agenda,” Mr Nath said.

On Thursday afternoon, former Chief Minister and veteran Congress leader Tarun Gogoi wondered if Mr Sonowal was feeling the heat of the fire that turned the effigy of Ravana representing him and other BJP leaders to ashes.

“The Ravana was burned near Mr Sonowal’s ancestral home in Dibrugarh. Like that effigy, there are many real-life Ravanas including those of the AGP that need slaying in Assam,” Mr Gogoi said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/aasu-to-start-work-on-new-party-soon/article30580115.ece

At the hearing organised by several civil society groups here, the jury, which included retired Delhi High Court Chief Justice A.P. Shah, retired Supreme Court judge Justice B. Sudarshan Reddy and Prof. Irfan Habib, heard from activists, doctors and lawyers about their experiences with the U.P. police since the wake of anti-CAA protests.

The jury concluded the day-long session by finding: “The state of affairs in U.P. shows a complete collapse of rule of law. In fact the very State administration that is charged with protecting the rule of law is perpetrating violence upon its own people.”

270,2020/01/17,Congress alleges racket in tender management under Fadnavis government,"The Maharashtra Congress on Thursday claimed to have exposed a tender management racket run by the previous Devendra Fadnavis government. The racket allegedly includes City and Industrial Development Corporation’s tenders worth ₹14,000 crore for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and those worth ₹1,000 crore for Metro Bhavan project at Aarey colony.

“A tender management racket was being run by ignoring, bending and even systematically framing new rules so that tenders of major projects could be allotted to some select contractors,” said spokesperson of the Maharashtra Congress Sachin Sawant.

Mr. Sawant said as part of the PMAY, CIDCO was to build 89,771 houses. The ₹14,000-crore project was spilt into four different contracts. “After Congress filed a Right to Information application, to show proper competition, a fifth company, Nagarjuna Construction Company (NCC), was asked to fill the tender. But its bid was cancelled, and to reward the company for its help it was decided to offer it the Metro Bhavan contract,” he said.

The Congress also took the issue to the PMO and the principal accountant general on September, 6, 2019.

The MMRDA (Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority) negotiated with NCC and initially showed a reduction of ₹73 crore, said Mr. Sawant. In another round of negotiations, the scope of work and a further ₹117 crore were reduced, and the final cost came to ₹972 crore. “Astonishingly, to give the tender to NCC, the tender condition was amended saying the proposed height of the building has been increased by five floors. However, after offering the tender through negotiations, the height was reduced from 32 to 27 floors,” he said.

The Comptroller and Auditor General, in its reply to the RTI, said the experience criteria were not clearly defined; strict eligibility criteria, it said, were required as the project was highly complex in nature. “The prospective bidders were not aware of the frequent changes in scope of work and rates of non-listed items, showing inadequate preparedness for tendering of such a big project. The reply of MMRDA is vague and did not address the audit contention,” it said.

CAG replied that the scope of project was not finalised prior to the tendering process. “The changes were made on the advice of participating bidders, which was not an ideal condition for transparent bidding. Further, by allowing change in eligibility criteria as per the wish of bidders, chances of cartelisation by a few bidders increased,” the CAG said.

Mr. Sawant said the CAG observations indicate that the entire process was “a model of corruption”. “It is clear the Fadnavis government is involved in this massive scam. Hence, the Congress demands a stay on these projects and an enquiry into them,” he said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/congress-alleges-racket-in-tender-management-under-fadnavis-government/article30580096.ece
271,2020/01/17,Women in Rampur demand release of their kin,"For the last three days, hundreds of Muslim women are sitting in Rampur’s Jama Masjid demanding the release of their husbands, brothers and children who were arrested after the protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act turned violent on December 21 last year.

“Their demand is that the protest was called by the ulemas of Rampur and they should intervene now to get the 34 people out of jail,” said advocate Shaila Khan, who is president of the Rampur Chapter of Indian Lawyers Association. She said the protesters went out of control because their leaders were forced to stay at home by the district administration.

An FIR has been registered by the police against 116 named and around 3,000 unnamed persons after the protest in which one person was killed.

Many of them say their kin were innocent and were lifted just to fill the list of unnamed protesters.

‘Only earning member’

Mothers of cousins Shahnawaz and Sharooz, Rizwana and Nazma said their 17-18-year-old sons were lifted when they were having their meals. Rizwana said her husband had suffered hemorrhage after that. Shabnam whose husband Pappu was picked up by the police said he was the only earning member in the family and she had not been able to feed her one-year-old child properly.

The women are holding placards that reject the CAA and thw NRC and this has possibly irked the clergy as the senior members suggest that a mosque was not a place of protest. Ms. Khan said there was a sense of fear among the clergy as well as they felt that the police could detain them as well.

Qualifying the protest as an appeal to get their men released, Muqarram Inayati, Secretary of Jama Masjid, told The Hindu that the appeal for a protest on December 21 was taken back by the ulemas on the evening of December 20 under sustained pressure from the district administration. “However, the message could not reach everybody and people gathered on December 21 to protest. The administration had to call the ulemas to request the protesters to return.”

He said Maulvi Mehboob Ali and other members of the clergy had met the District Magistrate on Wednesday and he promised of a “positive outcome” in 3-4 days.

Arun Kumar Singh, Additional Superintendent of Police, Rampur, said 34 persons are in judicial custody.

“The investigation is on. We can’t give a timeline, it is for the court to decide,” he said.

Ms. Khan, who fought the Municipal Corporation Chairman election on a Bahujan Samaj Party ticket, clarified that her support to the women protesters was only as a lawyer and social activist and had no political motive.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/4cbd83/article30580077.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16RAMPUR1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/women-in-rampur-demand-release-of-their-kin/article30580078.ece
272,2020/01/17,"Taking cue from Shaheen Bagh, protesters assemble daily in Jaipur","Taking a cue from Delhi's Shaheen Bagh, the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters have been assembling for two hours everyday outside the iconic Albert Hall Museum here since January 2. The protesters have drawn attention of Indian and foreign tourists visiting the 130-year-old museum built in the Indo-Saracenic architecture style.

Braving chilly winds, women and children have joined the protest in large numbers every evening, raising slogans and waving banners and placards with messages against CAA and the proposed National Register of Citizens. The participants select a theme of poems, songs, slogans and speeches everyday to make the protest attractive.

“Our emphasis remains on the Constitution and its principles of justice, equality and secularism. We explain in simple terms that citizenship is everyone's right, regardless of caste, creed and religion,” Mujahid Naqvi, High Court lawyer and a leader of All India Milli Council, said. Interestingly, the protest has been organised by a loosely held group of civil society organisations.

‘Only option’

The protest concludes everyday with a reading of the Preamble to the Constitution. Yasmeen Farooqui, convener of women's wing of All India Muslim Personal Law Board, said a peaceful protest was the only option available to the vulnerable sections targeted by the BJP government.

On Thursday, activists holding the copies of Constitution and portraits of B.R. Ambedkar chanted the slogans such as “Red salute to Shaheen Bagh”, “Inquilab Zindabad (long live the revolution)” and “Kala Qanoon Waapas Lo (take back the draconian law)”.

Dalit activist Pavan Dev said the protesters were inspired by the agitation at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and had distributed kites carrying messages against CAA, NRC to celebrate Makar Sankranti.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/taking-cue-from-shaheen-bagh-protesters-assemble-daily-in-jaipur/article30580040.ece

According to an official, an additional charge under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, has been imposed on 33 people who were arrested earlier for allegedly indulging in violence during the clashes that broke out here on December 20 last year during protests against the CAA.

The section was added after receiving permission from Chief Judicial Magistrate.

274,2020/01/17,Punjab government to move resolution against CAA today,"The Punjab Assembly is all set to see an “official resolution” for repealing the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act on January 17, during the second day the special session of the Assembly.

The list of business released by the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on January 16 includes the resolution to be moved by a Minister regarding the demand for repealing of the CAA.

The resolution reads: “The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, enacted by Parliament has caused countrywide anguish and social unrest with widespread protests all over the country. The State of Punjab also witnessed protests against this legislation, which were peaceful and involved all segments of our society. The CAA seeks to negate the very secular fabric on which the Constitution of India is based. It is divisive and stands for everything opposed to a free and fair democracy which must enshrine equality for all.”

The resolution adds: “The CAA is aimed distinguishing illegal migrants on the basis of religion, which is not permissible under the Constitution. It is also violative of Article 14 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Right to Equality and equal protection of the laws to all persons. CAA provides for granting citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians, who had migrated to India before December 31, 2014, but not to members of the Muslim community and others such as Jews.”

“The ideology behind the CAA is thus inherently discriminatory and is as far away as it can be from being a humanitarian measure. In the backdrop of these facts, it is evident that the CAA violates the secular identity of India, which is the basic feature of our Constitution; therefore the House resolves to urge upon the Government of India to repeal the CAA to avoid any discrimination on the basis of religion in granting citizenship and to ensure equality before law for all religious groups in India,” it said.

The Punjab government had earlier decided to go by the will of the House on the way forward with respect to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/punjab-government-to-move-resolution-against-caa-today/article30579994.ece
275,2020/01/17,"AMU Vice-Chancellor meets students, regrets police action","A month after calling the police inside the campus to control law and order in the wake of protests against the amended citizenship law, Aligarh Muslim University Vice-Chancellor Tariq Mansoor met students at the sit-in protest spot near Bab-e-Syed on Thursday morning and regretted the turn of events.

In a four-minute video of the meeting recorded by a student, Prof. Mansoor could be heard telling students that these were not “crocodile tears”. “My whole family regrets it. I didn’t know the police would enter the hostel and guest house...” he said.

In a statement released by the university, the V-C told the students that the police should have “no role in the working of the university and law and order is to be maintained by the university.” Expressing deep regret, Prof. Mansoor said, “I deeply regret that students suffered injuries and the inconvenience they faced when they were asked to vacate hostels.”

He assured them that the university administration was fully committed to provide a congenial atmosphere and security to the students.

A university spokesperson underlined that the V-C met the students without any security cover and categorically stated that no innocent student will be targeted and that the university had no issue if the students peacefully protest on any provision which they find objectionable.

The V-C further urged students to cooperate with the visiting National Human Rights Commission team and the fact-finding committee headed by Justice (retd.) V.K. Gupta set up by the university for a detailed investigation on what all transpired on the night of December 15, in which a score students were left injured.

In the video, the V-C could also be heard asking students about the social media post where a student has asked whether funeral prayer of General Dyer should be offered.

The students could be heard replying that as their teacher he should not focus on one post and think of the future of 32,000 students.

‘Precautionary step’

The V-C could also be heard describing the letter to the district administration where he asked for security as a precautionary measure. “This is a government university. It puts ₹1,100 crore annually. God forbid something happened...we put the ball in their court,” he said.

A student requesting anonymity said he was not happy with the V-C’s response and expected students, which included a former president of the Students’ Union, to present better arguments.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/joch4f/article30579968.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE17-PG5SCOLTARIQMANSOOR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/amu-vice-chancellor-meets-students-regrets-police-action/article30579970.ece
276,2020/01/17,Sheetal Mallar’s world of transience,"For the intuitive ones, whiffs of a past linger even in the emptiest of spaces. Old walls narrate tales of characters that once occupied the place—sometimes temporarily. The building, and shedding of these walls, worlds, and characters, popularly exists on film sets, where fleetingness is often the only permanence. Photographer, Sheetal Mallar, experiments with visuals depicting this thought, in a new solo show titled, Transients.

Between performance and isolation

For Mallar, the element of performance has been a recurring theme, be it in her early life as a supermodel through the 90s and early 2000s, or as a photographer. She’s fascinated with the variety of personas that actors are continuously embracing, and letting go of. The artist in her, relates to the garb of pretence required to be in front of the camera, and the isolation and quietude that seeps into thoughts, as soon as she’s behind it.

The ‘inbetween’, is attempted in brightly coloured photographs that line the gallery space, shifting between heightened reality, and clearly defined acting. Without context, certain photographs such as people lying in a pool of blood, or a perfectly lit portrait of a woman in a tub, might confuse the viewer, even though Mallar’s intention lies in the space between fiction and gritty reality. Art writer, Ranjit Hoskote, breaks this down in his exhibition note-“ [Mallar] explores the sets of a noir thriller that recreates World War II Calcutta, its compositions of violence, its behind-the-scenes levity. She traverses the ruins of a fire-ravaged film studio, with decades’ worth of memorabilia charred, blowing in the wind. Beneath these outward and visible subjects – ephemeral spaces and evanescent trades, aftermaths and afterlives – Mallar’s constant theme is transience.”

Creatures of passage

As the viewer walks through the photographer’s world, they might mistake the frames to be staged events, with predefined roles assigned to each subject. But the photographer is quick to clarify that the scenes were already playing out in front of her, mainly shot during her time spent on Dibakar Banerjee’s set of Detective Byomkesh Bakshy! (2015). One of her favourite photographs, is of an actress performing in a bright orange saree, as the director, producers, and cameramen watch on. “It’s my comment on the world we live in, where women are often seen voyeuristically by a majority of men.” It’s in images like these where Mallar ties the cinematic world with a real-life scenario.

In photographs of a tattered curtain resting on a worn out mattress, a prop of a witch lying on a crumpled bed sheet, remnants of burnt posters painted with the famous faces of Raj Kapoor and Nargis, and ruins of a torn-down film set, Mallar continuously revisits her theme of ruined worlds. As Hoskote puts it, “encountering [Mallar’s] protagonists, we recognise them, as well as ourselves, to be transients: creatures of passage afforded a brief leasehold by the cycle of time.” In a long exposure photograph of a run-down building, the theme is put forth rather literally, introducing the viewer to the artist’s thoughts.

Fantasy world

Mallar invites the viewer into her fantastical world with an image of a video game parlour lit by a neon green light emanating from the screen. Photographed on the outskirts of Mumbai in 2014, the parlours barely exist because of stricter piracy laws, and the availability of content on streaming platforms. Right from screening regional language films, cricket, B Grade films, to porn, these parlours once attracted a number of men. Mallar explains, “While photographing there, I’d try to stay completely invisible, and leave after a bit,” much like the characters in her photographs, those who exist in reality, but only in passing.

277,2020/01/17,How MoMA got woke,"Four months of complete closure and over $400 million spent: that’s what it took the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York to relaunch last October, the year of its 90th anniversary. Today, the transformation is both a physical and conceptual one. MoMA is now a freer, more open space (courtesy architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro in collaboration with Gensler). The curators have also adopted a new way of designing the galleries — launching off the basic springboard of time, they have played with it in ways that tell us new stories of the history of modern art. “Although the galleries are still organised [to a great degree] chronologically, the new enfilade not only allows, but encourages, detours, digressions, shortcuts, and complete immersions, allowing each visitor to construct his or her own experience of the collection,” says Glenn D Lowry, the David Rockefeller Director of MoMA.

In some ways, it appears that this re-telling is a concerted effort at being woke, to being alert to racial and other social injustices, and actively working to repair or address them. “Old favourites now neighbour compelling artworks formerly often overlooked, whether those by women or African Americans, by practitioners in Asia, Africa, Latin America or the Middle East, by the self-taught or the [literally] provincial, or by those who trafficked in the aesthetics of a ‘minor’ ism or joined the ‘wrong’ movement of their day,” he says, adding that “the new hang is, above all, inclusive”.

Interiors of MoMA | Photo Credit: Iwan Baan

A case in point: Picasso’s Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, a 1907 Cubist oil painting and one of the museum’s most-visited pieces, that’s hung adjacent to American People Series #20: Die, a 1967 oil on canvas by Faith Ringgold. On the one hand, Picasso — whose Demoiselles depicts prostitutes in Barcelona in the nude — has been famously criticised for appropriating African art into his works, and on the other, Ringgold, who chronicles racist rioting and undocumented killing of African American people in Die, is an 89-year-old, New York-based African-American woman multimedia artist known for her narrative quilts. This subliminal messaging comes through across the floors.

An example of a less political pairing perhaps is the Indian Modernist master VS Gaitonde’s Painting, 4 (1962) with the Russian-American Mark Rothko’s No. 10 (1950) in an exhibit called Planes of Color. It brings together artists, for whom “colour was an essential, expressive tool, capable of evoking a range of responses”.

Glenn D Lowry

In an interview with Weekend, Lowry discusses what MoMA’s conceptual shift in museum display means, how they plan to engage with the world, and how they intend to be nimble in a digital age. Edited excerpts:

You talked about an almost bi-yearly re-hang of the exhibits. What will these be based on?

l Our new model of presentation should be understood as a work in progress, an evolving look at an increasingly inclusive approach to the art of our time. Today, contemporary artists challenge us in many of the same ways that artists of the avant-gardes of 50 or 100 years ago [many of whom are now regarded as modern masters] challenged viewers of their day. That we have come to accept the achievements of Picasso and Matisse, Mondrian and Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and Yvonne Rainer, does not necessarily mean that their work is either fully understood or that this acceptance is universal.

For MoMA, this means that its collection must be a laboratory where the public can explore the relationship between contemporary art and the art of the immediate past, in an ongoing effort to define modern art. By continually rearranging the objects in the collection and encouraging visitors to create their own paths of exploration, the museum has created a space in which many individual stories can be developed and realised.

It seems that MoMA is trying to change the way museums fashion themselves.

l This [renovation] project increases our gallery space by 30%, transforms many of our public spaces into more welcoming areas, and better connects the museum to the urban fabric of mid-town Manhattan, by creating galleries that open on to the street.

But the real value of this project is the new platform it creates for MoMA’s curatorial staff to rethink the experience of the museum.

The challenge before us today is how to create a museum that is at once global in its perspective yet rooted in New York; that is sensitive to divergent artistic practices yet focussed on the artists and ideas it most believes in; that is fundamentally participatory yet enables individual experiences. The addition of more than 40,000 sq ft of space has allowed MoMA to realise a long-held dream: the creation of a series of carefully-choreographed galleries that enables a synthetic display of the collection, one that highlights the creative frictions and influences that spring from seeing all the disciplines — painting, sculpture, architecture, design, photography, media, performance, film, and works on paper — together.

The revamp of the MoMA has relied heavily on donors and trustees. This includes billionaires Glenn Dubin and Leon Black, after whom MoMA has also named two of its galleries. Around the time of the reopening, the Guerrilla Girls, a popular anonymous feminist art group had left protest signs against these “BIG donors with BIG ties to Jeffery Epstein”, the high-profile financier and convicted sex-offender who died in his cell in contentious circumstances in August 2019. The Museum has declined to comment on this.

The internet boom has meant a serious decentralisation in accessibility of art. Institutions like MoMA have been at the forefront of engaging with this, participating in initiatives like Google Art and Culture. How will you stay on top of this in 2020?

l One of the questions that interests me most is ‘How could a museum start to think digitally?’ What would happen if we gave up ownership and thought about sharing? If we stopped concentrating on collecting and focussed on programming? If we didn’t think so much about display, but about interpretation? Well, then, we would be transformed. We would be what I’m interested in, which is a digital institution.

It would lead to different kinds of exhibitions and different kinds of relationships. You can imagine your projects differently, if you can teach yourself to think digitally. I believe we’re exploring those questions with all that we do in the new MoMA.

278,2020/01/17,‘Most of My Heroes’: Vijay Jodha’s exhibition on victims of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots,"My strongest memory of Vijay Jodha is of him in tears after a film fellowship jury tore apart the first rough cut of a film of his. It was a documentary about how the effects of climate change could be seen in Himachal Pradesh as apple plantations shifted higher up the mountains every few years. But Jodha had picked a tough topic that hadn’t yet been studied in detail and would need years of evidence to prove. He was also in the early stages of his career and couldn’t figure out how to showcase an entire apple production cycle within his three-month production deadline, but he pulled himself together after the critique and completed the film. Fourteen years later, the forest department in Himachal Pradesh still screens it as part of its officers’ training programme, and it has won accolades nationally and internationally.

Jodha is a photographer, filmmaker and artist based in Gurgaon. He has produced five books and his projects have received over 70 honours in 24 countries, including 17 best film/ director awards. His films have been broadcast in over 200 countries on 75 channels including BBC, CNN and Discovery. Two of his books and three of his films have been selected for archiving in the U.S. Library of Congress. One of his projects, Pedaling to Freedom, was also selected for archiving at OSA Budapest — the world’s premier repository of materials dealing with human rights — in 2007. Parallel to paid work, Jodha has produced over 30 films on a pro bono basis. His last project, The First Witnesses, focused on India’s ongoing agrarian crisis, in which three lakh debt-stressed farmers have committed suicide since 1995. It was exhibited across India, including in the Chennai Photo Biennale in 2019.

Jodha tends to pick difficult topics that everyone else sees but wants to look away from because they’re too hard to process. ‘Most of My Heroes’, the exhibition he’s currently holding in different locations across India, is no different. It’s a show about the victims of the anti-Sikh violence in 1984 that saw thousands killed across India and especially Delhi.

Disembodied faces

The title is taken from American hip hop artist Public Enemy’s song ‘Fight the Power’, whose lyrics include the words ‘most of my heroes still don’t appear on no stamp’. The exhibition itself is in the form of giant postage stamps that feature the faces of Sikhs killed in various parts of Delhi in November 1984, after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her bodyguards.

The images, which include old men and women, and even a baby, are digital artworks based on photos of victims of the 1984 violence that are displayed in a modest one-room museum in Trilokpuri Gurudwara. This East Delhi resettlement colony earned the dubious distinction of witnessing the greatest anti-Sikh violence in 1984. Of the 2,700 victims overall, over 350 were killed in this single locality.

Jodha has placed each image individually on a black background from which the disembodied faces stare directly at the viewer. “Postage stamps are the preserve of the famous or the powerful, and not of the ordinary or the forgotten. This art exhibition subverts that idea. The men, women, children who were killed in broad daylight in Delhi exactly 35 years back have been reduced to mere statistics. Even going by the lower official figures, on an average one Sikh was brutally murdered in full public view every four minutes in the heart of India’s capital over three days of mob violence in November 1984,” Jodha says. “The endless recurrence of mob violence and the lack of justice are a reflection of the zero value attached to the innocent lives lost in every incident, which is why zero is the value given on each stamp”.

Jodha came upon the topic more than 20 years ago when he and his brother were doing a project on the idea of ageing in India. As he travelled across the country to research for a book on how the aged survive, the issue of mob violence and communal riots arose. “The average lifespan in India used to be 30 years,” he says. “Now it’s doubled. Elderly people need to be taken care of. If riots happen, younger generations are wiped out, so who will help the aged? This was the question that made me study the riots more carefully”.

He struggled for five years to get a space to exhibit the show, and finally got a chance in 2019 when well-known artist and friend Arpana Caur offered him the use of her own gallery. He then took the show to Constitution Club in New Delhi in December, where it was shown alongside a panel discussion on the 1984 riots by the Sikh Forum. “It was wonderful. The amount of traffic was incredible. People who came were deeply affected. Since the Sikh Forum gives scholarships to the children and grandchildren of the riot victims, there was a strong connection,” he says. He was also invited to present the exhibition at a cultural festival in Delhi on January 02, the day artist-activist Safdar Hashmi was killed by a violent mob.

Painful reactions

The reactions to Jodha’s show are often painful. “Arpana Caur was happy that it had been done but couldn’t bear to see it. It’s tough to have these people’s faces looking at you even though they’re one step removed and it’s just a picture. The wounds are still raw,” admits Jodha. A college student, a Sikh, at the Forum had a similar reaction. He, like a number of visitors, walked past the show with his eyes averted. When I questioned him, he said he was 18 and didn’t know much about the 1984 riots and it was hard for him to even imagine those times.

The brushing under the carpet of inconvenient truths is what bothers Jodha the most, for as long as I’ve known him. “We Indians are emotional people and hence easy to manipulate. I’m no different. But I’ve promised myself that I’m not going to spend those emotions in a frivolous way. I will put them into something worthy. It isn’t enough just to be angry. Do something about what infuriates you and in a manner that is creative, not destructive. Something that encourages introspection and debate.”

279,2020/01/17,"A confluence of artistic creativity on display at Weavers Village, Thiruvananthapuram","The atmosphere at Weavers Village is one of camaraderie as a group of youngsters prepare the works of setting up an exhibition. While some are busy hanging up paintings to be exhibited, others are creating an air of festivity in and around the venue. The exhibition, ‘The Series’, features art, photographs, writings and music. Thirty-odd artistes, most of them members of The Hidden Tales, a social media group, will be displaying their creative works and creativity at the three-day fête. “Some of them like Visakh Joji, who specialises in charcoal painting, and Naomi, who does mural-inspired paintings, are from the city,” says Lekshman Ajithan, a founder- member of group.

Visakh says his works are mostly portraits. “I am fascinated with eyes. In fact, a series of paintings I did, inspired by posters of the television series Game of Thrones, are half portraits. While the face and body are in monochrome, the eye has shades of blue,” says the graduate from Central Polytechnic, Vattiyoorkavu.

Athira Sajeev T, however, enjoys doing realistic paintings as it requires time and effort. The 23-year-old architect from Kozhikode has two works of hers on display at the exhibition. “One is a painting of a tiger and the other is a kingfisher. Both are in acrylic,” says Athira.

Photography is engineering drop-out Ashil Shibi’s forte. The 23-year-old uses his mobile phone to capture images that capture his fancy. Ashil has one of his photographs that depicts Kathakali chamayam of two artistes on display.

Seventeen-year-old Indrajith KS hopes he will recover his voice in time for his show tonight. An English rapper, his songs are about hope and support for those who are battling depression. Indrajith, who has started his own music label called Dogs of Hell hopes to promote up-and-coming musicians through it.

And that is exactly what The Hidden Talent is about, says Lekshman. “We are an art movement that is hoping to remove all barriers towards becoming an artiste.”

The Hidden Talent was a WhatsApp group formed by Lekshman, Ashil, Hari Krishnan, Midhun Murali and Karen Sigi, then students of Sree Narayana Gurukulam College of Engineering, Kadayiruppu. “All of us enjoyed photography and would share our works amongst each other. As we wanted someone to write about what inspired us to take the shots, we added writers into our group. We then gradually added musicians, artists... and the group grew,” says Lekshman.

Lekshman Ajithan and Ashil Shibi | Photo Credit: Liza George

Their Instagram account according to Lekshman, garnered them more members. They now have WhatsApp groups for artistes in Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and two in Kerala. “We also have dedicated groups for musicians, writers, photographers and the like,” says Lekshman.

Realising that their group had talented members who needed a platform for them to display their creativity, they organised an exhibition featuring 60 artistes in Kochi last year. “We have also held an exhibition in Thiruvananthapuram and several other districts.”

The Series is a series of exhibitions that will be held across Kerala. “We will be concentrating on displaying the creative talents of local artistes at each district. The exhibition will travel to Kollam, then Alappuzha and conclude in Kochi.”

As for the mish-mash display of creativity at the exhibition, Lekshman says: “We wanted to break the mould of a traditional exhibition. Often at exhibitions, the artist will not be able to give viewers a perspective of their work. We want our exhibitions to be lively, interactive, a festivity of sorts.”

The Series will be on at The Weavers Village, Vazhuthacaud until January 19",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/csfu9h/article30585268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvmpainting3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/art-music-and-literature-at-an-exhibition-cum-fete-in-thiruvananthapuram/article30585273.ece
280,2020/01/17,Charms of Odissi explored,"Visakha Music and Dance Academy’s three-day annual fest of classical dance unveiled grace and grandeur of different dance forms. With a lion share of performances in Kuchipudi style, it mostly featured artistes of promise, besides a ballet Kirata Vilasam by team of local artistes. The budding artistes of different schools essayed given pieces with great enthusiasm. Both in solos and group numbers these artistes displayed the best of their abilities.

Kolakata-based Odissi danseuse Atrayee Dutta’s performance was the highlight of the fest. In just a less than one hour performance she kept the auditorium spell-bound. With a perfect grip over the intricate choerographic patterns and expressional élan, she breathed life into the characters that she chose to portray. The fluid ease with which she executed complex jathis made her look like a verse in kinesis on the stage. Be it Lord Siva and Parvati or Radha and Krishna, she captured even minute nuances of expression in a wide range of sancharis. That she assimilated the grace and charms of maestro Kelucharan Mohapatra’s distinct choreography remained evident in every frame.

She opened the performance with Ardhanareeshwara sthotram ‘Champaya gouradha sareerakaya’of Adi Sankaracharya. In a superlative poetic description of Ardhanaareeswara, that epitomizes the seamless harmony of male and female elements in the cosmos and its synergy in unison found exceptional expression in her performance. The way Kelubabu translated it into kinetic idiom of Odissi stood well-executed in her performance. The lines ‘Jhanth quanath kankana nupurarai, padabja rajathphani nupuraya’ salutations to Goddess Parvathi who wears jingling ankle bells and Lord Shiva for whom serpents serve as anklets and ornaments, the unmatched juxtaposition seemingly contrary shades of beauty and fearsome in nature came alive in gestural vocabulary holding the viewers in thrall.

With no intermission, even before the audience came out of the spell, she slipped into the role of Radha for Sakhi, yehi kesi madana, an ashtapadi of Jayadev. In delineation of the mindscape of virahotkhantitha Nayaki Radha who shares with her dear sakhi the details of her intimate moments with Lord Krishna, Atrayee was in her element, connecting the spiritual with the romantic, her artistic energy kept pouring out in a poised and measured flow in more chiseled and softer improvisations of its mood and expression. She vivified the subtle shades of romance in the first flush of love and its soul-forgetful moments in sweet recollection in a breath-taking manner that remained lingering in minds even after the curtains downed.",dance,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/u850ix/article30585779.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYF17ODISSI3,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/dance/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30585780.ece
281,2020/01/17,Forest Department begins measures to prevent fire in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve,"With the peak fire season in the Sigur plateau round the corner, the Forest Department has begun maintaining fire lines in more than 700 km of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR).

The department aims at completing the work before the peak fire season to prevent a repeat of last year, when major fires that broke out in Bandipur Tiger Reserve spread into parts of MTR, leading to many hectares of reserve forest getting completely destroyed. “Fire lines”, officials explain, are gaps created between patches of forest and vegetation to control the spread of fire by limiting the amount of available ""vegetative fuel"".

Officials said that owing to good rain last year the habitats destroyed in last year’s fires had begun rejuvenating, with these areas once again providing fodder for ungulates in the reserve.

Deputy Director of MTR (Buffer Zone) L.C.S. Srikanth, said six-metre wide fire lines had already been dug in 560 km of the buffer zone in the Sigur, Singara, Masinagudi and Thenumarahada Forest Ranges.

Officials said the Department had completed the maintenance work in around 400 km of the buffer zone. Sanction had been sought for completing maintenance work on the remaining extent of the fire lines.

Moreover, 120 firewatchers – 30 in each range comprising the buffer zone - had been recruited temporarily for the next few months to watch out for fires. Specially-built command centres were also operational to watch out for fires and quickly despatch Forest Department staff to put these out.

Officials said that around 300 km of existing fire lines in the core zone of the tiger reserve would also be maintained.

Forest officials would also visit settlements in the tiger reserve in the coming weeks to explain the safe practices the local communities could adopt to avoid causing forest fires.

In the Nilgiris division, work would begin soon on 75 km of fire lines, with special focus of completing the work soon along the lower slopes that were more prone to forest fires.

Water availability

Due to the good rain across the Nilgiris last year, officials said that most water bodies and streams continued to be a good source of drinking water for wildlife, while water troughs had also been put up at multiple locations across MTR to provide drinking water to wildlife. An official said that though water availability was good in the reserve now, the crunch period would start in the coming months.

The Department had taken many steps to deal with the situation.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/forest-department-begins-measures-to-prevent-fire-in-mudumalai-tiger-reserve/article30589594.ece

283,2020/01/17,Hank yarn obligation for textile mills expected to be reduced further,"Textile Mills are likely to see further reduction in hank yarn obligation, which is currently at 30 %. It was reduced from 40 % to 30 % about a year ago. In 2003, it was reduced from 50 % to 40 %. The industry is currently asking for 15 %.

According to a release from the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil), Union Textile Minister, Smriti Irani, who participated in the Council’s annual export award function held in Mumbai on Thursday, said that she would continue to pursue efforts to bring down the hank yarn obligation further. She also said that the new Cotton Mission that the government planned to come out with would look at encouraging the textile industry to work with farmers as partners. She urged the textile and clothing sector to work towards increasing exports multi-fold.

The Minister said the Cotton Corporation of India, the Texprocil and the Skill Development Ministry should work jointly and prepare a paper on mechanising cotton picking methods so that contamination levels in cotton can be reduced.

K.V. Srinivasan, chairman of the Council, said that textile and clothing exports this year were affected by US - China trade war, EU’s struggle with Brexit, and the growing geo political tensions in west Asia. He appealed to the government to consider cotton textiles sector as an entire value chain. Incentives offered by the government should be applicable to products across the value chain. For instance, cotton yarn sufferred the same incidence of State and Central levied as made ups and garments. But it was not included for the Rebate and State and Central Taxes and Levies and the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme. Cotton yarn exports too should get these benefits, he said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/hank-yarn-obligation-for-textile-mills-expected-to-be-reduced-further/article30589588.ece

286,2020/01/17,Coimbatore Corporation issues notice to contractor over stalled multi-level parking lot project,"How to break the jinx, is perhaps what the Coimbatore Corporation is thinking of, as part of its plan to float a fresh tender to resume the construction of a multi-level car parking (MLCP) on D.B. Road in R.S. Puram.

The civic body is considering floating a fresh tender as the project is more or less stalled, says an officer on condition of anonymity. “Discussions are going on in this direction and it (Corporation) may soon take a decision to float the tender.”

The Corporation's likely decision to float a fresh tender comes after it issued two show-cause notices to the contractor asking for reasons for the tepid progress in the project, worth ₹40.78 crore.

The civic body awarded the contract sometime in the first quarter of 2019 to Annai Infra Developers Erode, to build the MLCP on a 60-cent ground within two years of awarding the contract. Thereafter, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani kick-started the work with a ground-breaking ceremony in March 2019.

The Corporation had asked the company to build the MLCP as a ground-plus-four-storey structure to accommodate 370 cars, to ease traffic congestion in R.S. Puram and D.B. Road, in particular. The Corporation had said that the MLCP would be a fully automated structure with elevators and shuttle and folly taking cars to parking lots and retrieving them between 60 and 90 seconds.

The Corporation had given the contract to the company with the condition that it would be responsible for defects and liabilities for a year after the completion of construction and maintenance for five years thereafter.

After starting the construction and completing part of the ground work, the contractor was unable to show satisfactory progress and that is the reason that the Corporation issued a show-cause notice, says the officer. And, after the first show-cause notice, the Corporation issued another one sometime ago seeking explanation for the delay. If the contractor does not respond within the stipulated time, the Corporation will have no choice but to cancel the contract after following the law and float a fresh tender, the officer adds.

The Corporation floating a fresh tender to restart the stalled work will be the latest in its chequered history to somehow build an MLCP in the city. The Corporation first floated the proposal to build not one but three or four MLCPs to de-congest the city. It first invited contractors with the condition that they will have to bear the cost of construction and then recover the investment by collecting parking fees. As the contractors felt that the model would force them to recover the investment after at least 20 years, none evinced interest.

The Corporation then changed the financial model saying it will invest upfront but the contractor will have to share a portion of the parking fees. After a long wait, it finally floated a tender and found successful bidders.

But now this set back has almost put Corporation back on square one, the officer adds.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/j73wat/article30585776.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17JANTH-CARPARK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/coimbatore-corporation-issues-notice-to-contractor-over-stalled-multi-level-parking-lot-project/article30585777.ece

289,2020/01/17,Manufacturers in Coimbatore welcome mandatory hallmark for gold jewellery,"Manufacturers of gold jewellery in Coimbatore are gearing up to have hallmark for all the products they make. Coimbatore Jewellery Manufacturers Association president B. Muthu Venkatraman said the Association would organise an education programme for its members and work with the Bureau of Indian Standards to create awarenness among the manufacturers.

They willl have to maintain standards from purchase of gold to finishing. They have a year’s time to learn and adopt the standards. The caratage of jewellery vary with the city. Some buyers in Karnataka prefer to purchase 18 carat jewellery from the wholesalers here and in Pune it is 23 carat. So there are no specific standards. Nearly 40 % of the jewellery made in the country do not have BIS mark. The manufacturers here cater to the needs of the buyers across the country. With mandatory hallmark from January 15 next year, the buyers can place orders only for 14, 18 or 22 carat jewellery. All the retailers and manufacturers will have to exhaust the stock they have by then.

“The announcement by the Government will improve the image of Indian jewellery. All the 2,000 manufacturers here will go in for BIS licence by then,” he said.

S.M. Kamalhasan, president of the Coimbatore Goldsmith Association, said there were about one lakh goldsmiths here, with 50,000 of them in the micro sector. Adopting the hall marking standards would not be difficult for them. “In fact, it will generate more employment. Now, not even 60 % of the jewellery that the goldsmiths make have the hallmark. The Government should implement the mandate strictly,” he said. The Government has been saying about mandatory hallmarking for the last six years. Making it mandatory from January next year is a welcome move as customers will get quality products.

In a memorandum to the Parliamentary Committee of the Commerce Department, the Union Commerce Minister and the Tea Board, the Society said that market for black tea is reducing world over.

The Micro factories are designed for production of speciality teas and these should be encouraged. The Small Tea Growers had submitted applications to the Tea Board seeking financial assistance for establishing the micro factories. However, the Board has scrapped its order on the micro tea factories and is now saying that the applications should be from the Bought Leaf Factories. Though the Union Government announced seven years ago 40 % subsidy for establishment of Micro Speciality Tea Factories, the scheme is yet to be implemented.

The Society also sought amendment to the price sharing formula between the Small Tea Growers and the Bought Leaf Factories. It should be changed from the existing 65 : 35 to 75 : 25, as in Kenya. The small tea growers should have equal representation in all the Government bodies and a co-ordination committee should be formed for tea as done for other trades. The District-level Gree Leaf Price Monitoring Committee should meet regularly and function effectively in all the tea growing districts.

Officials from Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department said competitions such as badminton, bicycle race, running race, musical chair and tug-of-war were held for mahouts.

Nearly 60 participants including the mahouts and assistant mahouts of the 28 elephants participated in these contests, which were held on Tuesday and Wednesday. “Being a rejuvenation camp, we did not want to conduct any competitions for the elephants as there is a possibility of injuries,” an official said.

On Thursday, gaja puja (ritual for elephants) and traditional Pongal celebrations were held. The elephants were fed with sarkkarai pongal (sweet pongal) dish and sugarcane. While the mahouts wore pink shirts for the celebrations, each of the elephants wore silk sarees, strung like shawls, as part of the decorations, officials said.

K. Rajamanickam, HR&CE Joint Commissioner for Coimbatore Zone, along with other officials from the department participated in the celebrations and felicitated the winners of the competitions.

With all the elephants in the camp being overweight, feeding of delicacies and sugarcane was carefully monitored by mahouts and veterinarians, according to officials.

298,2020/01/17,Suspected A(H1N1) death: preventive measures being taken,"Following the death of a 22-year-old woman from Pandalur, suspected to be of A(H1N1) influenza a few days ago, Health Department officials in the Nilgiris conducted an inspection and began taking precautionary steps to prevent any chance of an outbreak.

The officials said that the woman, a resident of Erumadu in Pandalur, along the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border, was pregnant and had come to her mother’s house when she fell sick.

As her condition worsened, she was referred to a hospital in Kerala, where she died a few days after being admitted.

They said that the woman’s child was successfully delivered by surgery and was doing well.

The officials said they were awaiting a detailed report from the hospital where the woman died, with conflicting reports that the woman died of A(H1N1) influenza or from Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).

However, precautions were being taken to ensure that there was no chance of an outbreak, with inspections being conducted in the area to identify people with similar symptoms. A total of 84 people living near the house, where the woman stayed, were being given Tamiflu as a precaution, the officials said.

“The victim does have a travel history, as she has travelled between Kerala and Tamil Nadu,” said the officials, adding that they were also identifying family members she had come in contact with to ascertain whether they were showing symptoms associated with A(H1N1) influenza.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/suspected-ah1n1-death-preventive-measures-being-taken/article30579484.ece

300,2020/01/17,Ganja peddling continues to be a concern in Coimbatore,"The recent arrest of an 18-year-old boy with 1.25 kg of ganja near a private school at Kuniamuthur highlights the availability of the drug in Coimbatore. The boy from Sugunapuram East was roaming the area to sell the contraband, mainly to students, the police say.

In the past, peddlers aged below 18 were also held with small quantities of the contraband.

According to the police, around 98 % of cases registered under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985, in Coimbatore are related to the possession, sale and use of ganja. A few cases were also registered against people who grew cannabis plant for personal use.

The Narcotic Intelligence Bureau CID (NIB-CID), a special unit of the police dealing with drug peddling, had 188 cases related to the sale, possession and use of ganja from January 1 to November 30, 2019 in Coimbatore. Of the 200 accused involved in these cases, 191 were men and nine were women. The NIB-CID seized 1,039.1 kg of ganja from the accused in the 11-month period.

Among the total cases, NIB-CID in October 2019 seized 500 kg of ganja which two persons trafficked from Andra Pradesh to Udumalpet in ambulance. According NIB-CID sleuths, a major share of the consignment was meant for sale in Coimbatore.

Statistics accessed from e-Court Services show that 284 cases registered under the NDPS Act since 2015 have been pending trial in the combined court complex in Coimbatore as on Thursday. It also shows that the courts also disposed of 934 NDPS Act cases registered since 2011.

R. Vincent, Deputy Superintendent of Police, NIB-CID, said that a major chunk of ganja seized in various cases in Coimbatore was sourced by peddlers from other States, mainly Andhra Pradesh.

“The cultivation of cannabis within the State or nearby Kerala is significantly reduced owing to the joint efforts of various departments. Now, the drug flow is from other States which the police and NIB-CID are struggling to cut,” he said.

The official also said that users of the drug were high among migrant workers who live in Coimbatore. NIB-CID had seized 30 kg of ganja from a migrant worker at Annur last year. However, incidents of migrant workers involving in peddling were very few.

An official with Coimbatiore City Police said that the frequency of cases registered for ganja peddling in the city, at least one case in every two days, was mainly due to high concentration of educational institutions in the urban areas where peddlers remain active.

“We have also observed a trend wherein users gradually involve in the sale of small quantities of ganja to meet their expenses,” said the official.

In a move to crack down on sale and use of ganja among students, Deputy Commissioner of Police (law and order), L. Balaji Saravanan, had convened a meeting of representatives from colleges in Coimbatore city, faculty members, coordinators of NSS and NCC last year to address the problem from institutional level itself.

The idea is to develop an intelligence network within each institution to find users of drugs and prevent drug peddling in and around campuses.

City Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan also launched a Drug Control Special Team that can be reached at 6384200100.

Whereabouts of people who share information on drug use or peddling to the special team would be kept confidential.

“Due to concerted efforts, the city police have seen a decline in the number of NDPS Act cases in 2019 compared to the previous year. Apart from arresting peddlers, our officers are also trying hard to trace the source of the contraband and cut the supply chain. Those arrested for drug peddling are kept under the watch of the police when they are released from prison. This is to check whether they engage in peddling again. Provisions of the Goondas Act are invoked against multiple offenders,” said a senior official of the city police.

Mr. Vincent said that NIB-CID was also involved in the initiative and personnel attached to the unit conducted awareness sessions on drug abuse in educational institutions.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/rb159k/article30579479.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB17GANJAPACKETS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ganja-peddling-continues-to-be-a-concern-in-coimbatore/article30579480.ece
301,2020/01/17,Organic coffee to improve livelihood of tribal women in Kil Kotagiri,"More than 200 women from tribal communities in Kil Kotagiri are to get a fair price from the Government for the coffee they grow, thanks to the launch of “Neel Café”, a brand of coffee that is to be sold at Tamil Nadu Horticulture Department Agency (TANHODA) outlets across the State.

The initiative by the Tamil Nadu State Rural Livelihoods Mission (TNSRLM) and the Department of Horticulture, was designed to provide a fair price for the coffee the women from tribal groups, who are part of self-help groups, produce in their small landholdings surrounding their villages.

Officials said the women were selling the coffee to private persons for around ₹100 per kg. “The women told us that they were not being paid enough for the produce, and asked us to purchase the coffee at a higher price, which is what we intend to do,” said Joint Director of Horticulture, Nilgiris District, Sivasubramaniam Samraj. The price will be decided soon, he said.

The tribal women have been asked to supply the coffee to the department, which has FSSAI certification. This, in turn, allows them to sell the packaged coffee at TANHODA counters across the State in the coming weeks. Already, this brand of coffee is being sold at the Government Botanical Garden and Rose Garden at ₹ 130 for around 200g. “The coffee produced by the women from these communities is completely organic, and by promoting it, we are giving them a sustainable livelihood,” said Mr. Samraj.

302,2020/01/17,Steps sought to preserve stone inscriptions at temple,"History enthusiasts have sought steps from authorities here to preserve centuries old ancient inscriptions at Suganeshwar Temple in Salem. History enthusiasts observed that one of the stone inscriptions at the temple is at least 500 years old and steps must be taken to preserve the rare archaeological artefact.

Historians here lamented that the stone currently lies unattended and half of the stone has got affected due to various development works at the temple.

The Suganeshwar Temple is one of the oldest temple to be built here.

According to historians, the stone inscription is located close to the sanctum of Kurumba Vinayagar in the temple premises.

J. Barnabas, general secretary of Salem Historical Society said that the stone inscriptions in the temple should be about 700 years old and it was written in the period of Pandya King named Veerapandian from the 13th century.

Mr. Barnabas said, “the stone has huge significance historically. The stone is from 13th century and the inscription on the stone records the King’s contribution to the temple and works done here during the era. The inscriptions also has used the words like ‘Salemnadu’ and ‘Salem’. The writings identify ‘Salem’ as capital of ‘Salemnadu’.”

Mr. Barnabas said that when the sanctum platform was raised, a major part of the stone got covered.

304,2020/01/17,"Dhawan, Kohli and Rahul fire away as India takes series to the decider","The 50-over game requires a group of individuals to chip with vital contributions for a team to succeed. India couldn’t have asked for a better occasion than Friday’s must-win encounter against Australia for a cohesive effort.

Shikhar Dhawan laid the foundation for a massive total, thanks to solid partnerships with opener Rohit Sharma and captain Virat Kohli, who returned to his customary No. 3 position. K.L. Rahul, batting at an unaccustomed No. 5 slot, then ensured that India finished on a high of 340 for six on a flat pitch at the Saurashtra Cricket Association stadium.

Pandey’s brilliant catch

Manish Pandey timed his jump to perfection and plucked the ball out of nowhere to send back the dangerous David Warner, putting Australia under pressure. Spin twins Ravindra Jadeja, the hometown hero, and Kuldeep Yadav struck vital blows in the middle overs even as Steve Smith threatened to run away with the game. The pace trio of Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami and Navdeep Saini — included in the place of Shardul Thakur — then came to the party as the Men in Blue sealed a 36-run win.

While India saw almost all its players making contributions, Smith and leggie Adam Zampa — who continued to finish on the right side of his ‘mini-battle’ with Kohli — lacked support from the others. The series will be now decided in Bengaluru on Sunday.

Asked to bat, Rohit and Dhawan gave India a solid start of 81 before the former was trapped in front by Zampa while attempting a sweep. Dhawan played some glorious shots and continued to prosper in the company of Kohli. The left-hander was looking good for a century before holing out in the deep for 96. Shreyas Iyer came and went, trying to swing Zampa and losing his stumps.

Kohli, who treated Zampa with respect and gave others the treatment, was brilliantly caught on the edge of the boundary, thanks to a relay catch by Ashton Agar and Mitchell Starc. Manish Pandey, who came in for the injured Rishabh Pant, fell quickly. At 280 for five in the 45th over, India was in danger of falling short of a challenging total for the second time in succession.

Breaking free

However, Rahul took the game away from the Aussies, also justifying the faith shown in him as a middle-order batsman. Off the 60 runs India scored in the last six overs, Rahul contributed 38 off 18 balls, including an astonishing assault on Starc.

The Karnataka player then impressed with his glovework, having skipper Aaron Finch stumped off Jadeja. Despite Smith and Marnus Labuschagne — who batted for the first time in an ODI after not getting an opportunity on his debut in the first game in Mumbai — forging a 96-run partnership for the third wicket, Jadeja struck at a crucial juncture.

The left-armer enticed Labuschagne into an error, the ball landing into the long-off fielder’s hands.

Kuldeep spun it India’s way in his penultimate over, tempting Alex Carey into playing against the turn with a clever change of field.

Smith, on 98, then played on while trying to cut, as the fate of the game was sealed. Shami, though expensive, castled Ashton Turner and Pat Cummins off consecutive deliveries.

Richardson employed the long handle against Shami in the penultimate over before Bumrah, who bowled two maiden overs and looked sharp, forced Zampa to edge behind.

Rahul snapped up the offering, making it a night to cherish for him and India.

305,2020/01/17,"Ben Stokes, Ollie Pope post twin tons on second day to put England in dominant position","Centuries by Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope, followed by two late wickets, put England in a dominant position on the second day of the third Test against South Africa at the St. George’s Park on Friday.

England declared on 499 for nine and South Africa was struggling on 60 for two when rain brought an early close to a day which the hosts would probably prefer to forget.

Ban for Rabada

It started with the news that strike bowler Kagiso Rabada would miss the fourth and final Test in Johannesburg next week because of his fourth disciplinary transgression within 24 months. After bowling Joe Root, Rabada charged down the pitch before celebrating with fists clenched almost within touching distance of the England captain.

Then, after taking a pummelling from the England batsmen, the day ended with the hosts facing an uphill battle to avoid going into that match one-down in a series which is tied at 1-1.

Off-spinner Dom Bess took both wickets for England, while Mark Wood bowled with electrifying pace and hit Dean Elgar (batting on 32) a painful blow on the left forearm.

Stokes (120) and Pope (135 not out) set up England’s big total by putting on 203 for the fifth wicket. They came together on the first day when their side was struggling at 148 for four.

In contrast to the first day, when England could only score 224 for four in 90 overs, the tourists scored freely for most of the day, although Pope made hard work of moving from 75 at lunch to his century, needing most of the afternoon before he punched Anrich Nortje through midwicket for his 14th boundary after facing 190 balls.

Moving cautiously

While Pope, 22, moved cautiously to join Dom Sibley in scoring a maiden Test hundred during the series, Sam Curran provided the impetus for England as he hit an aggressive 44 off 50 balls, with six fours and a six. He and Pope put on 59 for the seventh wicket, with Pope contributing 13.

England was already in a strong position when it reached 426 for eight at tea. The 37 minutes after the break rubbed it in as Wood joined Pope with a licence to score as quickly as possible.

Wood slammed five sixes in an innings of 42 off 23 balls, dealing out severe punishment to left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj before holing out. There was a bizarre incident when Wood appeared to have been caught off Rabada when the total was 467.

England captain Joe Root signalled a declaration but when Rabada was found to have sent down a no-ball after a check by the umpires, Root cancelled his decision and 32 runs were added, with Pope playing some outrageous shots, including two switch-hit left-handed shots for four and a hooked six off Rabada.

South Africa reached 50 in reply without any alarms before Pieter Malan chipped a return catch to Bess. Coming on as third change Wood discomfited both Elgar and Zubayr Hamza before Hamza was caught at short-leg off Bess in what proved to be the final over of the day.

309,2020/01/17,Getting the playing XI right,"Selection of the eleven and the team balance — these depend on conditions — often decide matches.

And Tamil Nadu, with just five points from an equal number of games, has got this crucial aspect wrong this Ranji season.

The side has brought in seamer M. Mohammad for paceman K. Vignesh for its next duel, here, against the Railways beginning Sunday.

But then, in the dry, hot conditions, and on a pitch expected to assist spinners, Tamil Nadu is likely to field a lone paceman, the often impressive left-armer T. Natarajan.

Not making sense

Since the State seamers do not possess the speed to achieve reverse swing, playing two of them does not make sense.

In fact, Tamil Nadu blundered by including a second paceman in Vignesh — he finished with none for 49 — against Mumbai here when the side was screaming for an additional spinner in left armer M. Siddharth.

R. Ashwin and Sai Kishore had reduced an inexperienced Mumbai to 129 for five on day one at Chepauk before Shams Mulani (87) and Aditya Tare (154) and some spirited batting by the tail lifted the visitor to a daunting 488.

Tamil Nadu desperately needed another specialist spinner after Mumbai had lost its fifth wicket considering Ashwin and Sai needed a break.

Inconsistency

The other problem for Tamil Nadu is Sai Kishore’s inconsistency with length. So you cannot rotate bowlers around him with the left-armer keeping his end tight.

And in the season opener against Karnataka, Tamil Nadu actually went in with four spinners in R. Ashwin, M. Ashwin, M. Siddharth and Sai Kishore, apart from the handy off-spin of B. Aparajith.

This was surely an overkill in a low-scoring game on a conducive pitch where an extra batsman could have made the difference.

The message to Tamil Nadu is simple and straight — Get your XI right.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/getting-the-playing-xi-right/article30588309.ece
310,2020/01/17,Recalled Hafeez aims for T20 World Cup before retiring,"Pakistan allrounder Mohammad Hafeez regards the home series against Bangladesh next week as an audition for the Twenty20 World Cup squad before he exits international cricket.

""My personal plan is that I should play for Pakistan on the basis of fitness and performance,” Hafeez said on Friday. “I want to play the World Twenty20 and then I want to make an exit from international cricket.”

The T20 World Cup is in October in Australia.

The 39-year-old allrounder expected his recall and believed he could groom youngsters in the team.

""Well, (selection was) not a surprise to me to be honest because I’m always available for the team,” he said. “There are more youngsters than seniors (in the team) so it will be great for us to share the experience with them and let them express themselves in a way so they can perform and do well for a long period of time.”

311,2020/01/17,South Africa’s Rabada banned for final test over Root celebration,"South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has been banned from the series-deciding final cricket Test against England.

Rabada was given a one-Test ban after breaching the International Cricket Council code of conduct for his celebration after getting England captain Joe Root out on the first day of the ongoing third test in Port Elizabeth.

Rabada ran through and celebrated — fists pumping and screaming — close to Root after bowling him.

He was found guilty of using language, actions or gestures which could provoke an aggressive response from the batsman. The 24-year-old Rabada was given one demerit point for the offense but it’s his fourth demerit in the last two years, which results in a one-match ban.

Rabada was charged with the offense in Port Elizabeth by match referee Andy Pycroft. He pleaded guilty and accepted the punishment.

It’s a major boost for England’s hopes of winning the four-test series and a major blow for South Africa’s. Rabada is the No. 4-ranked bowler in the world and South Africa’s spearhead.

The fourth test starts next Friday in Johannesburg.

313,2020/01/17,Ashwin signs up with Yorkshire,"Senior India off-spinner R. Ashwin will play for Yorkshire during this year’s English County Championship, the club said on Thursday.

Ashwin, 33, who will play for Delhi Capitals in the upcoming IPL, will be Yorkshire’s main overseas spinner following South African Keshav Maharaj’s stint in 2019.

Ashwin is scheduled to feature in a minimum of eight County Championship fixtures for the White Rose next season after the conclusion of his IPL commitments followed by a short period of rest at the BCCI’s request. It will be Ashwin’s third county stint, having represented Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire in the past.

“I’m thrilled to be joining Yorkshire, a club with a wonderful history and a fantastic fan base. I think our team looks extremely talented with some superb pace bowlers and exciting batsmen,” Ashwin told the club’s website.

“Headingley has always been a fantastic venue to play at. People speak about the overhead conditions playing a big part so let’s hope for plenty of sun.

“I love playing First-Class cricket and have enjoyed my two previous spells with Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire. My role will be to score runs and take wickets but it will be a collective effort if we are to win the title,” he added.

Ashwin said it was great to represent a club, where batting great Sachin Tendulkar plied his trade in the past.

“I feel I have been consistent over a long period of time which has helped my success for India. I know a lot about Yorkshire and to follow in the footsteps of Sachin, who played for the county many years ago is a wonderful feeling for me,” he said.

The off-spinner has taken 362 wickets in 70 Tests, 254 of those in 43 home Tests and recently claimed his 27th five-wicket haul in the longest format.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/ashwin-signs-up-with-yorkshire/article30578689.ece
314,2020/01/17,W.V. Raman’s The Winning Sixer launched,"It should come as no surprise that W.V. Raman has authored a book. The former India opener has always been one of the shrewdest voices on cricket, forthright and informed in his opinion and never shy of expressing it. In ‘The Winning Sixer’, released formally by Anil Kumble here on Thursday, Raman has drawn on his own experiences, and those of other athletes, to derive leadership lessons from sport.

Raman, the current head coach of the national women’s team; Kumble, a former India captain; and P. Madhavan, Executive Vice-President, TVS Tyres, engaged in a lively conversation on the subject of leadership, holding in rapt attention an audience that included G.R. Viswanath, Roger Binny, Rahul Dravid, Ajinkya Rahane, Narendra Hirwani and Mithali Raj.

No one a born leader

“I don’t think anyone is a born leader,” said Kumble. “You just throw them in the deep end and see how they swim. As far as Indian cricket goes, you just learn on the job. I don’t think there is any rule that so and so will be a perfect leader. You need to be able to step back from your personal goal and look at the team in a larger context.”

Raman agreed. “Experience is a tough teacher,” he said. “It punishes you first and teaches you later. You need to know the end result you are trying to achieve and then follow that path.”

Kumble recalled the turbulent Australia tour of 2007-08, when his capabilities as a leader were tested to the limit. “You need a core group of players to support you. I was lucky that I had Rahul, Sourav, Sachin, and Laxman,” he said. “The game is bigger than any individual. If you think that is the final outcome you want to get to, then things fall in place. When those issues happened... as a captain you are never trained to deal with off-field issues. The support I had from the players then was immense.”

Common purpose

As a captain, what did he want in a team, Kumble was asked. “It was all about having a core set of players who would contribute to the common purpose,” he said. “As a team, how well can you disguise your shortcomings? That is the critical aspect. No team can be complete. It’s very difficult to get a complete team. If you have it, that’s great, but it’s very unlikely you are going to get that. How well can you make sure that you throw your punches at the right time? That’s what matters.”

Getting all players to pull in the same direction was key, Kumble pointed out. “It all boils down to communication and respect. If you have those two things, it’s not hard to align people with the common goal.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/5qm92j/article30578630.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17BOOK,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/wv-ramans-the-winning-sixer-launched/article30578632.ece
315,2020/01/17,Four Nirbhaya case convicts to be hanged on Feb. 1,"On a day President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy plea of death row convict Mukesh Singh in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case, a Delhi court on Friday issued a fresh death warrant to hang all four convicts in Tihar jail at 6 a.m. on February 1.

Mukesh had submitted a mercy petition to the President earlier this week. He had followed this up with a petition at the Delhi court seeking postponement of his execution.

Judge’s query

Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora, who had previously ordered execution of all four convicts for January 22, questioned why the other three convicts had not yet appealed against the death warrant or exhausted their legal remedies.

“Would it not be delaying tactics? How far can it be stretched,” the judge asked.

The Delhi Prison Rule states that, “If the sentence of death has been passed on more than one person in the same case, and if an appeal or an application is made by or on behalf of only one or more but not all of them the execution of the sentence shall be postponed in the case of all such persons (prisoner sentenced to deaths)”.

Currently, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh have already exhausted their option of a curative petition before the Supreme Court against the death sentence, while the other two — Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh — are yet to approach the apex court with their curative pleas. Sharma, Gupta and Akshay Singh — have also not filed a mercy plea before the President.

Advocate A.P. Singh, representing Sharma and Gupta, said a case was pending before the Supreme Court on the question of Gupta’s alleged juvenile status when the crime was committed.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/yfyoxj/article30584794.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MUKESHSINGh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/delhi-court-issues-fresh-death-warrants-against-4-nirbhaya-case-convicts/article30586402.ece

The court passed the order on a plea by a BJP leader seeking to set aside Mr. Tomar’s election.

“The petition is allowed,” Justice Rajeev Sahai Endlaw said.

It is pertinent to mention that Mr. Tomar is also contesting the upcoming Delhi Assembly election and is likely to file his nomination from Tri Nagar constituency on Saturday.

Mr. Tomar had contested on an Aam Aadmi Party ticket.

BJP leader Nand Kishore Garg had alleged in his plea that Mr. Tomar’s election had been “materially affected by deliberate concealment, misrepresentation, wrong declaration and wilful suppression of the educational qualification in the affidavit filed along with the nomination form“.

“The respondent No 1 (Tomar), at the time of filing the nomination, and thereafter, has continued to misrepresent himself to be a law graduate and advocate and has thus been successful in exercising undue influence over the voters, which amounts to corrupt practice within the meaning of the Representation of the Peoples Act,” the plea said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/article17713374.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE29-PTI692015000012B,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/high-court-sets-aside-ex-delhi-law-minister-jitender-tomars-election-in-2015-polls-for-false-declaration/article30586139.ece

321,2020/01/17,Jail warder among sevenheld guilty in drugs case,"Seven persons, including a Kurukshetra District Jail warder, have been held guilty under different Sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 by the district and sessions court of Kurukshetra in an over two-year-old case.

Jai Singh, the jail warder, found in possession of around five gm heroin to be supplied to inmate Sahil @ Dilshad was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment and ₹20,000 fine under the Prevention of the Corruption Act. The rest — Ranjeet, Gurpreet, Sompal, Sahil, Gurmantar and Nishan Singh — were sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment with a fine of ₹1 lakh each under the NDPS Act.

The accused were also convicted and sentenced to lesser period of jail terms on different charges, but all the jail terms will run concurrently.

Kurukshetra DSP Raj Singh had received an information on October 16, 2017 afternoon saying that Ranjeet Singh, a resident of village Bhiwani Khera, had bribed Jai for delivery of heroin to accused Dilshad @ Sahil who was confined in District Jail, Kurukshetra. A police team led by Mr. Singh conducted a raid in the jail and recovered a polythene bag containing the contraband and four ₹500 denomination notes from Jai. Later, the remaining six persons were arrested during the course of investigation for their role in procurement of the drug and to facilitate its supply to Sahil.

Public Prosecutor Mainpal Singh produced 24 witnesses in support of the case, but defence counsel S.S. Jaidka, appearing on behalf of accused Jai, argued that his client was not given option to get him searched before a Magistrate in violation of the law and the place of occurrence of the crime was doubtful. He produced three warders claiming that Jai was not at the said place at the time claimed by the police and also he was searched before entering the jail premises as per the protocol, but nothing incriminating was found.

Mr. Jaidka claimed that the police party along with the accused came out of the jail at 8.00 p.m. on October 16, 2017, but it again entered the jail at 8.38 p.m. along with the accused and therefore, all these circumstances showed that possibility of false implication of Jai could not be ruled out. He also argued that nothing had been brought on record that the cash found from Jai was bribe money.

The defence counsels appearing on behalf of the other accused also argued that except the disclosure statements of their clients, no incriminating material was available on record to prove their involvement.

Saying that the case “represents an ugly face of drug abuse and drug racket running in a jail facilitated by jail officials”, Additional Sessions Judge-cum-Special Judge (under NDPS Act, 1985) Rakesh Singh said the evidence of the official witnesses was trustworthy and credible and he was of the considered view that there was no lacunae in the testimony of witnesses particularly when recovery of contraband as well as four currency notes has been duly proved by the witnesses.

Rejecting the testimonies of three defence witnesses, the judge said the testimony of the gazetted police officers could not be “thrown away, especially when accused Jai Singh had failed to show that they had any enmity with him”. “Moreover, in the current case, the place of occurrence is District Jail, Kurukshetra and in no way it can be imagined that police officers would implicate the accused Jai Singh in a false case by showing the recovery of drug in District Jail, Kurukshetra,” said the judge in his 58-page order.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jail-warder-among-sevenheld-guilty-in-drugs-case/article30580316.ece

328,2020/01/17,65% students have paid new hostel charges: JNU,"The JNU administration on Thursday said that out of the 6,450 students residing in its various hostels around 65% have cleared their dues by paying the new hostel fees.

The remaining, it said, were returning to the campus from home and have time till January 17 to register without having to pay late fees. When it comes to day scholars, they said that nearly 95% of students have cleared their semester dues.

‘Last-minute rush’

“Since January 15 [Wednesday] was the last date for registering for the winter semester, there was a last-minute rush. Several students have approached us to extend the last date for winter with an appeal for extension of date of registration by another two days. Therefore, to facilitate their registration process, the university has decided to extend the last date for one final time up to January 17. After this date also, students can register but they will have to pay the late fee as per University rules.” the university said.

“All the Schools and Centres have announced their time-tables and are working on conducting tests for those students who did not complete the last semester academic requirements. The University has been doing everything possible to help the students continue their academic activities. A great number of faculty members are actively working to make sure that the academic interests of the students are addressed,” Vice Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said.

JNUSU meanwhile, said that it had been decided to legally challenge the IHA Manual that brought the fee hike and seek interim relief. “We request the student community therefore- especially those who have not registered to continue to boycott the registration process in the light of such a move. Our unity at this juncture is very critical,” the JNUSU told students

JNUSU said that it will undertake all manner and means of struggle to see to it that the students facing proctorial enquiries and punitive actions like suspension/eviction are not victimised and their registration is completed on a priority basis.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/z1q1wr/article30582461.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE16JNU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/65-students-have-paid-new-hostel-charges-jnu/article30580256.ece

330,2020/01/17,"SC nod for smog towers, anti-smog guns in Delhi","The Supreme Court agreed with the Delhi government’s proposal to install a smog tower at Connaught Place within three months even as it passed several directions to reduce air pollution.

“As proposed in the reply of the Delhi government, let the smog tower at Connaught Place be completed by Delhi government as proposed in their reply affidavit,” a Bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta ordered on January 13.

The Bench also ordered a smog tower to be installed in Anand Vihar as pointed out by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The court ordered the Delhi government to provide 30 x 30 meters for installation of an experimental tower there within seven days. It said this project would be funded by the Centre even as the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change would monitor it. The court directed the project to be completed in three months.

The court directed that anti-smog guns should be used in Delhi and the National Capital Regions (NCR) at large construction sites, road construction stretches, mining activities, large parking sites on unpaved areas, during large public gatherings, demolition activities and while sprinkling on dust-prone traffic corridors.

The court made it compulsory for authorities to use anti-smog guns in Delhi-NCR at the site of projects that require environmental clearance from the State/Central level and which have a built-up area of more than 20,000 sq. m., including excavation, material handling and other dust-generating activities. The authorities would have to prepare a “pollutor pays” policy to cover the cost of installation of the anti-smog guns.

The court directed the Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan governments to identify plastic, industrial and other toxic waste and ensure they were not burnt but incinerated. Piled-up waste must be removed within six weeks. The court also directed the Pollution Control Boards (PCBs) of the four States to monitor at night and take stringent action against polluting industries.

The court asked the Delhi government to work out a comprehensive plan within three months to have 100% capacity to deal with garbage and wastes. The court had also directed the PCB and the Indian Bureau of Standards to randomly check the quality of water supplied in Delhi and submit a report in one month.

The court ordered penal action against developers in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan found flouting the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules of 2016. It ordered the States to file status reports on the action taken against rogue developers, including how many had been blacklisted. The court sought a report on the facilities for construction and demolition waste recycling in the four States. It asked them to come out with a comprehensive plan on waste management.

The court ordered the authorities of Ghaziabad, Panipat and Meerut to ensure remedial measures are taken in connection with waste pile-ups in certain areas and file a report in a month.

The court asked why Delhi, U.P., Haryana and Punjab should not be ‘saddled’ with the burden to pay compensation for failing to prevent pollution and stubble-burning. It ordered a comprehensive plan to prevent stubble-burning to be placed before it.

The 11-page order wanted a detailed plan for crop residuary management and its use as fertilizer, cattle food and bio fuel. It asked the government to take a final decision on the incentive/disincentive of ₹100/- per quintal and the in-situ farming.

Further, the court directed the Centre, Punjab, Haryana and U.P. governments to prepare a scheme to give access to small and marginal farmers advanced machines like combine harvesters, happy seeders, etc., either free of charge or for a nominal rent.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/real-estate/b2jrct/article30114515.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AIRPOLLUTIONSTANDALONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/sc-nod-for-smog-towers-anti-smog-guns-in-delhi/article30580186.ece

A two-hour-long session will be held with the protesters, who were granted bail on by a city court on January 10, a police officer said on Thursday. The officer said they have prepared the material on CAA to be distributed to the protesters. “The session will be addressed by a Crime Branch Inspector who is probing the violence in Seemapuri during the December 20 protest,” said the officer. There was, however, no mention of any discussion on NRC and NPR, two proposed exercises which have pushed people to take to streets against the CAA.

The city court, while granting bail to the 20 people, had ordered the police to hold a session on January 19 between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. at Seemapuri police station, where the IO/SHO shall make an effort to address the doubts of the protesters in respect of the CAA.

“For the session the material has been taken from the CAA, translated into Hindi and simplified because most of the protesters are uneducated. We will ask these protesters to counter rumours related to the CAA and pass the right message to their friends,” said the officer.

On the damage to public property during the protests, the police said they are waiting for the High Court to appoint a Claims Commissioner to investigate the liability and estimate the damages.

334,2020/01/17,AAP pulls up BJP for delay in hanging Nirbhaya convicts,"The Aam Aadmi Party on Thursday said the BJP is responsible for the delay in hanging the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case.

At a press conference, senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia said: “Bring the Delhi Police under our jurisdiction for two days and we will ensure execution of the culprits.”

On the other hand, Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday blamed the Delhi government for the “delay” in the hanging of the Nirbhaya convicts, alleging that it took over two and a half years to give notice to the four men after the Supreme Court’s rejection of their appeal against the death sentence in 2017.

“Had the government given notices to all convicts within a week of the Supreme Court order, they would have been hanged by now,” said Mr. Javadekar at a press conference.

“The complicity of the government in providing the detailed legal procedure to Tihar Jail for the last 2.5 years shows the side the government is taking – that of rapists and murderers,” he added.

To this, Mr. Sisodia said: “It really pained me to see a Minister [Javadekar] in the Central government blatantly lying on such a sensitive matter and that too, before the entire nation and surprisingly, with no hesitation whatsoever.”

He added that Mr. Javadekar must question the Ministry of Home Affairs and the police on the delay. “You should ask your Home Ministry and Amit Shah ji on why this execution could not be carried out when they have control over the police and Tihar administration. Why is Amit Shahji abandoning his responsibility? Why are you lying to the people just before elections? You are misleading people. I want to ask you why your government delayed the matter, why are you not taking responsibility for this delay?”

The government on Wednesday recommended rejecting the mercy plea filed by Mukesh Singh, one of the convicts, and has forwarded it to L-G Anil Baijal. It also informed the High Court during a hearing that execution of the convicts will not take place on January 22 as a mercy plea has been filed by one of them, Mukesh Singh.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-pulls-up-bjp-for-delay-in-hanging-nirbhaya-convicts/article30579661.ece

Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Subhash Chopra said: “90% of the names have been finalised and an official announcement will be made in a day or two.” January 21 is the last date for filing nomination.

The Congress is keen to go all out to regain some of its support base that has moved to AAP. Ms. Gandhi is reportedly keen on fielding senior leaders like A.K. Walia, Krishna Tirath and Arvinder Singh Lovely. Younger leaders like Alka Lamba too would be fielded.

Of the 70 seats in Delhi Assembly, the Congress has agreed to leave four — Uttam Nagar, Burari, Karawal Nagar and Palam — for its Bihar ally Rashtriya Janata Dal. The RJD, however, has not agreed so far and is negotiating for one more seat.

“Although the Congress has agreed to give us four seats, the RJD is keen to contest on five seats, which is a respectable number, with special emphasis on Timarpur,” RJD’s Delhi in-charge and Rajya Sabha MP Manoj K. Jha said.

Asked what will happen if the Congress refuses to lea-ve Timarpur for them, Mr. Jha said, “We will see tomorrow. The talks are still on.”

‘Cashback’ scheme

The Congress on Thursday announced that if it comes to power in Delhi, it would introduce a “cashback scheme” to encourage water conservation.

The DPCC chief said those households which save water from the present 20,000-litre free water per family, will benefit from this scheme, which will be introduced as part of the Congress’ Paani Bachao — Dilli Bachao campaign.

“Congress will keep the free water scheme but will also keep in mind the likelihood of a future ‘water war’. Congress will pay 30 paise for every litre of water saved, which will be directly transferred into the consumers’ account,” Mr. Chopra said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/final-list-of-candidates-in-a-day-or-two-chopra/article30579660.ece

Stating that the Budget should be away from politics, he said: “I will write to the Centre to not worry about the election and go ahead with the Budget.” I was under pressure from within and outside the party to write to the Election Commission to stop the Centre from presenting the Budget on February 1 so that they can’t influence the election but I don’t approve of this. Delhi’s development should not be stopped at any cost. We want the Budget on February 1 itself.”

He said enough funds should be allotted to municipal corporations. “They should also provide adequate funds to the State governments of Punjab and Haryana to take preventive measures against air pollution. To bring the transportation sector in Delhi at par with the international standards, the government must provide funds to improve the transport infrastructure here,” he said.

Mr. Kejriwal said adequate funds must be provided to the government for cleaning the Yamuna, to provide sewer connections to each household, expansion of Metro train routes and for cleaning Delhi. “We want this for the welfare of our State so that any party that forms the government here can utilise these funds efficiently,” he said. “Even if we do not receive adequate support from the Centre, we will not let the development of Delhi stop,” he added.

Union Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, said in a tweet: “Delhi govt was allocated ₹350 cr under SBM but they could spend only ₹102 cr.

The first manifesto will be concise while the second one will give finer details. “We are going with a concise one first as we need something to which people can connect easily and also because our candidates can start campaigning with it,” the insider told The Hindu.

Door-to-door campaign

The party is expected to hold a press conference on Friday or Saturday on how they will take the manifesto to the people. “We are thinking about door-to-door campaign and also a couple of town hall meetings by the Chief Minister to take the manifesto to the people but we are yet to finalise it,” the insider said.

Ahead of the 2015 Assembly election, the AAP had come out with a 70-point manifesto with Delhi Janlokpal Bill, Swaraj Bill, full statehood for Delhi, electricity bills to be reduced by half, and CAG audit of power discoms, as the top five promises. The manifesto was 12-pages long.

For the 2019 Lok Sabha election, AAP had made “full statehood”, the Central theme of the manifesto and explained how it will help the government in different sectors such as law and order, education, healthcare among others. It was 38-pages long.

“The first manifesto will not be longer than two to three pages, which will tell our vision for the next five years. We will also tell people that we will continue with our existing schemes,” another AAP leader said.

341,2020/01/17,Cornelia Sorabji: Woman of many accomplishments,"She was the first female graduate from Bombay University; the first woman to study Law at the prestigious Oxford University as no Indian woman has ever went to study in England before; she was the first female advocate in India and she was also the first woman to practice Law even in Britain. A lady with numerous records, Cornelia Sorabji, led a life guided by her own passion and faithfully followed her heart. In 2012, a bronze bust of hers was unveiled at Lincoln’s Inn, the High Court Complex in London by the prominent lawyers of the United Kingdom as a mark of respect to the first ever lady to don the lawyer’s gown in their country. A Google Doodle celebrated her 151 birthday on November 15, 2017.

Cornelia Sorabji was born in 1866 in Nasik, Maharashtra. Her career path was heavily influenced by her parents, who advocated for her and her siblings — who were altogether six sisters and a brother — to become leaders in education and social work. She spent her childhood initially in Belgaum and in Pune. After home schooling by her parents, and attending mission schools, Cornelia was the first woman admitted to Deccan College, Poona where she graduated with a first class degree. In fact, her parents encouraged all their daughters to attend Bombay University, but every time their applications were rejected as in those days female applicants were not considered for admission. But it was only their sixth daughter, Cornelia finally broke through the barrier of entry. At Deccan College, she pursued Literature and completed a five year course in one year. She was the top ranked student of her class. But as she was a female, she was denied the Oxford scholarship that was usually given for the top student of the year. But a few prominent English women in Poona and Bombay raised funds to send her to Oxford. Cornelia thus went to Oxford in 1889 and joined the Somerville College there.

Parental influences Cornelia’s mother, Francina Santya Ford was born a Hindu and after being orphaned, was adopted by a British couple, belonging to Indian Army. Francina married Sorabji Kharsedji a Parsi but a practicing Christian and a missionary. She established several schools for Parsi, Hindu and Muslim children in Poona. The Sorabjis had six daughters in succession and a son. Cornelia was the last daughter. Cornelia’s family dressed and followed Parsi cultural practices though they followed Christian faith and spoke Gujarati. All the children were raised with British customs and they grew up surrounded by diverse cultures.

At Oxford, Cornelia took Law and in 1892 she became the first woman to pass Bachelor of Civil Laws (BCL) examination but Oxford would not grant her the degree as no woman till then was allowed to register as advocate. At Oxford, she held the record as the first woman student till the arrival of the daughters of Maharaja Dhuleep Singh, (the deposed king of Punjab and the son of Ranjith Singh) Bhamba and Catherine in 1890. She was thus the first Indian national to study at any British University. At Oxford, she was drawn close to great Indologists and Sanskrit scholars like Max Muller and Monier Williams. She also had an enduring friendship with Florence Nightingale.

After returning from Oxford, Cornelia began a long search for a legal post in India. She got involved in social work on behalf of the Purdanashins, women who were veiled and forbidden to communicate with the outside male world. As a solicitor, she prepared cases for women clients first in the Princely state of Kathiawar in Gujarat. She helped altogether 600 women and orphans fight legal battles, many a time charging no fees from them. She also completed LL.B course from Bombay University in 1897. Although it was not possible for women to become barristers until 1923, she continued to read law at the Solicitors’ firms. For some time she joined her younger brother Dick in a brother-Sister law practice, in Allahabad.

After Oxford began awarding degrees to women in 1920, and the London Bar agreed to allow women with Law degrees to practice in law, Cornelia travelled to England to collect her degree and she was called to the Bar in 1922. She returned to Calcutta where she enrolled as a Barrister at the High Court. She thus became first woman to practice law in India and in Britain.

Cornelia Sorabji was involved in many social reform activities. She was actively associated with Bengal branch of National Council for Women in India. The Federation of University Women and Bengal League of Social Service. She extensively toured in the Bengal, Bihar and Assam on her social work. For her services, Cornelia was awarded Kaiser- i- Hind Gold medal in 1907 by the government of India.

She was a great votary for abolition of child marriages and sati practice. She worked alongside Pandit Ramabhai, the renowned social activist of Maharashtra. She gave up her practice in 1929 and devoted her time entirely for social work.

Though a nationalist initially, Cornelia Sorabji gradually became an anglophile, and towed the British line in her political leanings. She courted controversies by supporting the American writer, Katherine Mayo who in her book, Mother India (1927), defended British rule in India, the book which Gandhi called as “Gutter women’s Report”. Cornelia even opposed Gandhi when he launched civil disobedience movement. She toured India and U.S.A. to propagate her political views and thus became unpopular among the nationalist leaders.

When she made Gandhi angry In 1932 when Gandhiji was in London attending the Round Table Conference, Cornelia Sorabji using all her political influence obtained permission to interview him for a British journal, but the interview was aborted half way due to a spat she had with Gandhi and his line of anti- British approach and this was widely reported in the newspapers both in India and in England.

In 1931, she moved back to England and permanently settled there, visiting India during winters. She died on July 6, 1954 at 88. Cornelia was un-married.

Besides being an active social worker, Cornelia was also a prolific writer. She wrote a number of books, short stories and numerous articles for journals. Her two autobiographies were, India Calling: The Memories of Cornelia Sorabji (1934) and India Recalled (1936). Today, there is an attractive large portrait of Cornelia Sorabji in the prestigious National Portrait Gallery, in London.",history & culture,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/fvmncx/article30586011.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf10bustjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/society/history-and-culture/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30586015.ece
342,2020/01/17,CCMB hosting Indo-US workshop on genetic diseases,"CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) has brought together researchers from India and the United States to work to understand the genetic basis of diseases among various ethnic populations from different parts of the world for the ‘Indo-US workshop on Human Diversity and Health Disparities’. The three-day workshop got under way on Thursday.

Researchers will deliberate on genetic and epigenetic basis of different forms of cancer, diabetes, heart and neurological diseases in South Asia and the USA during the meeting. There will be focused discussions on the promise of personalised medicine and advancements in technologies to make it possible.

European populations

Co-convenors of the meeting — Dr Thangaraj from CCMB and Dr Keshav Singh, University of Alabama, Birmingham — stated that most of the existing data is based on European populations and for personalised medicine to progress, it is imperative to understand population- specific genetics.

The workshop is being attended by around 200 researchers, many of whom are promising Ph.D scholars from research institutes, universities, hospitals and life science companies in India as well as the USA.

This meeting is arranged by the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum, supported by Department of Science and Technology, India and Department of State, USA, with an aim to create fruitful collaborations between the two countries.

Economical approach

“Variation in our population and differential susceptibility to diseases and response to treatment methods has been known. With genome information, we can now think of precision and personalised approach for more effective and economical approaches to healthcare. This meeting brings experts from both countries to discuss the latest findings and is likely to help us fine-tune our way forward towards genome-assisted healthcare,” explained CCMB director Rakesh Mishra.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/ccmb-hosting-indo-us-workshop-on-genetic-diseases/article30589663.ece
343,2020/01/17,Rail passengers make good use of ‘Coach Mitra’,"Coach-Mitra, a digital application introduced by Indian Railways to provide assistance with regard to deficiency in travel comforts like coach cleaning, watering, lighting etc. in trains, has got positive feedback with South Central Railway (SCR) receiving 470 complaints a month.

These complaints pertain mostly to cleaning, watering, lighting etc. through phone, Whatsapp or website. Other issues are about electrical, bed roll, pest control and petty repairs.

“Nearly 90% of such service requests are being attended with 87% of requests being attended in less than 30 minutes. Two per cent of the rail users expressed dissatisfaction when we sought feedback,” said senior officials of SCR.

Coach Mitra is now working in 2,167 trains and in SCR, it is available in 72 pairs of trains with two more in the offing. Downloads of the Coach Mitra mobile app has crossed 10,000 and a tab is also being kept on the working of the cleaning staff with GPS-based biometric attendance and geo-tagged photos of cleaning are being posted to ensure strict compliance, they said.

To be extended

The tablet PC based feedback introduced in Secunderabad and Guntakal divisions are to be extended to other divisions too. Passenger can check the Coach-Mitra website to find out whether the particular train is covered or not before availing the service.

Senior officials explained that to avail the facility, a passenger has to send a text message to the mobile numbers earmarked or it can be done through a web page for logging the request. It is then immediately acknowledged through another message along with a code.

A member of the housekeeping staff would also receive the same message indicating the passenger berth number and has to contact the latter to carry out the work as per demand.

If the passenger is satisfied with the work, he discloses the code received during acknowledgement and the staff in turn sends the same code through SMS.

Scope for review

If the passenger is not satisfied with the work done, he/she wouldn’t disclose the code and the complaint would be reviewed further.

344,2020/01/17,Chhota Bheem all set for comeback on small screen,"This summer, children can spend time in ‘Dholakpur’ with their favourite Chhota Bheem, Chutki, Raju and Kaliya, as the series is making a comeback on the small screen after an interval of three years.

Fifty-two new episodes of the popular animation series created by a Hyderabad-based company will be aired on POGO TV channel.

Chhota Bheem, a game-changer in the country’s animation industry, is followed by more than 72% of Indian kids and its comeback will create more jobs for a decade, said Rajiv Chilaka, founder and CEO of Green Gold Animation Pvt. Ltd., which created the series. “After a break of three years, the popular animated television will be aired on POGO channel this summer,” Mr. Chilaka said while announcing the success of ‘Mighty Little Bheem’, Asia’s first Netflix original animated series which debuted across 190 countries in April last year.

Mighty Little Bheem, the story of a super-powered toddler, has emerged as a major attraction for kids worldwide and within the first year itself, it became the second most popular original kids programme globally to launch on Netflix after DreamWorks Animation’s The Boss Baby: Back in Business as well as the most-watched international show on Netflix in the USA in 2019, Mr. Chilaka said.

The latest series, which has no dialogues, was even highlighted by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings during a recent event in India where he said, “Mighty Little Bheem has been viewed by 27 million households outside India. Baby Bheem is going strong.”

Mr. Chilaka said it took them more than four years to convince Netflix, which later placed its trust on a toddler Bheem, a preschool spin-off based on the much loved Chhota Bheem, which was an ambitious project for the company. “We realised the opportunity, but also understood the challenges that come with creating a show that is truly global yet rooted in Indian culture,” he said.

With two seasons of Mighty Little Bheem with 49 episodes quickly becoming popular on Netflix, the team is working on releasing the third season. “Millions of kids across the globe are not sleeping without watching the Mighty Little Bheem, which will be aired on television screens in 2021,” he told The Hindu, adding that the world is indeed Little Bheem’s playground.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/bvqvk/article30589648.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HY17-2RAJIVCHILAKA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/chhota-bheem-all-set-for-comeback-on-small-screen/article30589640.ece
345,2020/01/17,Getting the insulin injection right,"Hyderabad is also known as a diabetic care capital of the country and endocrinologists have ‘Forum for Injection Technique and Therapy Expert Recommendations (FITTER)’ to communicate the correct insulin injection technique for better diabetes management, said president of Endocrine Society of India, Sanjay Kalra, who is also a consultant at Bharti Hospital at Karnal, Haryana.

“It has been 98 years since insulin was injected by Dr. Bernard Zinman on a boy named Leo Thompson at the Toronto General Hospital but patients are still scared of injections despite technological advancements to make it painless,” he said at a press conference on Friday along with Rakesh Sahay, professor and head of the department of endocrinology, Osmania Medical College and Osmania General Hospital.

Launching an awareness campaign on safe insulin injection practices organised by BD-India on ‘Insulin Injection Day’, the doctors said research has shown that most patients have been using the needle more than once and given injections within the same area causing lumps and leading to thickening of skin.

The golden rules of FITTER include: use fresh needles for every new injection; always inject into the healthy fatty layer under the skin; 4 mm needles should be inserted at 90 degrees angle; injecting the insulin into areas on abdomen, thighs, buttocks and upper arms – rotating injection sites so as to ensure it is used only once every four weeks, and check for lumps.

Crucial for diabetics

“For most people living with diabetes, insulin is an essential treatment and it is very critical that it is injected using the right technique,” the doctors said.

Oral intake of insulin treatment is still a long way off and injected insulin is going to be prevalent for some more time, they said. These awareness programmes are being taken to medical students, paramedic and nursing personnel apart from patients.

“Insulin therapy is a crucial part of diabetes management and we understand the importance of right insulin injection techniques as a maker of diabetes injection devices for more than 90 years now,” said managing director-BD India and South Asia, Pavan Mocherla.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/gz375f/article30589875.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hy17-injection,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/getting-the-insulin-injection-right/article30589630.ece

A resident of Lalaguda, Narra Akshay (20), is pursuing his engineering course from Nalla Mallareddy Engineering College.

Recently, the victim’s mother approached the police, stating that some unknown person was stalking and harassing her daughter on Instagram. Following the complaint, a case was registered and the accused was arrested on Friday.

To get acquaintance with the victim, Akshay created a fake Instagram account by hiding his identity and sent friend requests to random accounts, police said.

“When the victim accepted his friend request, he got her photos from the app and used them as display picture for his fake account. Later, he messaged her,” Cyber Crime police said.

As the victim did not respond to his messages, Akshay posted a morphed picture. “When chided for this, the accused sent a message ‘I need some help’ and again posted one more photo,” police said.

Even when she did not respond to video calls, Akshay got scared and deleted the objectionable pictures and fake Instagram account to hide the evidence.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/b-tech-student-held-for-harassing-friend/article30588068.ece

348,2020/01/17,118 kg synthetic manja seized,"Mobile squads constituted by the Telangana Forest department have confiscated a total of 118 kilograms of synthetic manja from various locations, a press release from the department said on Thursday.

The department has constituted six mobile squads to keep a check on the sale and purchase of synthetic manja during Sankranti in order to implement the complete ban imposed on glass-coated thread by the Telangana government under directions from the National Green Tribunal.

The squads conducted inspection of over 250 shops and establishments selling the banned manja, and recovered it.

Compared to previous years, the sale of manja has come down significantly, still it is being sold clandestinely by traders, the note said.

The manja has been banned after it has been proven to be fatal for not only birds and animals, but also humans.

Several birds died, and were found entangled in the thread on trees and poles, before being rescued by volunteers of animal welfare organisations.

The forest department with the help of NGOs and volunteers ensured display of posters in shops to create awareness about harm caused by the thread.

349,2020/01/17,Cyber crooks cheat Gulf migrant to the tune of ₹16 lakh,"An innocent migrant worker, Jangam Ashok in Kuwait, and his wife Muttemma in his native village Chepur in Armoor mandal, were cheated by cyber lottery criminals to the tune of ₹16 lakh last month.

They realised that they were conned only recently.

Ashok, left for Kuwait to work in an LPG supply company three years ago, leaving behind his wife and two small children.

Message

Last month, he received a message on his mobile phone from an unknown number informing that he won ₹46 lakh lottery, and that he would be given the amount in the form of a cheque, provided he pays ₹16 lakh in advance.

He immediately remitted ₹5 lakh to the account number he received in the message and told his wife to send the remaining amount after selling house and her gold jewellery.

She sent the amount to the account through a commercial bank in Armoor. As the family lost all their assets and valuables, whatever they earned in the lifetime, they approached the police for help. Crying inconsolably before press persons here on Thursday, Ms. Muttemma said that her husband left for Kuwait with the help of an agent by paying him a huge amount, which was borrowed at high interest rate.

He managed to repay the debt, and the family was slowly recovering financially, and then came the rude shock, she said. Telangana Gulf Welfare and Cultural Association president Patkuri Basanth Reddy, who presented the family before the media, said that of late, the cyber crooks are out to cheat gullible migrant workers in the name of lotteries by sending messages to mobile phones.

Appeal

He appealed to workers not to fall prey to such crooks and report it to the police immediately.

351,2020/01/17,Chief Secretaries meet deferred as AP CS expresses her inability to attend,"The proposed meeting of the Chief Secretaries of two Telugu States, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, to discuss pending reorganisation issues could not take place on Thursday as the AP Chief Secretary Nilam Sawhney expressed her inability to attend the deliberations owing to pressing engagements.

Though the Telangana delegation headed by the State Chief Secretary Somesh Kumar was prepared to attend the meeting, it was deferred as Ms. Sawhney said she could not attend the meeting as she was busy with the arrangements for the meeting of the high power committee on capital issue slated on Friday, followed by the meeting of the State Cabinet the next day and the brief session of Legislature starting on January 20.

The AP Chief Secretary, however, asked senior bureaucrat L. Premchandra Reddy, who is supervising the State Reorganisation Affairs, to meet Mr. Somesh Kumar this morning. Mr. Premchandra Reddy held deliberations on the pending issues with his Telangana counterpart K. Ramakrishna Rao during a meeting which lasted three-hours in the presence of Mr. Somesh Kumar.

The two officials described the meeting as a routine interaction on the pending issues, but it was learnt that the Telangana government had reiterated its stand on addressing the pending issues in line with the provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act 2014.

The division of assets and liabilities relating to the Schedule IX and Schedule X institutions figured predominantly during the meeting.

The Telangana government has reportedly decided to identify the issues that could be resolved through mutual acceptance and prioritise them during the next meeting whenever it is held. Senior officials said the State was prepared to attend the meeting as and when the AP Chief Secretary conveys her consent and “it is up to them to decide about the date. Complex issues like the division of assets and liabilities of 32 institutions not listed under any Schedule will be taken up subsequently,” a senior official told The Hindu.

These 32 are in addition to 13 complicated issues like division of assets and liabilities of erstwhile APSRTC, Deccan Infrastructure and Landholdings Limited (DIL), erstwhile State Finance Corporation, dues between power utilities of the two States and others.

352,2020/01/17,‘Name Palamuru project after Jaipal Reddy’,"The role played by the late Congress leader, S. Jaipal Reddy in the formation of Telangana and his key inputs that ensured that Hyderabad stayed with the new State of Telangana were recalled by several politicians here on Thursday.

Paying floral tributes on his 78th birth anniversary at the Jaipal Reddy memorial at Necklace road, they said his speeches in the Parliament showcased Telangana in the right spirit in front of the nation.

The Legislative Council Chairman, Gutta Sukhender Reddy said Jaipal Reddy not only played a crucial role in Telangana becoming a separate State but also helped Hyderabad get its Metro Rail project and funds from his ministry.

Telangana Congress working president and Malkajgiri MP, A. Revanth Reddy said all those who want to enter politics should seriously study the life of Mr. Jaipal Reddy.

353,2020/01/17,Coldplay goes experimental,"Somewhat hesitantly, I decided to play British band Coldplay’s new album Everyday Life. After totally loving their first two albums Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood To The Head, I found their later work rather inconsistent, trying to stick to a formula. Yes, there were brilliant songs like ‘Fix You’, ‘Speed Of Sound’, ‘Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall’ and ‘Hymn For The Weekend’, and their Mumbai show in 2016 was well-received. But because of a self-created mindblock, I didn’t expect much from their latest effort.

Pleasant surprise

I was misguided. The first thing I observed about Everyday Life is that it’s a complete departure in sound. The band has moved away from its trademark alternative rock, post-Britpop style to incorporate more global sounds, with some tracks having African, Middle Eastern and a dash of Sufi influences. The emphasis is more on producing solid songs, rather than stadium-friendly rock. The subjects revolve around war, crime, nostalgia, equality and religion, and one finds doses of gospel, jazz and new age. Indeed, for a band which started off on a positive note, and had its ups and downs, it required guts to experiment. Interestingly, this is also first Coldplay album to get a ‘Parental Advisory’.

What Everyday Life has in common with Coldplay’s earlier discography is Chris Martin’s vocal style. He’s in supreme form on ‘Daddy’, a gooseflesh-inducing piano-backed track which talks of someone missing his father, and the title song, where he asks, “What kind of world do you want it to be, Am I the future or the history?”

Sonic treasures

Divided into two parts ‘Sunrise’ and ‘Sunset’, the album has an assortment of sonic gems. With its vibrant horns and foot-stomping pulse, ‘Arabesque’ peps up the tempo. ‘Guns’ is a satire on America's weapons policy, and ‘Trouble In Town’ talks of racism and police atrocities. ‘Champion Of The World’ is about the power of dreaming. ‘Broken’ and ‘When I Need A Friend’ have a gospel touch.

While Martin’s keyboards are first-rate (check out the opening of ‘Children Of Adam’), guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion display versatility. A highlight is the use of back-up chants, especially on ‘Orphans’ and ‘Church’.

Despite its technical brilliance and the fact that it pushes boundaries, Everyday Life may not be everybody’s cup of tea. But that’s a normal reaction to blatant experimentation - either one accepts it or one doesn’t. Many popular bands like to try out new things. U2 did it with Pop, and Linkin Park with A Thousand Suns. The trick is to listen to such efforts with an open mind.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/gqeiae/article30588765.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/188810871---06072017---232528---GERMANY-G20-SUMMIT-CONCERT,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/coldplay-goes-experimental/article30588766.ece
354,2020/01/17,Spotify launches personalised playlists... for your pets,"Ever wondered whether your beagle would be down with Dr Dre? Or if your tabby cat would purr to Ritviz? On Thursday, Spotify launched ‘Personalised Pet Playlists,’ a new experience where the streaming service’s users can get an algorithmically curated playlist based on their tastes and their pet’s character attributes.

Each Pet Playlist includes around 30 tracks based on the listener’s preferences that their pet is more likely to enjoy given it is created based on their personality and characteristics. For example, an energetic dog might get a playlist with tracks that are upbeat while a shy cat might get something with slower tempos.

Before developing Pet Playlists, Spotify consulted with musicologist David Teie, a cellist with America’s National Symphony Orchestra, who pioneered species-specific music and composed two albums of Music for Cats, and he advised on the general likes/dislikes of each animal... for example, dogs don’t respond well to music in the lower register as it’s often viewed as a threat. While each playlist is algorithmically created, David’s expertise impacted how the algorithm was programmed.

The data

Spotify’s global online survey shows that 71% of pet owners globally play music for their pets, 8 in 10 believe their pets like music and most pet owners think music can help pets relieve stress, boost their happiness and keep them company.

Additionally, almost 50% of pet owners say their pet prefers certain songs or genres of music with classical and soft rock as the top picks. 53% of pet owners globally indicated they would pick their pet over their partner, if they really had to choose 70% consider the emotional wellbeing of their pets daily.

355,2020/01/17,Where experience made all the difference,"Ageing can also be a boon to the depth of a classical musician’s singing repertoire, more so for the worldly wisdom, he/she could use to enhance the scope of a composition. It was this emotional depth coupled with the inherent sweetness in N C Rangacharyulu’s voice that won the hearts of a limited audience at a concert held in Saptaparni. The Kodad-based veteran musician, a medico by qualification, was in town to perform for Sangeetha Ksheera Sagaram’s monthly musical series recently.

One needn’t always rely on long delineations to explore the various facets of a ragam — precision and brevity can be equally impactful too, proved the musician during his two-hour succinct concert. Packing in over 10 compositions by multiple vaggeyakaras, the precise swara prastharas, innovative manodharma and neraval made the evening an educative experience for many in the music fraternity among the audiences.

Opening a concert with a Saranga ragam kriti can be empowering for a rasika, especially in the case of Enta Bhagyamu for the brisk pace in which it is set. A composition where Thyagaraja calls himself privileged to be a devotee of Rama, the singer presented the bhakti rasa with impressive sincerity. A delightful sketch of the Sri Ranjani ragam dovetailed wonderfully into the rendition of another Thyagaraja composition Brochevarevare Raghupate. The manodharma with the various swara phrases leading to the opening line was a true testimony to the musician’s skill.

Siddhi Vinayakam, a work of Dikshitar that explores the glory of the Shanmukhapriya ragam to the fullest, is a great showcase of artistry for the way it explores bhakti in various contours and speeds. Thyagaraja’s Sobhillu Saptaswara in Jaganmohini ragam also creates a similar effect with its intriguing pace. Both these works demand an honesty that emanates from the soul and Rangacharyulu was all heart in letting the beauty of the composition come into the forefront, trusting the work without going overboard.

The importance of a familiar composition to sustain the momentum of a concert is often underrated — it felt like a homecoming when the seasoned vocalist took to Thyagaraja’s Bantureeti Koluvu in Hamsanandam, consolidating on a solid start with the neraval Ramanamamane. The mood turned into that of vairagya, with Mokshamu Galada in Saramati ragam (also by Thyagaraja) — the vocalist’s experience working just right for the composition’s emphasis on immortality, purpose to life and beyond.

Pantuvarali ragam became the point of focus with Thyagaraja’s Ninne Nera Namminanuraa, furthering a similar impact created by the previous composition. The ‘heavy’ phase in the concert made way for some pleasantness, thanks to the charm of the Begada ragam unveiled in the form of Dikshitar’s Vallabha Nayakasya. Several interesting literary devices within the piece (the alliteration, the rhyme scheme) were alluringly revisited through the soulful rendition.

The penultimate phase of the concert could have done with more medium/briskly paced numbers to ensure a holistic musical flavour to the evening. Nevertheless, Sri Narada Nada in Kaanada ragam wasn’t without its element of charm. Narayanathe Namo Namo got the audiences humming with the vocalists and the disciples. It’s this simplicity that has always been an asset of Annamayya’s works, the Behaag ragam doing its bit to adorn the poet’s lyrical charm this time.

N C Rangacharyulu’s singing through the evening was memorable for its accessibility to the amateur music learner and an accomplished musician alike. The three generations from the vocalist’s illustrious clan were present on the stage — including his son (N C Sundara Varadacharyulu on mridangam) and grandchildren (and disciples as co-musicians), portraying their love for the classical form. N C Anantha Krishna’s adaptive violin advances contributed to the musical appeal.",music,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/j2or7x/article30585855.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hyf17rangacharyulu-2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/the-hindu-friday-review-telangana/article30585857.ece

357,2020/01/17,Youth held on charge of marriage fraud,"The Perumbavoor police on Thursday arrested a person who allegedly cheated women of their gold ornaments and money after pretending to register their marriages.

The arrested is Abdul Rahman, 25, of Punalur. According to the police, the accused used to acquaint himself with divorced woman by securing their phone number through matrimonial sites. He then won their trust and got them to live with him by getting their names displayed at the registration office in the guise of a formality ahead of registering the marriage before fleeing with their money and ornaments.

He had four such marriages and was picked up from Tirur in Malappuram where he had been staying for the past few months allegedly hunting for the next victim.

358,2020/01/17,"Debris removal within stipulated time, says contractor","Prompt Enterprises, the official contractor for removing debris from the four implosion sites at Maradu, has clarified that it will shift debris within the stipulated time.

“We are hopeful of removing the estimated 76,200 tonnes of debris from the four sites within 20 days. As per the schedule, we need to start work only within 10 to 12 days,” said Achyut Joseph of Prompt.

On reports that the Aroor panchayat authorities had issued stop memo for the dump site at Chandiroor, Mr. Joseph said the company was yet to receive it. “The site was cleared by the technical committee appointed by the Government. We have already shifted around 500 truckloads of debris since December 12 when pre-blast preparations had started,” he added.

Company representatives said they were confident of lifting the stop memo while claiming that people living near the Chandiroor site had no issues with it and blamed the media for creating unnecessary controversies. “We also have alternative sites where debris can be shifted. Debris will be downsized immediately and will be handed over to medium and small enterprises involved in the construction sector,” they added.

Meanwhile, the Maradu municipal authorities said the contractor had one more week left to start removing debris from the blast sites. They have to obtain a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Pollution Control Board for the site selected for shifting debris.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/debris-removal-within-stipulated-time-says-contractor/article30580422.ece
359,2020/01/17,Minor scare for dialysis patients after power outage,"Patients undergoing dialysis at the Perumbavoor Taluk Hospital had a scare on Thursday when power supply snapped during the course of the procedure, and the generator did not kick in owing to an unforeseen snag.

The first batch of nine patients was undergoing dialysis when power snapped around 11 a.m., with nearly half-an-hour left for the completion of the procedure. Normally, the generator takes over automatically in the event of a power outage, which was not the case at the hospital, nor it could be manually made operational despite the best of efforts by the hospital authorities. They said the hiccup was completely unexpected as the generator was being periodically maintained.

“The agency people [in charge of maintenance] rushed to the hospital and initially found it to be a fault with the starter motor. Since they said it would take some time to rectify the fault, we decided to stop the dialysis prematurely by a few minutes as the UPS backup would not have lasted beyond 30 minutes,” said M.M. Shani, superintendent of the hospital.

However, a few patients experienced panic attack, fearing that the premature stoppage of the procedure would have an adverse effect on their health.

Some even complained of chest pain, but their vitals were found to be stable on examination. “There was nothing to worry since the dialysis had already completed three hours and was as good as over. Their concerns were baseless,” Dr. Shani said.

Eventually, the agency found the snag to be a minor one owing to a faulty battery, which they promptly replaced following which dialysis for the second batch of patients was conducted albeit with a little delay.

“We have all our equipment from dialysis machines, generator, air conditioners, and computers covered by an annual maintenance contract [AMC]. We spend over ₹70,000 on AMC for the equipment not covered under the maintenance provided by the Government,” Dr. Shani said.

The hospital has 10 dialysis machines serving 44 patients in two batches of nine each on alternate days. One more machine is to be added shortly using the corporate social responsibility initiative of a private company.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/minor-scare-for-dialysis-patients-after-power-outage/article30580415.ece
360,2020/01/17,Mobile skill vans to upskill tyre mechanics,"‘Mobile skill vans’, complete with tyre fitting equipment and manned by skilled trainers, will ply on highways and reach transport hubs as part of a drive to upskill and certify tyre mechanics in the State. The programme was launched by the Rubber Skill Development Council, the sectoral skill council for the rubber sector.

The state-of-the-art mobile vans were launched to upskill 3,000 tyre mechanics and certifying them till March 2020, said a communication from Automotive Tyre Manufacturers’ Association of India (ATMA) here early this week.

“Kerala is a major transport hub, and tyre mechanics play an important role in making road transport safer. Fitting of tyres, especially commercial tyres, is a skill-based job requiring formal training. The drive by RSDC will make road transport safer and competitive,” said K.N. Raghavan, executive director, Rubber Board, flagging off the van.

Instead of classroom training, mobile skill vans reach out to tyre mechanics. They move across villages and towns, creating awareness about the skills required and maintenance of tyres, the release added.

ATMA has joined hands with RSDC for the campaign. Training is being offered under the Centre’s Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme.

361,2020/01/17,Glitches at KWA plant hit tanker services,"A cable fault in the high-tension line of the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) at the Kerala Water Authority’s treatment plant at Aluva hit the services of private water tankers in Ernakulam on Thursday.

The situation eased after the district administration gave its nod for drawing water from private wells. Even though there was no official confirmation, private water tanker operators said they had received the go-ahead from the district administration to collect water from private wells for 10 more days. According to the KWA, water supply was disrupted between 4.30 a.m and 9.30 a.m.

Number of hydrants

The Legislative Committee on Petitions had reiterated at its sitting held at the collectorate on Tuesday that private water tankers could draw water only from hydrants operated by the KWA. It had asked the authority to increase the number of hydrants at its supply points after water tanker operators had complained that they were not able to meet the demand.

Even though water supply to apartments and commercial establishments was hit in the morning hours, it resumed after operators started drawing water from private wells. An office-bearer of an apartment association at Thripunithura said there was delay in getting the required amount of water. Operators said it was due to long queues in front of the KWA supply points. Moreover, operators have now hiked the per load fee to ₹2,200 from the earlier ₹1,200 for a load of 10,000 litres, saying that the KWA was charging ₹60 for a kilolitre.

Meanwhile, KWA officials at Aluva said over 430 loads of water (approximately 10,000 litres per load) were supplied to water tankers on Tuesday. On Monday, the corresponding figure was 360. There are nine hydrants at Aluva for supplying water to tankers. Two more hydrants will be set up soon, they added. Tanker operators are of the view that the demand-supply gap can be brought down by increasing the number of hydrants under the authority.

At Infopark

At the same time, the demand for industrial water at Infopark is likely to be resolved in two days. The district administration has assured that steps will be taken to resume water supply from the purification plant operated by Kinfra. Supply from the plant was hit after salinity levels in water drawn from the nearby Kadambrayar went up recently.

A senior official of the Infopark administration said efforts were on to reduce the salinity levels by releasing water from the Bhoothathankettu dam. “With restrictions on tankers being lifted for a few days, we hope the situation will be resolved. Infopark requires an average of 15 lakh litres of industrial water daily,” he said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/glitches-at-kwa-plant-hit-tanker-services/article30580401.ece
362,2020/01/17,PCB to make use of Maradu data for future research,"The State Pollution Control Board (PCB) plans to carry out a scientific modelling of air pollution data in the aftermath of the implosion of the four apartment complexes at Maradu.

The exercise is aimed at developing emission control strategies and health risk assessment.

The findings, which PCB Chairman Ajit Haridas describes as “rare and valuable”, will be used for comparative studies in the future. “For example, researchers can use the findings to estimate the difference between the quantity of dust generated during the demolition of an apartment and a flyover,” he told The Hindu on Thursday. The board is likely to engage a competent agency to come up with an inverse dispersion modelling to assess the quantity of dust generated after the implosion of the four apartment buildings on January 11 and 12.

Air quality

“The data on air quality levels after the demolition is available with the board. The inverse dispersion modelling will provide us with data on the quantity of dust generated following the demolition,” said Mr. Haridas.

Maintaining that raw data collected using equipment installed by the board near the blast sites will only give an estimate of the air quality, he pointed out that the inverse dispersion method would give an idea about the quantity of dust generated at the source of the implosion. “Now, the question is how much dust was generated. Such useful information can be used by others as well,” he added.

The board is of the view that the data will be key to adopting measures to mitigate the impact of demolitions of such magnitude. The data can be used to evolve strategies to meet challenges of air pollution caused by demolition of buildings.

The findings will also be used to address health issues caused by the spread of dust in areas close to blast sites. The findings are expected to be ready in two weeks.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/pcb-to-make-use-of-maradu-data-for-future-research/article30580396.ece
363,2020/01/17,SLMC seeks details from Maradu Municipality on debris management,"The State Level Monitoring Committee (SLMC) on Solid Waste Management constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Maradu municipal authorities to appear before it on January 21 to elaborate on the debris management plan following the implosion of the four apartment buildings.

The committee has issued notices to the Chairperson and the Secretary of the municipality to appear before it during its sitting to be held in Thiruvananthapuram. They will have to explain the steps being taken to manage the dust issue facing people living near the blast sites. The municipal authorities will be directed to come up with an action plan for the scientific management of debris as per the provisions of the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016, according to the SLMC.

The committee had earlier asked the State Pollution Control Board (PCB) to initiate steps to mitigate the impact of the demolition on the quality of air and water nearby. According to the Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, debris should be covered with sheets. Vehicles transporting debris should also be properly covered to prevent fugitive dust emission. Moreover, water sprinklers should be used at all points where waste is unloaded.

The authorities will have to monitor the movement of vehicles carrying demolition waste. Regular checking and maintenance of vehicles should be ensured. The transportation routes have to be identified after discussions with the civic authorities. Parking space for vehicles transporting debris should be earmarked. Regular water sprinkling has to be done on roads through which construction waste is transported to the designated disposal site.

In its letter to the Municipal Secretary, the board has made it clear that dust from the debris will spread if water sprinkling and other proposals as per the Construction and Demolition Rules are not implemented. In addition, the civic body will have to submit reports on a regular basis to the regional office of the board in Ernakulam on steps being taken to remove debris.

The PCB has also instructed the municipal authorities to remove debris that fell into the Vembanad lake after the implosion of the second tower of the Alfa Serene complex.

367,2020/01/17,Trouble far from over for Congress in Kochi Corpn.,"It may be a day of great relief for the Congress in Kochi as its nominees sailed through the elections to the three standing committees of the Kochi Corporation Council. But, trouble seems to be far from over for the party.

‘Defying party’

Congress may initiate action against Gracy Joseph, the chairperson of the development standing committee, who has defied the diktats of the party leadership to step down from the post. The party may consider a proposal to suspend Ms. Joseph from the organisation and move a no-confidence motion against her for her defiance against the party leadership.

Those at the party district leadership, who hoped that the councillor would eventually heed to the demand, said the organisation would not hesitate to initiate disciplinary measures if she refused to abide by the organisational demands.

No one could defy the party and take independent positions and every party worker would have to abide by the party decisions, said a senior district functionary.

Though A.B. Sabu and Shiny Mathew, chairpersons of welfare and town planning standing committees respectively, had stepped down as instructed by the party leadership to make way for others, Ms. Joseph refused to put in her papers. She decided to stick to the post by citing the defeat of the party nominee to the town planning committee. Ms. Joseph had stated that the party might lose the development committee too if she resigned.

Shocking defeat

Three weeks ago, the Congress nominee to the town planning standing committee suffered a shocking defeat after two of the Congress councillors voted for the Left Democratic Front (LDF) and another one wasted his vote in protest. Another Congress councillor could not exercise her franchise as she came late for the voting, thus leading to the victory of an LDF councillor to the committee.

The cross-voting and wasting of votes by the Congress councillors was part of their protest against the party leadership to remove Mayor Soumini Jain from the post.

The councillors had openly revolted against the party leadership against the move to oust Ms. Jain.

A CPI(M) woman councillor is likely to be elected to the chairperson post in the committee where the LDF has the support of majority members.

Power-sharing deal

The standing committees are being recast as part of a power-sharing agreement in the party.

The party had earlier arrived at an understanding that its standing committee chairpersons would step down after two-and-a-half years in office, paving the way for others to head the committees.

On Thursday, the Congress party managed to keep its flock together in the election and thus ensured the victory of its councillors Delena Pinheiro to the finance standing committee, P.D. Martin to the welfare standing committee and Vijayakumar to the works standing committee.

Mr. Martin is likely to be elected as the chairman of the welfare standing committee shortly.

The United Democratic Front (UDF) has 37 members in the 74-member council. The LDF enjoys the support of 34 members and the BJP, two. The two members of the BJP abstained from voting.

The Congress leadership had issued a whip to the party councillors on Thursday morning asking them to exercise their votes in favour of the party candidates.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/trouble-far-from-over-for-congress-in-kochi-corpn/article30580159.ece
368,2020/01/17,Clowning around with the classics,"A whopping century of shows and counting, could well be theatre’s version of the 100-crore milestone, and likely costing just a nano-fraction of that. At 110 shows over a little more than a year, Rupesh Tillu’s adaptation of a fourth century opus by Kalidasa, performed by a trio of clown-actors and titled Shakuntalam (Agar Pura Kar Paye Toh…), is now in the process of out-lapping itself. Beginning with the Laughter Per Kilometre initiative in 2018 that spawned the piece, as part of a set of plays by a selection of international directors, Shakuntalam has been performed across the nation — in several arts venues and NGOs, in plush living rooms and even rundown outhouses.

Fresh treatment

The production features Sagar Bhoir, Shreeram Chaudhuri and Ankita Nikrad — clowns in a travelling troupe who are called upon to perform ‘the play within the play’ from a script as large as a treatise they’re likely never to finish reading, let alone performing. Their frequent send-ups and departures, and foolhardy excursions into dramatic territory, coupled with a linguistic mangling of Sanskrit to the point of gibberish lends the piece its distinctive character, that is as familiar and derivative as it is fresh and original.

This is a low-fat production that relies on the raw amorphousness of performance. The absence of production values cannot obscure the grit and salt that allows the play to leapfrog over enterprises of supposedly greater sophistication. The actors build in a suspension of disbelief, knowingly acknowledging and disregarding entirely simulated spaces like the omniscient green room, or the wings. It is a minimalism that gives Shakuntalam its portability, and has perhaps contributed to its longevity at the turnstiles. The cast could do better on timing, pace and rhythm, because the material demands the taking of no prisoners with a certain gumption and sharpness. Yet, they do frequently spring disarming surprises with their otherwise great sense of space and the seasoned connectedness they have developed. Bhoir, specially, makes much of his dithering and disbelieving clown, finding those special nooks and crannies in his performance that give it flesh, heart and relatability.

Tried and tested

Tillu and his team are now planning to move on to clown versions of other classic plays, fulfilling the promise of the publicity art on display in Shakuntalam — presumably that of forthcoming attractions from the company the clowns belong to. The rainbow array of posters features telling (and often iconic) motifs from the plays in question. The meta-tastic possibilities include eternal favourites that might prove relatively easy to spoof, like William Shakespeare’s Hamlet or Girish Karnad’s Tughlaq, although their humongous casts of characters might spectacularly throw down the gauntlet for a troupe of ‘reduced’ proportions. There are also serious dramas like Mohan Rakesh’s Aadhe Adhure and Vijay Tendulkar’s Sakharam Binder in the mix, of which one might be hard-pressed to recall any spoof, let alone one with clowns.

The overwrought melodrama in Shakuntalam and its Sanskrit-era ethos seem made-to-order for the contemporary parody — these other plays would likely provoke other approaches. A prototype already exists for Shakespeare in plays by Rajat Kapoor, like Nothing Like Lear or Hamlet The Clown Prince, where clowning is of the essence most certainly, but darker territory is never shied away from, and ostensibly comic actors deliver nuanced dramatic turns.

Room for improvement

In Shakuntalam, the inherent regressiveness of the Kalidasa play is subverted by creating a gender-neutral turf of sorts, with Nikrad, Bhoir and Chaudhari positioned as equal players in the game, even if they don’t completely discard the trappings of stereotypical gender. There are running gags dealing with Shakuntala’s baby bump, for instance, or Dushyant’s woeful attempts at seduction. The humour comes through, but it all seems a little pat at times, and perhaps these perfunctorily ‘woke’ sequences could benefit from more bite. Often, small measures count only for a little.

It is not as if Shakuntalam should yield a feminist hero for the ages, but we could leave with a stronger sense of the woman in our midst. Nikrad’s stage presence and comic felicity signals a different outcome than the one the production delivers. Shakuntala isn’t merely a cipher, or a vessel for humour, but a character in search of a deliverance that she is highly capable of staking out for herself, if only theatremakers ‘allowed’ her the agency. Women clowns are sometimes trapped by a similar propriety, and the answer doesn’t lie in the sexually risqué, or in playing a spectrum of extremes – from coquette to ice-maiden.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/a4v5vw/article30588744.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18bm-Theatre-Column-Shakuntalam-by-Rupesh-Tillu,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/clowning-around-with-the-classics/article30588745.ece
369,2020/01/17,Sun is not set on the Parsi theatre,"Senior theatre practitioner Hema Singh is fascinated by Parsi theatre. As a writer, she has written about this tradition, which has played historical role to create the Hindustani stage, in depth. She has worked as a performer under the direction of the late B.M. Shah, former director of National School of Drama, as well as under the guidance of Master Fida Gussain “Narsi”, the legend of Parsi theatre. In fact, she played the vital role of Hemeeda in Pt. Radheshyam Kathawachak's “Mashriqui Hoor” with flying colours under the direction of Shah.

Another notable modern theatre practitioner of Parsi theatre is Nadira Babbar who retained some comic elements in “Yahudi Ki Ladki” by Aga Hashr Kashmiri with music score by Kajal Ghosh. These brief references are given to suggest that Parsi theatre was not only a commercial venture but it has vital elements which could contribute to the creation distinct Indian theatre idiom. With this background, it was a pleasure to watch Hema Singh's “Veer Abhimanyu” by Pt. Radheshyam Kathawachak, which the senior faculty at the NSD directed for second year students of NSD, presented recently at Abhimanch.

Ham acting and melodrama are essential elements of Parsi theatre, apart from use of several curtains which keep on changing with the change of scene to provide background for dramatic action. These curtains are painted mostly in garish colours. There used to be lapse of considerable time between the changes of scenes. To bridge this irritating pause, comic interludes were created to keep the audience in good humour. These interludes have hardly any relation with the main plot. Slick and visually spectacular, Hema's production did away with curtains and comic interludes. She has imbibed innovative elements from Shah's directorial treatment of Parsi theatre.

Hema's production reflects a modernist vision to be in tune with the aesthetic sensibility of modern audience. “Veer Abhimanyu” has a significant place in the history of Parsi theatre (1850-1950) which was written exclusively in Hindustani with elements of Sanskrit drama.

The set designed by Vishala Ramchandra Mahale, a graduate from NSD, created a metaphor for Chakravyuh – complex warfare strategy – with young Abhimanyu fighting with exceptional bravery against the united force of the Kauravas warriors. His design attempted to convey the thematic essence of the play by transcending realism, using expressionism and abstract imagery. There were ascending levels with stairs that linked the raised platform to the acting space down.

Upstage, there was a screen which indicated Veer Rasa through lighting effects and the all-round devastation created by the war. There are number of spaces enacting war scenes with multiple entry and exit points. With lighting effects, the action shiftted from one space to another swiftly, rhythmically and uninhibitedly.

Some of the scenes were enacted with remarkable finesse. One such scene was where veteran Kaurava warriors defeated by Abhimanyu break the code of war, resort to deception and kill an unarmed Abhimanyu.

The scene is enacted downstage with the display of martial art at its very best. With subtle lighting effect, the whole scene is transformed into surrealistic imagery that thrilled the audience. The scene where Jaydrath was killed was remarkable for evoking intense moods of revenge, hatred and despair. These contrasting moods produced a deep emotional impact.

Arjuna has taken pledge to destroy Jaydrath who is responsible for the death of his dear son Abhimanyu before sun set and in case he fails, he will offer himself to the burning pyre. In the horizon, the sun has almost set. There is gloom in the Pandavas camp. The pyre is set on the centre stage. Arjuna gets ready to fulfil his pledge. The Kauravas are in wild celebratory mood. Jaydrath emerges from his hiding, taunting Arjuna. Krishna smiles and tells Arjuna, “The sun has not yet set. Your target is just standing right before you.” The scene left the audience stunned.

The high pitch and exaggerated dialogue delivery form the style of Parsi theatre. It was toned down in the production under review. But still the essence of Parsi acting style was in evidence. Some of the leading male characters were performed by females. It was a thrilling experience to watch the young female students enacting war scenes, using martial art forms with a skill that highly impressed the audience.",theatre,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/ewbsky/article30586514.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/NSD5798,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/theatre/sun-is-not-set-on-the-parsi-theatre/article30586516.ece
370,2020/01/17,Hyderabad theatre group La Fiesta on staging ‘Silence! The Court Is In Session’,"“The whole experience has been just liberating,” starts Manasa Uppuluri, one of the actors in Silence! The Court Is In Session, a play directed by Dimple Ramchandani. Manasa, 19, plays Samant but beyond that, she says she cannot give details on her character. But she does add that working on a play about women empowerment in the 1960s helped her celebrate womankind even more than she usually does, adding, “It makes young people really think about how society receives and treats women through different eras!”

Manasa is one of the actors in La Fiesta, the theatre group at St Francis College For Women. So it seems apt that this timeless production is seen as a bar-raiser to the trying times for women.

The English play by Vijay Tendulkar has a Marathi counterpart Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe. The script has been translated into more than 16 languages internationally. A political and social satire, the plot centres on a travelling theatre group, one of whom does not turn up for a show in a village. A local stage-hand is asked to step in and what follows is a mock trial in a ‘court-room’ to test the skills and wit of the new cast member.

“The themes of the play are very serious,” explains Manasa, “but the language of the play makes it so that everyone can understand and possibly relate. And Dimple, who is making her directorial debut, really set a great foundation for the cast. She let us take in the script and connect with the themes in our own way, so working in rehearsals for the past four months has been time-consuming but so worth it. Honestly, I could not even tell it was her directorial debut, she was so natural.”

On the scene

Loving the ever-growing space for homegrown theatre writing, Dimple, 20, is looking forward to audiences’ responses and reaction to the play. “Working on rehearsals has been more cathartic than I’d like to say! I did not want my first project to be overwhelming for myself, and for the actors especially. Any theatre actor needs empathy; it’s about behaviour. I tell them that their character is their best friend to instigate that. Having all women starring in the play was very much a conscious choice, because we can address the women bashing that goes on in society.” So, why this play?

The young director responds, “I’m an ardent fan of Girish Karnad and Vijay Tendulkar so this play just spoke volumes to me, especially now when we need our voices to be heard.”

371,2020/01/17,Several crowd-pullers on day two of KLF,"Mamta Mohandas was one of the biggest attractions of day two of the Kerala Literature Festival. That may have something to do with her popularity as a leading actress of Malayalam cinema, but she showed what a capable speaker she was in the session on cancer.

A cancer survivor, she talked at length about her fight against Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. “And there was very little information about my disease available online,” Mamta said. “But now things have changed. Especially with the arrival of social media, cancer patients have started to talk much more openly.” The session also featured widely respected oncolgists P.V. Gangadharan and M.V. Pillai. It was just one of the several sessions that attracted huge crowds on the second day of the four-day festival.

Among the biggest crowd-pullers was Ramachandra Guha, who talked about patriotism and jingoism. Another attraction was the talk on climate and environment sustainability by the UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment Thani Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi. Navroz K. Dubash also spoke on a similar theme.

372,2020/01/17,‘Floods showed no one was safe from climate change’,"Thani Ahmed Al-Zeyoudi, the UAE’s Minister of Climate Change and Environment, is convinced that it is high time the entire world gave a serious thought to climate change.

“The threat is very real, though there are also people who attribute the recent disasters in climate to other reasons, but then, there could be two opinions on every issue,” said Mr. Al-Zeyoudi in an exclusive interview with The Hindu here on Friday. “The bushfires in Australia, hurricanes, droughts, floods ...these are all due to climate change.”

The young, articulate, US-educated minister, who was here for the keynote speech of the Kerala Literature Festival, stressed the point that the recent heavy rainfall back home in the UAE was also due to the climate change, though there was the view that it was due only to cloud seeding.

“It was because of a storm that went past the region,” he said. “And there was snow in Saudi Arabia a few days before that. How is that possible? There was cloud seeding only in the UAE.”

He said the UAE was taking climate change very seriously and had already invested heavily. “We are focussing both on mitigation and adaptation aspects,” he said.

“We have had huge investments on renewable energy. For instance, in 2009 we had only 10 MW; in 2019 we managed to have 1800 MW. We are aiming to have more clean energy in the UAE. We have invested more than 100 billions of dirham in renewable energy.”

He said the government was also taking enough precaution while allowing construction work. And that is something Kerala could relate to, given the recent demolition of multi-storey buildings at Maradu, Kochi. “Let me tell you something that I haven’t told anyone before: any project closer to the coastal area has to be above the sea level by 1.2 to 1.4 metre,” he said.

While talking about the impact climate change has had on Kerala, Mr. Al-Zeyoudi said he was impressed by the way the State responded to the floods over the last couple of years. “It was very commendable the way the Kerala Government and the public sector responded to the disaster so quickly,” he said. “The floods proved that no one was far away from the impact of the climate change.” While conceding that the process of nationalisation of jobs was very much on, he said there was no need for fear among workforce from Kerala and the rest of India.

“We still welcome the people from India to the UAE,” he said. “Of the 3.2 million Indians living in the UAE, 80% are from Kerala.”

He pointed out that the bilateral relations between India and the UAE had grown considerably over the last four years. “The close relation between India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed has been a big boost,” said Mr. Al-Zeyoudi. “From $180 million in 1970s, the trade between the two nations has jumped to $60 billion. We have to keep the momentum.”",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/lxo79p/article30589516.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17CTUAE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/floods-showed-no-one-was-safe-from-climate-change/article30589517.ece
373,2020/01/17,Second charge sheet filed in Koodathayi case,"The special police team probing the Koodathayi serial murders submitted a second charge sheet before the Thamarassery Judicial First Class Magistrate’s Court- II on Friday.

The charge sheet was filed against prime suspect Jolly Joseph for poisoning to death Sily, wife of Shaju Zacharias, Jolly’s second husband. M.S. Mathew aka Shaji, 44, and Prajikumar, 44, who allegedly helped Jolly in the murder named second and third accused respectively.

The charge sheet, running into 1,200 pages, has included 165 witnesses, including Sijo Sebatain and Shali Francis, brother and sister of Sily respectively.

Crucial statements

Staff Reporter adds: District Police Chief (Kozhikode Rural) K.G. Simon who led the investigation into the Koodathayi serial murder case on Friday said the statements of Sily Sebastian’s son and her two siblings were crucial in gathering strong evidence against Jolly Shaju in the Sily murder case. Sily was the sixth and last victim in the Koodathayi serial killing case, which was cracked by the District Crime Branch squad.

Mr. Simon told reporters that Sily’s son had directly seen the collapsing mother at a private hospital in Mukkom where she was admitted with suspected symptoms of epilepsy. “Though Jolly had managed to keep away Sily’s son during the well-planned murder attempt, the son, who became suspicious about her behaviour, came back to the spot,” he said.

Mr. Simon said it was the second attempt made by Jolly to kill Sily and she had done everything possible on her side to delay the medical aid. “The presence of poison had been confirmed in the first attempt itself but her family members had not taken it seriously. If it had been taken seriously, the life of Sily could have been saved,” he said.

Mr. Simon also said Sily’s husband Shaju Zacharias was unaware of the plans of Jolly and her desire to marry Shaju. In the investigation, it was also found that he had no involvement in the murder of Sily, he said.

It was in 2016 that Sily died in a suspicious circumstance. Her daughter Alphine too died in a mysterious circumstance in 2014. According to the District Crime Branch squad, Jolly killed Sily and her daughter for marrying Shaju Zacharias. Jolly got married to Shaju a year after the mysterious death of Sily.",kozhikode,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kozhikode/second-charge-sheet-filed-in-koodathayi-case/article30588182.ece

He said in a press release issued on Thursday said that certain news channels had misinterpreted his statement made in the afternoon. “They are airing reports saying that I had rejected the Chief Minister’s stand. I had only pointed out that the Government can only move legally in such cases,” Mr. Mohanan said. Both the Government and the party had earlier clarified that UAPA cases could be dropped when it came up before the judiciary. The party’s stand was the same in Allan Shuhaib and Thaha Fazal’s case too.

Mr. Mohanan alleged that the National Investigation Agency had taken up that case after pressure from Kerala BJP leaders.

Many of the excited foreign tourists who visited Alanganallur to watch the famed jallikattu on Friday were disappointed with the poor planning, which forced them to stand in long queues for hours together.

Jallikattu, a traditional sport of Tamil Nadu, has been on the list of must-watch events for many foreign tourists. In Alanganallur, a gallery is specially built for foreigners to watch the sport.

On Friday, around 150 foreign tourists, including those who had registered themselves with the State Tourism Department, came to watch the sport.

Virginia Masciello from Italy said she had come to India for the first time only to watch the sport. “I have heard a lot about this traditional sport and was very excited to watch this sport. But, it was very difficult to stand under the hot sun for more than two hours to enter the gallery,” she said.

382,2020/01/17,Tank overflows; farmers thank Collector,"TIRUNELVELI

When Collector Shilpa Prabhakar Satish recently went to inspect the overflow structure of Manur Periyakulam, one of the biggest irrigation tanks of the district getting water from Chittar river, a group of women accorded her traditional welcomewith ‘aarathi’.

Most of the irrigation tanks, including Manur Periyakulam, getting water from Chittar river, used to remain dry owing to badly damaged bunds, encroachments, waste and debris dumped along the river.

Farmers getting water from Chittar river, especially those having lands beyond Paavoorchathram, cannot start farming operations between June and September.

For the first time, Ms. Shilpa initiated removal of weeds and waste dumped along the river, flowing for about 86 km from Courtallam to join the Tamirabharani beyond Gangaikondan.

The district administration joined hands with Anna University in the exercise with the support of a few organisations and individuals. A team, led by G. Sakthinathan, Deputy Director of Anna University Constituent Colleges, Chennai, started the exercise from Courtallam on May 29, 2019. Desilting and cleaning of the river were completed for about 6 km at a cost of ₹3 lakh. “After witnessing the progress in the work, a few sponsors came forward to share the cost. With the help of sponsors and the farmers, the entire water course could be covered,” Dr. Sakthinathan says.

Ms. Shilpa negotiated with encroachers, who agreed to remove illegal structures.She repeatedly visited the spots where the work was going on and also the areas like Veerakeralampudhur, the starting point of the 33-km-long Manur channel taking water to Periyakulam.

As a result, Manur Periyakulam, with an expanse of 1,120 acres, is overflowing now to provide succour to over 4,000 acres in 30 villages under Manur, Madhavakurichi, Mavadi and Ettankulam village panchayats.

Whenever the tank overflows, farmers cultivate ‘pisanam’ and ‘advance kar’ crops. All wells in the region are also brimming with water.

The cows unite us,” he said.

Mr. Parthiban and his neighbours took part in a series of traditional games, including drawing kolams, tug-of-war, pallankuzhi and adupuliyatam, and organised a fashion show for cows.

R. Priya, who lives in Chennai and visits her native place during Pongal every year, said that her cow was dressed up as a deer and her friend’s cow as an angel. “The best dressed cow was given a prize – sweet rice. We also played with balloons and indulged in village games,” she said.

Participating in another similar event, S. Alagarsamy, whose family travelled from Bangalore to Alanganallur, said that he would never miss the chance to come back during Pongal. “In our cities, Pongal is prepared in a pressure cooker, and there is no greenery and space to play,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/ds2rse/article30582180.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ma17MattuPongal2jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/cows-steal-the-show-on-mattu-pongal-alanganallur-madurai/article30582181.ece
389,2020/01/17,Palamedu jallikattu event largely incident-free,"The Jallikattu event at the famed Palamedu in Madurai passed off largely incident-free, barring injuries to 25 people.

A bull belonging to Ramesh from Dindigul district was adjudged the winner. Tamer Prabakharan from Pothumbu near Madurai, who caught 16 bulls, was adjudged the best bull tamer and was given a car as a prize. Efforts made by the district administration and the police to enforce safety regulations imposed by the Supreme Court has helped in minimising injuries to tamers and accidents behind the vaadivasal (entry point to the arena).

A total of 2,000 policemen were deployed for the event and the arena was completely double-barricaded. “We have also ensured that only two members accompany each bull at the queue behind the vaadivasal,” said Superintendent of Police N. Manivannan.

Proper safety arrangements and regulation of bulls at the waiting yard has reduced the chaos behind the vaadivasal, said M. Elangovan, Honorary State Animal Welfare Officer, Animal Welfare Board of India. “They have also allowed bulls to the examination point in batches of 50. This has ensured that there are no accidents behind the vaadivasal. Also, through proper check, the officials have ensured that there are no duplication of tokens for the bulls,” he said.

There was sufficient water and green fodder available for the bulls. “This is the first time the district administration had erected shamiana for bulls in the holding area,” he said.

District Collector T.G. Vinay said that the number of tokens issued after the registration of bulls was restricted between 700 and 750 to avoid overcrowding of bulls. A total of 936 tamers took part in the event and each player was let into the arena after clearing necessary health check-up. The officials and organisers who were monitoring the event, largely ensured that the players who violated the rules were promptly removed from the arena.

However, owing to inadequacies in the regulation of the crowd and the bulls near the collection point,the place where the bulls exited the arena, a considerable number of injuries were sustained by spectators and bull owners near the spot.

Occasionally, bulls returned from the collection point to arena and at a point even four bulls were present at the arena. “Though police personnel were present at the collection point, the crowd swelled in the afternoon, and the wooden barricades were broken by them,” said M. Sarathkumar, a spectator from Alanganallur.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/8ka1oe/article30581586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PALAMEDUJALLIKATTU,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/palamedu-jallikattu-event-largely-incident-free/article30581587.ece

Jayakumar at Palamedu near here prepare large quantities of lemon rice, tomato rice, kuska and pearl millet porridge on the day of jallikattu. The spot for their stall changes every year, but the number of customers who throng their stall to taste the food items is only increasing.

“For us work starts as early as 1 a.m. on the day of jallikattu. All our family members work together to prepare large quantities of the different varieties of food. By investing some hard work and ₹1,500, we earn as much as ₹5,000 on this day,” says Ms. Radhika.

Theirs is not an isolated case. For hundreds of residents of Palamedu, the famed jallikattu event is one occasion when their cash registers are ringing.

Irrespective of what they do for their regular earning, these families set up food stalls on the day of the grand show. Most of the families in the village open food stalls, just on the day of jallikattu, says V. Gnanamani, a stall owner. “The main aspect is that the spectators do not have to travel for long to have food as they can easily get it. The prices are also economical,” he adds.

On Thursday, the streets were lined with closely erected food stalls. The visitors to the village on the special day had ample options at affordable prices at the food stalls – a mug of pearl millet porridge for ₹20, a pack of kuska for ₹30, etc. “We don’t see this as just a business option. We also consider it our responsibility to feed the guests who come to watch jallikattu in our village,” says Mr. Jayakumar.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/hc1pi1/article30581903.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MA17MDUBIRIYANI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/its-roaring-business-for-palamedu-residents-madurai/article30579778.ece

Addressing a rally organised by The Muslim Central Committee of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi at Adyar on Wednesday, Harsh Mander, activist and former IAS officer, and Shivasunder, human rights activist, alleged that the government after the Jammu and Kashmir and the Ram Mandir issue, was now focusing on having a Hindu rashtra.

Mr. Mander said the fight against CAA, NPR and NRC was to save the Constitution. Muslims in the country are Indians by choice, he said. “Humanity is my religion. In case the government wants to decide my religion on the basis of documents, I will register as a Muslim,” he said. Asking people to take up the fight against CAA on the lines of the Civil Disobedience Movement taken up by Mahatma Gandhi, Mr. Mander said the people’s fight would not stop.

Kannan Gopinathan, former IAS officer, said the Union government thought it could scare the people. But it can not succeed. The government was crossing its limits, he said.

Mr. Shivasundar requested the Opposition parties to take up the matter in the Budget session of Parliament. He alleged that the Centre was spreading lies on CAA, NRC and NPR. He said Home Minister Amit Shah should study the history of the country properly.

The rally was supported by 30 organisations, including the Congress and Muslim organisations.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/govt-trying-to-convert-india-into-hindu-nation-activists/article30588627.ece

Jio is focused on giving unmatched digital experience to consumers on a nationwide basis at most affordable price, and accordingly expanding network capacity and coverage to keep pace with demand. We are making good progress on the value unlocking initiatives announced earlier while building on sustainable growth platforms for our shareholders,” Mr. Ambani added.

409,2020/01/17,"Government has failed in e-mobility mission, says plea in Supreme Court","The Supreme Court on Friday sought the response of the government on a petition that alleges the non-implementation of the National E-Mobility Mission Plan, 2020 (NEMMP), which came out in 2012, that made several recommendations for the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), including electric-powered government fleets and public transportation and subsidies for those who opt for electric and zero emission vehicles.

A Bench led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde directed the impleadment of the Union Ministry of Surface Transport and Highways through its Minister Nitin Gadkari.

The petition was filed by NGOs Centre for PIL, Common Cause and Sitaram Jindal Foundation, represented by advocate Prashant Bhushan.

Also read: Electric vehicles: charging infrastructure needs a jolt to meet 2030 target

The petition contended that the governmental apathy has violated the fundamental rights of citizens to health and clean environment guaranteed under under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The government had failed in its obligation to mitigate the impact of climate change and air pollution partly attributable to emissions from vehicles that burn fossil fuels.

“Government's failure to suitably implement these recommendations is the direct cause of air pollution levels that have turned our cities into virtual ‘gas chambers’ having severe negative health impacts on the lives of citizens and especially those of our children,"" the petition said.

Transport vehicles are currently one of the biggest consumers of fossil fuels and more than 99.9% of transport vehicles in India are based on fossil fuels.

Taking cognisance of the evolving global scenario, the government, in 2012, came out with the NEMMP that provided recommendations for incentivising the adoption of EVs.

It had set a target of achieving a sale of seven million EVs by 2020 and thereby aimed to cut total carbon dioxide emissions by three per cent from the ‘do nothing’ scenario.

The recommendations pertained to providing demand and supply side incentives, the creation of requisite charging infrastructure, and the promotion of research and development for localisation and indigenisation. A government investment of Rs. 14,500 crore was called upon to realise the targets.

“Despite moderate targets, due to lack of implementation of the recommendations, as of January, 2019, only 0.263 millions EVs have been sold in the country thus far. Total allocation by the Union of India thus far has been woefully inadequate at Rs. 579 crore,” the petition said.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/90ih3o/article30586947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ELECTRICVEHICLE,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/goverment-has-failed-in-e-mobility-mission-says-plea-in-supreme-court/article30586948.ece

The proposed deal is subject to requisite government and regulatory approvals.

Under a binding term sheet signed on Thursday, the GM India legal entity, which includes the Talegaon facility, will be transferred to GWM.

In 2017, GM stopped production and sale of its cars in India and sold its first factory at Halol in Gujarat to Chinese auto major SAIC, which is now manufacturing its Morris Garages (MG) range of vehicles in India, namely MG Hector.

In September 2019, GM India signed an agreement with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to transfer its Bengaluru based technology centre along with 1300 employees.

And now the Talegaon plant its sole asset and the Indian legal entity is being sold to Great Wall Motors which has ambitious plans to enter the Indian market with a big bang.

Liu Xiangshang, V-P, global strategy, Great Wall Motors, said the transaction would underpin the company’s plan to enter and invest in India.

“The Indian market has great potential, rapid economic growth and a good investment environment. Entering the Indian market is an important step for Great Wall Motors’ global strategy,” said Mr. Xiangshang.

“It is also an important measure to respond positively to the Indian government’s national strategy of vigorously advocatingMake In India, Digital India and a ‘strong focus on clean energy in India’ and building a new India vision,” he said.

“Great Wall Motors’ investment will create more jobs, including direct and indirect employment, further enhancing the skill level in the auto industry; promote the development of the local supply chain, R&D and related industries; and contribute more profits and taxes to the government of India and the government of Maharashtra,” Mr. Xiangshang added.

He said Great Wall Motors will officially debut its Haval brand and GWM EV at the Delhi International Auto Show, and launch its Indian market plan.

The outright purchase of GM’s plant will enable the Chinese company to have an immediate head start and it can roll out its products without waiting for another two years to build a new plant. Great Wall Motor has booked 3,500 sq.meters space to showcase its vehicles in the auto show.

Julian Blissett, senior V-P, International Operations, GM said the Talegaon manufacturing facility had delivered excellent vehicles for domestic and export markets.

“Since focusing the Talegaon plant on manufacturing for export markets in 2017, GM has been exploring strategic options for the better utilization of the site,” Mr Blissett said.

“Our decision to cease production at Talegaon is based on GM’s global strategy and optimisation of our manufacturing footprint around the world,” Julian Blissett, Senior Vice President, International Operations, GM, said in a statement.

“On behalf of GM, I also want to express our gratitude to the government of Maharashtra and the government of India for their supportive partnership ever since we began to make investments and build cars in India. We will work closely with the state and national governments to secure the required approvals so that GWM can elevate production at the plant even further and maintain Talegaon’s status as a vibrant vehicle manufacturing region,” he added.

GM will provide a separation package and transition support for impacted employees, as well as an orderly transition for partners. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020.

Since 2017, GM has been manufacturing Chevrolet Beat which is exported to markets in Latin America and this will soon stop.

This comes after the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected telcos’ review plea to reconsider its decision on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR), that may force telcos to cough upto ₹1.3 lakh crore.

Vodafone Idea has AGR dues of about ₹44,000 crore while Bharti Airtel has AGR dues of about ₹34,000 crore.

Telcos can still file a curative petition in the apex court though it is done only to cure gross miscarriage of justice and analysts see very low chance of success.

With no relief on dues from SC, Jefferies Equity Research expect either the SC or government to provide relief in terms of payment options.

""We expect a moratorium on AGR dues for two years and staggered payments post that last over a period of time, aiding cash flows. This will be similar to the spectrum dues. We build this in our base case,"" said Jefferies in a research note.

According to Jeffries, even with the reliefs, AGR dues are a drag on Vodafone and will affect operations.

418,2020/01/17,Talking to the Prime Minister,"In the 1990s, when there was no social media, durbars (people’s court) were held by Prime Ministers at their official residence to lend a ear to the concerns and comments of common people. The janata darbars were held in the afternoons for an hour or so. People got an opportunity to meet and personally hand over their petitions to the Prime Minister. Depending on the Prime Minister’s availability, the darbar was held once a fortnight or once a month. People from all walks of life and all parts of the country attended these darbars. Not everybody got lucky given the Prime Minister’s limited time, but rarely did anybody get upset. In fact, many turned up only to see the Prime Minister from close quarters.

We reporters would take turns to attend these darbars. I had the opportunity of attending a few held by Prime Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

On darbar days, everybody had to go through security check and undergo frisking by the Delhi Police. The Special Protection Group (SPG) would instruct the crowd over the public address system to maintain order. People were randomly divided into groups and made to stand in three blocks in a horse-shoe formation.

Often I found stories from the people waiting patiently in the queue outside. They narrated their difficult journeys, purpose of visit, life’s hardships, and articulated hope. I gathered the issues people cared about most from these conversations and my ‘human interest story’ for the day would be ready. Besides, there was also the comfort of knowing that the Prime Minister was available to the media at other forums. The darbar was meant for the people.

After the Pokhran nuclear test in 1998 was announced by Vajpayee, his next darbar (held usually on Fridays) assumed significance. Specifying three questions to be asked of the Prime Minister, my Chief of Bureau told me, “Go as a commoner this time.” It was an outrageous request. In that crowd how could I go near Vajpayee, reveal my identity, and ask political questions? This was not a press conference. I was miffed.

As it happened, Vajpayee arrived late that afternoon and I found place in the third and last block of people waiting for their turn. The SPG kept the excited crowd at bay behind a thick rope as the Prime Minister walked on a path on the other side of the rope surrounded by another layer of security. Sensing my diminishing chances of an interaction, I suddenly jumped over the rope along with the photographer, all in the hope that the Prime Minister would answer my questions.

This shocked everyone as we had violated the protocol and landed ourselves right next to the Prime Minister. However, he did not flinch. Stopping and smiling he asked what the matter was. In 120 seconds I had his comments on our exclusive post-Pokhran questions. The unexpected honour of talking with Vajpayee was heady even as one of the SPG guards desperately tried to grab my hand and pull me back.

I wonder what would be the outcome of such an impulsive act today. It is a different matter that the Prime Minister is out of bounds and the Lok Kalyan Marg is now closed to the public.",comment,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/talking-to-the-prime-minister/article30577594.ece
419,2020/01/17,Should celebrities avoid political activism?,"Over the past few weeks, several actors have spoken out against the Citizenship Amendment Act-National Population Register-National Register of Citizens (CAA-NPR-NRC) as well as the attack on students and faculty in Jawaharlal Nehru University. In a conversation moderated by Radhika Santhanam, actor Parvathy Thiruvothu and campaign adviser Dilip Cherian discuss why so many celebrities are suddenly speaking up and whether their voices make a difference. Edited excerpts:

Parvathy, activism is not new in the film industry. We had film personalities protesting during the Emergency. Many also speak up about specific issues – you, for instance, have consistently been critical of misogynist dialogues in films, among other things. However, what is different today is that so many film personalities are speaking up across regions, which we have rarely seen in recent times. What do you think has pushed them to speak up against the CAA-NPR-NRC and the violence in JNU and other universities?

Parvathy Thiruvothu: The magnitude of the repercussions that may befall us is very scary. What has been happening in Assam and Kashmir and the lack of information from these places has really pushed their buttons. Even before debates began over the CAA, conversations within the industry had already started changing during the communications shutdown in Kashmir. When we all got together, whether at a dinner party or a casual meeting or even a work meeting, we would start talking about what was happening and what could happen next. I have to say that these kinds of conversations are not new in the Malayalam film industry; talking politics is not new. I’ve always found actors and directors discussing current affairs that affect our cause, within the industry. But whenever I stepped out of the Malayalam film industry, I found that current affairs had nothing to do with industry politics. That has changed this time.

Dilip Cherian: I think the issues are getting more relevant for all of us. What started out as small issues have become issues that fundamentally affect everybody. The reason more people — whether actors, students, or doctors — are stepping out of their comfort zones is that the issues are more visceral.

Two, the big difference from, say, 10 years ago is that today, whether it’s actors like Parvathy or celebrities like Deepika Padukone, they have very sensitive audiences beyond their films. And by this I mean their social media audiences. So, these audiences are talking back to them and they are able to listen to these voices, not just the coins of the box office. Malayalam cinema has always been hyperconnected to reality, but Bollywood is now feeling the change.

Three, some years ago if an actor was critical, he or she would stand out like a sore thumb. Today they find many voices joining them. Whether it’s Swara Bhaskar or Richa Chadha, there are people at the forefront.

And four, for the first time you have a serious agitation in the country which is being led by women. The voices of women are not going to shut up, I think, whether it’s in Shaheen Bagh or elsewhere. They are making a big difference.

Mr. Cherian, on the one hand, when there is a burning issue, you have people criticising actors saying they don’t speak up. On the other, when they do speak up, they are hounded for expressing an opinion that some may not like...

DC: Times have changed. Even five years ago, the risks of speaking out were higher. But today the risks are lower. If I were to advise a star on this issue, I would say that if you want to speak with conviction, there is room for it and there are enough people who will support it. Today the rules of engagement have changed. In fact, there is bigger danger in your being seen as someone who is either scared or unable to articulate an opinion. There are advantages to being seen and heard.

Parvathy, in what way does speaking up affect your career, personal life and image?

PT: Speaking up and the impact it creates is directly proportional to your popularity. When I spoke up 6-7 years ago, I felt that I could speak, go to work, and it wouldn’t matter. But once my movies started becoming successful, everything that I said got more airtime. That then started getting misinterpreted. My only paranoia was that I needed to be quoted right. Eventually more questions started coming in from my family and friends, and it all led to the creation of the WCC [Women in Cinema Collective]. Once that was formed, I felt support in speaking up that was never seen before in the industry. Of course, then you just don’t get the kind of opportunities you got before the Collective was formed and that was too evident to not notice.

Regarding this particular cause, friendships are ending. This is such an inhumane act, a state-sponsored act, it’s impossible to have a conversation with people who don’t see that at all. I believe this is the biggest — I can’t even call it a loss — revelation for me: how many people have suddenly realised where they stand. There is uneasiness in families too. If it comes to a state of Emergency, where would you stand?

As an actor, I have never had an image consultant. At any point, for all the causes that I’ve stood up for, I have always felt, if not this, I’ll do some other job. When Bollywood had maintained its silence for a long time, except for some consistent voices like Swara and Richa, there were few who asked me, aren’t you scared that if you speak out about the industry, which I did a while ago and about the films that were made, you will [lose opportunities]? And I said, that ship sailed a long time ago.

You said Bollywood had not spoken for a long time. Does the State where you work make a difference? For instance, the Pinarayi Vijayan government is also opposed to the CAA-NPR-NRC, so do you think it would be harder to speak up if, say, you’re an actor in a BJP-ruled State?

PT: Definitely. There have been arrests in Kerala as well, which is not commendable. However, I feel very insulated in Kerala speaking up than when I’m outside. It definitely makes a difference if a government is very clearly and vocally against… it gives you a little more strength in standing up. I have friends in Bengaluru who are scared to step out. We have to see how far that goes though. Allegiances change, anything can happen. But the public is holding the government responsible; they are watching.

Mr. Cherian, do you think the government could have done anything differently to protect its image this time?

DC: As far as the content and intent are concerned, they have been consistent and there is not very much they could have done. But it would have truly helped if they had a willingness to listen, instead of talking only in absolute terms that there is no compromise on this. If you do that, the image you’re creating is that of a hard-nosed government, one that is unflappable, one that does not want to be influenced by contrary opinions. The belief that the government is working with is this: we won with a landslide majority, therefore most of the public is with us. They don’t recognise that their [NDA’s] vote share never went above 45%. If the government was conscious about its image, it would trot out people with a more conciliatory tone, not confine it to just the hardliners who are speaking out.

The government did host a dinner for celebrities to discuss the CAA.

DC: The fact is that they opted for that route after a lot of protests had happened. Sometimes, too little, too late can be detrimental rather than actually helping your cause. Talking to relatively junior voices is not going to [reduce] people’s fears or anxieties. When emotions are high, you need to be able to placate people with a suitably senior voice.

Parvathy, does it help a cause when celebrities speak up or do you think it’s just a passing phase since the news cycle too keeps changing?

PT: Yes, the news cycle keeps changing and it breaks my heart. But that is not something celebrities should be thinking about. Their voices have to be consistent. Cinema and celebrities have a huge influence in our country. I have spoken up not just against harassment of women, but also the rampant Islamophobia that is being shown in popular culture. That is seen as okay; it is not discussed at all. That’s added to the collective psyche of a lot of people. They keep saying, “But Muslims this, Muslims that…” So, we have to give the spotlight to an issue again and again. We may not be able to step out on the streets every day, but the virtual revolution is impactful in the long run and we need to keep that momentum going. It’s all or nothing at this point; there is a lot at stake and you need to be able to put everything at risk.

DC: There is a danger that the news cycle may shift but I think celebrities play a big role in ensuring that an issue comes back into the picture. Celebrities have the power to change dramatically the visuals of what’s going on. Today we are no longer in an age where commentary or the written word is dominant; it is visuals. An actor turning up at an event changes the entire dynamic of its being reported and people on social media watching it. Twitter warriors are almost as relevant as anybody else. Also, you’re talking today of being able to keep a big issue in focus and I think that as long as there are people protesting on the street, there is a role for everybody else, including the media, to keep it as something that is worth covering.

After Deepika’s visit to JNU, her Instagram profile was full of disappointed and angry comments. Others on Twitter threatened to boycott her film. For an actor, especially before a film, the most important people are their fans. What would you say, Parvathy, to actors who are perhaps scared of losing this fan base?

PT: The fact that a woman is speaking up becomes an issue. If she is not speaking about something related to vanity or her body, or her likes and dislikes, she is criticised heavily. By speaking up constantly on mental health, Deepika has really changed the stigma surrounding the issue. Deepika is followed for her outfits, airport looks, her films and in that manner she has very effortlessly carried her followers to JNU. All the people who used to follow her for that are very uncomfortable because they have probably been turning a blind eye to the issue. But now they can’t. This discomfort will definitely generate a lot of ire among her followers. There will be a lot of filtering. But I feel that it is better to have a well read, well aware, politically aware fan following than the other way round. Very slowly the numbers of those fans will increase. Initially, when I was speaking up, there were very few supporting me. There were theories floating about me then. But when I kept speaking up, what became clear was that I am speaking up for the cause. That eventually gets you your fan following back. Entertainment isn’t something that people are going to let go off very easily. I wish for people who have spoken up to just wait till that filtering stops.

420,2020/01/17,Preventing mob lynching,"The spate of incidents of lynching over the past few years has led to a heightened sense of insecurity among the marginalised communities. Though no data has been compiled by the NCRB of the number of cases of lynching in the country since 2015 for reasons unknown, the figures reported by various sections of the media are troubling.

In 2018, the Supreme Court described lynching as a “horrendous act of mobocracy”. The Court exhorted the Centre and State governments to frame laws specifically to deal with the crime of lynching and laid down certain guidelines to be incorporated in these laws including fast-track trials, compensation to victims, and disciplinary action against lax law-enforcers.

State laws

In this backdrop, the Manipur government came up first with its Bill against lynching in 2018, incorporating some logical and relevant clauses. The Bill specified that there would be nodal officers in each district to control such crimes. Police officers who fail to prevent the crime of lynching in their jurisdiction are liable to be imprisoned for a term that may extend from one to three years with a fine limit of ₹50,000. Additionally, no concurrence of the State government is required to prosecute them for dereliction of duty.

It devolves upon the State to protect victims of mob violence and witnesses from any inducement or coercion apart from initiating schemes for rehabilitation and setting up relief camps where a community is displaced. The law provides for adequate monetary compensation to the victims or their immediate kin.

The Rajasthan government passed a bill against lynching in August 2019, not a moment too soon, given that according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal, “After 2014, 86% cases of mob lynching reported in the country happened in Rajasthan.” However, not only has the government accepted only a few guidelines issued by the apex court, but is also silent on any action to be initiated against police officers who may be accused of dereliction of duty.

West Bengal came up with a more stringent Bill against lynching. Punishment for lynching to death is punishable with the death penalty or life imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹5 lakh. West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has invited the Chief Minister and leaders of all legislature parties for a meeting this month to discuss the Bill. Most other guidelines of the Supreme Court have been adopted by the State.

What the Centre can do

While adopting the guidelines, the Centre would do well to incorporate sections in the law for penal action against doctors who stand accused of dereliction of duty, for delay in attending to victims of lynching, or submitting false reports without carrying out a proper and thorough medical examination of the victims, either under coercion by the police or due to their own prejudice against the community or religion of the victims. Under the compensation scheme for the victims, the amount to be paid to the victims should be recovered from the perpetrators of the crime or collective fines be imposed on the villagers where the lynching takes place.

While framing the laws, the Centre could even provide for punitive action against political leaders found guilty of inciting mobs. Until a zero-tolerance attitude is adopted in dealing with mob lynching, this crime will continue to show a rising trend. Punitive action to be taken against police officers accused of dereliction of duty, as incorporated in the law enacted by Manipur government, could be replicated in the Central law too as it would deter police officials acting in a partisan manner in favour of the lynch mob.

421,2020/01/17,"Of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Chinese dreams","The landslide re-election victory for the Democratic Progressive Party’s (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan earlier in January has presented Beijing with a second pressing challenge in its backyard. In late-November, pro-democratic political parties swept the local district council elections in Hong Kong, which were widely seen as a referendum on the protests that have roiled the Special Administrative Region since June.

On the surface, Taiwan and Hong Kong may seem to have little in common. Unlike Hong Kong, which returned to China’s fold in 1997, Taiwan has been entirely self-ruled since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek fled to the island to set up the ‘Republic of China’. Also, unlike Hong Kong, Taiwan has a thriving democracy and has held direct elections to choose its leaders since 1996 — incidentally, one of the five demands voiced by the tens of thousands who have taken to Hong Kong’s streets in recent months.

A referendum on China

Differences aside, the events in Hong Kong and Taiwan are not entirely unrelated. If the local elections in Hong Kong were a referendum on the protests, the DPP and Ms. Tsai made sure the elections in Taiwan ended up becoming a referendum on China — and specifically, on the “one country, two systems” model that is at the centre of debate in Hong Kong, and is seen by Beijing as an eventual solution to the ‘Taiwan question’.

One of the DPP’s most evocative campaign advertisements, which aired on television three days before the polls, drew a contrast between the daily life of a young Taiwanese and that of a young Hongkonger. As one slept peacefully on the train ride home from work, the other was on the streets evading tear-gas and riot police. Protect democracy, it urged voters, or Hong Kong’s future awaits.

Earlier this year, Ms. Tsai was trailing in the polls and looked set for defeat, but the events in Hong Kong revitalised her campaign. She has been outspoken in her support for the protesters. No surprise that since coming to power in 2016, Beijing has gone after Ms. Tsai, accusing her of pursuing a pro-independence agenda and making no secret of its preference for a Kuomintang (KMT) return. The KMT had pushed closer economic relations with Beijing. It backed a first-of-its-kind economic cooperation agreement in 2010, and the then-leader Ma Ying-jeou, whose term ended in 2016, held a landmark meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015.

With Ms. Tsai on the other hand, Beijing has pushed with even more vigour an international strategy aimed at isolating Taiwan. By the end of 2019, Taiwan was left with only 14 UN member states that maintain diplomatic relations, after losing the Solomon Islands and Kiribati which both shifted to recognising Beijing. With every year, the list grows shorter.

Yet Beijing’s pressure, in some ways, worked to Ms. Tsai’s advantage and reinforced her campaign’s message, as she swept home with 57% of the votes. In her victory speech, she said this election’s results “carry an added significance, because they have shown that when our sovereignty and democracy are threatened, the Taiwanese people will shout our determination even more loudly back.” Ms. Tsai said that through Beijing’s “increasing pressure and proposal of a ‘one country, two systems’ model for Taiwan, China has hoped to force us to accept conditions that are entirely unacceptable.”

Where does this leave the future of “one country, two systems”? While Ms. Tsai sees the election as a resounding rejection of the model, Beijing sees things differently. Indeed, during a December visit to Macau to mark the 20th anniversary of its return to China, Mr. Xi said, “Macau’s successful experience speaks volumes about the viability and strength of one country, two systems, as long as we are committed to it and act on it”.

Mr. Xi’s remarks were seen as being directed at Hong Kong, but carried relevance for Taiwan as well. Mr. Xi outlined what he viewed as the core of the model, which was “recognising that ‘one country’ was the premise and precondition for ‘two systems’.” Apparently drawing a contrast with Hong Kong, Mr. Xi praised the people of Macau for “standing by the red line of the ‘One China’ principle” and having a “tradition of loving the motherland, as well as a strong sense of national identity, belonging and pride”. The problem for Beijing is that fewer and fewer people, both in Taiwan and Hong Kong, appear to share this view that elevates “one country” over the “two systems” part of the formula. The recent election results in both territories make that clear, as do polling data that show delicate shifts in how Taiwanese and Hongkongers view their relationship with the mainland.

Sense of autonomy

Polls conducted in Taiwan by the National Chengchi University in June 2019 showed that 56.9% identify as being only ‘Taiwanese’, up from 54.5% a year earlier, the first time that number had increased since a 60.6% peak in 2014. While 36.5% identify as being Taiwanese and Chinese, 3.6% identify as only Chinese. On the choice between independence and reunification, 86.1% favoured maintaining the status quo. Within this group, 26.9% preferred to maintain the status quo indefinitely, 19.9% preferred to maintain the status quo and move towards independence (up from 15.1% in 2018) while 8.7% wanted eventual unification (down from 12.8%). A poll conducted at the same time by Hong Kong University found that the number of people who identified only as ‘Hongkongers’ was the highest since the 1997 handover, at 53%. While 23% identified as “Hongkongers in China”, 11% identified as Chinese and 12% as “Chinese in Hong Kong”. These may seem to be subtle differences, but they have consequences. A record 71% said they were not proud of being a national citizen of China, a number that went up to 90% among the 18-29 age group.

China’s leaders believe that the country’s “great rejuvenation”, which Mr. Xi has declared as the “China dream”, will not be complete without Taiwan’s return, for long the holy grail for the Communist Party. They believe the tide of history is on their side, and that the island of 23 million people (roughly the population of Beijing) will inevitably return to the fold.

They may be right, and perceptions can, no doubt, change. Yet, if Beijing wants them to move in a favourable direction, the results have shown it will probably need to offer more than the stability, security, and economic growth that its model promises, when issues of identity and values are involved. At a time when China’s leaders have spoken confidently of offering “the China model” as a solution for the world, what better evidence to offer than show its flexibility when faced with challenges closer to home?

422,2020/01/17,Talking of Kashmir: on China raising Kashmir issue again at UNSC,"For the second time since the government’s decision on Article 370 in August last year, China raised the issue of Kashmir at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday, prompting a protest from New Delhi. In its response, the government said that Beijing should “refrain” from bringing a bilateral issue into the UNSC, and accused China of working at Pakistan’s behest. New Delhi’s response also pointed to the “overwhelming majority” of Security Council members being opposed to the Chinese reference on conditions in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), which resulted in a lack of consensus for any kind of statement at the end of the meeting. India’s case rests on the 1972 Shimla accord, where India and Pakistan agreed to resolve the Kashmir issue bilaterally. China’s repeated raising of Kashmir since last August, which includes an aborted attempt in December, is unconstructive and will impact the India-China bilateral relationship if it continues. It is also unlikely to push the government, which has already defied several international calls from friendly countries, into lifting restrictions or rolling back its measures in Kashmir. Given that New Delhi has refrained from raising similar issues over Tibet, Xinjiang or Hong Kong, it is unfair on the part of Beijing to take its concerns to the international stage, especially since President Xi Jinping didn’t officially raise such concerns while visiting India in October.

While China’s move may be unwarranted, it is yet another reason for New Delhi to take heed of the continuing and unprecedented criticism of its actions in Kashmir. Prior to August, the last time Kashmir was raised at the UNSC format was in 1971; it has since been raised twice within a period of five months. China may have found no takers for a statement, but the fact that it was allowed to raise the issue at the UNSC cannot be brushed away. Nor can India maintain the duality of insisting, on the one hand, that Kashmir is a bilateral issue and, on the other hand, rejecting all bilateral talks with Pakistan. At some point, the government must push for normalisation of ties with Pakistan as well as for the lifting of restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir. In the past few days, it seems the government has decided to review some of its decisions taken in August: it has released political prisoners and restored 2G connectivity to select places; it has also taken one group of envoys to Srinagar and Jammu, and is making plans for 36 Cabinet Ministers, who have not visited the region yet, to travel there. These measures, however, must not come in dribs and drabs, but must be comprehensive. Only when all communications are restored, all political prisoners freed and added security restrictions removed can the real task of healing in J&K even begin.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/talking-of-kashmir/article30578626.ece
423,2020/01/17,"One Cup too many: on bid to merge ATP, Davis Cup","The inaugural ATP Cup ended on Sunday in Sydney with Novak Djokovic-led Serbia defeating Rafael Nadal-led Spain. The new, ambitious 24-country team tournament was considered a resounding success, for it attracted nearly all of the world’s best — except Roger Federer — and culminated in a heavyweight final. That Nadal, the world’s best male player, took on Djokovic, the No.2, in the summit clash just about set the perfect tone for the season’s first Major, the Australian Open, which starts next Monday. But for all the on-court highs, serious questions have been raised about the competition’s viability in an already-crowded tennis calendar. It was only last November that the Davis Cup, steeped in history, came out of a time warp and morphed into a similar one-week, 18-team, single-venue competition. Two such events within six weeks of each other will lead to a huge incursion into the players’ off-season and can cause spectator fatigue. This was echoed by none other than Nadal and Djokovic, who played their hearts out at both the Davis Cup and the ATP Cup, and yet called for the two marquee tournaments to merge.

The root of the problem lies in the fact that tennis suffers from a multitude of governing bodies that do not see eye to eye. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which controls men’s tennis and also the official men’s rankings, is the brain behind the ATP Cup and thus decided to award important ranking points for the event. The Davis Cup, run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), does not have that luxury. In fact, awarding ranking points for such team events is inherently flawed, for it doesn’t provide a level-playing field. Andrey Rublev, ranked No.18, didn’t make the Russian team for the ATP Cup because Daniil Medvedev and Karen Khachanov were ranked higher. But Greece’s Michail Pervolarakis, ranked 483, featured because he was the country’s next best player after Stefanos Tsitsipas. The flagship tournament has also had negative consequences for India. The coveted start-of-the-season slot, which was earlier reserved for three ATP 250 level tournaments in Brisbane, Doha and Pune, is now the ATP Cup’s. Brisbane is one of the venues for the ATP Cup and such is Doha’s monetary heft that it can still attract players. But Pune has had to push its dates by a month and, unlike in recent times, stares at the prospect of not featuring a single top-20 player. The spirit of tennis has for long been overwhelmingly global. But with top players increasingly ready to embrace events that pit nation against nation there is no shortage of nationalistic fervour. It is this sentiment that the ATP Cup is seeking to tap into. But sans any clear vision it is sure to turn into an overkill.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/one-cup-too-many/article30578660.ece
424,2020/01/17,Building bylaw violations will attract double property tax,"Those who have constructed buildings in violation of bylaws will have to pay double property tax in Bengaluru with the State Cabinet on Friday giving approval for amending the Karnataka Municipalities Act.

Briefing mediapersons after the Cabinet meeting, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said the doubling of property tax would apply to only that portion of the built-up area that has been built in violation of bylaws.

He said such powers had been so far granted to all municipal bodies in the State barring Bengaluru. However, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahangara Palike will now get the power to slap double the property tax on violators as soon as a notification is issued in tune with the Cabinet’s decision, he explained.

He also made it clear that slapping double property tax did not mean that the government had approved the violation. Such owners would have to pay more property tax as a penalty till a decision is taken by the government on unauthorised structures, he said.

Mr. Madhuswamy denied that the measure was an exercise by the cash-strapped BBMP to raise revenue.

The show, dedicated to Swami Vivekananda on occasion of the saint’s 157th birth anniversary, drew the young and old. From sayings and messages to the famous speech he made in Chicago, Swami Vivekananda’s important milestones, from birth till death, are on display.

Mr. Yediyurappa urged school students and citizens to visit the botanical garden. The flower show is being organised with the main intent of creating awareness among the youth about the city’s distinct culture and heritage, he said adding that the show had received world-wide recognition.

Children dressed up as Swami Vivekananda were seen at the flower show. “I recently read a book about Swami Vivekananda and I was moved by his thoughts. He is a great inspiration and worth emulating,” said 12-year-old Harsh Vardhan. “The saint’s birth anniversary is more like a celebration for us. Since we cannot travel to Kanyakumari, we have come here with the children dressed up as Vivekananda,” said Shashi Gowda, who had come from Ramakrishna Ashram in Hanumanth Nagar.

426,2020/01/17,App to streamline CSR contributions to government schools,"The Department of Primary and Secondary Education has decided to develop an app to meet the needs of government schools under CSR programmes and bring in transparency among donors.

The Nanna Shale - Nanna Koduge (My School, My contribution) programme aims to provide accessibility to donors across the globe. The objective of the app, according to department officials, is to develop a sense of ownership among the public, alumni and stakeholders, and strengthen the public education system.

The app will have a window for donors and another for schools. Once a donor has logged into the app, he/she will get a list of schools on a need-based format. Once the donor selects a school, he/she will have an option to donate money or material.

The app aims to provide easy and quick access to schools without any human interface, and there would be fixed timelines for effective utilisation of donations. The department will have a redressal cell at the head office. The names of donors will be up put at a prominent place on the school premises, and in case of major contributions, the structure would be named as per the donor’s wish, officials said.

Aparupa Negi, manager of the programme management unit (PMU), which manages all the department’s CSR programmes, said that in the last two years, they have mobilised nearly ₹150 crore from 60 companies. She said that corporates as well as non-governmental organisations have invested in infrastructure, digital classrooms, scholastic programmes, learning centres and the breakfast meal programme. The UNDP had come forward to conduct a career counselling programme for students.

Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar, who had a meeting with representatives from the corporate sector and NGOs on Friday, appealed to them to help government schools, particularly in north Karnataka that were affected due to floods.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/app-to-streamline-csr-contributions-to-government-schools/article30588599.ece

428,2020/01/17,Maharashtra Mandal in Bengaluru celebrates centenary,"Maharashtra Mandal, a socio-cultural forum of people from Maharashtra in Bengaluru, is celebrating its centenary celebrations on January 19 at Palace Grounds. The mandal was started in 1920 and completes a century this year.

A few Maharashtrians came to Bengaluru in late 19th century to survey the Mysore State and settled in Basavanagudi. One of them, Baburao Joshi, and his colleagues started the mandal as they were missing their home state and culture.

Maharashtrians came to Bengaluru in two other waves in 1960s to 1980s to work in Public Sector Undertakings and again post 2000 to work in the Information Technology industry, explained Abhay Dixit, chairman of the centenary celebration committee.

“We estimate around 2.5 lakh Maharashtrians are there in the city today,” he said. Cricketer Rahul Dravid has been a life member and patron of the mandal in the city, he said.

Despite tensions between Karnataka and Maharashtra, the mandal has never been caught in the crosshairs, he said. “Kannadigas have always been hospitable. And the mandal have resolutely remained cultural and have stayed out of politics. It is beyond the comprehension of common people like us,” said Mr. Dixit.

The centenary celebrations on Sunday will feature a music programme by popular Marathi singer and music composer Avadhoot Gupte and a conversation with popular actor Sachin Khedekar.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/maharashtra-mandal-in-bengaluru-celebrates-centenary/article30588477.ece
429,2020/01/17,NCW wants speedy execution of rape convicts,"The National Commission for Women (NWC) is planning to write to all the State governments and the authorities concerned to amend the jail manuals so that execution of rape convicts is not ‘deliberately delayed’, said Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women (NCW).

Speaking to mediapersons on the sidelines of ‘Know your POSH eco-system’, a conference on sexual harassment at workplace organised for IT companies by Metis POSH Consulting Service, on Friday, she said, “Justice delayed is justice denied. There has been too much delay and impediments in hanging the four men found guilty in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case. Mercy should be shown to the parents of the victim, and not the convicts,” adding that their execution would “send a strong message and act as a deterrent.”

“Such delaying tactics should be taken into consideration and all such loopholes should be cleared. This is a practical problem that needs to be addressed immediately,” she said.

The Delhi Prison Rules of 2018 says that there has to be a minimum of 14 days’ gap between rejection of mercy petition and the date of execution. “This is being misused by convicts and their counsels,” she said.

‘Internal committees not up to the mark’

Speaking at the conference on prevention of sexual harassment at workplace, she said that the working of internal committees in companies is not up to the mark. “As per my experience, 30% of cases relating to workplace sexual harassment are false. This has had a negative impact on genuine cases,” she said.

She also said that clauses, such as compromise and compensation, should be removed from the Act, which were not only unethical but also led to false complaints.

Accepting that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013 needs to be updated, she said that the NCW would soon convey the necessary changes to the Centre.

Arpita Sen of Exide Life Insurance Company Limited said that the spirit and background of the legislation should be taken into consideration as mere compliance with law does not take us anywhere. “The situation in urban and rural areas, in multi-nationals companies or manufacturing industries, will be different. However, the Act does not speak about such specifications,” she said.

She said that the definition of sexual harassment should be changed, and matters such as consensual relationships going bad should be dealt with sensitively.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/ncw-wants-speedy-execution-of-rape-convicts/article30588271.ece

431,2020/01/17,Six arrested for attack on RSS activist after pro-CAA rally in Bengaluru,"City police have arrested six activists allegedly associated with the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) for the attack on Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) activist Varun Bhoopalam, 31, on December 22, shortly after a pro-CAA rally near Town Hall.

City police commissioner Bhaskar Rao said at a press conference that the alleged SDPI activists had also planned to kill leaders at the rally, but were deterred by the heavy police presence at the rally, prompting them to attack Mr. Bhoopalam in Kalasipalya on his way back home.

Bengaluru South BJP MP Tejasvi Surya and Yuva Brigade founder and BJP supporter Chakravarthy Sulibele were at the rally. But the commissioner did not explicitly name the duo as targets and only said they had come to target “Hindu leaders at the venue”.

Mr. Surya had made an unscheduled stop at the rally and hence he was not the specific target, but once he was there the gang wanted to attack him, a senior police official said. Mr. Surya, talking to mediapersons, said Mr. Rao called him on Thursday night and informed him of the conspiracy.

“The city police have provided me with a gunman,” he said. “As a member of Parliament, he is eligible for additional security, which he has been given. On Mr. Sulibele, the jurisdictional police will take a call,” Mr. Rao said.

The arrested have been identified as: Mohammed Irfan, 33, a tailor; Syed Akbar, 46, a mechanic; Sanaulla Sherief, 28, an electrician – all residents of RT Nagar; Syed Siddique Akbar, 30, a civil contractor and a resident of Lingarajapuram; Akbar Basha, 27, a delivery boy with an e-commerce firm and a resident of KG Halli; and Sadiq Ul Amin, 39, a sound system rental shopkeeper and resident of Shivajinagar.

“All the accused are associated with SDPI and they are being paid ₹10,000 every month. We will now probe as to who was financing them. All of them are fundamentalists. But several Muslim religious and political leaders have helped us in this investigation and want them arrested. Only these men and the organisation are involved. We don’t want the community to be tarnished with the same brush,” Mr. Rao said.

Arrested people are not our activists: SDPI

Ilyas Tumbe, spokesperson of SDPI, Karnataka, has denied that any of the six arrested are associated with the organisation. He alleged that the arrest and linking it to the SDPI was a “diversionary tactic” to tarnish the anti-CAA protests in the State.

“The party is unnecessarily being dragged in the mud. We are a mainstream registered political party contesting elections across the country. We abide by the Constitution and do not subscribe to any form of violence. The party is in no way involved in this attack,” said Akram Hassan, Secretary, SDPI, Karnataka.

Attack organised, pre-mediated, says police commissioner

The attack on the ‘India for CAA’ rally was “organised and pre-meditated”, city police commissioner Bhaskar Rao said on Saturday.

The gang of six men, now arrested, met around 5.30 a.m. at Richards Park on December 22 and moved towards Town Hall, the venue of the rally, on three bikes, one of them stolen. They had smeared black soot on the number plates to ensure they are not detected. “All six of them were wearing saffron kurtas to ensure they merged into the pro-CAA rally crowd,” Mr. Rao said.

“Their plan was to pelt stones on the crowd to create chaos. They thought this would disperse the crowd leaving the leaders isolated when they would kill them,” he said. The gang did pelt seven stones on the crowd, of which one fell near a person, but the gathering was so large it did not affect the crowd and did not come to the notice of the policemen as well, the commissioner said.

“As their plan failed, the gang wanted to kill any of the workers who attended the rally. They followed Varun Bhoopalam, who was on his way home on a Bounce bike. They attacked him near Kalasipalya and fled towards Bidadi. In fact, two of them returned to see if the man had indeed died. But by then Varun was shifted to Victoria Hospital and later survived,” Mr. Rao said.

The accused had worn multiple shirts to avoid being identified. They have burnt some of the clothes they had worn and threw the weapons used in the attack into Anchepalya lake near NICE Road, and helmets into a lake in Ramamurthy Nagar, he said. “We analysed footage from 700 CCTV cameras along the path of Town Hall to the scene of crime to identify the accused,” Mr. Rao said.

The police commissioner said the case needs to be probed further to uncover the larger conspiracy behind the gang including their funding. “The case will be probed by Anti-Terror Squad of Central Crime Branch,” he said.

We have begun the process to ban PFI, SDPI: Bommai

Alleging that the Popular Front of India (PFI) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) had a role in recent incidents of terror and violence in Karnataka, the State government on Friday said it had commenced the process of banning these organisations.

Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai told a press conference here that a few other organisations were also likely to face a ban along with PFI and SDPI.

“There are a set of procedures to be followed before seeking a ban on any organisation such as collecting evidence regarding their unlawful activities. We have directed all the authorities concerned to submit such evidence and materials. Once this process is complete, we will forward them to the Centre for suitable action. We will also hold consultations with the Law Department on the procedures to be followed depending upon the nature of evidence that we get,” Mr. Bommai said.

Describing PFI and SDPI as “political faces” of banned terrorist organisations like SIMI, the Home Minister alleged that they were trying to re-emerge by changing their names.

He alleged that these organisations were carrying out their activities in Karnataka for the last seven to eight years. However, the last few episodes including the busting of a suspected terror module in Bengaluru by the Tamil Nadu police along with the Central Crime Branch (CCB) had brought the focus on the need for banning these organisations, he maintained.

Uttar Pradesh too was in the process of taking serious action against such organisations, he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/wfr6bc/article30588359.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18BGACCUSED,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/six-arrested-for-attack-on-rss-activist-after-pro-caa-rally/article30587672.ece
432,2020/01/17,"With no BBMP permission, avarekai mela put off","The annual avarekai mela, which was to be inaugurated on January 17, was put off, with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike not according permission.

Every year, the mela is organised by Sri Vasavi Condiments on Sajjan Rao Circle, V.V. Puram. With the local communities complaining about the fair causing parking problems, compounding traffic issues and increasing littering in the area, the BBMP held back the permission.

On Friday, it was just another day at the usually bustling outlet. Though frames for the pandal had been erected, the pandal that had been put up a couple of days ago had been removed by the BBMP officials. The frames still remain.

However, the proprietor of Sri Vasavi Condiments Swathi K.S. maintained that the mela would be held. However, she admitted that the mela could be held at another venue.

“We are not ruling out the possibility of holding the mela elsewhere. We have invested a lot in holding the annual mela. Farmers have also cultivated the seasonal bean at our behest for the mela. We cannot let them down,” she said.

Confirming that BBMP had not given permission, BBMP’s Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said the civic body would consider giving permission if the organiser comes up with a better alternative with regard to venue.

Though local councillor Vani V. Rao had been objecting to the mela being held on the narrow stretch for years, the fair was being held every year. This year, even the BBMP’s Solid Waste Management Department gave a report stating that the mela generated a lot of waste and suggested that it be held elsewhere, in accordance to BBMP’s rules and regulations that in place for events.

Several organisations, including Basavanagudi Residents’ Welfare Association, Ramiyengar Road Association, MMV Road Association, Parvathi Puram Association, Jain Community Association, have submitted letters against the mela. They met BBMP Commissioner and Chikpete MLA Uday Garudachar and urged them to not grant permission to the mela.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/with-no-bbmp-permission-avarekai-mela-put-off/article30587542.ece

434,2020/01/17,Study finds relation between loss of access to groundwater and decline in agricultural income,"In what is purportedly one of the first evidences of the medium- to long-term impact of large-scale, permanent environmental deterioration on rural populations in developing countries, a study has found a “dramatic decline” in agricultural income following the loss of access to groundwater owing to the drying up, or failure of the first borewell.

The paper, ‘Way Down in the Hole: Adaptation to Long-Term Water Loss in Rural India’, was published in the American Economic Review this month.

The authors of the paper are David Blakeslee [New York University, Abu Dhabi]; Ram Fishman [Tel Aviv University, Israel], and Veena Srinivasan [ATREE, Bengaluru].

Studying the effects of increasing water scarcity in India, their analysis is based on villages in Karnataka where groundwater is a vital source of irrigation but has been depleted by a combination of a prolonged, multi-year drought, and intensive extraction.

“Our study covered 102 villages that were randomly selected from the 31 sub-districts along Karnataka’s eastern border that are not served by surface irrigation. Thus, each of the district on the eastern boundary of the State was included, from Kolar to Bidar,” Mr. Fishman told The Hindu, via email.

Data for the March 2019 paper was collected between 2015 and 2017. The paper points out that Karnataka’s groundwater is stored in small, scattered pockets located within a hardrock sub-surface, which leads to substantial spatial variation in the volume of available groundwater at even very small distances.

“Importantly, this feature of the local aquifer has only become relevant with the recent drop in water levels, making continued access to groundwater subject to a high level of chance. The loss of groundwater causes a sharp and persistent decline in farm income, driven by abandonment of high-value horticulture and dry-season cultivation, and leads to a substantial loss of wealth,” it says.

Recommendations

Though the researchers said Karnataka is “advanced in its ability to monitor drought conditions [through KSNDMC] and provides support to drought=affected areas”, they added that the issue is a complex one given that groundwater resources in the area are very limited.

“To some extent, the rate of water depletion could perhaps be slowed down by incentivising water conservation [through pricing of water and power for pumping] and the adoption of highly water-efficient irrigation technologies through a bold extension and training programme. There may also be room for recharge of groundwater, or for the creation or rehabilitation of surface water sources, such as tanks. Ultimately, groundwater resources in the area will remain very limited. It is therefore also important to offer farmers ways to exit farming before fully exhausting their water resources and their money on drilling wells that are bound to fail, and then having to cope with this shock in undesirable ways,” Prof. Fishman added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/study-finds-relation-between-loss-of-access-to-groundwater-and-decline-in-agricultural-income/article30582569.ece

Based on her complaint, police arrested Pawan, who runs the dance class, charging him for outraging the modesty and rape, and remanded him in judicial custody. The woman, in her complaint, alleged that Pawan, who was teaching dance for Kannada reality shows, claimed to have links with the Kannada film industry. She had been learning dance from him for the last three years.

On Sunday, Pawan called her asking whether she was interested in acting in movies and offered a role.

The accused allegedly called her for audition to his dance class and made her to speak to a person who claimed to be a film director. The accused later allegedly said that she has been selected to act as the sister of the protagonist in the movie.

She got uncomfortable when the accused allegedly started showing her video clips with objectionable content and insisted on going home.

The accused allegedly offered her a glass of water laced with sedatives. The woman claimed to have passed out after drinking the water. The accused allegedly raped her and later dropped her home, the police said.

436,2020/01/17,Bengaluru students are owning the protests in city,"For the first time last week, Shanthi S., an undergraduate in a college in Bengaluru, took part in a protest at Town Hall. What spurred the 18-year-old was footage of a masked mob attacking students at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi. “I was particularly disturbed by the violence in educational institutions. Watching the videos made me shiver. Today if it is JNU, tomorrow it can be our campus,” she said.

Millennials and the generation born after 1997, like Shanthi, are often dismissed as Instagram-obssessed, hashtag-loving youth who prefer social media and armchair activism to ground realities. But recent events have upended this stereotype as it is primarily students and young adults who have been spearheading protests and marches against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NCR) and the violence meted out to students in Jawaharlal Nehru University and Aligarh Muslim University.

Though campuses in Bengaluru are far removed from the political turmoil and violence plaguing institutions in other parts of the country, student groups here are not sitting back. They have been instrumental in carrying out protests almost every day since December 2019, and sustaining the momentum.

Student activists are delighted with the turnout because unlike in other States, activism in Karnataka’s colleges has always been low key. Student union elections have been banned in the State for more than three decades as they were deemed responsible for perpetuating caste-based violence in higher education institutions.

Gururaj Desai, State secretary, Students' Federation of India, has seen students coming out on their own over the past few weeks. “I have been in the student movement for the last 16 years, but this is the first time they are fearlessly voicing their opinion on divisive forces. They are anxious about the political environment in the country,” he said.

For many, attending rallies and protests is a new experience, but they believe that the fight against CAA and for freedom of expression warrants their participation. They inject their own brand of humour with quirky placards. Even when Section 144 was imposed, they came out in large numbers risking detention and arrest. Others have gone against the diktat of their colleges undeterred by the consequences.

Ajay Kamath, State secretary, All India Democratic Students’ Organisation, said that students were turning up on their own. “Of course, some networks have been made among students of different colleges and we are circulating information on where protests are being held. But all we are doing is putting up the venues on social media,” he said.

Last week, students from different colleges came together and took part in a 24-hour protest. Hundreds of students camped at Maurya Circle all night while the police kept watch. The energy was high with students raising slogans, reciting poetry and singing songs. It was an open mic platform where everyone was allowed to express their opinion.

Hamza Tariq, president of the Student Bar Association, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), acknowledged that social media is playing a huge role in facilitating the protests. Students are using all social networking sites, messaging platforms and even dating apps to spread the word, but it does not end there. “While expressing our voice on social media is important, we have also realised the importance of group activism and, therefore, students of our university are participating in different protests conducted across the city.”

NLSIU students got a first-hand experience of the power of the importance of ground activism last year when they had staged protests, boycotted classes and examinations while demanding the appointment of a vice chancellor. Law students are taking it a step further by conducting awareness campaigns on CAA in residential areas. “We want to connect it with roti, kapda and makaan, and break it down to them on how it will affect them,” said Mr. Tariq.

‘Largely inclusive’

Photographer Vaishnavi Suresh, who has been actively involved in the protests, said that the gatherings have also been “largely inclusive” with people from institutions such as NLSIU as well as those from government first grade colleges turning up in large numbers. “At the protests, we come across people speaking in Kannada, Hindi and English. There is a sense of student unity, a sentiment that is currently being echoed throughout the country,” she said.

Many of the protests are conducted by a collective of students without the name of any organisation. Those organising the protests state that students and student organisations are keeping their differences aside, and are coming together with an “incredible amount of resistance”.

“The more students are oppressed, the more our struggles are getting momentum. Things have not changed overnight, but the series of events over the past few weeks have acted as a tipping point for students,” said Mr. Kamath.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dohoj9/article30582550.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/15BGCAANRCNPRJNUPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/bengaluru-students-are-owning-the-protests-in-city/article30582551.ece

438,2020/01/17,IIT Madras alumnus donates ₹5 crore to renovate hostels,"An alumnus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras has donated ₹5 crore to renovate the institute’s hostels.

Krishna Chivukula, owner and chairman of Indo-US, MIM TEC Private Ltd., has made the offer to augment existing maintenance facilities. An initial sum of ₹2.5 crore was handed over to the Institute to renovate Cauvery Hostel, the first facility to be built on campus. He presented the cheque to the institute’s director Bhaskar Ramamurthi and Dean of International and Alumni Relations, Mahesh Panchagnula, recently

Construction of Cauvery Hostel began in 1961, with a capacity to house 216 students. The hostel was expanded in 2002 to accommodate 171 more students. Since 2018, the rooms have been converted into double occupancy rooms to house around 750 students. The institute will identify two more hostels for renovation.

Improvement to the façade of the main entrance, corridors and staircase, painting, short-track fixing, gardening, development of play fields and cycle parking are also some of the works to be taken up.

Mr. Panchagnula said such efforts by the alumni made a huge difference to several key initiatives.

The contribution is part of the institute’s #keepitflowing campaign to support the hostels and improve amenities such as executing face-lift work, the officials said.

Mr. Chivukula of the M Tech (Aero) 1970 batch said the Institute had given him “world-class education at ‘zero cost’. This led to my being admitted to the Harvard Business School, which in turn led to my being successful in life. I am delighted to be able to give back to the institution that was the root cause of my success.”

Student General Secretary R. Aswanth said the funds would be used to improve facilities and create a student-friendly healthy environment.

The hostel currently has facilities such as grid-connected solar PV panels and solar water heaters; recycled water for flushing and gardening; play field area for cricket, football, basketball; garden space in the quadrangle; open cycle parking; TV room, library and table tennis room; washing machines in restrooms; separate study halls and drinking water points.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/yl67aw/article30585889.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17JANTH-IITM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/iit-madras-alumnus-donates-5-crore-to-renovate-hostels/article30585890.ece
439,2020/01/17,Fluctuations in price of gold may stabilise in a few weeks,"The soaring price of gold may take four or five weeks to stabilise. The price of the yellow metal, which began to ease a few days ago, has started climbing up for the past three days.

On Friday, one gram of 22-carat gold was priced at ₹3,809, which is ₹1 higher than the previous day. There has been a 27% rise in gold prices this year compared to last January, noted jewellers in the city. On January 8, the cost of one gram of 22-carat gold had touched ₹3,897.

Normally, the price of gold goes up by 3 % to 4% around Pongal time in Chennai. This year, the threat of an US-Iran war led to the strengthening of the dollar value and developments in the global market were some of the key reasons that triggered an abnormal rise in the gold price, said S. Santhakumar, vice-president, Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association. Moreover, gold has attracted attention in global market as a better investment option compared to mutual funds and real estate. This has led to further hike in the price. It may take a few weeks for the gold cost to stabilise, he said. He recalled previous years when gold prices have dipped whenever a country sold its stock to sustain its economic status.

Jewellers noted that sales have already dipped by 25% in the past few months as people’s purchasing power has decreased.

The high import duty has also influenced the steep hike in prices. The All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council has sought a reduction in import duty on gold to save the labour-intensive business. Its chairman, N. Anantha Padmanabhan said the high import duty has led to the emergence of illegal channels to procure gold. Many of the labourers engaged in jewellery manufacturing have left the profession due to the growing challenges.

The council has also suggested that the PAN card limit must be increased from ₹2 lakh to ₹5 lakh for purchases. The option of buying jewellery in easy instalments should be allowed to help consumers, he said.

Welcoming the mandatory gold hallmarking initiative, jewellers said it would help the gem and jewellery industry to move towards the organised sector and improve the quality of gold.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/jf1ihu/article30585139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17JANTH-GOLD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/fluctuations-in-price-of-gold-may-stabilise-in-a-few-weeks/article30585140.ece
440,2020/01/17,Traffic hit on Anna Salai near Spencer Plaza on Friday morning,"Traffic was hit on Anna Salai for more than 30 minutes when Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran arrived to garland the statue of former Chief Minister M.G. Ramachandran on Friday morning. Huge crowds of AMMK cadre thronged the statue on Anna Salai near Spencer Plaza on the eve of MGR’s 103rd birth anniversary.

Though police personnel were posted near the MGR statue to regulate the traffic, commuters faced delays at the Spencer Plaza junction because of the blocking of a portion of the road.

A senior official of the City Traffic police said the flow of traffic at the Spencer Plaza junction eased after Mr. Dhinakaran paid his floral tributes to MGR at around 11.30 a.m.

Mild tension prevailed at the venue after police personnel removed party flags of the AMMK installed on the road margins, citing safety issues.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/traffic-hit-on-anna-salai-near-spencer-plaza-on-friday-morning/article30583894.ece
441,2020/01/17,"Chennai Central Metro gets a parking facility, but no signs to inform commuters","Chennai Central Metro Rail station has finally got its underground parking lot, which was opened a few days ago -- but it does not have adequate signs to guide passengers.

The largest underground station in the city, Chennai Central Metro Rail station has about 10,000 passengers using it on a daily basis. This underground parking lot can house about 80 cars and 100 two-wheelers and is connected with the subway and the station. But importantly, there are not enough signs to lead passengers entering from Poonamallee High Road to the station. There is a ramp (near the Chennai Central Railway station) through which the vehicles can enter the parking lot; but there is hardly any signage and also sometimes, some commuters take this ramp to walk down to the station, without knowing what this facility leads to.

“Imagine if a bike or car comes speeding in or out and rams into a passenger? This is risky. When we have waited all these months for the construction to get over, we might as well install the signage and then start operating the parking lot. We are hoping there are no mishaps,” a source said.

According to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL), soon, they will install signs in and around the parking lot. “We wanted to open the facility first, as this is one of the most important stations and it will be of help for passengers who come to the station in a two-wheeler or four-wheeler. During the course of next week, we plan to put up more signs.”

Also, there are two lifts near the parking lot, which haven’t been opened as yet; it will be convenient for passengers to reach the concourse level only if they are opened.

While two-wheelers have to pay ₹10 an hour, for four-wheelers the cost is ₹25 an hour to use this space.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/s1y6j3/article30583663.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17JANTH-CENTRAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/chennai-central-metro-gets-a-parking-facility-but-no-signs-to-inform-commuters/article30583664.ece

444,2020/01/17,Students protest against Krishna Gate closure,"A section of students from IIT-Madras held a rally inside the campus on Thursday evening, as part of the ongoing protests against the IIT management’s “unilateral” and “unnanounced” closure of Krishna Gate.

One of the students who took part in the protest said there was a considerably high turnout on Thursday, compared to protests carried out in the last week of December, soon after the closure. “Now that the vacation is over, more students have returned to the campus. They are also against the closure. We will continue our protests,” he said.

After carrying out the rally, the students reportedly blocked the roads at the Gajendra Circle for a short while, before dispersing. The students are also preparing a petition to the Ministry of Human Resource Development.

“We have collected around 1,500 signatures in the last few days,” said another student.

Disagreeing with the management’s rationale that the closure was to ensure the safety of girl students, particularly those residing in a hostel near the gate, the students said that the closure has caused great inconvenience to both students residing in the campus and the scholars residing close to the Krishna Gate.

“It was us who led the protests today. We never felt unsafe. There must be other ulterior reasons for the closure,” a girl student, who took part in the protest, said. The locals residing outside the gate also staged a protest last week.

Meanwhile, the administration has stood by its decision. Earlier this week, the administration sent an elaborate email to all students, explaining why the closure was needed, despite some inconveniences to the students, and appealed for cooperation.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/students-protest-against-krishna-gate-closure/article30579780.ece
445,2020/01/17,Madras High Court orders early transplantation of kidney on 62-year-old patient,"The Madras High Court has directed the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu (Transtan) to make an endeavour to facilitate an early kidney transplantation for a 62-year-old patient, suffering from chronic renal disease since 1991. He is yet to get a cadaveric transplant, despite having registered with the authority on February 18, 2016.

Disposing of a writ petition filed by N. Krishnan, Justice C.V. Karthikeyan ordered that the petitioner be considered, whenever a matching kidney is available in the north zone of the State, though it was the case of Transtan that the petitioner was on waitlist number 57, in common pool (consisting of all age groups), and number 32 in the above 60 years pool. “It is directed that whenever a cadaver kidney is available in the north zone, and if other parameters are proper... then the respondent may bestow their personal attention and endeavour to afford continuity of life to the petitioner by granting the said cadaver kidney for the benefit of the petitioner whenever the opportunity arises,” the order read.

“The fourth respondent (MIOT International Hospital at Manapakkam), where the petitioner intended to undergo transplantation, may also join in this endeavour, and as and when a cadaver kidney is available in the north zone, seek the same, and subject to availability, transplant the same to the petitioner,” it said.

In his affidavit, the petitioner had stated that his kidney function started deteriorating in 2015, and since then he had been undergoing dialysis thrice a week. He decided to undergo kidney transplant at the MIOT International Hospital, and got himself registered with Transtan in February 2016, when he was 58 years old.

His counsel claimed that the government had taken a policy decision to give priority in cadaver transplantation to patients who were below 60 years of age and therefore the petitioner had to wait for years together, though he was below the prescribed age limit when he first registered with Transtan.

On the other hand, the private hospital informed the court that the petitioner was in waiting list number one, in so far as the rank list maintained by the hospital was concerned, and therefore he would be given first priority when a matching cadaver becomes available within the hospital. The rank list of Transtan would have to be followed when the cadaver comes from outside.

The counsel for Transtan, in turn, told the court that it maintains a database of four kinds of priority lists — one for each hospital in the State; a second for all government hospitals combined; third for all private hospitals combined; and fourth for government and private hospitals combined. Whenever a donor cadaver becomes available at a private hospital, the first priority for transplantation would be accorded to a matching recipient available in the same hospital, the second priority would be given to a combined list of government as well as private hospitals, third to the hospitals situated outside the State and fourth to foreign nationals.

It was also stated that Tamil Nadu was divided into three zones for the pupose of sharing cadavers and that MIOT Hospital fell in the north zone. After listing out the petitioner’s rank in the common pool as well as the above 60 years pool, the counsel said the petitioner would be given priority, as and when an in-house cadaver donor was available.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/8yfgft/article30579760.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17THORGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/madras-high-court-orders-early-transplantation-of-kidney-on-62-year-old-patient/article30579761.ece
446,2020/01/17,Writing and theatre are very powerful agents of social transformation: A. Revathi,"My awakening as a writer and transgender child began during adolescence. That was when I was trying to come to terms with my femininity, which was at odds with my male-assigned body and with the expectations that go with being seen as a boy by others. It was also the time I began penning romantic poems to a boy in Class IX on whom I had a crush.

The dual awakening brought with it much agony and self-doubt. First, I had grown up believing that writers had to be highly educated, compliant with grammar and well-defined literary rules. Did I, growing up in a village in Namakkal, have what it takes to be a writer? Second, how could I expect society that privileges masculinity and refuses to treat women on a par with men, accord people like me even a shred of dignity?

It was with time that I grew aware of the distinction between sex and gender: differences that governed the way I felt, how others saw me, and that determined how I was treated by them. Sex, usually assigned ‘male’ or ‘female’ based on the parts we are born with, becomes the arbiter of how society expects us to conduct ourselves, as children and adults. Stereotypes abound, and are enforced to keep everyone on the straight and narrow path. And, in a society where man is deemed superior to woman, a boy behaving in ways that are seen as feminine becomes the target of bullying, and — often — unspeakable violence.

The autobiographical novel Karukku (1992) by Tamil Dalit woman Bama on gender and caste discrimination had a huge impact on me, and motivated me to start writing about the need for liberation of transgender women. Unarvum Uruvamum (Emotions and the Body), the book I wrote in 2004, attempted to highlight the tribulations transgender women go through on a daily basis. Finding answers to the fundamental questions I posed in this book around society, gender and trans lives remains a lifelong quest. I have been accepted and acknowledged by society as a sister, a friend as well as a writer of substance.

But, the going has not always been smooth.

My autobiography The Truth About Me – A Hijra Life Story (2010), translated by V. Geetha, and A Life in Trans Activism (2016), translated by Nandini Murali, have gone on to fetch me recognition from the academic and literary communities. Last year I was featured, among other women writers of note in the Butler Banner Project at Columbia University. My autobiography was first adapted into a Kannada play by a theatre group in Shimoga and was staged at nearly 100 venues in 2014-2015.

More recently, it has taken the form of Vellai Mozhi, a mono-act play performed by me, directed by A. Mangai, with music by Shyam Balasubramanian. Featuring my own writing and a powerful poem by Kalki Subramaniam, I have been able to perform it extensively in southern India with support from a SAATHII Fellowship.

Writing and theatre are deeply fulfilling and make me realise that these are very powerful agents of social transformation. On many occasions, I have experienced art can convey many things to people about a world alien to them. It can also resonate strongly with those facing marginalisation like — or unlike — my own.

Vellai Mozhi will be staged as part of the Thirunar Vizha Rainbow Festival segment of Chennai Kalai Theru Vizha on January 18, at Raga Sudha Hall, Mylapore.

447,2020/01/17,Unsegregated waste sees a dip during Pongal,"Conservancy workers in most parts of Chennai have reported an increase of around 10% in collection of biodegradable waste after segregation at households because of Pongal festival. However, the quantity of unsegregated waste has reduced by around 20% in most of the 200 wards after over 10 lakh residents have left for their native places during Pongal.

“The per capita waste generated in each of the wards every day is around 700 grams. This has increased in many households during Pongal. But the total quantity of waste collected has reduced in many of the 200 wards,” said an official. For example, ward number 126 in Teynampet zone with a population of 43,624 which generates 34 tonnes of waste per day has collected less than 80% of the quantity during Pongal. The unsegregated waste collected in the ward is estimated at 27 tonnes during Pongal. The reduction of the quantity of waste has been reported after many residents have moved to their native villages for Pongal. The per capita waste collected in the ward is 778 grams.

The total capacity of the compost facilities in the ward is 5.85 tonnes. Conservancy workers in the ward have reported a rise in collection of biodegradable waste in Pongal. ""Such areas have huge support for compost facilities,"" said an official. Ward number 113 has an installed capacity to compost 25 tonnes of biodegradable waste.

Biogas facilities in each of the 15 zones have been using around 9 tonnes of municipal solid waste. The quantity of waste collected for biogas facilities is expected to increase this season.

Market areas such as Kothwal Chavadi and Koyambedu have reported an increase in quantity of waste collected during Pongal, said officials. The Corporation has been collecting around 5,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste from the city. The estimated quantity of waste generated during Pongal was around 3,700 tonnes.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unsegregated-waste-sees-a-dip-during-pongal/article30579719.ece
448,2020/01/17,SBI’s iconic white building on Anna Salai turns 100,"The State Bank of India’s iconic white building on Anna Salai recently turned 100.

Motorists cannot miss the building that has become one of the landmarks on the arterial road.

Built in the Palladian style of architecture associated with Europe, the heritage structure was opened on January 8, 1920.

It was then known as Mount Road branch of Bank of Madras. After 1921, the three presidency banks were merged and called the Imperial Bank of India, said sources in SBI.

Recent makeover

Spread over 22,000 sq.ft., the single-storeyed building continued to serve customers after the formation of SBI on July 1, 1955. It now has a customer base of nearly 20,000 and has passed the ₹1,000-crore mark in business as on December 2019.

The building was recently renovated to add modern facilities and better interiors. However, no structural changes were made, sources said. Besides 1,231 lockers, it also has a dedicated e-corner with an electronic cheque deposit machine and a recycler.

The branch’s long standing customer, Prince of Arcot Nawab Mohammed Abdul Ali, was felicitated at the centenary celebrations held recently.

The 72-km-long river, which branches out near Kesavaram anicut, Vellore district, is pristine until it reaches the urban stretches near Chennai. In an effort to save water that drains into the sea, the Water Resources Department has planned to construct a check dam, a wall-like structure across the river, to help store floodwater.

The river has one check dam in Putlur village, between Kesavaram anicut and Korattur anicut, in Tiruvallur district. The new check dam will come up about 12 km downstream the Kesavaram anicut. WRD officials said a check dam would be constructed at a height of 2.25 m, across the 100-m-wide river.

“We plan to raise the flood banks to convert it into a riverine reservoir and ensure water stagnation for a distance of 2 km, on the upstream portion of the structure,” said an official.

Water table to improve

Once the ₹7.80-crore project is completed, residents from surrounding villages, including Agaram, Kavankolathur and Kadambathur, will have enough water to cultivate paddy and sugarcane.

Moreover, the water table, at a depth of 4-5 m, will improve.

According to officials, excess water stored through the new check dam in Pudumavilangai village will be diverted to neighbouring lakes in Kesavanallur, Agaram and Kadambathur, through supply channels that branch out from the Cooum.

This will be constructed upstream the Korattur anicut, which was damaged during the 2015 floods. Built in 1876, the anicut, located in Jamin Korattur, is vital in regulating excess floodwater in the Cooum, to the Chembarambakkam lake.

“We have submitted a proposal to the State government, seeking approval to reconstruct the damaged anicut,” the official added.

The Cooum has two more check dams in Kannapalayam and Paruthipattu, near Avadi, before it reaches the urban areas in Chennai.

The department plans to complete the construction of the check dam in a year.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/dem1ap/article30581021.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/cooum-mapJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/unpolluted-stretch-of-cooum-to-get-another-check-dam/article30579667.ece
450,2020/01/17,The perils of RBI’s fixation on inflation,"Inflation is back in the news and attention has willy-nilly turned on the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This would lead us to recognise what the central bank is mandated to do and assess how much of its objective it actually achieves.

The establishment of some of the world’s oldest central banks was inspired by the goal of maintaining financial stability. It was recognised that when private commercial banks fail, whether due to malfeasance or misjudgment, they not only harm their trusting depositors, they can also take down with them the rest of the financial system. The latter can take place when banks have lent to one another, which is not uncommon. In the crisis that ensues, there is a collapse of credit which, in turn, leads to a downturn in economic activity. To avoid this, the central bank was conceived of as the lender of last resort, one that could pre-empt a run on banks and give them time to put their books back in order. However, this was to be accompanied by the adoption of a tough regulatory stance, whereby the central bank would stay hawk-eyed towards the activities of banks, particularly risky lending. This was necessary as the knowledge that they could always rely on the lender-of-last-resort facility may leave banks less than diligent or even make them indulge in plain dishonesty. However, with the rise of neoliberalism, the central tenet of which is that markets should be given free play, the regulatory role of central banks took a back seat. They came to be primarily mandated with inflation control. It is hardly the case that central banks were unconcerned with inflation earlier, but they were at the same time concerned with financial stability and the level of economic activity.

Moving the goal post

In India, the RBI had earlier pursued a ‘multiple indicators approach’, implying concern for outcomes other than inflation, including even the balance of payments. But, developments in economic theory discouraged such catholicity by arguing that having economic activity as an objective of monetary policy leads to higher inflation. It should be noted that this argument privileged low inflation over low unemployment, favouring owners of financial wealth over workers. But, not to be left behind in the race to adopt the architecture of the West, the Indian government also instituted inflation targeting as the sole objective of monetary policy. The RBI was permitted to exceed or fall short of a targeted inflation rate of 4% by a margin of 2 percentage points. This was hailed by the government as the adoption of the ‘modern monetary policy framework’ by India, and came into effect from the year 2016-17.

The late Arun Jaitley as Finance Minister projected the attainment of macroeconomic stability, represented by slow inflation, as a major achievement of his tenure. Adherence to fiscal discipline and inflation targeting were taken to be the instruments. Throughout Mr. Jaitley’s tenure, inflation remained within the range envisaged under the inflation targeting regime agreed to between the government and the RBI. But have all the objectives of the RBI’s original mandate as a central bank been met as a result? I believe not.

In 2018, within three years of the adoption of inflation targeting goal, a crisis engulfed IL&FS, a non-banking financial company in the infrastructure space. It defaulted on several of its obligations, including repayment of bank loans and the redemption of commercial paper. The IL&FS was not just another ‘shadow bank’; it operated over 100 subsidiaries and was sitting on debt of ₹94,000 crore. Given this, its default had a chilling effect on the investors, banks and mutual funds associated with it both directly or indirectly. Since then, in 2019, a run on the Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank had to be averted by imposing withdrawal limits. It was discovered that fictitious accounts, reportedly over 21,000 of them, had been created so that the books would tally, even as deposits were siphoned off as loans to the promoters. While in the case of IL&FS, some part of the problem may have been caused by a slowing economy, outright fraud underlay the crisis at PMC Bank. And now, in early 2020, curbs have had to be placed on withdrawals from the Bengaluru-based Sri Guru Raghavendra Sahakara Bank. Even if it is too early to declare that financial instability prevails in India, it is not too early to ask if the RBI’s responsibility to regulate the financial sector may have taken a back seat after adoption of inflation targeting as the main objective. Has a fixation with inflation rate made the RBI take its eyes off the loan books of the banks?

Rise in inflation

Further, even apart from regulatory infirmity, it is not as if the RBI is doing spectacularly on the inflation targeting front either. At over 7%, the inflation rate in December is the highest in five years. This may not be reason to panic, for the price rise could be seasonal and may well abate, but it does raise a question on the efficacy of inflation targeting as a means of inflation control. Inflation led by rising prices of food stuff cannot quickly or easily be contained by the mode of control underlying inflation targeting. It requires enhancing supplies which, in turn, would mean raising imports in the short run. Be that as it may, the extent of failure of inflation targeting right now is substantial indeed; the inflation rate has exceeded the permissible range of error by 65%. This must give pause as to how much the shift to the ‘modern monetary policy framework’ has delivered. If the inflation rate was within the intended range so far, that may have been due to both declining food prices and, for a phase, oil prices.

Finally, we come to what the ordinary Indian considers the RBI’s principal mandate, the management of the currency so that trade is facilitated. The central bank has the monopoly on the issue of notes. Why then is there is an absolute shortage of small denomination notes in the bazaars of India? ‘Bazaar’ is here only a word for a site of commerce; from the north to the south of the country, from airports to village stores, trade and production is held up due to the absence of notes and coins of the denomination appropriate to the transaction.

The RBI and the government showed themselves to be entirely out of touch with reality when, in 2016, the 1,000-rupee note was replaced with a 2,000-rupee note. It is anybody’s guess whether the daily wage for a labourer is more than ₹500 in much of India. Small denomination notes are mostly unavailable, or, if available at all, are of so shabby an appearance that it makes you wonder whether those responsible for the management of our economy take any pride in discharging their tasks. In this department, India’s central bank has failed substantially.

451,2020/01/17,Arrest of a DSP,"The arrest of the Deputy Superintendent of Police Davinder Singh while ferrying two terrorists to Delhi raises several disturbing questions (Front page “Hizb ultras led police to rogue officer,” Jan. 14). It is even more disconcerting that despite such a murky background, the officer continued to enjoy the confidence of his seniors within the force. It is, however, to the credit of the Jammu and Kashmir police to have finally caught him red-handed in an act amounting to treason. His arrest has ignited controversy, with doubts being cast on the veracity of the official version of the Parliament attack of 2001. Afzal Guru, an accused in the attack, had purportedly made a startling claim in a letter to his lawyer that Singh forced him to take one of the five Pakistani terrorists involved in the attack to Delhi and to then arrange for his stay and other logistics ahead of the attack. It is intriguing that the CBI did not probe the matter further to unmask those who possibly facilitated the attack from behind, Singh included. Will the nation ever know the truth or will it remain buried under the thick layers of secrecy on the pretext of national security?

452,2020/01/17,A split Opposition,"The pitiable plight of the Congress Party was most accurately depicted in the cartoon (Jan. 15). While some regional parties of importance have opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, they have refused to come under the Congress umbrella. This sends a strong message that the Congress may have to either contest alone in the upcoming elections or play second fiddle to regional parties as has happened before. The party’s failure to project a young and promising leader outside the Gandhi clan is the most obvious reason for this debacle. Also, scams, criminal cases against its leaders and lack of a definite political vision have been its undoing. It also strikes one that regional parties were waiting for a chance to show what they can do without Congress.

453,2020/01/17,Hindutva agenda,"The blatant and brazen attack on dissent by the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah duo and their bankruptcy on measures of real development has been quite effectively compared to the three-card game by the writer (Op-Ed page, “Running out of tricks,” Jan. 15). It is not incredible that the BJP government is resorting to measures that reek of Hindutva and the present CAA/NRC/NPR exercise is part of its bigotry in pursuing this particular agenda. The spontaneous protests by students across the country, which have been branded as an act of treason by the BJP, have become a headache for the party and the JNU entanglement which has received worldwide attention has had no effect on the duo, who continue to propagate their mission of divisive politics unabashedly. The BJP should do more than lambasting those voices of dissent, from the safety of podiums to its arduous supporters, as people have started to realise, though belatedly, that this is a government which had failed the people on its promises and has no leaders and Ministers who really think of development

454,2020/01/17,Protest is ‘political’,"Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has called for unity among Opposition parties to support the ongoing protests against the CAA and force the government to roll back the law.

When the CAA, rushed through in Parliament, is ‘political’ in its true sense, the protest against it too has to be ‘political’ and it is. The protest is as ‘political’ as the enactment of the Act was ‘political’. The law was passed by members of political parties. Members of Parliament are not apolitical. Are not BJP and its allies that voted in favour of the Bill essentially political entities? The passage of the law was a political act in all its senses.

The protests for the rescission of the CAA have to be complemented by a strong political pushback by a combined and strong Opposition. The refrain by some TV channels that ‘a people’s movement’ has been hijacked by certain political parties and leaders is but a vain bid to de-legitimise the protests led by students, civil society activists and women.

Shashi Tharoor, Mani Shankar Aiyar and Kanhaiya Kumar are not disqualified to be on the ‘protest stage’ just because of their opposition to the Hindutva brigade. They do not piggyback on the protest but just extend their support to it. May be, it is a dictate of ‘patriotism’ that BJP leaders can organise and take part in pro-CAA campaign and rallies but the Opposition leaders should not take part in anti-CAA protests.

The issue of ‘traffic’ is brought in to counter the Shaheen Bagh protest which will go down in the annals of Indian history. Women at the protest site ask why not talk of the roads shut to their children. No sacrifice is too great to win the ‘political’ battle for a liberal, secular India in which all of us live as members of one wider family.

India has categorically declared to the global community that its move of diluting Article 370 of the Constitution and bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir into Union Territories was an internal matter and advised Pakistan to come into terms with reality. Given this stance, what right does China have to poke its nose into Kashmir issue? Intentions of China, Pakistan’s all-weather ally, are malicious and malafide, with an evil design of exerting undue global pressure on New Delhi.

456,2020/01/17,School-readiness,"It is not surprising that there is a vast difference in “school-readiness” between the children joining government schools and those joining private schools in grade one (Editorial page, “Chalk and cheese in private vs. government schools”, Jan. 15). Imparting and building cognitive skills, viz., concentration, perception, memory and logical thinking have been found to play an important role in inculcating basic literacy and numeracy abilities in children. But, are our Anganwadi workers adequately trained to impart such skills? And, do they have enough time to do the job effectively? As per an assessment paper published in the International Journal for Quality in Healthcare, they lack the knowledge required to discharge their functions effectively. The facilities provided are also inadequate. It is necessary to appoint a better-qualified second Anganwadi worker exclusively to attend to the preschool activities. Unless special attention is paid to imparting skills to children joining government schools, the gap observed between them and their counterparts joining private schools cannot be bridged.

The Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) paints a sad picture on the rural education in India. A majority of India still lives in villages, and naturally so, the topic of rural education gains utmost importance. Fewer committed teachers, lack of proper textbooks and learning materials in schools are some of the major issues for quality and access to education in rural India. In some government schools in villages, the system of teaching by a single teacher still prevails, and if the teacher is absent, the school declares a ‘holiday’ on that day. Also, many government schools in villages are over-packed with students, which lead to the imbalance in teacher-student ratio. In fact, some years back, the ASER survey revealed a distressing fact that many students in fifth grade were unable to read a second-grade text book and weren’t able to solve even some simple mathematical problems. The reason cited for this problem was the increasing number of single classrooms to educate students from more than one grade. The foundation to offer quality education to our rural students has to be laid down strongly at primary level. Improvement in the condition of government schools, education quality and committed teachers with more salaries to them should be part of the development. It is an established fact that basic education improves the level of human well-being, especially with regard to life expectancy, infant mortality, and nutritional status of children.

R. Sivakumar,

The article comparing learning outcomes among schools, as assessed by the ASER correctly mentions the importance of focusing on developing cognitive skills in young children rather than knowledge content. However, the analysis detailing the factors that could be leading to poorer learning outcomes in government schools did not account for a crucial controlling factor. There is a well-established direct link between children’s achievements (including educational achievements) and the socio-economic status (SES) of the family. In comparing private schools, which levy a comparatively higher fee, and government schools, this factor too must surely be analysed. Government schools cater particularly to children from the middle and lower socio-economic strata. In fact, government schools performing approximately half as well as private schools could arise from disparity in SES alone.

It would be more meaningful to assess the relative efficacy between schooling systems by looking at the relative proportions of people occupying positions involving higher thinking who had been through different schooling systems rather than by looking at learning outcomes at the primary level alone. Here also, the fact that private schools filter out slow achievers should be factored in while assessing learning outcomes.

That a nine-judge bench will look into larger questions of religious freedom under the Constitution shows that religion is too complex an issue for adjudication by the judiciary.

459,2020/01/17,Did you say quitters’ day?,"New Year resolutions are as common as blowing candles over a birthday cake. While some may find resolutions silly, some others draw out a list of resolutions with utmost dedication. Fitness happens to be one of the most popular resolutions. How far they achieve their goal or how serious they are about it a only for them to say. Memes galore that make fun of the many fitness resolutions. That apart, did you know that there’s a lot of research that goes into fitness resolutions and the day it dies?

Research conducted by Strava, (a social fitness network used to track cycling and running exercises) using over 800 million user-logged activities in 2019 predicts the day most people are likely to give up on their New Year’s resolution —-January 19. Strava designated January 19 as ‘Quitters Day’ for fitness-related resolutions.

Disagreeing with Strava’s prediction, Sai Kiran, a businessman shares how his journey towards fitness took him forward, “The Strava might have had non-dedicated users. I’m not a quitter. Fitness for me is a way of life. I have survived and I am living to enjoy every day because I decided to get fit the right way after learning my lesson from wrong fitness advice. I was obese from wrong food habits and erratic sleep patterns from my engineering days and was in a hurry to lose weight. In that process I have not only invested huge sums on trainers who would consult from abroad but also suggest my diet and supplements. Come to think of it, I did lose weight but at a cost. My health parameters flipped and I was rushed to a hospital with a health complication from wrong diet and supplements.”

Post that traumatic hospitalisation, Sai took it slow but was cautious to find the right fitness advisor. The task was hard because he wasn’t ready to trust anyone who spoke about unrealistic diets and supplements. “I want to stay fit to be happy. I found myself a trainer and he literally nursed me back to health through constant food consultation and then hand holding me to get the desired look for my body. So fitness for me doesn’t have an expiry date,” adds Sai.

Fitness and happiness is a known fact. According to a study published in the Strava website where 8000 people interviewed by Glasgow Caledonian University, it showed 89 percent of respondents were happier because they exercised regularly and 83 percent were more motivated to exercise by support .

Alay Razvi, a lawyer isn’t in favour of letting an app talk about Quitters’ Day. His modesty prevents him from calling himself a fitness freak; he simply says, “I strongly disagree with a ‘quitters’ day.’ You are basically saving yourself from the guilt of calling yourself a quitter. You move forward but never stay stagnant. And those who become stagnant basically go back to where they started from. I won’t quit from my fitness goals ever.”

Chetan Mallik is a fitness enthusiast who pursues endurance activities to spread awareness about the rare medical condition of acromegaly. He locks his fitness activities on Strava says there are two ways to look at Quitters’ Day. He, personally will never quit to workout because “my goal is different. Strava is a good fitness app to keep track of your fitness goals and there are many others too that anyone can use like- Endomodo, MapMyRun, MapMyRide etc. While it is always inspiring to see what other athletes are doing by being on an app, we have to always stay connected with our own unique purpose and not get overwhelmed by other athletes. Each one of us have a different level of preparedness and fitness and we should always respect that.”

The study on the contrary stated: While it’s certainly harder to achieve a huge goal than a small one, the difficulty of the goal you set isn't nearly as important as whether or not you develop the kind of habits that allow you to achieve that goal.

So it meant everything came down to developing new habits to successfully stay put to one’s fitness goals. “But isn’t that the way of life. Right from eating right, quitting bad habits like smoking, to being honest, beginning to dedicate a fixed hour for fitness; everything boils down to making it habit to see the success. More than agreeing and working on to get ‘a look’ I train my client to work with them to stay healthy along with with meeting their ‘looks’ goals,” says fitness consultant Bilon Aristotle.

So if you wish to get Jason Momoa’s looks that makes women and men go weak in their knees, first get the dedication he put for the role of Aquaman. “It might be a little too late to be Aquaman for me. I, however can never call it quits on my fitness routine. I discovered the joy of fitness activities when I decided to join a marathon and started working out. For many years, the first thing I do everyday after getting up is get ready for my workout,” says Chef Yogender Pal.",fitness,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/txdhix/article30583015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Chef-Yogender-Pal,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/fitness/quitters-day-strava-fitness-resolution-alay-razvi-sai-kiran-chef-yogender-pal-chetan-mallik-acromegaly/article30583025.ece

Ansari, 68, convicted for the 1993 blasts, went missing on Thursday while on parole from Rajasthan’s Ajmer Central Prison. A missing person’s report was lodged at the Agripada police station in Mumbai when he did not appear for his usual attendance as part of his parole conditions, police said.

U.P. DGP O.P Singh said a team of the UP STF, which was in touch with the Anti-Terrorism Squad Mumbai, nabbed Ansari outside a mosque in Kanpur. Ansari was arrested from Faithfulganj around 1 p.m., the police claimed. Around ₹47,000 cash, a diary, a mobile phone and an Aadhaar card were recovered from him, they said.

President of Anjuman–I–Islam, Zahir Kazi on Monday said the community is a living example of national intergration and harmony. He also said governments over the years had neglected the region’s tourism potential. “Irrespective of which government is in power, they do not care for the tourism sector in the Konkan belt as compared to the attention Goa gets when it comes to tourism, which is why it is lagging behind in that sector,” he said.

Addressing a press conference organised by Kokan Community Forum (KCF) to announce the programmes, Dr. Kazi said that the lack of hotel facilities for people who wish to holiday on the beaches results in short-term visitors to the coastal belt.

Maharashtra Assembly Speaker Nana Patole and Public Works Department Minister Ashok Chavan will attend the World Kokani Day celebrations at M.H. Saboo Siddik Ground at Byculla. Eminent people from the region who have excelled in academic and non-academic endeavours will be felicitated on the occasion.

467,2020/01/17,"MTV Nishedh to tackle sexual health, diseases","A new scripted series titled MTV Nishedh will explore usually taboo but important subjects like abortion, tuberculosis and healthy contraceptive measures on television. Launched by the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, the 13-episode series will be modelled on the lines of the 2009 MTV Shuga show that aired in several African countries such as Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa.

The Indian show’s objective is to inform and educate young people, and give voice to often neglected issues. “Our research team went to the rural parts of States like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to come up with data, which showed that till date people are unaware of issues related to abortion, tuberculosis and healthy contraceptive measures,” said Georgia Arnold, executive director of the MTV Staying Alive Foundation, worldwide. “Our researchers created various focus groups and had them discuss these issues. It was then that we decided to launch such a campaign in India.”

In India, the foundation has partnered with Viacom 18 to launch the miniseries, which will run through seven weeks. “I’ve always believed that doing good is good for business,” said Sudhanshu Vats, group CEO and MD, Viacom18. “We have, since inception, created content on social causes and built a successful broadcast business around it. We would continue to create multimedia campaigns, over and above our TV shows, that highlight various social themes.”

As Indian culture is extremely disparate to African customs and way of life, Ms. Arnold also spoke about the challenges the adaptation had to overcome. “The language, food, clothing everything is different when it comes to different countries,” she said. “Especially, in a country like India, there are thousands of cultures within the country. So, the researching phase went on for quite some time.”

Ms. Arnold said the miniseries will also be available on Viacom 18’s Colors Rishtey in addition to MTV. “These are some issues which people would like to watch alone. To enable personal viewing, we will be also airing this series on Voot,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/g327mm/article30580295.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bmMTV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mtv-nishedh-to-tackle-sexual-health-diseases/article30580296.ece
468,2020/01/17,Another pangolin rescued in Navi Mumbai; three arrested,"In the third such case in Navi Mumbai in the past two weeks, an Indian pangolin was rescued and three people were arrested by the Vashi police on Wednesday in a joint operation with the Thane forest department and Resquink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW).

An informer of RAWW, an NGO promoting urban wildlife conservation, noticed three poachers taking the pangolin in a car and alerted the Vashi police at 1.30 a.m. on Wednesday.

“We learnt about the animal being smuggled in a car coming from Palm Beach towards Sector 17 in Vashi. We laid a trap opposite Citibank in Vashi around 2.30 a.m. and intercepted the car. We found the mammal hidden in a plastic sack inside,” senior police inspector Sanjeev Dhumal said.

The three men in the vehicle were Krishna Padmakumar Chaughule (30), Nana Lakshman Waghmare (39) and Mangesh Yashwant Waghmare (25), all residents of Roha in Raigad district. They planned to sell the animal for ₹4 lakh. “We are yet to find out from where the three got the pangolin,” Mr. Dhumal said. The accused have been remanded in police custody till Saturday.

Last week, in separate incidents, the Khandeshwar police had arrested one person and the Kalamboli police seven people for smuggling pangolins to Navi Mumbai. In both cases, the police have found that the mammals were caught by an Adivasi in Ratnagiri.

The pangolin seized on Wednesday was handed over to RAWW for medical examination and further care. “It was completely dehydrated and traumatised due to travel and captivity stress, and had minor injuries,” Pawan Sharma, founder and president, RAWW, said.

The animal was treated by veterinary doctors and the RAWW team. Its X-rays and cytology tests were normal. The animal was taken to Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) on Thursday for natural feeding. “The animal is active and behaving normally, indicating it is fit to be released into its natural habitat. A microchip will be inserted in the animal, after which it will be ready to be released,” Mr. Sharma said.

Pangolins are one of the most endangered and threatened species, with highest level of protection status, in India, and are protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mre01z/article30580258.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bmPangolin,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/another-pangolin-rescued-in-navi-mumbai-three-arrested/article30580259.ece
469,2020/01/17,Mumbai records coldest January day in a decade,"Mumbai recorded the coldest January day in a decade on Thursday, with maximum temperature dipping to 25.3 degrees Celsius — six degrees below normal. The minimum temperature at 15.4 degrees was not the lowest of the season, but the small gap between minimum and maximum temperatures meant that Mumbaikars felt the chill through the day.

Daytime temperatures have been falling through the week, from 30.1 degrees Celsius on Monday to 29.1 on Tuesday and 28.3 on Wednesday. The all-time highest maximum temperature for the month is 37.4 degrees, recorded on January 16, 2006. Thursday’s maximum temperature was the lowest for the month since 2009. In the last decade, day temperatures have not fallen under 26 degrees Celsius.

Minimum temperature at 15.4 degrees was also two degrees below normal. The coldest January night ever in the city was on January 22, 1962, at 7.4 degrees Celsius. However, the coldest January night every year in the past decade has been colder than Thursday, between 10 and 14 degrees Celsius. Minimum temperature is yet to dip below that this year.

The lowest minimum temperature on Thursday was recorded at Borivali at 12.9 degrees, while at Chembur the mercury dipped to 16.8, Mulund 15.4, Powai 14.3, Worli 18 and Colaba 17.6.

“Lowest maximum temperature indicates the severity of chill during the daytime. The effect is due to the western disturbance in north India and northerly winds. Temperature will drop further on Friday and may pick up after Saturday. Minimum temperature will also drop further,” said K.S.

Mr. Ambedkar said till date, 35 organisations have expressed support for the bandh.

The leader said he had met members of all major political parties in Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli, Navi Mumbai and Panvel to discuss the Statewide bandh. “We also had discussions with the organisations that had protested the CAA, NRC and NPR, on carrying out a peaceful bandh. Along with the CAA and NRC, the issue of the economy will also be raised during the bandh as the country is suffering an economic crisis and we could be heading towards bankruptcy. These issues need to be brought to the people’s attention,” Mr. Ambedkar said.

472,2020/01/17,"Two cultures, one beat: Carnatic to meet rap","Using the mridangam as a pivot between cultures, producer and composer Viveick Rajagopalan plans to bring together Carnatic music and contemporary rap at a fusion concert at Royal Opera House on Friday. The concert called ‘Mridangmela’, aims to celebrate the unique elements of the percussion instrument, in both traditional and contemporary music.

The concert will feature musicians Anantha R. Krishnan (mridangam), Charumathi Raghuram (violin) and Mr. Rajagopalan, who has composed and produced the event.

Charumathi Raghuram

“I am looking forward to my collaboration with these musicians as this will be for the first time ever,” said Mr. Rajagopalan. The first act, ‘Dvita-Dual Elements’ will be performed by Mr. Krishnan and Ms. Raghuram. This act is a highly energetic performance that will see the parallel development of melody and rhythm. “The performance is specially designed for mridangam and violin,” said Mr. Krishnan. “It is unique in the sense that ancient and possibly centennial compositions in mridangam are reformatted and re-contextualised for modern-day performance practice.” Mr. Krishnan believes that no music can be pure or impure. “It is up to people to be honest enough to either like or dislike what they see and hear as art. Creative people just do what they desire,” he said.

The second act will feature Mr. Rajagopalan with his rap collective, the Ta Dhom Project. This performance brings together Carnatic classical rhythms, vocal percussion and street rap together. Mr. Rajagopalan believes the project is an attempt to explore opposite genres classical and hip-hop. “What started as Sunday morning classes to share the art of understanding rhythm through konnakol is somewhat a regular affair now, with more showing interest in learning. As a mridangam player, I used my experience as a composer and producer, to use the sound of the instrument, to emulate beats from other genres. We also explore different time signatures, which are not so common in hip-hop and rap,” says Mr. Rajagopalan.

Anantha R. Krishnan

Konnokol is an over 5,000-year-old vocal percussion art form from South India which is a part of the Carnatic genre. It has been used by Carnatic musicians to teach the mridangam and Bharatnatyam. “What is unique about it is that you can adapt it to any form or genre of music from around the world, which is one reason why so many artists globally are drawn towards it,” says Mr. Rajagopalan.

Mr. Rajagopalan, who is best known for his popular track, ‘India 91’ in Zoya Akhtar’s critically-acclaimed movie Gully Boy, stresses on the fact that the voices of Indian rap artists are being heard in the present time.

“I think it would be fair to say that only the ones [rap artists] who have depth will stick around and the hype will become mellow after a while,” says Mr. Rajagopalan.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dg06ph/article30580133.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bmViveick-Rajagopalan,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/two-cultures-one-beat-carnatic-to-meet-rap/article30580134.ece
473,2020/01/17,Will act against MU prof. for ‘Pappu’ tweet: minister,"The Maha Vikas Aghadi government will take action against a Mumbai University professor for an ‘abusive’ post against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Maharashtra Home Minister Anil Deshmukh announced on Thursday. On December 14, the professor had posted a video on Twitter targeting Mr. Gandhi for his statement against V.D. Savarkar, referring to him as ‘Pappu’. The professor has since been sent on forced leave by the university administration. “A university professor’s work is to teach children, not give statements like these (on Mr. Gandhi). He has been sent on leave for now but action will be taken once he is back,” said Mr. Deshmukh.

Professor Yogesh Soman, Director of the Academy of Theatre Arts at Mumbai University, had posted the video on December 14. Mr. Soman had said, referring to Mr. Gandhi, “You are right, you are not Savarkar. You have nothing of him in you, his dedication, his sacrifice, his valour, but you also do not have anything to be called Gandhi. I condemn your pappugiri (sic).”

The tweet set in motion a political blame game, with members of the Chhatra Bharti Students Union and activists of AISF (All India Students’ Federation) staging a sit-in, which was withdrawn after the Mumbai University general secretary issued a letter stating Mr. Soman had been sent on forced leave. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) had called that a violation of the professor’s freedom of speech. “According to @INCIndia, criticising a venerated freedom fighter like Veer Savarkar is perfectly okay. But dare anyone criticise His Highness @RahulGandhi or anyone from the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, they will be sent on forced leave! Hypocrisy, thy name is Congress,” the ABVP tweeted, soon after.

The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) too criticised the announcement to send Mr. Deshmukh on leave.

BJP leader Shweta Shalini said by the same token, action should be taken against professors protesting in Jawaharlal Nehru University. “Really, what about all the professors in JNU who are participating in marches, sloganeering and stone-pelting? What’s their work, and guess what the Fascist government is doing against them? Nothing,” she said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/will-act-against-mu-prof-for-pappu-tweet-minister/article30580118.ece
474,2020/01/17,Murderer held after 12 years on the run,"The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has arrested a murder convict who was on the run for 12 years after jumping furlough in 2008.

On March 17, 2003, a woman who lived by herself in her Bhulabhai Desai Road residence was found with her throat slit. Valuables worth over ₹2 lakh were missing from her house. The Gamdevi police had arrested Rajeshkumar Dwivedi (22), a security guard at the building, and had charged him with murder and robbery.

Dwivedi was convicted in 2007 and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment, after which he was lodged in Nashik Central Jail.

In 2008, he appealed his conviction in the Bombay High Court and the same year, obtained furlough for a month citing his wife’s illness. However, he never returned to prison and had been missing since then.

In 2017, the Crime Branch was instructed to trace him without delay, and had been investigating since.

“We first visited his hometown in Uttar Pradesh, as well as his wife’s native place in Madhya Pradesh, which were on top of our list of probable locations where he might be hiding. For several months, we scoured the area, cultivating local informants,” an officer with Crime Branch Unit II said.

After inquiries in both States, the investigating team learned that Dwivedi’s wife was constantly shuttling between U.P. and M.P. However, in M.P., she was not staying at her parents’ house, but at a different place. The police kept a watch and found that she was staying with a man who worked as a driver.

“We watched the man for several days, before confirming he was the same person we were looking for, and picked him up for inquiries on January 12. After preliminary inquiries confirmed that he was indeed Dwivedi, we produced him in a local court and obtained transit remand till Thursday. We brought him to Mumbai and produced him in the sessions court,” the officer said.

The court sent him to Nashik Central Jail, the police said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/smiz8t/article30580100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17bmcrime-branch,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/murderer-held-after-12-years-on-the-run/article30580101.ece
475,2020/01/17,Uddhav launches first MTHL girder,"Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday launched the first girder for the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) project, which will connect Mumbai with Navi Mumbai.

The Sewri to Nhava Sheva sea link will become the longest bridge in India with a length of almost 22 km and has been in the planning stage for over four decades now. An automatic girder launching system, which was used for the first time in India, helped lay the foundation of the bridge.

“We all know that the Sewri-Nhava Sheva bridge, which is very essential for the people, was being postponed for a long time. The work has now begun, and is going very fast. The bridge will now be completed before time,” Mr. Thackeray said, while launching the girder near the Sewri end of the bridge.

According to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), the bridge will be 21.8-km long and will cost ₹17,000 crore, 80% of which will be funded by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). Around three lakh metric tonnes of steel and 10 lakh metric tonnes of concrete will be used for its construction. Sanjay Khandare, additional commissioner, MMRDA, said the bridge will be connected with the Eastern Freeway, Prabhadevi railway station and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link on the Mumbai end. Meanwhile, on the Navi Mumbai end, it will connect with Chirle and Shivaji Nagar to help people reach the proposed Navi Mumbai Airport and will be connected to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway and Alibaug.

“The major problem that the environmentalists had was that the flamingoes, which migrate to the Sewri mud flats every year, would be disturbed by the construction work. Taking the environmentalists’ concerns into account, we have installed silencers and mufflers on all the working equipment to minimise the noise. Further, we have used eco-friendly lighting systems as the birds are sensitive to heavy light exposure,” R. A. Rajeev, Metropolitan Commissioner, MMRDA, said.

He also said CCTV cameras would be installed throughout the bridge. “These cameras are command-controlled and will automatically report any mishaps on the bridge, while also working as a security measure. The MTHL is a one-of-its-kind mega project in the world. It will consist of six lanes and one emergency lane and plans to cut short the travel time from two-and-a-half hours to 22 minutes,” Mr. Rajeev said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/upxttc/article30580085.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMMTHLFIRSTGIRDER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/uddhav-launches-first-mthl-girder/article30580087.ece
476,2020/01/17,"State govt. has funds to build statues, not for public health, says Bombay HC","The Bombay High Court on Thursday reprimanded the government for the delay in releasing aid to Wadia Hospitals, and said the State has money to build statues but not for public health.

A Division Bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and R.I. Chagla was hearing a public interest litigation filed by Sarva Shramik Sanghatna seeking release of funds from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the State government to Bai Jerbai Wadia Hospital for Children and Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital.

As per the trust deed signed by the hospitals, the maternity hospital receives grants from the State and the BMC, while the children’s hospital gets funds from the civic body. The BMC held back money from its December payment, citing irregularities. This led to protests by current and former employees over unpaid salaries and pensions.

‘Release by Friday’

Advocate Girish Godbole, appearing for the State, informed the Bench that the Finance Department has sanctioned ₹24 crore for the maternity hospital and will release it within three weeks.

The Bench, irked by this statement, said the amount should be released by Friday. The court said, “The government wants to build Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue taller than the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel statue. For all this money is there, but those people whom Ambedkar represented all his life can die? Do people require medical aid or statues to rid themselves of ailments and diseases?”

Public health has never been a priority for the government, the Bench said, adding that the Chief Minister is busy inaugurating bridges. “We thought there are new faces at the political helm … all these matters won’t come to court. This does not augur well,” it said.

‘Disgusting’

The Bench went on to say that in Mumbai, which is considered the country’s commercial capital, people from the poorer section of society are refused admission to a charitable hospital.

“This is disgusting. How can people, mainly women and children, be refused admission to hospital? Children are dying and the State machinery is not doing anything in States like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat … should we have the same situation in Maharashtra?”

The court said hospitals are finding it difficult to cater to the needs of patients due to lack of funds.

“These patients cannot afford private hospitals as they are mainly from the poor section of society. They require urgent medical attention. In such circumstances, the State government is obliging nobody by making statements that funds have been sanctioned,” it said.

The BMC counsel also told the court that it will release ₹14 crore for the children’s hospital.

The court directed the government to submit accounts of its finances and will hear the matter on Friday.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/mz2r2w/article30580043.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMWADIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/govt-has-funds-to-build-statues-not-for-public-health-says-hc/article30580044.ece
477,2020/01/17,"Fewer crimes in Navi Mumbai, but women still unsafe at home","The annual report of the crime registered in Navi Mumbai has revealed a dip in the total number of cases as compared to 2018. Meanwhile, cases of cheating, economic offences and crimes against women have increased.

Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar unveiled these statistics at an annual police press conference at CBD Belapur on Thursday. “This year, the focus was on the quality of investigation. Navi Mumbai has one of the best detection teams. We have been able to solve many big cases, including the IED bomb case in Kalamboli, some serious cheating cases and fake call centres which cheated U.S. residents. Taking suo moto action, we also cracked down on two multi-level marketing schemes before anyone was cheated,” Mr. Kumar said. According to him, even with two elections and several rallies, the city remained peaceful in 2019.

A total 6,895 offences were registered in 2019 of which 4,929 were solved. This was a drop of 118 cases from 2018, which saw 7,013 crimes, of which 5,077 were solved.

Crimes against women stood at 10.78%, an increase from the 9% recorded in 2018 with 56 more cases being registered this year. Of these, 169 complaints were of rape, 251 of molestation, 174 were of dowry harassment and eight cases were dowry harassment coupled with abetment of suicide.

“In only one of 169 rape cases was the accused an unknown person. Fifty-seven offences were committed on the promise of marriage, and in a whopping 111 cases, the accused was a friend or a relative,” Mr. Kumar said.

He also revealed that cash gold and other valuables worth ₹28.93 crore were stolen, of which around ₹9.18 crore were recovered. In 2018, the figures for the same were ₹26.57 crore and ₹7.96 crore respectively. “For 2020, we aim to increase the percentage of recovery as for the common man, this matters the most,” Mr. Kumar said.

According to him, drug menace and cyber crimes are social issues and awareness was required to curb the two. “We are conducting regular seminars to curb them. We also have three teams working on drug cases and in 2019 we had 154 offences registered under NDPS Act while only 44 were registered in 2018.

478,2020/01/17,Pune-Jaipur flight lands in Mumbai after glitch,"An IndiGo flight from Pune to Jaipur made an emergency landing in Mumbai on Thursday morning after the pilot noticed a glitch in the engine, forcing it to divert.

The aircraft, an Airbus 320 neo with a Pratt & Whitney (PW) engine, has since been grounded in Mumbai. The incident resulted in the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), calling for a report.

A spokesperson of the airline said, “An IndiGo flight operating from Pune to Jaipur was diverted to Mumbai this morning. During the flight, the pilot observed an engine vibration message and followed the laid down standard operating procedure.” All passengers were accommodated on another aircraft, which was flying to Jaipur. The aircraft is under inspection in Mumbai.

DGCA directive

On Monday, the DGCA had extended the deadline for the budget carrier to replace all 135 unmodified PW engines on A320 neo aircraft from January 31 to May 31. In a statement, the DGCA said, “Post the DGCA order dated November 1, 2019, all stakeholders — the airline, aircraft and engine manufacturer — have made significant efforts towards completion of the task. They have jointly and severally submitted a complete action plan, which finds the change of engines for the entire fleet feasible by the end of June 2020.”

The DGCA said the process involved procurement of 135 engines and month-wise details had been worked out to achieve the goal. The DGCA said, “Needless to say, the timeline looks impressive if we recall that originally it was expected to be accomplished in 14 months — from November 2019 to December 2020.”

However, the DGCA said it felt the target could be compressed further and should be achievable by May 2020. “It is further laid down that no aircraft with unmodified engine in the IndiGo fleet shall be allowed to fly after that,” the regulator said.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/hn1bvc/article30579921.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMINTERGLOBE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/pune-jaipur-flight-lands-in-mumbai-after-glitch/article30579922.ece
479,2020/01/17,"Navi Mumbai Police say stalking, kidnapping complaint against DIG baseless","The Navi Mumbai Police on Wednesday said their probe has revealed that the allegations of stalking and kidnapping levelled by the father of a teenage girl from Taloja against Nishikant More, Deputy Inspector General (Motor Transport), Pune, are baseless.

At a press conference, Ashok Dudhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II), said the complaint against Mr. More was filed by the victim’s family on December 21 to frame him. He said, “After analysing the CCTV footage and the call detail record, it has been established that the victim was not kidnapped and her family members made up the incident.”

The police said at 9.06 p.m. on December 21, the 17-year-old victim made a call to the police control room claiming that she had been kidnapped by Mr. More. Later, a video of the victim’s father pleading with Mr. More’s driver to reveal her whereabouts went viral. The family claimed that Mr. More had been stalking their daughter and had now kidnapped her.

However, the investigation revealed that the family found Mr. More’s car parked outside a building at Kharghar Shilp Chowk at 8 p.m., where he and his wife were meeting a doctor. The call records showed the victim’s brother and his friend, Ankit Singh, planned the kidnapping. CCTV footage confirmed the victim, her brother, parents, Mr. Singh and other two friends were at the location. When the girl called the police control room, she is seen standing next to her mother in the footage.

After speaking to the police, she is seen making two calls to her father, who then catches hold of Mr. More’s driver seated in the car parked outside the building. The police said they might book the family for obstructing a public servant from performing duty and providing false information to the police.

On Tuesday, the Taloja police brought the missing teen from Dehradun along with Mr. Singh, who was arrested on Wednesday under Section 363 of the (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 8 (sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. According to the police, they have found photographic evidence which fits into Section 8 of POCSO.

Victim went ‘missing’

The victim had accused Mr. More of molesting her on June 5, 2019, during her birthday party at her house. On January 6, she went missing after leaving a suicide note behind. Mr. Singh later confirmed that he and the victim first boarded a train from Kharghar to Kurla and then took a train to Allahabad, where they stayed with his relative. On Monday, the duo went to Dehradun.

The Navi Mumbai Police with the help of the Special Task Force of Uttar Pradesh then found the duo and brought them back to Mumbai. Mr. Singh has been remanded in police custody for 12 days. Calls to the victim’s father for a comment remained unanswered.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/igr1g9/article30579888.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/11BMMore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/police-say-stalking-kidnapping-complaint-against-dig-baseless/article30579889.ece
480,2020/01/17,Civil Aviation Ministry opens window for registration of drones,"To facilitate identification of civil drones and operators that do not meet regulatory norms, the government has launched a one-time opportunity to voluntarily register them.

The registrations, which began on January 14, will be open for a fortnight. It will provide an accurate number of drones in India, estimated to be between 4 lakh and 6 lakh.

Smit Shah, director of partnerships, Drone Federation of India, said the drone policy did not first account for the drones existing in the market. He said, “The exercise will give us a picture of who owns what kind of drone in which part of the country. This data will help in making policy decisions and should ideally become the base for understanding the scale of drone operations in India.”

The policy essentially saw drones as a new product and did not consider all the drones in the country. Since one cannot retrofit the drones in the market to comply with the rules, it was decided to hold a one-time voluntary registration.

All drone operators are required to register on the Digital Sky portal: http://digitalsky.dgca. gov.in. They will be issued an Operator Acknowledgement Number (OAN) and a Drone Acknowledgement Number (DAN) for each drone registered under the operator’s profile.

However, possessing a DAN or OAN does not confer any right to operate drones in India if it does not fulfil the provisions given in the civil aviation requirements (CAR).

Mr. Shah said, “Finally, there is a way to get existing drones in the legal framework and only if you register then in the future probably you will be considered, and some sort of a structure will be formed in which you can fly. This may enable flying of drones easily in the future while maintaining high standards of safety, security and accountability.”

After the January 31 deadline, ownership of a drone without a valid DAN or OAN shall invite penal action under sections of the Indian Penal Code.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/tpjurc/article30579458.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17BMINDEXDRONECAMERA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/civil-aviation-ministry-opens-window-for-registration-of-drones/article30579459.ece

The rejig has resulted in secretaries considered close to the previous Bhartiya Janata Party-led government being relegated to low-key positions. Special Inspector General of Police in charge of Maharashtra Cyber Cell Brijesh Singh, who is also Director General of Information and Public Relations (DGIPR), was relieved of his additional responsibilities.

The new DGIPR will be 2004-batch IAS officer D.D. Pandharpatte, who is currently posted as the Collector of Sindhudurg. Mr. Singh, a native of Nagpur, was considered to be a confidant of former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.

Among other major changes, Pravin Darade, additional municipal commissioner of the Brihanmumbai Muniicpal Corporation, has been transferred as Commissioner (Social Welfare) in Pune. A 1998-batch IAS officer, Mr. Darade had served in the Chief Minister’s Officer as a secretary in the previous government.

Sales Tax Commissioner Rajiv Jalota has been shifted to the Rural Development and Water Conservation Department as an Additional Chief Secretary.

The current secretary of the department, Aseem Gupta, has been shifted to the Energy, Industry and Labour Department as Principal Secretary.

For many, this may sound a bit childish but the crowds gather here in droves for the affordable and diverse menu and friendly service.

The Funnel Hill Creamery originally started out in Delhi but the franchise came to Hyderabad with a somewhat different menu for appeal.

Hits: In-house ice creams, mac ‘n’ cheese, burgers

Misses: Mocktails

“We are adamant in not taking to the biryanis since that is not what the brand is about,” says one of the partners Vinay Krishna, who partners with Charan Teja, “and we did our research in what the market wanted or was missing. We serve sourdough bread here and we have put a disclaimer board, informing people about the benefits of this type of bread. But fortunately, people have really leaned into it. We are currently the only place in Hyderabad selling Blue Tokai Coffee. We are about to launch a new menu this month!”

The breakfast menu at The Funnel Hill Creamery is worth waking up a little extra early. They boast some of the city’s fluffiest eggs, indulgent yet not sickening smoothie bowls and perfectly balanced bubble waffles.

The bubble waffle trend has been prevalent in the country for a while now — mainly for its prettiness — but only a handful of places manage to pull them off. The restaurant also offers a range of toasts topped with fresh ingredients such as avocado, hummus, bacon or berries, among many. And, of course, one can indulge in French toasts and pancakes. The best part is that one can enjoy breakfast items through the day here.

Teamed with the Blue Tokai coffee range, expect a memorable spread. The mocktails are not anything to write home about; they are a little oversweet with an excess of ice. If you do order one, ask the team to take it easy on the extra chill.

The lunch and dinner menus keep the restaurant busy throughout the day, too. Burgers are nestled with sourdough buns, while still being delightfully soft, and the skinny fries that come along with them are in a reasonable portion.

The All Day Chicken Burger at The Funnel Hill Creamery, Hyderabad | Photo Credit: Sanjay Borra

The All Day Chicken Burger is one of the bestsellers for its delicately spiced mince chicken patty teamed with greens, onions, tomato, cheese and an homemade sauce that does not overpower. Two people can share this if they are not famished and the kitchen can divide the burger neatly.

If you’re feeling particularly indulgent, try the mac ‘n’ cheese topped with crisp golden breadcrumbs and a fried egg with a gently runny yolk. As most good mac ‘n’ cheeses, multiple cheeses were used as the base, seasoned lightly. This is a dish ideal for after a long hectic day, but do not let it get cold.

The Funnel Hill Creamery has a wide range of in-house ice creams as its name suggests and they are freshly-made, says Vinay. From fruity to classic to unconventional, there is a flavour here for everyone. If you’re not into ice cream, try their cheesecakes which are light and tasty.

The menu there gives the fried rice and Hakka noodles a miss, and instead explores Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese and Malaysian food. For the Ramen lover in me nothing was more exhilarating than the soup bowls and pho. Without much ado, I order for Spicy Chicken Miso Noodle Soup and in a matter of 15 minutes piping hot soup filled with noodles and half of a soft boiled egg is put before me. The ramen is served in a brown soy beans-based broth. This is accompanied by minced chicken that is spiced up with gochujang (Sweet, spicy and fermented and made from red chilli powder, glutinous rice, meju powder, yeotgireum, and salt). The broth that has a significant amount of miso paste (made from soybeans fermented with salt) also has generous helpings of zucchini, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and spring onions.

“The broth for all the soups is brewed overnight for at least eight hours so it can develop its strong flavours. For Spicy Chicken Miso Noodle Soup the dominant flavour is that of soybeans,” says the head chef Imitaz Ahmed who has worked with a luxury hotel for over 18 years.

Around 5 am, a team from the restaurant brings in the vegetables and meat fresh from the market. The indigenous vegetables are bought from Rythu Bazar while non-local ones are procured from vendors. These are washed, dried and chopped to be used during the day. The end of the day sees the broth being prepared and it is left to simmer all night.

Any self respecting Asian food restaurant should be proud of its dumplings and this one offers seven varieties including the prawn dumpling, chilli oil scallion dumpling and corn and mushroom open dim sum. I order Fish Suimui Open Dumplings filled with minced basa fish. They are steamed, soft and filled with juicy fish garnished with diced bell peppers. These are served with a spicy fish-based sauce and a tangy tomato-based sauce.

The Barbeque Chicken and Egg Noodles I still have the space for is served with a sunny side up egg. The brown noodles are spicier than they look. They are tossed with broccoli, spring onions and diced carrots. The chicken has a spice run and is barbecued just right.

All that spice has me craving for something sweet and I gratefully look on as a cool serving of Thapthim Krop a popular Thai dessert. Bright red cubes of water chestnuts (called Thai Red Rubies) are coated with the creamy and thick layer of sweet coconut milk.

485,2020/01/17,"We the people: how the country is reclaiming democracy, one symbol at a time","Dalit human rights activist Martin Macwan mailed last week about a project that Navsarjan Trust is launching. A wooden toy house that will be used to teach citizens the basic provisions of the Constitution — what does the structure’s foundation represent, what do its many doors stand for, its wide-open windows and so on. On January 25, the eve of India’s 71st Republic Day, the programme is to be inaugurated.

I was delighted with the mail — I see in it yet another way in which the ongoing anti-CAA protest has helped us, almost as it were, rediscover the country and our relationship with it. In all these years I have not seen the Constitution, the samvidhan, being touched and discussed and shared by the masses with the intimacy and familiarity of a Sholay script. Whether smarmy TV anchors or young lawyers, whether students or homemakers, taxi drivers or actors, the Constitution is today their lodestar, in exactly the way its framers had intended it to be.

In school, we had to mug up the Preamble to the Constitution for exams. In adulthood, this simple yet powerful manuscript found no place in the ugly political jungle we had created. Now, as it is read out loud by crowds ten thousand strong in protest after protest, you realise that this is exactly how it should be. The preamble says, “We the people of India… give to ourselves this Constitution,” and when ordinary people declaim it in public, one sees democracy reclaimed and played out in the very theatre of its origins.

Reclamation — that is the overwhelming victory the protests have already won. Ordinary people, the Amars, Akbars and Anthonys, have wrenched back one democratic symbol after another, symbols that had slipped so far out of the nation’s grasp in these last six years as to engender a real fear of their being lost forever.

When the absurd rule to play the national anthem in cinema halls was introduced, I remember how infuriated it made me. I love singing the anthem, but I was damned if I would let a bunch of loony thugs force me to do so. By taking control of the anthem, by dictating who should sing it and where, the grinches stole the anthem and took its essence away. To see people harassed and beaten up if they didn’t sing it was to see the anthem itself being manhandled and polluted.

So, when a bunch of slogan-shouting bullies descended upon a Delhi park, it was terrific to see the protestors gathered there burst into ‘Jana Gana Mana’. They simply drowned out the shouting and forced the gang to retreat. The telling thing here is that the bullies did not join the singing, but nobody beat them up and nobody asked them to go to Pakistan.

There is an artlessness in the plain singing of the anthem that one need not intellectualise too much. It is important, instead, to understand its power to move and to signify. And that power the people have recovered. In protest after protest, the anthem is being sung today the way it’s meant to be — freely, willingly, joyously. And everywhere the tricolour is unfurled, sometimes several kilometres long, in potent contrast to the saffron flags of the self-proclaimed nationalists.

Gandhi’s ‘Vaishnava Janato’ has been rediscovered, if it ever went away. And the very first line, vaishnava jana to, tene kahiye je / peed paraayi jaane re (call that person a sage who feels the pain of others), establishes a rich irony — that a prime minister from Gujarat claims ownership of all things Hindu and yet misses the main point of this Gujarati bhajan by Narsi Mehta.

From foods to clothes, from universities to PhD degrees to even Urdu, the government has systematically distorted ordinary, familiar things into twisted, angry shapes, creating monsters from memories. The peaceful face of Hanuman now snarls in anger from car stickers and the Muslim prayer la illaha ilallah is held up as some sort of menacing bogeyman.

In this atmosphere of hate and bigotry, to hear Faiz and Habib Jalib quoted night after night is to thumb your nose at the trolls in no uncertain fashion. And when you hear the crowds chanting those infectious azadi slogans or shouting out Rahat Indori’s immemorial words, “Kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai,” you know India has reclaimed its voice again.

486,2020/01/17,Resilience was the hallmark of realty in 2019,"Resilience stood out as the hallmark of the real estate market in 2019 amid all-round economic slowdown. Propelled by reforms across several sectors, India travelled several notches up on the ‘ease of doing business’ metrics to be ranked 63rd in the 190-nation ranking. This holds out hope for the year 2020 after a year of sluggish demand. However, in contrast to depressing news from several cities, Bengaluru seemed to be bucking the trend in several sectors.

If year-end reports are to be believed, CRE (commercial real estate) leasing maintained a rising trend with the segment registering 47 mn.sq.ft, a 30% increase during the first three quarters of 2019, surpassing its previous peak of 2018. It is expected to go past 50 mn.sq.ft in 2020. Of these over 15 mn.sq.ft. came during the Q3 of 2019, a rise of 23% in nine metropolises. Four cities — Bengaluru, Hyderabad, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for 80% of the leased space in the first three quarters.

New supply

The same period witnessed 43 mn.sq.ft. of new supply of office space. Again the same four metropolitan cities accounted for the major portion of the new supply. Technology sector has been still holding the sway among the new occupiers and is expected to continue to do so in the new year. However, with co-working exerting pressure, the companies are likely to realign their portfolios in keeping with the trend favouring flexible and collaborative workspace. Flexible space operators are also likely to target Tier-I and Tier-II cities in the months ahead.

Retail

A CBRE report foresees retail demand to pick up during 2020 based on its strong showing during the year past. It expects 4mn.sq.ft. to 5 mn.sq.ft. of investment grade mall development to go operational by the end of 2020. The year 2019 saw an investment of $196 million in the sector, which was though slightly less but comparable to the one in 2018. Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad led the demand in retail space while in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, fine-dining restaurant and sports good brand were the main drivers in the retail sector.

Housing

Sale of residential units in the top seven cities saw a marginal 5% rise during 2019 over that of 2018 i.e., 2.61 lakh against 2.48 lakh units. However, the sales during H2-2019 declined by 22% against H1-2019 owing to economic slowdown.

A report by Anarock Property Consultants says the residential sector in these cities registered a 21% rise in housing supply with a total of 2.37 lakh units being launched in 2019. However, the second half of the year registered 30% less supply than the first half (i.e., 1.4 lakh units in the first half and 97,000 units in the second half).

The year witnessed fresh impetus for several flagship schemes of the Union government such as Affordable Housing, AMRUT, and Smart Cities which are likely to sustain and enhance growth in 2020. Setting up of an Alternative Investment Fund of ₹25,000 crore for the stalled housing projects by the Centre is in fact likely to boost the growth in 2020.

Segment-wise analysis by Anarock reveals that affordable housing continued its growth momentum in 2019 with overall new supply rising by 22% - from 77,590 units in 2018 to nearly 94,530 units in 2019. Of this, 54,660 units were launched in the first half alone.

Meanwhile, unrelenting liquidity crunch continues to grip realty. According to Shobhit Agarwal, MD & CEO, Anarock, the outlook for 2020 would depend on swift on-ground implementation of some of the previously announced sops including for stressed funds. Of the total $93 billion loans to Indian real estate, $14 billion (or 16%) is stated to be in ‘severe stress’ category, 62% (or $58 billion) is completely stress-free, while 22% (or $21 billion) is under pressure and can be potentially resolved. Of the ones under ‘severe stress’ category, MMR, NCR and Bengaluru share almost 80% of the amount. Of the loans extended to developers in Bengaluru, only 1% (or $160 million) fall under the ‘red alert’ category. Bengaluru owes its positive image largely to lower demand-supply mismatch and gradual rather than haphazard growth, concludes the Anarock report.

Among the projects in line for Ministry of Tourism and Culture aid are the Bahour Chola temple, libraries, museums, art and culture events and production of a film series on temples.

These projects will be jointly overseen by concerned departments of Puducherry, Additional District Magistrate, Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the South Zone Cultural Centre, Ministry of Culture.

The Ministry will extend support for expansion of existing as well as establishing new libraries under the Art & Culture Department in rural areas.

This would be achieved by augmenting existing resources andcreation of new assets in the form of books shelves, books and cost of refurbishing old buildings. These can come as grant in aid and be overseen by the National Library.

491,2020/01/17,Rajiv Gandhi Park is a picture of neglect,"Children are put to risk at the Rajiv Gandhi Children’s Park at Lawspet as play equipment are in a dilapidated condition and due to lack of lighting inside the premises.

The park, which is the only recreational facility for children, in one of the oldest and largest residential colonies once visited by hundreds of people. Its long neglect has resulted in damage to most of the play equipment.

Whether it is the slides, swings or multi-action play station, the installations are in a dilapidated condition putting a question mark on the safety of children playing in the area. Some of the equipment even have large gaping holes.

Apart from poor infrastructure, lack of proper lighting in the entire premises is another issue. “It once used to be filled with children and parents even on weekdays. But now hardly a few kids make it to the park and that too for playing some games,” said I. Raja, a scribe and resident of Avvai Nagar in Lawspet. R. Raghu, a resident of Ashok Nagar, said the park needs an urgent facelift. A majority of the playthings are in worn out condition. “I don’t allow my children to play alone as I am worried about their safety. Besides the poor condition of the equipment, lack of lighting is a big problem as anti-social elements come in during weekends. In the thick of darkness anything can happen.” According to S. Parthasarathy, a resident of Avvai Nagar, the park was the only facility available for children in the locality. The gates remained locked at all times with a chain preventing children from accessing the park.

Several schools which lacked proper ground used the park for allowing their students to play. Lack of regular maintenance has destroyed a good recreational facility, he said. “Due to the condition of our park, we have to take the children to the Venketa Nagar Park or Bharathi Park during weekends. But on weekends these parks will be full leading to overcrowding. The government should urge elected representatives to use local area development funds to maintain parks in their respective locality,” said Mr. Raghu.

According to educationist T. Poorani, lack of proper infrastructure was one of the reasons for poor participation on from the part of children in physical activity. “Children need to play. Lack of infrastructure, encouragement from the part of parents and teachers are the reasons that demotivate the children to engage in play,” she said.

An official said the government was working on ways to conduct regular maintenance of parks either using own funds or with corporate funding. The maintenance of Bharathi Park had already been taken up. The Rajiv Gandhi park too will have more facilities soon, the official added.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/962wkb/article30579599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH17PONDYUT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/rajiv-gandhi-park-is-a-picture-of-neglect/article30579600.ece
492,2020/01/17,Senkumar insults journalist,"Former State Police Chief T.P. Senkumar courted controversy on Thursday when he turned his ire on a journalist and went to the extent of asking him whether he was drunk. The incident took place during a joint press conference called by Mr. Senkumar and Bharat Dharma Jana Sena (BDJS) general secretary Subhash Vasu at the Thiruvananthapuram Press Club on Thursday.

Mr. Senkumar became indignant when journalist Kadavil K. Rasheed asked him about Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala’s remark that he regretted appointing Mr. Senkumar as DGP during the previous United Democratic Front government’s term.

Raising his voice, Mr. Senkumar demanded that the journalist identify himself and step forward. He also wanted to know whether he was drunk.

Members of Mr. Senkumar’s group tried to eject Mr. Rasheed, who is the Bureau Chief of Kalapremi Malayalam daily, from the hall. But they were stopped from doing so by other journalists who raised a protest and intervened.

Mr. Rasheed, who is recovering after medical treatment, displayed his press accreditation card to Mr. Senkumar before taking his seat. Mr. Senkumar also responded sharply to Mr. Vasu who tried to calm him down. Later, replying to the question, Mr. Senkumar said he had responded to Mr. Chennithala’s remark at Irinjalakkuda.

Mr. Rasheed said he had filed a complaint against Mr. Senkumar at the Cantonment police station.

Meanwhile, the Thiruvananthapuram district committee of the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) condemned the incident and demanded an apology from Mr. Senkumar. The police should register a case against the men who tried to manhandle Mr. Rasheed, the KUWJ said.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/senkumar-insults-journalist/article30579890.ece
493,2020/01/17,Alternatives to plastic galore at Suchitwa Sangamam,"Saju Ravindran lifts a bag made of newspapers that has two stones weighing a total of 10 kg inside. An ordinary newspaper bag that can carry such a heavy load without tearing seems impossible, but Mr. Ravindran says it is not only possible but also is probably the cheapest alternative to plastic.

There is nothing fancy about Mr. Ravindran’s newspaper bags, displayed at Suchitwa Sangamam, an exhibition of alternatives to plastic products organised by the Haritha Keralam Mission, Local Self-goverment Department, and the Suchitwa Mission, at the Sooryakanthi grounds, Kanakakkunnu.

Mr. Ravindran says the round base of the bag, like the columns of a bridge, plus the bonding material comprising white flour, alum, and copper sulphate make the bag sturdy by dispersing the weight. With handles made of jute threads, the bags are very economic; one can be made at a cost 10 paise. Moreover, these bags can be used two to three times.

The bags are ideal for production in home units as the raw material is easily available and they can be sold to nearby stores. With an increase in the number of such units, carry bags needed by people of the State can easily be made available, he says.

City residents worried about the plastic menace yet unsure of where to look for alternatives can head to the expo where there are alternatives galore. Cloth bags; bags and footwear made of bamboo, plaintain fibre, and screwpine; paper pens; coconut-shell cutlery, steel straws, plastic-shredding machine, biogas plants, and sanitary napkin incinerators are on display.

Corn starch

One stall has tableware such as plates, bowls, and boxes made from sugarcane bagasse, easily available as farm waste, and wheat straw. Sheets of the raw material are pulped, made into sheets, and moulded at high pressure. Another has juice containers made completely of corn starch and glasses and straws made of paper with a coating of corn starch, all imported. Spoons made of corn and potato starch are also worth taking a look here.

As the campaign against single-use plastics picks up momentum, one stall offers an alternative — cassava bags that degrade in 180 days, dissolvable in water at 80 degrees Celcius, and emit only carbon when burnt. The bags are even edible, the manufacturers claim, adding that they have the relevant certifications. The bags are available in different thickness and can be reused. They are inexpensive too, they say.

When it comes to single-use plastics, straws are counted among the biggest pollutants. An alternative is palm leaf straws, made by a Bengaluru start-up. Unlike paper straws, these do not become soggy.

Palm leaf instead of being dumped somewhere or burnt can be treated. They associate with 50 women self-help groups and are also in talks with the Kudumbashree in the State, thus giving a fillip to women empowerment. The straws come in different types – for cocktails, juices, and milk shakes. The prices start from ₹1.5 to ₹2.5 depending on the thickness.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/dr1g1r/article30579884.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17TVTVHARITHAKERALAM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/alternatives-to-plastic-galore-at-suchitwa-sangamam/article30579885.ece
494,2020/01/17,Digital varsity status for IIITM-K,"The Cabinet decision on Wednesday to elevate the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala (IIITM-K) as a ‘digital university’ is a big step forward for the institution that has introduced learning and research in a number of important information technology areas.

In its new avatar, it will be known as ‘The Kerala University of Digital Sciences Innovation and Technology’, continuing to focus on new digital technologies and related areas such as computational biosciences, informatics, electronics, and automation and digital humanities.

The hardware incubator Maker Village in Kochi functions under IIITM-K, and the varsity status will be a boon for it, IIITM-K said in a statement. The Cabinet decision has come at a time when the institution is set to shift to a new world-class facility in Technocity, Pallipuram.

Campus ready

“The campus is ready. We hope to move there in two-three months,” Saji Gopinath, Director, IIITM-K, said.

The ‘green campus’ will have a “learner-centric environment, facilitated by state-of-the-art infrastructure in cutting-edge areas in fast-paced technology domains,” IIITM-K said in a statement. It will also be equipped with an auditorium, administrative and academic blocks, students’ hostel, library and laboratory wing, faculty and non-faculty residences, director’s residence, and community centre.

The State government had established IIITM-K at Technopark in 2000 as an institution of excellence in science, technology, and management.

Affiliated to the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat), IIITM-K currently runs four MSc programmes — in cyber security, machine learning, ecological informatics, data analytics, and geospatial analytics.

It also has MPhil programmes in computer science and ecological informatics, besides doctoral programmes in computer science.

India’s first Blockchain academy, Kerala Blockchain Academy (KBA), was set up by the government under IIITM-K.

“The KBA has become the first official Hyperledger training partner in India after it was chosen by the US-based Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project as a feature member organisation for offering training courses.

The KBA is also a General Partner of R3 consortium of Corda Blockchain,” the statement said.

497,2020/01/17,Applications invited for allotment of space,"As construction of a new commercial complex at the old Thillai Nagar market site is nearing completion, the Tiruchi Corporation has invited applications for allotment of floor space to prospective tenants.

The old market at Cross VII of Thillai Nagar, which was in a dilapidated state for more than two decades, was demolished to make way for the new shopping complex. The project, taken up under the Smart City Project, is being executed at a cost of ₹15 crore.

Although the corporation had long been planning to redevelop the market for more than a decade, it managed to find capital only under the Smart City Project. The work on the project commenced in 2018 and the complex is expected to be ready for occupation within the next few months.

The complex would have about 50,200 square feet of floor space in basement, ground plus three floors. The basement would have parking area.

The civic body said that the commercial complex could be taken on rent fully or by floors by government or private agencies. As of now, the tentative rental value as per the Public Works Department guideline was ₹ 53 per square feet.

However, the rent would be subject to change depending on the completion date and the then market value, infrastructure and amenities provided. If there were multiple applicants the allotment would be made through auction or by calling for tenders, officials said.

Since the construction work was still under way, prospective tenants can seek changes to suit their requirements.

Given the rapid commercial development in Thillai Nagar in the city in recent years, the civic body is hoping to generate substantial revenue and hopes the complex would find many takers.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/applications-invited-for-allotment-of-space/article30588856.ece
498,2020/01/17,Man shoots himself with rifle,"N. Sasikumar, 31, a diploma holder, ended his life by shooting himself with a rifle here on Friday. He had a gun licence and was running a shooting academy for nearly two years behind his house at Santhosh Nagar.

He shot himself using a .22 rifle in his possession at his room. He had spoken to his mother in the house a few minutes before resorting to the extreme step, said a police officer. Hearing her cries, neighbours shifted him to the Mahatma Gandhi Government Hospital here where he was declared brought dead.

The police said he was a trainer in shooting. A bachelor, he was a member of the Tiruchi Rifle Club. His father was also a gun licence holder. He was training his wards with air gun.

Forensic experts and scientific assistants were pressed into service. The police said it was a case of suicide and detailed investigation would be done to determine the reason. The rifle was seized.

The bullet was removed and the body was handed over to his parents after completion of post mortem later in the day.

Calls made by Sasikumar from his mobile phone would be examined and those who were being trained by him would be inquired. The Airport Police have registered a case under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

499,2020/01/17,People throng tourism spots,"People thronged various picnic spots on the occasion of Kaanum Pongal here on Friday. They went to Mukkombu, Butterfly Park and Kallanai from Tiruchi and other nearby districts to spend time with their friends and relatives.

Mukkombu or Upper Anaicut witnessed a steady stream of visitors right from the morning. The crowd swelled in the evening, officials said. Flow of water in the Cauvery, unlike last year, added flavour to the festivity. They spent time at the amusement park and the garden.

Several of them brought food and snacks. Youngsters and children preferred to enjoy the day by swimming in the river while some attempted to fish.

‘We came here from Karur as my daughter lives in Tiruchi. We used to spend time at Mukkombu on Kaanum Pongal every year. Like making Pongal, it has become a family tradition,’ said M. Seethalakshmi, a visitor.

For some, the spot was the last stop before returning home in the holiday season. ‘We came to Tiruchi to spend time with our grandparents,’ said S. Sujatha, who works in Chennai.

An official of the Public Works Department said 3,530 tickets were sold on Friday. ‘Tickets were sold at ₹ 5 each. Parking fee for two and four-wheelers was collected separately. The total revenue stood at ₹ 30,050,’ he said. The number of visitors was significantly lower this year than in previous years, he added.

The Tropical Butterfly Conservatory, a popular picnic spot at Melur near Srirangam, overflowed with the arrival of a large number of people from Tiruchi. Puliyancholai and Pachamalai too witnessed a steady stream of visitors. A total of 2,587 visitors spent the day at the conservatory.

Thanjavur

The Big Temple was the prime spot for the ‘Kaanum Pongal’ revellers as the Sivaganga Park was closed by the corporation for renovation under the Smart City Project.

As the number of visitors swelled, the police was forced to close Big Temple Road for heavy vehicles and directed visitors to park their vehicles near the flyover traffic signal.

Raja Rajan Manimandapam on Tiruchi Road near the Collector’s camp office, the Iravatheswarar temple at Dharasuram in Kumbakonam too attracted a huge crowd.

Meanwhile, women took part in a ‘kolam’ contest organised by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Thanjavur Tourism Promotion Council and Inner Wheel.

500,2020/01/17,Harvester owners hope to reap profit this samba season,"This samba paddy season is all set to provide a bumper harvest not only for farmers but also for owners of harvester machines.

Timely availability of water for irrigation resulted in a good season and the crop will be ready for harvest during January-February in about 10 lakh hectares in seven districts in Tamil Nadu, according to official sources.

In addition to crop raised on about 3.50 lakh hectares in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, paddy has been raised in Ramanathapuram, Sivagangai, Pudukottai, and part of Villupuram districts will also come for harvest during this January-February period when normally the harvesting will be taken up in full swing in delta districts.

Since a bounteous harvest is expected, despite the Gall Midge pest and other pest attacks in some of the areas in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts, officials feel that the 30-odd harvesting machines owned by the Agriculture Engineering Department (AED) in the three districts will not be sufficient enough to meet the demand from ryots.

Hence, the farmers will be forced to hire machines from private players within the Delta and as well as from the neighbouring districts, they pointed out.

Thus, a meeting was convened by the Thanjavur district administration this week to fix the rental charges to be collected for the harvesting machines. While the AED will be charging ₹850 per hour for harvesting machines with tyres, private players have been allowed to collect ₹1,500 per hour for the machines. For the belt type harvesting machines, the AED will charge ₹1,400 per hour whereas the private players can collect around ₹2,000 per hour.

In Tiruvarur district, the AED will be lending the tyre type machine for an hourly charge of ₹1,200 and the belt type machine for ₹1,475 per hour.

Private players have been allowed to collect ₹1,500 per hour for tyre type machines and ₹2,000 per hour for the belt type machines, sources said. Meanwhile, enquiry show that it would take around 60 to 90 minutes for a harvesting machine to harvest paddy raised in an acre.

However, the farmers said, despite the fixation of charges by the government, the ryots normally end up by paying more for hiring harvesting machines.

Pointing out that the belt type machines alone can be deployed in the delta region in view of the moisture content in the soil, president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Welfare Association G. Sethuraman says private players always tend to cash in on the demand for belt type machines. If pressurized, the time taken for harvesting will get extended beyond the normal time required for completing the process, he added.

“Instead of issuing mere directions to private players, which on many occasions get overlooked, the government should think of extending subsidy of ₹750 or ₹1,000 per acre to farmers for harvesting,” Mr. Sethuraman said.

Expressing a similar view, secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association S. Vimalanathan suggested that the government allow farmers to use the harvesting machines of Agriculture Engineering Department free of cost. At the same time, the government should also keep a watch on private harvesting machine owners from harassing other ryots, he added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ksibls/article30582474.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY17-HARVEST5,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/harvester-owners-hope-to-reap-profit-this-samba-season/article30582475.ece
501,2020/01/17,Waste collection in Tiruchi neglected on festival days: residents,"Despite having made special arrangements for waste collection in the city on Bhogi festival, Tiruchi Corporation has been facing flak from residents for ‘tardy work’ on solid waste management post-Pongal.

The Corporation on January 13 opened five waste collection centres to ensure that citizens did not set them on fire. “A total of 1.5 tonnes of tyres, rags, old mats and pots were collected. They were all handed over at the centres and will be sent to the cement factories to be used as fuel,” an official of the civic body said.

The five centres were at Puthur near K. Abhishekapuram zonal office, EB road, Madurai Road and Raja Street (G corner), where sanitary workers received the waste handed over by residents.

From burning old material, Bhogi is increasingly witnessing burning of plastics and tyres, causing much air pollution. Residents who clean their houses ahead of Pongal usually burn the discarded items in front of their houses. “Pollution of that nature can cause severe damage to the lungs. To prevent it, such a move was formulated,” the official said.

Meanwhile, collection of clothes at Anbu Suvar - ‘Wall of Happiness’ set up near Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital, multiplied manifold. ""People who cleaned their houses, especially those in affluent areas, gathered their old clothes and decided to donate them to the less fortunate. There are at least four large gunny bags filled with clothes which are yet to be checked and arranged at the wall. There is no room for it at the moment,” said a guard manning the Wall.

However, the civic body appears to be struggling with garbage collection since Pongal, going by the dumping of waste at several road corners. “When we contacted our local sanitary workers, they said they were on leave and would only come back on Saturday. What are we to do until then? Food waste has accumulated and causing a terrible smell,” a resident at Thillai Nagar said.

Residents living in apartment complexes resorted to dumping their waste on the roadside, said M.Shanmughapriya, a resident of Woraiyur. ""Well-dressed men drop their garbage bags early in the morning thinking that nobody notices them. Will they like it if we all went and dumped our waste in front of their houses?” she asked.

“Cattle and stray dogs drag the garbage to our doorstep,” she added.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/6p9qvd/article30582471.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY17-GARBAGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/waste-collection-in-tiruchi-neglected-on-festival-days-residents/article30582473.ece

This time around cameras were also installed at the vaadivaasal from where the bulls were released after being subject to intense examination by veterinary team deployed at the spot.

The Tiruchi Rural Police had instructed the organisers to install surveillance cameras also mentioning the vantage points where the gadgets had to be fitted for closer examination of the entire event.

In addition to surveillance cameras, the event was recorded by police personnel using handy cams.

Superintendent of Police, Tiruchi Ziaul Haque told The Hindu that cameras were put up at vaadivaasal this time to ensure that the bulls were not poked while being released.

Police sources said cameras were also put up at the collection point at the end of the arena where the owner would capture his respective bull.

Cameras were also placed at the holding point where the bulls were lined up in a queue, the spot where the tamers are screened, the two stages besides at the location covering the entire arena where double barricades were installed up to a distance.

A dedicated team of police personnel were deployed to closely monitor the video footages generated by the surveillance cameras placed near the vaadivaasal.

The Tiruchi Rural Police had established a temporary control room at the event venue.

In addition to surveillance cameras put up by the organisers, the police for their part recorded the whole event using handy cams, SP Ziaul Haque said.

Manpower strength was augmented for the event by drawing personnel from neighbouring Perambalur and Ariyalur districts, said police sources.

Around 600 police personnel and some Home Guards were involved in bandobust duty and for regulation of traffic movements at the village, which wore a festive look, the sources added.

A police team on board a mini good vehicle was pressed into service inside the arena to pull those bulls which remained at ground after being released from the vaadivaasal. The vehicle was used to pull such bulls beyond the arena.

G. Ramakrishnan, Honorary District Animal Welfare Officer, Tiruchi, and one of the committee members nominated by the Animal Welfare Board of India to monitor jallikattu event, said there was no major injuries to the bulls.

503,2020/01/17,3 more smart toilets to come up in Tiruchi,"The Tiruchi City Corporation (TCC) plans to construct three more smart toilets in the city.

The first smart toilet of the city was inaugurated on Allithurai Road adjacent to Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Medical College Hospital (MGMGH) a few days ago.

A Chennai based firm set up the pre-fabricated structure on a 100 sq ft site. Unlike the conventional toilets and Namma toilets, the smart toilet has a provision for automatic cleaning. It cleanse the toilet once in 30 minutes.

Prior to it, it makes an automatic announcement about the flushing and cleaning process. The pressure pump set up atop the smart toilet enables flushing and cleaning easy and effective. It is user friendly.

Ever since the smart toilet was thrown open to the public on Sunday, it has largely been appreciated by users. It comes handy for the passengers, who wait for Allithurai, Somarasampettai and Vayalur bound buses and those visit MGMG Hospital.

“We are closely monitoring the functioning of the smart toilet and are collecting feedback from the users. The initiation reaction indicates that it is being received well.” says S. Sivasubramanian, Corporation Commissioner.

He adds that he will wait for a few more days to analyse the feedback. If it continues to receive well, three more smart toilets will be set up in the city. Srirangam, Golden Rock and Ariyamangalam zones would get each one smart toilet.

Mr. Sivasubramanian points out that it is easy to set up the Smart Toilets on platforms and pathways, as they may not require more than 100 sq ft.

504,2020/01/17,TDP seeks more time for raising objections on delimitation of wards,"Leaders from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), including two MLAs Velagapudi Ramakrishna Babu and Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar, and former MLA Palla Srinivas, submitted a memorandum to GVMC Commissioner G. Srijana demanding more time for raising objections on delimitation of wards and also rectifying certain defects in the delimitation, here on Friday.

‘Gross irregularities’

The TDP delegation told the GVMC Commissioner that there are gross irregularities in the delimitation and sought rectification. Speaking to the media later, Mr. Ramakrishna Babu said the number of wards were increased from 72 to 98 overnight without a proper dialogue with the stakeholders.

According to him, the delimitation notification was announced on January 10 and on January 11 it was issued in the gazette. “How can they increase the wards from 72 to 98 in just 12 hours?” he questioned.

He said that the window period for objection for delimitation was given from January 12 to 17, and working days in the window period was just two days (January 12 and 17). “How can the government expect a proper consensus or objection for that matter in just two working days?” said Mr. Ganesh Kumar.

According to Mr. Ramakrishna Babu, all delimitation as per the municipal rules should be taken up on geographical features and not on population census. “The authorities concerned should consider the city as a unit and not Assembly constituencies. This exercise is a farce and is being done to benefit the YSR Congress Party,” he alleged.

Earlier, the GVMC had completed the exercise of delimitation of wards from 72 to 81. The number of wards has been increased as per population—63 wards for 10 lakh population and 18 wards for 50,000 people each. It took up delimitation of wards as per 2011 population census.

505,2020/01/17,IT majors keen on setting up base in Visakhapatnam,"IT major Accenture is planning to set up shop in Visakhapatnam, while TCS has reportedly expressed its interest in launching a base in the city, said sources.

Minister for IT and Industries Minister Mekapati Goutham Reddy has reportedly held two rounds of discussions with TCS which has exuded confidence that it would set up a facility in the city soon. Capgemini and Accenture are also making enquiries on infrastructure available in the city, said sources. Uber recently announced that it chose Visakhapatnam as its base for its second Centre of Excellence in the country, with the first one located in Hyderabad.

Sources told The Hindu that TCS is interested in establishing a 1,000-seater facility subject to availability of suitable land. The city at present is home to HSBC, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, Conduent, Concentrix, WNS, Miracle Software, IBM, Patra India and other IT and ITeS units.

Out of an estimated turnover of ₹2,000 crore, 80% is from BPM units. IT Association of AP (ITAAP) projects a bright future for BPM units in the State in general and Visakhapatnam in particular. Uber recently started a CoE with an investment of USD 800,000 and promised to provide employment to 500. This was the first major project set up in the city after the YSRCP government made it mandatory to provide 75% of jobs to locals. Once the proposed executive capital is set up in the city, stakeholders in the industry feel that more companies will invest in the city.

“Though the proposals are at a nascent stage, in response to the encouragement given under India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS), many are coming forward to start their operations in the city,” STPI Joint Director M.P. Dubey said when asked about reports of TCS, Capgemini and Accenture evincing interest to launch their facilities here.

‘Prominent hub’

“Visakhapatnam, because of availability of industry-ready graduates from management, engineering and other professional colleges with good English knowledge and communication skills, is emerging as a prominent hub for BPM units,” he said. Under the IBPS, financial incentive of up to 50% of expenditure incurred on BPO/ITES operations towards CAPEX and/or OPEX on admissible items, subject to an upper ceiling of ₹1 lakh for every seat created is given.

The scheme also offers special incentives for employment of women and specially enabled persons. For those who generate jobs exceeding the target, local entrepreneurs and those creating opportunities in remote areas are also given financial support.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/it-majors-keen-on-setting-up-base-in-visakhapatnam/article30580088.ece

508,2020/01/17,"Of speed, control and adrenaline rush","The Sankranti revelry was at its peak on Thursday as the dusty open grounds at Krishnarayudupeta, a village along the district borders of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram, and three other villages in Chodavaram hosted the high-octane bullock cart races as part of Kanuma.

Well, historically there is no documentation of the races, but the natives say that they have been participating in it since the last seven decades. “The race could be a few centuries old, but I remember seeing my grandfather participating in it,” says Addepalli Palaveli, a resident of Chukkapali.

Light, yet strong

The race is unique as bullock carts are specially designed for the purpose. Usually, a bullock cart weighs around 1,000 kg, but the carts used in the race are around 250 kg. These are much lighter, but the wheels are much stronger.

Many use teak wood for building the carts. The wheels made up of wood with a rubber lining get a better grip on the clay. Their spokes are reinforced with iron rods, says Mr. Palaveli, adding that the cost of each cart varies between ₹50,000 and ₹1 lakh.

“The lighter the cart, the faster it moves. But, there is a risk. At times the riders get thrown off the cart during the race, injuring themselves,” says Apparao, a participant from Chodavaram.

At Krishnarayudupeta, as many as 18 participants from the neighbouring villages in Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts threw their hats into the ring to win the prize money of ₹10,000. However, it is not all about the prize at all.

Pride at stake

“It is not about money, but pride. Winning the race is not only an individual achievement but also a matter of pride for the village. It is the prestige of the village at stake,” says Mr. Palaveli.

The participants practice for the race at their respective villages for over a month.

According to the participants, a lot of technicalities are involved in the race. “Once the bulls get going, there is no looking back. Speed has to match the control. At times, the speed touches 60 km per hour. At times, riders bite the tail of the bulls to move them faster,” explains Mr. Palaveli.

Each cart is pulled by two bulls, mostly Mysore breeds . They are fed well and trained through out the year for the big day, says another participant.

Be it at Chodavaram or Krishnarayudupeta, around 10,000 people gather at the race venues. Some even bet their money on participants.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/tahwv9/article30579897.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1717VZ2BULLOCKCARTFEST2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/of-speed-control-and-adrenaline-rush/article30579901.ece
509,2020/01/17,HRF alleges violation of PESA Act in ZPTC quota,"Taking exception to the allocation of seven Zilla Parishad Territorial Constituency (ZPTC) seats to general category and four to BC (women), Human Rights Forum (HRF) has said not allotting even one ZPTC seat to STs in the Visakhapatnam Agency is nothing but a violation of the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, popularly known as PESA Act.

“The ZPTC seat in Anantagiri, a tribal mandal, has also been allotted to non-tribal category. The Section 4 (G) of the PESA Act says that all sections should have representation on a population basis in the areas coming under the Fifth Schedule and half the seats should go to adivasis. All president and sarpanches should be adivasis,” said HRF State general secretary K. Sudha.

Land encroachment

HRF district president M. Sarat alleged that non-tribal people have encroached a huge tract of land in the tribal areas in violation of the PESA Act, 1/70 Land Transfer (Prevention) Act and their population has increased over a period of time. “Now, they are demanding that pattas be allotted to the land in their possession. This poses a threat to the very existence of tribal people,” said Mr. Sarat.

510,2020/01/17,Spurt in cybercrime frauds keeps police on their toes,"The sharp rise in cybercrime cases in the city has kept the police on their toes. Police records suggests that as many as 201 cybercrime cases were reported from the city in 2018 which increased to 369 last year.

The worrying factor is the amount of property lost in regular property offences including house break-ins, robberies, snatching and others is less than the that of cybercrime cases.

Statistics available with the crime wing suggest that the total property loss in 849 property offences is around ₹6 lakh, while the figure for cybercrime cases has been put at around ₹7 crore.

UPI frauds

A majority of of the cases include frauds involving banking UPI transaction and One Time Password (OTP) among others, while the rest are online second hand market, lottery frauds, social media crimes, said Cybercrime Police Station Inspector V. Gopinath,

“We arrested 95 persons for their alleged involvement in 65 offences last year. Around 30% of the cases have been detection, while the percentage of property detection has been put at around 8%,” Mr. Gopinath told The Hindu.

Major achievements

The Cybercrime Police Station in the city has brought laurels to the Police Department by cracking sensational cases last year. About 26 persons were arrested in a sensational fake online dating website case in October. Teams from Visakhapatnam went to Kolkata and arrested the fraudsters on charge of duping people of around ₹18 lakh.

Another case that made the headlines was the arrest of four persons who allegedly made spoof calls by impersonating the likes of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, Telugu Desam Party president N. Chandrababu Naidu among other politicians.

Apart of these, the police teams nabbed major cybercrooks allegedly involved in job frauds from the Northern States.

Staff crunch

Even as the Cybercrime Police Station in the city is receiving the most number of cases in the State, it is reeling under severe staff crunch. At present, the police station has one investigation officer (IO), three sub-inspectors (SIs) and 25 other staff including constables.

According to a senior police officer, in a city like Hyderabad, there are eight IOs and 100 staff, but in Vizag, the staff is inadequate.

“Apart from staff crunch, what seems to be worse is that if a police personnel is deployed to other State to detect crime, they need to bear their expenses. The government should provide incentives to the officers working on cybercrime cases,” he said.

The police station needs at least five IOs, 15 SIs and 50 other staff members including constables, technical assistants and forensic experts, he added.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fl55kn/article30579728.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/17VZ3CYBERCRIMEKI22,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/spurt-in-cybercrime-frauds-keeps-police-on-their-toes/article30579729.ece
511,2020/01/17,Entrepreneurs and environmentalists come up with a range of eco-friendly products at an exhibition-cum-sale,"‘Suchithwa Sangamam’ at Sooryakanthi Grounds displays several alternatives to singe-use plastic that has been banned by the Kerala State government. The exhibition showcases a wide range of products by entrepreneurs from the State and other States too.

Ignited minds

Papla, a brand run by Devakumar Narayanan and his wife, Saranya SV, has products made of arecanut leaf sheaths (paala in Malayalam). Engineers in the UAE, they relocated to the State to start the venture, which they say is an attempt to reduce the use of “paper and plastic”. And therefore the name Papla, coined from paper and plastic.

Based at Neeleswaram in Kasaragod district, areca was a natural choice for the duo because the region has large-scale arecanut cultivation. “While living in the UAE, we found that areca products are in demand. So when it came to starting something of our own, we decided to work with areca,” Devakumar says. Saranya adds that through Papla, they are able to generate income for several women in the neighbourhood. The products, most of them customised, are exported. “Domestic demand is picking up. Besides tableware, we have badges, canvas board and the traditional areca sheath hat once used by farmers working in the paddy fields,” they say.

Nithin Raj and Harsha Puthussery from Kozhikode chucked their jobs to open their start-up, Iraaloom, which sells cotton and paper shopping bags, utility bags, booklets, files and customised eco-friendly gifts. “We decided to do something on our own that is eco-friendly. We are also empowering women by making them a part of this initiative,” Nithinexplains.

Also grabbing eyeballs at the fair are a group of students of University College of Engineering, Karyavattam. They make catchy designs on used bottles and turn them into works of art. “We either sell them on online platforms or distribute among our friends,” says Fidha Abdul Kader, a student.

Innovative products

Paper straws aren’t the only alternative to plastic straws, proves Bengaluru-based Evlogia, which has stocked organic straws made from palm leaves. “The leaves become brittle when they are dry. So they are put through chemical-free processing,” says Joshy John, operations manager of the brand, Leafy Organic Straws. The product is available in different sizes and varieties. “Currently our focus is on export. However, we’ve got enquiries from the local market and have already provided straws to a couple of restaurants in Varkala,” he adds.

Shijo Joy, Abhijith A and Ajith S, pursuing their post graduation in environmental science at Mahatma Gandhi University, have showcased straws made of “invasive grass species”, commonly known as ‘potha’ or fountain grass, which belong to Pennisetum grass family.

“They grow in abundance near railway tracks and are mostly burnt or destroyed. But we found that once cleaned of all impurities and fungi, they can be used as straws,” says Shijo.

Products made of bamboo, plantain fibre and screw pine, cassava bags and containers made of corn starch, and seed pens have also been exhibited.

Upcycling mode

Grameena Padana Kendram, Karakulam, has a stall where cloth or saris brought in by customers are turned into attractive bags. “We teach them how to tailor bags. Kids’ dresses can also be upcycled into colourful bags,” says V Sreekantan, coordinator of the Kendram, a rural study centre of Karakulam Grama Panchayat.

Radha Gomathy’s collection of upcycled bags made from tailoring waste and export furnishing pieces is another treat. Products by Bhagidhari, an “eco group” include multi-purpose bags in cotton and jute in mindboggling designs and colours.

Going creative

Craftsman and sculptor John Baby makes toys using coconut leaf fronds.... bird, fish, snake, chameleon, hat, grasshopper…. “Creating something for children is not child’s play,” says John, who will hold workshops at the venue. Coconut shells turn into amazing creations at the hands of artisans of Thirunelveli-based Kavin art gallery. Jewellery, pendants, candle stands, name plates, kitchen ware.... have been showcased at the stall.

Biogas plants, compost gardens, sanitary napkin incinerators and plastic-shredding machines have been exhibited.

512,2020/01/17,Vloggers from Kerala capital speak about what keeps them going,"Have you heard of Dravyapara? Well, cycling enthusiast Vishnu Lal R just came up with a post in his vlog Kcyclopedia — Kerala’s Cycling Encyclopedia about this picturesque spot at Amboori on the outskirts of the city where he went for a cycling trip. Maintained with his friend Krishnamoorthy G V, the YouTube vlog aims at promoting the benefits of cycling.

“It may not be obvious in terms of page views or subscription numbers, but the influence goes beyond. If at least one person a day decides to go cycling after watching our vlogs, wouldn’t that be great?” asks Vishnu. He points out the “instant impact” of visuals over wordy text. “Visuals stay better in one’s mind. After all, it’s the age of Netflix and videos are a way of communication that’s growing more popular,” he adds.

Cycling vloggers Vishnu Lal R (left) and Krishnamoorthy G V | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

With videos becoming the zeitgeist, vloggers from the city, like Vishnu, are commanding a substantial viewership in the digital space, aided by the boom of social media. With content on diverse topics — from travel, food, tech, books, automobiles, agriculture and even law and finance – grabbing eyeballs, the trend of vlogging has caught on. Recently, TechnoparkToday, an online publication, organised a Trivandrum Vloggers’ Meet, bringing together video bloggers from and around the district at the lush green environs of Green Tsavorite in Varkala to help connect them for exchange of ideas, experiences and techniques of their craft.

“We had sent out invitations and 25 vloggers were selected depending on the quality and reach of their videos. The focus was on knowledge-sharing as each vlogger employs a different approach,” says Suryajith Kattappana, co-founder of TechnoparkToday.

It’s YouTube channel, launched six years ago and with close to 2,700 subscribers, chiefly chronicles lives of techies and life in the city. “Anything of interest to techies, be it lifestyle, food, hang-out spots or emerging trends, find space in the channel, apart from interviews with achievers,” says Suryajith.

Lifestyle, more specifically travel and food, seems to top in terms of popularity, with cinema too finding many takers. Lifestyle vlogger Kiran Deepu, whose YouTube vlog Nikkis Cafe has about 14,000 subscribers, says he essentially vlogs about “my interests and whatever I spend my time on.” A techie, Kiran started Nikkis Cafe four years ago while working in Chennai. Initially, he chronicled his life and travels in Tamil Nadu.

“My first video was a documentary of sorts on AVM when the famous production house completed 70 years. Later, I did one on actor Ajith, which went viral. Now, I don’t restrict himself to any topics or categories,” he says. Kiran is happy to point out that his video review of the recent box-office hit Anjaam Pathiraa was shared by its lead star Kunchacko Boban on his Facebook page.

Anupriya Raj, who works with Doordarshan, is a travel junkie and her YouTube channel, Anu Vibes, captures her excitement off the beaten track. “I once made a travel video on a Munnar trip I undertook and that boosted my confidence to vlog more,” says Anupriya, who was part of the vloggers’ meet in Varkala.

Anupriya Raj | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

She then learnt to use home video-editing software Windows Filimora and Final Cut Pro for her posts. “When you travel, you may otherwise just see the sights or click photos. But vlogging helps me mingle with more people and ask more questions. It’s a good way to learn about the places,” she adds.

For vlogger couple Vishakh Babu and Amala Gopan, a visit to Langkawi in Malaysia after their wedding six months ago provided a launchpad for their channel, Travel Techies. Vishakh, a shutterbug, says their vlog is an amalgamation of his twin passions — travel and photography.

“Travel comes as a break from work for us. But instead of simply going for a trip and forgetting the experience, we want to chronicle it. Such memories will be there on our channel, which we can revisit and re-live any time,” he explains. They also bring out videos on “general, useful” topics such as ‘All about FASTtag’ and ‘How tea is manufactured.’

From a young age, reading has been a passion for Smitha Jayakar. So much so that she started her YouTube channel, Reads & Roads Cafe, in 2017 to help others inculcate the habit.

“A good way to keep one’s interest going is by sharing your experiences with others. My vlogs are an extension of my hobby,” says the Kochi native who works for an IT firm in the city.

With the spurt in number of restaurants, the food culture in the city has witnessed a massive growth in the last few years and we have food vloggers unearthing new flavours and trends for gourmets. Like Anjana Gopakumar who regularly posts “mini videos” about her culinary experiences on her food blog ‘Thank God I am Fat.’

Food vlogger Anjana Gopakumar | Photo Credit: Special Arrangement

While she focussed more on food reviews earlier, Anjana, who studied culinary arts at Manipal University, says she is now zeroing in on “telling stories about people” and their adventures involving food. “I like to explore the nuances of each cuisine. For example, if someone asks me for the difference between a dimsum and a dumpling, I’ll be happy to explain,” says Anjana, a member of the EAT — Eat at Trivandrum team. She is planning to launch her own dedicated YouTube channel soon.

As competition hots up in the “game for numbers” due to a cornucopia of material to choose from, for followers, quality and quantity too matters.

“The reach of vlogs is vast and unpredictable, thanks to multiple platforms for sharing. An interesting video can immediately go viral. Perhaps, today, more people are watching videos than reading text,” says Renjith Ramachandran, co-founder of TechnoparkToday, while stressing the importance of making the presentation and narrative attractive for more “hits.”

So, let’s vlog on to...",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/iooy6f/article30584939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/18tvmVloggersmeetatVarkala,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/vloggers-from-kerala-capital-speak-about-what-keeps-them-going/article30584940.ece
513,2020/01/17,Connecting the world through dance,"Veteran dancer and choreographer Jonathan Hollander founded Battery Dance ( a community into art education) in Lower Manhattan in 1976.

Six years later he founded the Battery Dance Festival which is now New York City’s longest-running public dance festival. Widely recognised as one of the outstanding choreographers of his generation, his works have been presented in major theatres and festivals across five continents.

He co-founded the Indo-American Arts Council in 2000 in New York City and served on its Board until 2018. Jonathan was named Adjunct Professor by the Indian Institute of Finance and represented the U.S. performing arts field at the inaugural conference on Soft Power in New Delhi in December, 2018.

In an email interview with The Hindu MetroPlus, Jonathan shares his journey in dance and views on contemporary dance in India.

The founding of Battery Dance in 1976 changed the way contemporary dance was experienced. Tell us about those early days?

The dance world in New York in 1976 was transitioning from the modern dance pioneers such as Martha Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor to a new generation of creators in a more conceptual vein. The classical ballet world was in the final brilliant period of Balanchine and Jerome Robbins and there was a pretty clear distinction between ballet and modern. That gap has since disappeared and big ballet companies regularly commission contemporar

y choreographers and contemporary dancers often study ballet as their technical foundation. For me, the availability of well trained ballet dancers with a modern sensibility has been a boon and inspired my movement vocabulary

Your association with India and Indian dance goes back to the nineties. How do you see the evolution of contemporary Indian dance culture in the last two decades?

When I came to India on a Fulbright lecturing assignment in 1992, there wasn’t much available in the way of ballet or modern/contemporary training. Few ventured into an experimental territory and those that did faced vocal criticism for being un-Indian. Nowadays with people like Sumeet Nagdev, Terence Lewis, Ashley Lobo and institutions like Attakkalari, change is happening rapidly.

India has a rich history of traditional dance but contemporary and modern dance is still quite untapped. Comment.

Chandralekha, Kumudini Lakhia, CV Chandrasekhar, Mrinalini and Mallika Sarabhai, Manjusri and Ranjabati Sircar all proved that one could bend the classical vocabulary to suit a strong individualistic sensibility. I think it just takes determination and many today have that in full.

There is an explosion of dance in small cities in India— Cinematic dance, Bollywood etc. What do you have to say about this trend?

I support dance of all genres. I do hope that people don’t confuse or lose sight of the fact that it takes years of meticulous training to really master any form.

On a personal note what is your relationship with dance and what does it mean to you?

Dance is the funnel into which I pour my passions and ambitions. I feel lucky that I have been able to pursue a lifelong career that has had so much richness of experience, relationships and inspiration

Tell us about your Kerala connect. What are you going to talk about and showcase here?

I am bringing the new documentary film that has attracted so many awards and has touched audiences in film festivals and exclusive screenings in the U.S. and internationally since its première at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in February, 2018. I am excited to interact with artists and students at Lokadharmi and College of the Sacred Heart and share this inspiring film with them.

514,2020/01/17,Visakhapatnam’s Zoological Park awaits for more animal adoptions,"The Indira Gandhi Zoological Park spends nearly two crores a year just to feed its animals. In order to provide beter healthcare and diet, the zoo has been running an animal adoption scheme since 2011. While you cannot take the animals home, the adoption amount is spent for their fodder and health care. People who wish to ‘adopt’ an animal can do so by taking care of its maintenance costs for a year, or even for a day.

“The benefits of adopting an animal goes way beyond just healthcare and fodder, it helps people to understand the massive effort that goes into caring for these animals. It gives them an insight of the workings of a zoo,”says R Yeshoda Bai, curator of the zoo. “Though we have been trying to push the adoption scheme, we haven’t seen a great response from the public. In 2018-19, the zoo saw 16 ‘year-long’ adoptions. This year that number has fallen to 10. There are 30 ‘daily adoptions’ so far this year,” says Yeshoda Bai.

About the zoo The Zoo was opened to the public in May, 1977.

It is a part of the Seethakonda Reserved Forest and is spread over 625 acres.

IGZP is home to over 800 animals belong to 90 species.

All the donations from the adoption programme are exempted from taxes.

Huge hoardings have been put up at various locations in the zoo to raise awareness among the citizens.

The adoption list has 24 animals. It was recently updated to include a pair of zebra and Sarus crane that were brought to IGZP last year. To adopt a pair of zebra for a year, animal lovers will have to shell out ₹60,000. To adopt them for a day, one has to pay ₹ 330. One Sarus crane is available for four days at ₹ 100 while one has to pay ₹ 10, 000 to adopt them for a year.

“The most expensive adoption is an elephant at ₹ 4.3 lakh for a year. This figure was calculated in 2011 when the scheme was introduced. However, we have refrained from escalating the cost as that would mean almost doubling the amount mentioned here,” she says. The animals available in the price range of ₹ 10,000 to ₹ 25,000 are the most popular one for adoptions. “Tigers are usually adopted for a single day mostly by children. Most parents readily agree to it as it costs only ₹600,” she says. Birds are another crowd favourite as their yearly adoption ranges from ₹1000 to ₹9000 a year. The daily amount for a few birds is as low as ₹100. In a month’s time, the zoo is launching its own website through which people can adopt animals.

The three animals that no one has ever adopted are the Elephant, Rhinoceros and Giraffe. “While it is an expensive proposition for individuals, corporate houses could definitely adopt them under their CSR activities,” she says adding how several companies and educational institutes have been approached by the zoo to do so.

When Laxmi Narayan Sastry, manager of warehouse at Pharmazell Vizag Private Limited was assigned to look for CSR initiatives, the animal lover already knew what he wanted to support. For the last three years, the company has adopted a Star tortoise and some love birds. “We were helping out in infrastructural developments in villages, but when the staff of the zoo reached out to us with their adoption scheme we included animal welfare initiatives in our CSR,” says Sastry.

The adopters are also given a certificate. “For those who pay more than ₹30,000 for adoption entry to the zoo is free for the year,” adds Yeshoda Bai",environment,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/vyt5wx/article30585241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16VZHIPPO,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/visakhapatnams-zoological-park-awaits-for-more-animal-adoptions/article30585244.ece
