1,2020/02/03,Sports Ministry diktat to Volleyball Federation of India,"The Sports Ministry has asked the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI) to conduct its elections by March 2020.

In its letter dated January 31, the Ministry said, as per the provisions of the National Sports Development Code of India (NSCDI), a National Sports Federation is required to convene its Special General Body meeting over four years (or earlier as required under the tenure of office bearers) to elect members to the Executive Body including the president and secretary.

With the existing NSDCI provisions, the letter from the Ministry further said, it is clear that the tenure of existing Executive Body of VFI is for the period 2016-2020 and it will end on April 10. Hence, it suggested that VFI conduct elections preferably one month prior to the expiry of its current term i.e., before April 10 2020.

With regards to complaints received from one Dr. Anil Agarwal, Member of Parliament of Rajya Sabha that despite Court orders, VFI is not granting affiliation to certain State Associations, the Ministry said it is waiting to hear from VFI at the earliest.

2,2020/02/03,"Premier Badminton League | Rituparna, Loh Kean Yew do it for Aces","Pune 7 Aces rode on the brilliance of Rituparna Das and Loh Kean Yew to score an emphatic 4-1 win against Awadhe Warriors to virtually assure themselves of a place in the last four stage of the Premier Badminton League championship at Gachibowli Indoor Stadium here on Monday.

In the first match of the evening, former world champions Ko Sung Hyun and Shin Baek Cheol of Awadhe raised the bar in the decider to hand over the first loss this season to a fighting Chirag Shetty and Hendra Setiawan.

In the decider, it was anybody’s game even before Chirag faltered with his net game – committing three unforced errors in crunch time. This saw, the Awadhe duo came back strongly to clinch the issue.

Then, Awadhe suffered a huge blow as World No. 14 Beiwen Zhang, playing the Trump match, suffered a shock defeat taking on World No.100 Rituparna Das for the first time in her career.

It was a splendid display by Rituparna, especially her ability to return most of the big smashes and the vastly superior net game being the decisive factors against the former India Open champion.

“I really happy with this win which was my first against her. I played it safe, ensured didn’t make too many mistakes. And, the team supported me really well. Well, this is a very special win for me,” said a visibly delighted Rituparna later.

Later, former World championship silver medallists Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock scored a fluent win over Ivan Sozonov to give Pune a 2-0 lead.

With Loh Kean Yew winning the Trump match for Pune against Subhaknar Dey, the contest was over with Pune 7 Aces taking an unbeatable 4-0 lead even before the last match was on.

Ajay Jayaram won against Kazumasa Sakai to score the consolation point for the losers.

The results: Pune 7 Aces bt Awadhe Warriors 4-1 (Chirag Shetty & Hendra Setiawan lost to Ko Sung Hyun & Shin Baek Cheol 15-6, 9-15, 12-15; Rituparna Das bt Beiwen Zhang (T) 15-13, 15-12; Chris Adcock & Gabrielle Adcock bt Ivan Sozonov & Christina Pedersen 15-6, 15-9; Loh Kean Yew (T) bt Subhankar Dey 15-12, 15-14; Kazumasa Sakai lost to Ajay Jayaram 15-6, 10-15, 13-15).",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/dn99lw/article30728736.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04RITU,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/premier-badminton-league-rituparna-loh-kean-yew-do-it-for-aces/article30728737.ece

5,2020/02/03,"13 minutes, $13 million: The logistics of pulling off a Super Bowl halftime show","The popular Super Bowl halftime show is only 13 minutes long, but the million-dollar-a-minute extravaganza takes thousands of people, months of planning and near military precision to pull off.

Organizers have the Herculean task of turning a football field into a concert venue and back in less than half an hour, and without damaging the playing surface.

Halftime at Sunday's 54th Super Bowl between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs in Miami was headlined by Latina pop stars Jennifer Lopez and Shakira. It also featured surprise artists and other ensemble singers, said Dan Parise, a producer working with Roc Nation, the entertainment company producing the show with the National Football League.

PepsiCo is sponsoring the show for the eighth straight year. A source with direct knowledge of the show said it would cost about $13 million, a figure an NFL spokesperson declined to confirm.

“There are so many aspects of it, the dancers, the lighting elements, the special effects,” said Parise. “It's like a big jigsaw puzzle.”

The work starts almost a year in advance, said Mark Quenzel, the NFL's senior vice president for programming and production. Organizers scout the venue for logistical hurdles or unique structural elements they could use to their advantage.

In 2014, for example, producers had to keep Bruno Mars show relatively simple, because it was impossible to predict field conditions at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, a rare outdoor cold weather Super Bowl.

This year, said Parise, a newly renovated overhang at Hard Rock Stadium allowed for deployment of more advanced audio equipment.

All in, the production takes 2,000 to 3,000 people to produce, said Quenzel, who is on his 10th halftime show.

Like past performances, this year's show will include an on-field audience of some 800 people, mostly kids from local schools who are cast in advance, and must rehearse with the artists.

Often, they are asked to play a larger role than that of cheering fans. During Justin Timberlake's 2018 rendition of Mirrors, the on-field crowd held up mirrors to reflect stadium lights.

Like air traffic controllers

The biggest feat of coordination is setting up the stage, which is wheeled in on 38 separate carts, each requiring 12 people to move. Another 18 carts, with 6-member teams, carry the audio equipment.

Like air traffic controllers, team leaders wearing headsets direct each team. A stage piece ending up in the wrong place, even by an inch or two, could be disastrous, Quenzel said.

The setup takes eight minutes, with the show itself lasting about 13. Removing the stage takes just over six minutes, Quenzel said, before the teams retake the field.

During the show, behind-the-scenes personnel wait in predetermined spots to carry away clothing during wardrobe changes that must be executed down to the second, Quenzel said. Part of the art of the show is what we don't show you, what you don't see, he said.

An example that stands out to Quenzel was in 2015, when pop star Katy Perry wanted to sing her hit, ‘Roar.’

She and the producers thought it would be fun if she entered riding a golden lion. The 6.1 metre mechanical beast was set on wheels concealed by legs that were pushed back and forth by performers to mimic footsteps.

For such a massive spectacle, there is precious little time to rehearse. Shakira and Lopez began separate rehearsals as early as December, Parise said, but had only a few days to practice together.

Rehearsals mostly took place at the Miami Dolphins practice facility, before moving to the Super Bowl stadium on Wednesday. We were working 12-to-15-hour days, Parise said.

Communication is another challenge. In addition to the hundreds of people hired by the NFL, each artist brings enormous teams of dancers and staff. To get everyone on the same page, producers hire veteran industry pros, including producer Ricky Kirshner and director Hamish Hamilton.

Sunday's show is said to feature plenty of special effects and dancing. But with all that goes into planning, it is important to remember the show is not the main event, Quenzel said.

“It's never lost on us that we're the side show,” he said.",other sports,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/5hnk1/article30724092.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKFOOTBALL-NFL-SUPERBOWLHALFTIME,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/13-minutes-13-million-the-logistics-of-pulling-off-a-super-bowl-halftime-show/article30724093.ece

8,2020/02/03,Tata Open Maharashtra | Viktor Troicki fights back to pack off Nagal,"Viktor Troicki staved off a stiff challenge from Sumit Nagal, winning 6-2, 6-7(4), 6-1 to enter the second round of the Tata Open Maharashtra at the Balewadi Stadium here on Monday.

The Serbian’s current ranking of 191 is deceptive at best, for he was once ranked as high as 12 in the world.

Against Nagal, the 33-year-old drew upon his rich experience to turn a match that Nagal had seemingly taken charge of towards the end of the second set and the start of the third.

Troicki won the first set in quick time, breaking Nagal in the first and seventh games. But in the first half of the second set, Nagal finally found the game to match Troicki’s.

Big aces

Up 2-1, he had the 33-year-old by the throat at 0-40, but Troicki snuffed out three of four break opportunities with big aces and held to make it 2-2.

Troicki appeared to land the decisive match-turning break in the very next game, converting his fifth break-point opportunity to go up 3-2.

But Nagal struck back immediately, with his ploy of moving Troicki end-to-end and then opening up the court working well. Nagal’s next three service games were tidy before he made the play on the Troicki serve at 5-6.

Fluffs two set points

Nagal, with some deep, pin-point returns took time away from Troicki and hurried him into errors.

Two set points were his reward, but the home favourite fluffed both, first sending a backhand cross-court wide before dumping a pass into the net.

Nagal, however, composed himself to take the ensuing tie-break for the loss of four points, with two great inside-outs from 5-3-up sealing it.

Carrying the momentum

The 22-year-old carried the momentum into the third set and was presented two opportunities to break in the very first game.

But Troicki saved both, the second with a forehand that just about caught the tramline by a millimeter.

It was the oxygen that Troicki needed and he took five of the next six games to romp home.

Earlier, in the day’s opening match, last year’s finalist Ivo Karlovic was beaten 6-3, 6-4 by Germany’s World No. 149 Cedrik-Marcel Stebe.

A break each in the sixth game of the first set and the fifth game of the second set was all that was required as the Croat struggled to combine his huge serve and fine volleying into a match-winning tactic.

The results (first round):

Cedrik-Marcel Stebe (Ger) bt Ivo Karlovic (Cro) 6-3, 6-4; Yuichi Sugita (Jpn) bt Thomas Fabbiano (Ita) 6-3, 6-0; Viktor Troicki bt Sumit Nagal 6-2, 6-7(4), 6-1.

10,2020/02/03,‘Greatest’ tag there for the taking,"Novak Djokovic put Roger Federer on notice as he won his 17th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open and warned he was going all-out for the Swiss' record of 20 — and his mark for weeks as World No. 1.

Relentless

Djokovic, who came through a mid-match slump to win his eighth title in Melbourne, is relentlessly totting up the victories that could soon end the debate over who's the greatest in history.

The five-set victory over Dominic Thiem was his eighth in eight finals in Melbourne, putting him alongside Federer and Nadal as the only men to win the same Slam eight times.

It makes Djokovic, 32, the first man in the Open era, and only the second in history, to win Grand Slam titles in three different decades — and as a not-insignificant bonus, returns him to World No. 1.

Ominous sign

In an ominous sign for his rivals, the Serb has started the year unbeaten with Wimbledon, the French Open, the Tokyo Olympics and the US Open all lying in front of him as tantalising opportunities.

He is clear-sighted about his goals: overtaking Nadal's 19 Major titles and Federer's 20 to become the all-time Grand Slam king, and outdoing the Swiss master's record 310 weeks in the top ranking.

Djokovic has so far clocked up 276 weeks as No. 1 and could pass second-placed Pete Sampras's 286 in April, and Federer's 310 on October 5.

“Obviously at this stage of my career, Grand Slams are the ones I value the most. They are the ones I prioritise,” said Djokovic, adding “there's a lot of history on the line”.

“Grand Slams are one of the main reasons I am still competing and still playing full season, trying to obviously get the historic number one (record). That's the other big goal,” he said.

Huge win

With five Major titles in just over two years, and unbeaten by Nadal and Federer at the Grand Slams since 2014, there's no question who's now the leading member of the ‘Big Three’.

The latest rankings tell the story at the top of men's tennis: Djokovic is number one, Nadal, one year older at 33, is second and 38-year-old Federer is a relatively distant third.

Seven-time Major winner Mats Wilander said Djokovic’s win in Melbourne sets a marker for a year in which he could sweep all before him.

“At the end of the year, we could have two players on 20 or two on 19 or even more because Novak can win all four,” he said.

“This is a huge win for him going forwards. A loss here would have been very difficult to get confidence and come back. But the door is open for him to start climbing through it and talk about being the greatest ever.”

As he jets out of Melbourne, his name etched yet again on the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, Djokovic warned that his confidence and expectations were soaring.

Confidence boost

“I'm super-happy with the way I started the season. It kind of sets the tone for the rest of the year,” he said.

“To start off the season with a Grand Slam win significantly boosts your confidence and your expectations are quite high for the rest of the season. But whatever happens, this season is already successful.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/eopnld/article30728604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04JOKER,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/greatest-tag-there-for-the-taking/article30728605.ece
11,2020/02/03,Hungry to reach the next level: Ankita Raina,"Ankita Raina is happy about the strong start for the season. If you think winning the double crown in Nonthaburi in the $25,000 ITF women’s event last week was special, the 27-year-old Ankita puts things in perspective by pointing out that she had finished the last season with a double crown in Solapur.

“I am glad to continue from last year when I ended on a winning note. But, I am not satisfied. I am hungry to reach the next level. I want to have a good performance in the Grand Slams. I will use this confidence to lift my game and get the next big result,” said Ankita, when contacted in Thailand.

The early exit at the Australian Open was a disappointment, but Ankita pointed out that she was helpless because of the suffocating conditions.

“I was disappointed with the qualifying match at the Australian Open because I didn’t feel usual that day. I think, somewhere the smoke also played a part. I didn’t feel physically great which hampered my performance,” she said.

Elaborating further, Ankita threw more light on her situation. “In the morning when I got to the venue, I could see the sky wasn’t clear. I remember blue sky from last year in Melbourne. This was smoke probably. From the beginning of my match, I was feeling tired and uneasy in my chest. It was strange when it was just two or three games into the match. I took the medical time out in the second set. I think it was 1-3, and I threw up. I asked for doctor. It was 2-3 when the physio came on court. I told them that I felt a burning sensation in the chest, my stomach was paining and I just felt drained. That was not usual for one and a half set. No way! I was just unlucky it happened on such an important day,” said Ankita.

Overall, she said that she was happy with her fitness and game, even though she was keen to step it up and reach higher standards.

“I have to keep getting better. I personally can see the improvement in a lot of aspects from the last one and a half years or so.”

Ankita was quite thrilled to win a doubles crown in front of her mother in Nonthaburi.

“With God’s grace, I have had my mother or team to travel with me. It makes a huge difference. Even just to have the moral support and have someone to help you with small things makes a lot of difference. I have travelled alone since I was 14 years old. That is a long time. I rarely get time with family. So, it was lovely to have mum with me here, and am more than happy to have my coach, my team for the Slams,” Ankita said.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/hungry-to-reach-the-next-level-ankita-raina/article30727180.ece
12,2020/02/03,"Bananaman, Nadal's kiss and a 'crazy aunt' - five Australian Open moments","From bushfire smoke to a memorable kiss and a controversial banana, the Australian Open was never short of incident.

Mother Nature roars

Melbourne's weather is famously fickle and Mother Nature — seemingly no fan of tennis — appeared determined to steal the show. Air pollution from Australia's deadly bushfires saw qualifying matches and practice sessions delayed, with organisers roundly criticised for not protecting players better.

Torrential rain — some of it a murky brown colour — helped wash the smog away, but that brought problems of its own, caking courts in brown sludge.

Next there was ferocious heat, with beaten semi-finalist Simona Halep saying that temperatures close to 40 degrees Celsius ""killed me"".

'Bananaman' slips up

France's Elliot Benchetrit was dubbed ""Bananaman"" by Australian media after handing the fruit to a ball girl during a qualifying match and asking her to peel it for him. Benchetrit argued that he was struggling to get the skin off because he had cream on his hands.

But umpire John Blom wasn't impressed and told him to peel his own banana, allegedly berating him for treating the girl like his ""slave"". As the controversy rumbled on, making headlines in Australia and beyond, the Frenchman complained that the backlash against him was ""out of control"".

Nadal's scary moment

She was very brave! https://t.co/4RS8Xz80Xb — Rafa Nadal (@RafaelNadal) January 23, 2020

Rafael Nadal melted hearts after rushing to console a ballgirl and kissing her on the cheek after one of his fearsome forehands thundered into the side of her head.

The Spanish world number one was in the throes of wrapping up his second-round clash against Argentine Federico Delbonis when the unfortunate girl found herself in his firing line.

Nadal went over to check how she was and gave her a quick peck on the cheek, leaving the youngster blushing.

Nadal called the mis-hit ""one of the more scary moments of my career"" and met 13-year-old Anita the next day to apologise again.

'Crazy aunt'

She is the most successful tennis player in history with 24 Grand Slam titles, but Margaret Court loomed ominously over the tournament she graced as a player.

Now 77, the Australian is a controversial figure because of her deeply conservative views, once saying that ""tennis is full of lesbians"".

She was granted a low-key ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of her calendar-year Grand Slam, but John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova were having none of it.

McEnroe labelled Court ""a crazy aunt"" and he and fellow legend Navratilova staged an on-court protest demanding Margaret Court Arena be renamed. They later apologised for breaking tournament ""protocols"".

Ashleigh Barty, a surprise loser in the semi-finals to eventual champion Sofia Kenin, caught the world's media off-guard by conducting her post-match press conference with a baby cooing happily on her lap.

Australia's world number one said 12-week-old niece Olivia, who seemed perfectly at ease in the spotlight, put her defeat in perspective.

But not everyone was amused, some accusing Barty of using the baby to deflect attention away from her loss.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/hstq02/article30724336.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AUSTRALIANOPENTENNIS,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/bananaman-nadals-kiss-and-a-crazy-aunt-five-australian-open-moments/article30724337.ece
13,2020/02/03,Tata Open tennis | A chance for Indians to hold centrestage,"Benoit Paire is a much-loved man in these parts. The Frenchman’s thrill-a-minute persona, a combination of some outrageous shot-making and his spontaneously combustible nature, have routinely kept Indian tennis fans on the edge of their seats.

But until such a time the showman is on show — not until Wednesday — it will be the turn of a bunch of Indians led by Prajnesh Gunneswaran and Sumit Nagal to shine in the limelight as the Tata Open Maharashtra gets underway at the Balewadi Stadium here from Monday.

Five of them will be in action over the next two days, including wild cards Ramkumar Ramanathan, Sasi Kumar Mukund and Arjun Kadhe.

For Prajnesh and Nagal in particular, the tournament will be an important marker. Prajnesh entered last year’s edition as India’s top-ranked player (107) and has done modestly well to retain that position and a ranking in the vicinity (123 as on Sunday).

But having scaled a high of 75 last April, the 30-year-old will no doubt want more.

“The goal is to climb as fast as possible and then eventually go back to the ATP tour like the tournament here,” said Prajnesh.

“Since the second half of last year, I wasn’t at 100%. But it is what it is and I still had a pretty decent Australian Open.

“I got in as a lucky loser but I obviously put myself in that position; ranked high enough and being in the final round [of qualifying].”

“I think I should have played better. But things are getting better. And I think my tennis is there. I’m constantly improving and once things fall into place, I will start getting results again.”

Measuring stick

For Nagal, the show court meeting on Monday with the accomplished Serbian Viktor Troicki, who came through the qualifying, will be a good measuring stick after the high of last year when he pinched a set off Roger Federer at the US Open. Breaching the top-100 and qualifying for the French Open on his beloved clay are his immediate targets.

“The goal is to break into the top hundred as soon as possible,” said the 22-year-old. “French Open is the first goal and then it's going to be the Olympics. I can't put too much pressure on myself. But to be honest I'm very excited and I have good feeling about it.”

Ramkumar, India’s third best singles player, has now slipped into the 180s, but when he takes on Italian Salvatore Caruso in the final match on Centre Court on day one, it will be an opportunity to show that he is no spent force.

Qualifying results (final round): Lukas Rosol (Cze) bt Matthew Ebden (Aus) 6-2, 7-5; Roberto Marcora (Ita) bt Blaz Rola (Slo) 6-4, 7-6 (4); Nikola Milojevic (Srb) bt Robin Haase (Ned) 6-3, 6-3; Viktor Troicki (Srb) bt Evgeny Karlovskiy (Rus) 6-2, 6-4.",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/kwat6t/article30720692.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03RAM,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/tata-open-tennis-a-chance-for-indians-to-hold-centrestage/article30720693.ece
14,2020/02/03,‘Novak has put Serbia on the map’,"Viktor Troicki was in a hurry. “I gotta go fast, it's fifth set, he’s just a couple of games away,” the Serb said after quickly wrapping up his final qualifying match. It was not long before Troicki watched Novak Djokovic — his Davis Cup doubles partner and one of his closest mates since their early days in war-torn Yugoslavia — win his eighth Australian Open and 17th Grand Slam title.

“Novak has put our nation on the map with all the things he has done for our country,” Troicki said. “He is the most famous person in the whole country and the region. People recognise it, kids want to be like him.”

The 33-year-old recollected those times back home when they were literally in penury. “We had nothing. There was no help from anyone except our parents, who were giving us everything they could. We had to go outside Serbia to even practice. Abroad, the kids that had everything — coaches, support behind them, the federations; we had nothing. We had to find it all on our own. That made us stronger and believe even more.

“Many, many, many players didn't make it, but we are the fortunate ones who did. Now, tennis has become very popular in Serbia, probably the most popular [sport] and because of Novak there are a lot of kids playing tennis. Federation is also supporting more and we have more clubs and more courts to play.”",tennis,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/8rbps3/article12032052.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-VIKTOR,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/tennis/novak-has-put-serbia-on-the-map/article30721698.ece
15,2020/02/03,NewSpace India: a podcast aiming to popularise discussions on India’s space programs,"A Twitter exchange between two vehicles operating outer space went viral in September 2014. NASA's Curiosity Rover, which had been on the Mars surface for two years, tweeted “Namaste @MarsOrbiter [the official account of India's Mangalyaan Mars probe]” and congratulated India on its first interplanetary mission. Mangalyaan quipped, “Howdy @MarsCuriosity? Keep in touch. I’ll be around.”

Within the first four hours of setting up its Twitter account, @MarsOrbiter had more than 32,000 followers and #Mangalyaan, #IndiaAtMars, #MarsOrbiterMission and #Martian were among the top 10 Twitter trends in India. This was one of the rare instances of a space-related topic being discussed by a mass audience in India. Apart from the historic space missions such as Chandrayaan, other activities by the Indian space communities are hardly heard by the hoi polloi. And, landmark lunar missions, unfortunately, are not weekly events.

Narayan Prasad’s podcast, NewSpace India, attempts to fill this lacuna in Indian space discourse. In his biweekly podcast, he interviews experts (including authors, researchers, scientists and lawyers) to shed light on the less-discussed areas related to space programs. The guests so far on the podcast include Arup Dasgupta, former ISRO scientist, Vasudevan Mukunth, the science editor of The Wire, and Rakesh Sasibhushan, the Chairman and Managing Director of Antrix Corporation.

Narayan co-founded Satsearch, a search engine for the space industry. He also started a Bengaluru-based company, Dhruva Space in 2012, which builds and launches small satellites. He did an Erasmus Mundus SpaceMaster (graduate course) with a scholarship from EGIDE (French Embassy Scholarship) at the end of which he got a Master in Space Technology, Sweden and a Master in Space Techniques and Instrumentation, France.

In one of his episodes, Narayan says, “There are hundreds of books that discuss the space programs from NASA or even the ones from Russia. And we read about the same characters. When it comes to Indian space programs, there is very little literature, apart from the academic stuff, that discusses the intricacies involved from the perspective of a general audience.”

Narayan wasn’t a space geek as a child. His interest in the subject, he says, happened by accident. “While doing mechanical engineering [in 2007], my friends and I were developing microwave vehicles, which are now called drones. One of our professors, made us collaborate on a project with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. So, that is how it started.”

Narayan’s podcast is just a part of the larger NewSpace India community that he started in 2015. “I have written a lot of articles for journals and edited a book. But the readership would always be little. When I started listening to podcasts from India, I thought this was a better way of discussing space-related stuff.”

The episodes of NewSpace India podcast — started seven months ago — get downloaded 650 times, according to Narayan. About 40% of the podcast’s audience is overseas. He reckons there is a lot of interest in space in India as well but the knowledge about it is less. “Whenever I interact with students, I can see their fascination for the topic. But that is not enough. We need to see how to build a career in it or analysing our space policies.”

For future episodes, Narayan wishes to focus on the history of India’s space programs. “Out of my first 15 episodes, only in two or three, I have discussed what happened in the 70s and 80s. I want to go back further and speak to the guys who worked in the 60s. They will all be quite old and it’s important to record their stories now.”

16,2020/02/03,Portable detector can detect concussion right on the field,"In good news for athletes or cricketers who suffer concussion on the field, a team of doctors and engineers has developed a noninvasive way to measure whether brain cells are in distress using an infrared laser.

The device uses optical fibers to deliver pulses of infrared light to a person’s forehead.

This light can penetrate through the skin and skull to the brain without doing harm, interacting with an important molecule for metabolism called cytochrome C oxidase, or CCO.

While existing technology can give real-time information on whether the brain is getting oxygen, this new device gives information about whether the brain cells are able to use that oxygen, said researchers from University of Michigan.

This could enable concussions to be diagnosed on the sidelines of the game, while also providing rapid feedback as doctors adjust treatment.

“At present, there is no one test that can diagnose a concussion. There’s no scan, no blood test, no computer test,” said Steven Broglio, director of the Michigan Concussion Center and professor, athletic training.

According to Rachel Russo, a trauma and emergency surgeon and clinical lecturer, this device could guide the treatment of more serious brain injuries and other conditions that put the brain at risk.

“It could help patients whose blood pressure falls so much that there isn’t enough blood flow to keep cells functioning normally,” said Russo.

Previous experiments used infrared lamps, but the signal from the CCO is not very distinct.

“Hemoglobin, which tells us about the blood oxygen levels, also responds to the range of wavelengths we use to probe CCO, and it is 10 to 20 times more plentiful in human tissue,” explained Mohammed Islam, professor of electrical engineering and computer science.

“We needed a stronger signal from the CCO to distinguish it from the hemoglobin and other molecules in the body, and we got that stronger response by using a laser that is nearly 10 times brighter than the lamps,” he elaborated.

The quicker you identify a concussion, the faster you can begin the recovery process of resting and gradually returning to normal activity, said researchers.

Research in the last 10 years has shown that resting sooner can shorten recovery time, helping people get back to school, work and military duty.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/migration_catalog/w22nha/article30725013.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/21isbsconcussi21ISBSCONCUSSIONSjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/portable-detector-can-detect-concussion-right-on-the-field/article30724975.ece
17,2020/02/03,Tech firms using big data to help fight novel coronavirus,"Chinese mobile operators and technology firms are supporting the tracking and prevention of pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus with the help of big data.

Telecom giant China Unicom has set up a group-wide team of more than 100 big data technicians and experts to provide data analysis and intelligent applications to the government using algorithm models, Xinhua reported on Sunday.

It provides big data analysis reports on epidemic-related population flow to 31 provincial traffic and health departments.

GeTui, a smart data provider, has studied the number of people travelling from Wuhan, the hardest-hit city of the epidemic outbreak in central China, and released their distribution density in a heat map.

Fang Yi, CEO of GeTui, said the travelers from Wuhan were distributed across a wide range of rural areas, especially in Henan, Hunan and Sichuan provinces, according to the heat map.

An official document has asked for efforts to mobilise communities and village-level authorities to launch grid-based health management, tracking the health of residents with the help of big data and the public.

Yonyou, a software and cloud services company, has updated its cloud service platform, using the Internet of Things and big data technologies to connect the supply and demand of medical resources between medical enterprises and hospitals at the center of the epidemic.

By Wednesday, the platform had released the demand for medical supplies of 30 hospitals, involving protective clothing, masks, goggles, surgical gowns and shoe covers.

Yonyou has gathered more than 50,000 security protection suppliers on its platform to provide corresponding supply channels with big data analysis, said the company.

From a heat map to a hospital map, from traffic information to epidemic news, Chinese technology firms have given full play to their advantages to provide the public with knowledge on the epidemic through big data mining.

Before going out, one can use the Baidu Map application to check the population density in business districts, hospitals and transportation hubs, in order to avoid crowded places, which is key to preventing and controlling the epidemic.

When medical treatment is necessary, one can check the list of nearby hospitals that have set up fever clinics using the Baidu Map or WeChat.

Staying at home, one can learn the latest epidemic news via smartphone. Epidemic information and protection knowledge collected with big data has been shared with nearly 80 million users every day through Toutiao, a popular news feed mobile app in China.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/7yqnlk/article30724512.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THBIGDATAFORHEALTHCARE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/tech-firms-using-big-data-to-help-fight-novel-coronavirus/article30724513.ece
18,2020/02/03,Huawei may avoid using Google Mobile Services again,"Reiterating the commitment to develop its own ecosystem, a Huawei executive has said that the company may not use Google Mobile Services for its future phones even if a trade ban limiting its use is lifted, the media reported.

According to a report by Austrian publication DerStandard, Huawei executive Fred Wangfei said the main reason Huawei does not want to go back to Google Mobile Services even after the ban is lifted is that there is no guarantee such a ban would not be imposed again.

However, the world’s second-largest smartphone seller may continue to use the open source Android platform.

As a replacement to the Google Mobile Services, the Chinese giant is building the Huawei Mobile Services (HMS), while its has also developed HarmonyOS, an operating system.

Under the terms of the previous US trade ban, Google was barred from selling Android license to Huawei, meaning its phones could use the base open-source code, but would not have access to the all-important Play Store and Google apps.

A temporary licence was issued which allows Google to support and update the Android OS currently running on existing Huawei devices. However, the trade ban has affected the development of future products.

“An open Android ecosystem is still our first choice, but if we are not able to continue to use it, we have the ability to develop our own,” TechRadar quoted a statement from the company as saying.

The Huawei P40 series, expected in March, could come with Huawei Mobile Services, said the report this week.

If HMS rolls out in future phones, Google may make its suite of apps such as Gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc. available on Huawei devices via this new shopfront just as the American search giant offers its suite of apps on the Apple App Store.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/24xocu/article30724459.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THHUAWEI,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/huawei-may-avoid-using-google-mobile-services-again/article30724460.ece
19,2020/02/03,Why drone delivery is not possible in densely populated areas,"Your dream to get a pizza delivered by a drone or an Amazon drone knocking at the door will remain a dream as researchers have revealed that a drone delivery service is not realistic and may not be possible in densely-pulated areas.

The reason is simple: Demand for drone delivery in e-retail is high but the ability to meet that demand is very low.

For a city like New York, the optimal design for the test locations, based on all factors, is three drone facilities covering 75% of NYC area and 34% of the population.

“Opening a fourth facility increases area and population coverage to 84% and 38%, respectively, but the increase in operation cost is not enough to cover the facility costs,” said the researchers from University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

“We analyse the tradeoffs between distribution costs and revenues under varying social difficulties with drones like customer preferences and regulatory and technological limitations,” said Fatma Gzara, a professor in the Department of Management Sciences at Waterloo.

“We then can make educated decisions on how many facilities to open, which services to offer at that facility and which services to make available to customers in certain areas,” she added.

The new research, published in the journal Transportation Science, looked at how possible and desirable it is to use drones for delivery for e-retailers considering cost and effectiveness in certain population areas and in certain locations.

The study, conducted by Gohram Baloch and Gzara, used New York City as an example and looks at data surrounding the Manhattan area.

The authors separated the area into boroughs based on population and size.

Baloch and Gzara said they chose New York because the world’s largest e-retail company, Amazon, first started its 2-hour delivery services in the Big Apple.

“Our results show that government regulations, technological limitations, and service charge decisions play a vital role in optimal configurations and drone target markets,” said Gzara.

“Under current drone landing capabilities, a drone delivery service may not be possible in a densely populated area like Manhattan where demand for such a service is expected to be high,” the researchers wrote.

e-retailers can reach smaller markets and more price-sensitive customers by possibly offering discounts on drone-delivered orders, the findings showed.",technology,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/wr9jv5/article30724424.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THFLYINGDRONE,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/why-drone-delivery-is-not-possible-in-densely-populated-areas/article30724425.ece
20,2020/02/03,Dell XPS 13 7390 review: Gives good game for the essentials,"There was a time when Dell and most other laptops were chunky, but as the design-conscious era hit, Dell outdid themselves. Everything became slimmer and lighter. There were the occasional touches of pastels and chunky golds in an attempt to spruce up the releases, but there is nothing like the sleek platinum or deep charcoal hues of gadgets.

The eco-tag of the series compensates: 25% of the material consists of ocean plastics collected from coastal areas, while the remaining 75% is made up of other recycled plastics. That said, the XPS series is a testament to intuitive and conscious design, and now it seems instinctive that a Dell should be on a person’s laptop usage timeline. So how does the XPS 13 7390 measure up?

Dell XPS 13 7390’s two colour variants

My review device came saddled with Windows 10 Home and an OS build of 18362.592, and thankfully, was not of the frosty gold variety.

Next gen display

XPS 13 7390’s size, though being 13.3 inches, feels more compact, perhaps due to its light nature. Sitting in a packed car or in a busy press conference was a breeze. What drew eyes around me was the display, which offers plenty to play around with, thanks to a next generation Infinity Edge display with an 80.7% screen-to-body ratio, plus the 60Hz refresh rate. However, at the start of 2020, we are here for 120Hz, which would be pretty slick.

Specifications Processor Options 10th Generation Intel® Core™ i5-10210U processor (6MB cache, up to 4.2 GHz, 4 cores), 10th Generation Intel® Core™ i7-10510U processor (8MB cache, up to 4.9 GHz, 4 cores)

Though a smaller device, watching movies or gaming is still enjoyable on the XPS 13 7390. Dell certainly delivers with the eye-catching 4K Ultra HD display, elevating gaming and photo-editing experiences. The XPS 7390 definitely had a leg up on my 13-inch MacBook Air for its 0.65% anti-reflective coating. Not being a fan of matte screens, the review device’s still-glossy visage is not compromised, if the 400-nit brightness and wide 178-degree viewing are anything to go by.

Clever features

Those who are ‘experience junkies’ can make the most of the Cinema features. CinemaColor does not overdo proportions of contrast and saturation, which is pretty constant across Dell displays. The Waves MaxxAudio Pro in the CinemaSound keeps things dropout- and scratch-free. In theory, CinemaStream’s Killer Wireless, leverages the user’s maximum bandwidth to play videos or music to steer clear of buffering — basically similar to Netflix’s Adaptive Streaming feature. I experienced numerous connectivity dropouts here, about every 10 minutes, which was a pain. This should not be an issue in the average household with a 100-megabytes-per-second connection.

The XPS 13 7390 sports a 16 gigabyte RAM and 10th Gen Intel processors, and, boy, does it use them well! I could seamlessly switch from a tension-heavy moment in Fortnite Battle Royale to a Google Docs file and back to Fortnite, without any glitches. On the other hand, my MacBook Air (2015 model) often slows down when a certain number of programmes are running, but I knew going into this review that shoving the Dell back into its box would be a solemn moment.

However, my MacBook Air does trump the XPS 13 7390 in that the battery power (charged by a standard USB-C charger) is far more pleasing. Despite Dell’s Power Manager, which helps users decide where and when the device uses power, the battery life of an-hour-and-a-half while transcribing and writing (with no background apps) is barely excusable. In such a case, I lowered the resolution of my display, since 4K Ultra HD has a habit of sapping energy.

Speaking of transcribing, journalist that I am, the keyboard and touchpad of a laptop make or break one’s usage. But the XPS 13 7390, to no surprise, offers a quiet and focussed means to get writing and browsing done. Plus, the ergonomics of the ever-so-slight tilt of the base makes for a comfortable wrist.

Personally, I am looking forward to the expected new member of the family, the XPS 13 9300, to not only make up for aforementioned drawbacks, but to see how Dell will take the XPS series forward.",gadgets,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/w7q6t/article30726538.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04bgdell4,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/gadgets/dell-xps-13-7390-2019-september-review/article30726539.ece

22,2020/02/03,"Huawei, Chinese chip makers keep factories humming despite coronavirus outbreak","Some Chinese technology firms are continuing to manufacture parts and products despite government calls across various cities and provinces for work to be halted as Beijing seeks to stop the spread of the coronavirus ravaging the country.

Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd said on Monday it had resumed production of goods, including consumer devices and carrier equipment, and operations are running normally.

The company restarted manufacturing in line with a special exemption that allows certain critical industries to remain in operation, despite Beijing’s call to halt all work in some cities and provinces.

The spokesman said most of the production was in Dongguan, a city in the southern Guangdong province.

Other companies have also kept production running, in some cases even through Chinese New Year, in a sign of the critical importance Beijing places on its domestic tech supply chain, a subject of friction with the United States

Yangtze Memory Technologies Co Ltd (YMTC), a state-backed maker of flash memory chips based in Wuhan — the city where the virus outbreak originated — confirmed on Monday that it has not yet ceased production.

“At present, production and operations at YMTC are proceeding normally and in an orderly manner,” a company spokesman wrote in a statement on Monday.

The spokesman added that no factory employees have been confirmed as infection cases, and that the company has enacted certain isolation measures and partitions to ensure the safety of employees.

State media reported that the chip maker did not cease operations over the Lunar New Year holiday.

Meanwhile, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) also kept production running throughout the holiday break.

In a post on social media on Monday, the company said that it organised a work group before Chinese New Year to ensure the plants could stay open, while protecting the safety of employees and adhering to government regulations.

“SMIC needs to ensure that factory production runs 365 days a year and 24 hours a day to meet customers’ fabrication needs,” the post read.

24,2020/02/03,"Boris Johnson, Michel Barnier talk tough on trade","Britain and the EU laid down on Monday their red lines for post-Brexit trade talks, offering contrasting visions for their future relationship that raise the prospect of clashes to come.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged not to “undermine EU standards”, after the U.K. finally went its own way on Friday after nearly half a century in the bloc and an 11-month transition period began.

Champion of free trade

But he envisioned his country as a global champion of free trade, emphatically rejecting EU insistence on full alignment with Brussels.

Worries over trade negotiations sent the pound sinking more than 1.1% against the dollar in London midday deals on Monday.

“I see no need to bind ourselves to an agreement with the EU,” Mr. Johnson said in a speech at the Old Royal Naval College, which chronicles Britain’s past as a maritime superpower.

“We will restore full sovereign controls over our borders, immigration, competition, subsidy rules, procurement (and) data protection.”

He added: “We will not engage in some cut-throat race to the bottom.

“We are not leaving the EU to undermine European standards. We will not engage in any kind of dumping, whether commercial, social or environmental.”

In Brussels, EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier formally offered a deep future relationship but only as long as Britain makes guarantees to trade fairly.

Mr. Barnier said fisheries and fair trade would be his top priorities in the talks, with a special focus on denying Britain “unfair competitive advantages”.

Brussels will offer a close post-Brexit trading relationship — but will demand tough terms on fisheries and a level playing field for businesses, he said.

His vision flies in the face of that of Mr. Johnson, who insists that Britain’s alignment with Europeans on rules and regulations defies the spirit of Brexit and was a thing of the past.

“We are ready to offer a highly ambitious trade deal as the central pillar of this partnership, including zero tariffs,” Mr. Barnier said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/qnadog/article30728769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Boris,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/boris-johnson-michel-barnier-talk-tough-on-trade/article30728770.ece
25,2020/02/03,United Kingdom to review terrorism laws,"British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed to end the early release of convicted terrorists after an Islamist attacker stabbed two people days after he was set free half way through his prison term.

Sudesh Amman, jailed in 2018 for possession of terrorist documents and disseminating terrorist publications, went on the rampage after strapping a fake bomb to his body and wielding a stolen knife on a busy London street on Sunday. He was shot dead by police.

He had previously praised the Islamic State, shared an online al-Qaeda magazine and encouraged his girlfriend to behead her parents.

Mr. Johnson said the government would announce fundamental changes in dealing with people convicted of terrorism offences, saying he had come “to the end of my patience” with freeing offenders before they had completed their sentences and without any scrutiny.

“I think the idea of automatic early release for people who obviously continue to pose a threat to the public has come to the end of its useful life,” he said.

“We do think it's time to take action to ensure that people - irrespective of the law that we're bringing in - people in the current stream do not qualify automatically for early release.”

The government has repeatedly promised tougher rules on terrorism since another former convict killed two people and wounded three more before police shot him dead near London Bridge in November.

Mr. Johnson said the instances of deradicalising and rehabilitating Islamists was hard and the instances of success were few.

Amman’s mother, Haleema Faraz Khan, told Sky News that he was a “nice, polite boy”, who was radicalised online and in prison.

“He became more religious inside prison, that's where I think he became radicalised,” she said.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the stabbing attack.

Britain has about 220 people in prison with terrorism convictions.

In 2016, Britain announced plans to isolate radical Islamists in special units in high security jails to limit their ability to influence other inmates amid concerns that prisons were breeding grounds for extremists.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/rh7cz/article30728730.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Sudesh-Amman,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/united-kingdom-to-review-terrorism-laws/article30728731.ece
26,2020/02/03,Democratic race opens with Iowa caucuses,"Iowa Democrats kick off what could be a bruising nominating process when they gather at caucus sites around the State on Monday to begin choosing a challenger to President Donald Trump.

At more than 1,600 schools, community centres and other public locations, voters will render judgment on a field of 11 Democratic contenders, led by front-runners Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice-President Joe Biden, who have battled for the top in recent Iowa polls.

The caucuses will begin on Monday at 7 p.m. CST (6:30 a.m. on Tuesday), and results are expected to begin rolling in within a few hours. Because voters may register as late as Monday, the caucuses could draw a late surge of attendance, particularly among independent voters or Republicans turned off by Mr. Trump.

By day’s end, tens of thousands of Democrats will have participated in the Iowa caucuses, the premiere of more than 50 contests that will unfold over the next five months. After more than a year of campaigning and more than $800 million in spending, the caucuses will render the first verdict on who among dozens of candidates is best positioned to take on Mr. Trump in the November 3 presidential election, whom Democratic voters are desperate to beat this fall.

Do voters want someone with appeal to centrists, independents and disaffected Republicans, like moderates Mr. Biden, Pete Buttigieg, the former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Amy Klobuchar? Or should the party choose a candidate who energises its liberal base and could bring out new voters, like progressives Mr. Sanders and fellow Senator Elizabeth Warren?

Impeachment trial

The race has been overshadowed in recent weeks, with Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar relegated to part-time campaigning in Iowa as they stayed in Washington for the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.

Even if one candidate wins by a commanding margin in Iowa, Democrats may still lack clear answers as the race moves on to the other three early-voting States of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina later in February. And whoever remains in the race by Super Tuesday, when 15 States and territories vote on March 3, will also confront billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is skipping the early States in favour of focusing on delegate-rich States.

Mr. Sanders, who finished in a virtual dead heat with Hillary Clinton in Iowa during his first presidential run in 2016, surged recently in many Iowa polls to move just ahead of Mr. Biden. But Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg remain in striking distance. Many polls show a big bloc of undecided Iowa voters, creating the potential for upsets and late surges.

Record turnout

Iowa State party officials are expecting a record turnout, exceeding the nearly 2,40,000 voter attendance in caucuses in 2008 amid the excitement over Barack Obama’s first candidacy.

A poor showing in Iowa could cause a front-runner’s fundraising to slow and support in later States to dwindle, while a strong result can give a candidate much needed momentum that propels him or her to the nomination. Several Democrats who won the Iowa caucuses went on to clinch the party’s nomination.

27,2020/02/03,Imran Khan leaves for Malaysia to placate PM Mahathir for skipping key Islamic summit,"Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on February 3 embarked on a two-day visit to Malaysia to placate the country’s leadership after he skipped a major summit of Muslim nations in Kuala Lumpur, solidify the bilateral strategic partnership and discuss the situation in South Asia.

Prime Minister Khan’s visit will contribute to further strengthening the historic Pakistan-Malaysia ties and taking bilateral cooperation to a higher level, the Prime Minister’s Office tweeted.

Mr. Khan’s visit to Malaysia at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Mahathir Mohamad comes after he skipped the Kuala Lumpur summit of some 20 Muslim countries in December attended by leaders from countries like Iran, Turkey and Qatar.

Mr. Khan did not attend the summit, reportedly due to pressure exerted by Saudi Arabia, which had extended liberal financial assistance to Mr. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government to stave off the looming economic crisis, Dawn newspaper reported.

The Express Tribune, quoting sources, reported that the visit of Prime Minister Khan is aimed at removing misgivings Malaysia may have about Pakistan for skipping the Kuala Lumpur summit.

Pakistan initially confirmed its participation at the summit but changed its mind after Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries voiced concerns over it. Riyadh is reported to have viewed the summit as an attempt to create a new Islamic bloc, the reports said.

J&K situation

During his visit to Malaysia, Prime Minister Khan will also highlight the human rights and humanitarian situation in Jammu and Kashmir, his office tweeted on February 2.

He would also emphasise the importance of “averting risks to regional peace & stability posed by India” and underscore the importance of peaceful resolution of Jammu and Kashmir, it said.

Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir has already angered India with his provocative comments on Kashmir and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, prompting New Delhi to impose restrictions on the import of refined palm oil from Malaysia, the top supplier of the commodity to the country.

Mr. Khan’s two-day working visit is set to further enhance and solidify long-standing brotherly relations between the two nations, Malaysia’s official news agency Bernama reported on February 3.

Mr. Khan’s second visit to Kuala Lumpur since becoming Prime Minister in August 2018 would include a high-level Pakistani delegation including Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi and other senior ministers.

The former cricketer-turned-Prime Minister is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Mahathir in Putrajaya on February 4 morning, the report said.

Regional peace and security

The two Prime Ministers also met on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly Session in New York in September last.

Mr. Khan is also scheduled to address scholars at the Institute of Advanced Islamic Studies (IAIS) on regional peace and security.

The two leaders share great camaraderie as both have similar views in many areas, such as on combatting corruption and issues concerning Muslim ummah like Islamophobia, Palestine and the Rohingya’s plight, the report said, avoiding any mention of Kashmir.

Their meeting is expected to discuss on matters of mutual interest and a follow up on Mr. Mahathir’s March 2019 official visit to Islamabad where both leaders had agreed to elevate Malaysia-Pakistan relations to a strategic partnership that will mark a new level of bilateral cooperation, it said.

The two countries are expected to step up cooperation in the trade of palm oil, agricultural products, retail, halal products, automotive parts, energy, science and technology, and telecommunication investment, the Bernama report said.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/axq2yi/article30727022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/VBK-IMRANKHAN-GETTY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/imran-khan-leaves-for-malaysia-to-placate-pm-mahathir-for-skipping-key-islamic-summit/article30727023.ece

29,2020/02/03,"Russia to start evacuating citizens from Wuhan, stops passenger trains to China","Russia plans to start evacuating its citizens on Monday from Wuhan, the epicentre of an epidemic in central China, and has suspended direct passenger trains to the country where the death toll from a coronavirus has increased to 361.

Russia, whose border with China is 4,300-km long, had reported first two cases of the virus last week in the Siberian region of Tyumen and other in the far eastern Zabaykalsky region, both involving Chinese nationals.

Russia's aerospace defence forces, part of the armed forces, will start evacuating Russian citizens from Wuhan and Hubei on Monday. There are more than 600 Russians there, Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova has said.

Moscow has already restricted direct flights to China and the Russian Railways suspended passenger trains to the country from midnight.

The last train from Beijing to Moscow entered Russia empty as all 136 passengers were taken out at Russia-China border, RIA news agency reported, adding that they all were Chinese nationals.

Demand for medical masks has increased in Moscow's drug stores, Vedomosti newspaper said on Sunday after visiting a number of places around the 12-million Russian capital, with some places facing a shortage.

30,2020/02/03,U.S. demands more from Taliban on ceasefire before deal,"U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday demanded “demonstrable evidence” from the Taliban that it can and will reduce violence before signing a deal that would lead to Afghanistan peace talks and a withdrawal of American troops from the country.

Speaking at a news conference in neighboring Uzbekistan, Mr. Pompeo said a deal is close but that they have been close before and failed because the Taliban was unable to demonstrate its seriousness. He said more work remains to be done so that peace talks can get started.

""We’re working on a peace and reconciliation plan, putting the commas in the right place, getting the sentences right,” he said. “We got close once before to having an agreement- a piece of paper that we mutually executed and the Taliban were unable to demonstrate either their will or capacity or both to deliver on a reduction in violence.”

""So, what we are demanding now is demonstrable evidence of their will and capacity to reduce violence, to take down the threat, so the inter-Afghan talks ... will have a less violent context,” he said. “We’re hopeful we can achieve that but we’re not there yet, and work certainly remains.”

Mr. Pompeo’s comments came just two days after U.S. peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad arrived in Kabul and told Afghan President Ashraf Ghani there has been “no notable progress” in talks with the Taliban. However, Mr. Khalilzad said he was hopeful of reaching an understanding with them on a reduction of hostilities, without offering any time frame.

Mr. Khalilzad had been in Pakistan last week to rally support for getting an agreement with the Taliban to reduce their attacks, as a first step toward a peace agreement to end 18 years of war in neighboring Afghanistan.

Earlier, the Taliban said they offered Mr. Khalilzad a 10-day cease-fire window in which to sign a peace agreement that would be followed by intra-Afghan negotiations.

Mr. Khalilzad was appointed by the White House in 2018 to find a negotiated end to Afghanistan’s war that would allow the United States to bring home its estimated 13,000 soldiers and end its longest military engagement.

Talks in recent weeks have focused on finding a way to reduce hostilities and bring both sides in the conflict to the negotiating table. Until now the Taliban have refused to talk to Afghan President Ghani’s government. Mr. Ghani has also been unable to agree on a negotiating team with Abdullah Abdullah who is currently his partner in Afghanistan’s so-called Unity Government. Mr. Abdullah accuses the president of foiling efforts at peace by imposing new conditions on talks.

Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah were the leading contenders in last September’s presidential polls. The voting was mired in controversy and is still without a final result.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/feiul5/article30474226.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/POMPEO,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/us-demands-more-from-taliban-on-ceasefire-before-deal/article30724768.ece
31,2020/02/03,"4 Turkish troops, 6 Syrian soldiers killed in Idlib province","At least four Turkish soldiers were killed and nine others were wounded in “intensive shelling” on Monday by Syrian government forces in northwestern Syria, Turkey’ said. A Syrian war monitor said six Syrian troops were killed as well in the shelling.

The exchange came hours after a large Turkish military convoy entered the province of Idlib, the last rebel stronghold in the country. It is also likely to increase tensions between the two neighboring countries as such direct clashes have been rare.

Turkey’s National Defense Ministry said the shelling in Idlib took place despite prior notification of the coordinates of the Turkish forces that were sent to the province as reinforcements. It said Turkish forces responded to the attack.

The incident comes amid a Syrian government offensive into the last rebel-held territory, located in Idlib and parts of the nearby Aleppo region. Turkish troops are deployed in some of those areas to monitor an earlier cease-fire that has since collapsed.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitoring group with activists around the country, said the exchange occurred near the town of Saraqeb, which Syrian troops have marching toward in recent days.

Relations between Turkey and Syria have deteriorated sharply since Syria’s civil war began in 2011. Syria accuses Turkey of undermining its security by allowing thousands of foreign fighters to come battle the Syrian army. Idlib province is currently dominated by al-Qaida-linked militants.

Government forces captured the key town of Maaret al-Numan from the rebels last Wednesday, and have now set their sights on Sarqeb. A strategic highway that links Damascus with northern Syria passes through both towns and government forces aim to reopen it. The highway has been closed since 2012.

The province of Idlib is home to some 3 million people, many of them displaced from other parts of Syria in earlier bouts of violence. The United Nations has estimated that about 390,000 Syrians have been displaced there over the past two months - 315,000 in December and 75,000 in January.

Turkey already hosts 3.5 million Syrian refugees, and the current wave of violence in Idlib has raised concerns of a new surge in displaced civilians fleeing toward the Turkish border.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/2h1hv2/article30385928.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SYRIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/turkey-says-4-soldiers-killed-in-syria-government-shelling/article30724665.ece
32,2020/02/03,Donald Trump bashes Democratic rivals during pre-Super Bowl show,"U.S. President Donald Trump used a Super Bowl pregame interview to rail against Democrats, accusing them of hatred and offering schoolyard insults about his potential 2020 rivals.

“I see the hatred. ... They don’t care about fairness, they don’t care about lying,” Mr. Trump said in a taped interview with Fox News Channel’s Sean Hannity, which aired on Fox hours before sports’ biggest night of the year.

But Mr. Trump’s Super Bowl night may best be remembered by an errant — now deleted tweet — congratulating the state of Kansas and not mentioning Missouri, where the game was played at Missouri-based Arrowhead Stadium, for the Kansas City Chiefs’ win.

Mr. Trump spent his weekend in Florida as most of the political world has been focused on Iowa, where Democrats on Monday will cast their first votes to choose the party’s nominee.

Prompted by Mr. Hannity, Mr. Trump went through most of the major candidates one by one, deriding “Sleepy Joe” Biden, the former Vice President, accusing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren of telling “fairy tales”, and labeling Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, as “a communist”, even though he’s not.

But Mr. Trump seemed most preoccupied by the candidates who has chosen to skip the early-voting States — Michael Bloomberg, the former New York Mayor who has been blanketing the airwaves with anti-Trump ads.

The President’s campaign and Mr. Bloomberg’s ran dueling, multimillion-dollar ads during Sunday night’s game, with both spending an estimated $10 million for 60 seconds of air time, which Mr. Trump used to purchase two 30-second spots.

Mr. Trump’s first featured the story of Alice Marie Johnson, a nonviolent drug offender whose life sentence Mr. Trump commuted after reality TV star Kim Kardashian West championed her case. The ad showed footage of the emotional moment when Ms. Johnson was released from prison and reunited with her family.

“My heart is just bursting with gratitude,” she tells the camera. “I want to thank President Donald John Trump. Hallelujah!”

“Thanks to President Trump, people like Alice are getting a second chance,” the ad’s text reads, adding, “Politicians talk about criminal justice reform. President Trump got it done.”

A second Trump ad — which ran after the game had ended, instead of during the game as his campaign had said — argued that, “Under President Trump, America is stronger, safer and more prosperous than ever before.”

Mr. Bloomberg, whose spot was scheduled to air during the second half of the game, also chose an emotional subject, featuring a grieving mother who lost her son to gun violence. George Kemp Jr., who dreamed of one day playing in the NFL, was only 20 when he was fatally shot in 2013.

Mr. Bloomberg is a longtime backer of what he calls “common sense” gun legislation and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars since his tenure as New York Mayor to combat gun violence.

In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump mocked Mr. Bloomberg’s height and accused him of making a special request for a box to stand on if he qualifies for future presidential debates. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign denies that is the case.

“Why should he get a box to stand on?” Mr. Trump asked. “Why should he be entitled to that, really? Then does that mean everyone else gets a box?”

Mr. Bloomberg campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood said Trump was “lying”.

“He is a pathological liar who lies about everything — his fake hair, his obesity, and his spray-on tan,” she said.

A Democratic official said there have been no discussions about the topic, noting that Mr. Bloomberg has yet to qualify for a debate. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing a policy of not discuss conversations with candidates.

Earlier Sunday, Mr. Trump fired off a series of post-midnight anti-Bloomberg tweets, calling the billionaire “part of the Fake News” and insisting he “is going nowhere” and “just wasting his money,” despite rising in the polls.

Mr. Bloomberg responded with his own aside: “Looks like our ads are keeping you up at night. We’ve got one in particular you should watch today.” Mr. Bloomberg’s 60-second spot will focus on the impact of gun violence.

Mr. Trump in the Fox interview also criticised House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats. Asked whether it would be possible for him to work with the opposition party after they had impeached him and tried to remove him from office, Mr. Trump said he’d “like to, but it’s pretty hard when you think about it because it’s been such ... I use the word ‘witch hunt,’ use the word ‘hoax.’”

“I’m not sure that they can do it, to be honest,” he added. “I think they just want to win and it doesn’t matter how they win.” Mr. Trump is expected to be acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday.

The interview aired just days before Mr. Trump was set to deliver a State of the Union address that aides say will offer an optimistic message to a divided nation.

Mr. Trump spent his weekend golfing and mingling with guests at his dues-paying Mar-a-Lago club. On Saturday night, he appeared at an event there hosted by the “Trumpettes” fan club.

And on Sunday he attended an annual Super Bowl watch party at one of his Florida golf courses, where he and First Lady Melania Trump were welcomed by a performance from a local college marching band and cheerleaders.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6a97n/article30721438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/donald-trump-bashes-democratic-rivals-during-pre-super-bowl-show/article30724531.ece

34,2020/02/03,"Built in 10 days, China’s virus hospital takes 1st patients","The first patients arrived on Monday at a specialized hospital built in just 10 days as part of China’s intensive efforts to fight a new virus.

The Wuhan treatment centers mark the second time Chinese leaders have responded to a new disease by building specialized hospitals almost overnight. As severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, spread in 2003, a facility in Beijing for patients with that viral disease was constructed in a week.

The first patients arrived at the Huoshenshan Hospital at 10 a.m. on Monday, according to state media. The reports gave no details of the patients’ identities or conditions.

The ruling Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, sent 1,400 doctors, nurses and other personnel to staff the Wuhan hospital, the official Xinhua News Agency said. The government said earlier some have experience fighting SARS and other outbreaks.

Authorities have cut most road, rail and air access to Wuhan and surrounding cities, isolating some 50 million people, in efforts to contain the viral outbreak that has sickened more than 17,000 and killed more than 360 people.

The Huoshenshan Hospital was built by a 7,000-member crew of carpenters, plumbers, electricians and other specialists, according to the Xinhua News Agency. Photos in state media showed workers in winter clothing, safety helmets and the surgical-style masks worn by millions of Chinese in an attempt to avoid contracting the virus.

About half of the two-story, 60,000-square-meter (600,000-square-foot) building is isolation wards, according to the government newspaper Yangtze Daily. It has 30 intensive care units.

Doctors can talk with outside experts over a video system that links them to Beijing’s PLA General Hospital, according to the Yangtze Daily. It said the system was installed in less than 12 hours by a 20-member “commando team” from Wuhan Telecom Ltd.

The building has specialized ventilation systems and double-sided cabinets that connect patient rooms to hallways and allow hospital staff to deliver supplies without entering the rooms.

The hospital received a donation of “medical robots” from a Chinese company for use in delivering medicines and carrying test samples, according to the Shanghai newspaper The Paper.

In other cities, the government has designated hospitals to handle cases of the new virus.

In Beijing, the Xiaotangshan Hospital built in 2003 for SARS is being renovated by construction workers.

Dai Yuming told reporters at a English-language press conference in Tel Aviv that the errors to limit or even ban entries of Chinese citizens reminded him of the old days, the old stories that happened in World War Two, the Holocaust, the darkest days in human history.

Millions of Jewish were killed, and many, many Jewish were refused when they tried to seek assistance from other countries. Only very, very few countries opened their door, and among them is China, Mr. Dai said.

The Chinese Embassy in Israel later issued a statement saying there was no intention whatsoever to compare the dark days of the Holocaust with the current situation and the efforts taken by the Israeli government to protect its citizens.”

We would like to apologize if someone understood our message the wrong way, the embassy said.

Israel halted direct flights to China on Thursday, and Israel’s Health Ministry has authorized border control agents to deny entry to non-Israelis who have visited China in the past two weeks.

Israeli citizens who returned from China have been instructed to remain quarantined at home for two weeks in order to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 300 people and sickened thousands of others in China.

The number of coronavirus cases worldwide has passed 14,550, according to China’s National Health Commission and other countries.

Most reported incidents are in China, but around 150 cases have been reported in two dozen countries around the globe.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told ministers on Sunday that the country had closed land crossings, seaports and airports to arrivals from China for the time being. He said he has instructed the country’s Health Ministry to develop a vaccine for the fast-spreading virus.

We are also updating the Palestinian Authority on all preventive steps and public health measures that they must take into account here as well,” he said.

37,2020/02/03,"Coronavirus | Deaths in China pass 360, over 17,000 infected globally","China's death toll from the coronavirus epidemic hit 361 on February 3, with deepening global concern about the outbreak and governments closing their borders to people from China.

The fresh toll came a day after China imposed a lockdown on a major city far from the epicentre and the first fatality outside the country was reported in the Philippines. Authorities in Hubei, the province at the epicentre of the outbreak, reported 56 new fatalities, with one reported in the southwestern megalopolis of Chongqing. That took the toll in China to 361, exceeding the 349 mainland fatalities from the 2002-3 SARS outbreak.

Struggling to contain the virus, authorities took action in the eastern city of Wenzhou on Sunday, closing roads and confining people to their homes. Wenzhou is some 800 kilometres from Wuhan, the metropolis at the heart of the health emergency.

Since emerging out of Wuhan late last year, the new coronavirus has infected more than 17,200 people across China and reached 24 nations.

The G7 countries — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — have all confirmed cases of the virus. They will discuss a joint response, Germany's health minister Jens Spahn said on Sunday.

In Thailand, which has 19 confirmed cases, doctors said Sunday an elderly Chinese patient treated with a cocktail of flu and HIV drugs had shown dramatic improvement and tested negative for the virus 48 hours later.

Most of the infections overseas have been detected in people who travelled from Wuhan, an industrial hub of 11 million people, or surrounding areas of Hubei province.

The man who died in the Philippines was a 44-year-old from Wuhan, according to the World Health Organization, which has declared the epidemic a global health emergency.

China has embarked on unprecedented efforts to contain the virus, which is believed to have jumped to humans from a Wuhan animal market, and can be transmitted among people.

Closing borders

The United States, Australia, New Zealand and Israel have banned foreign nationals from visiting if they have been in China recently, and they have also warned their own citizens against travelling there.

Mongolia, Russia and Nepal have closed their land borders.

The number of countries reporting infections rose to 24 after Britain, Russia and Sweden confirmed their first cases this weekend. There were 2,829 new confirmed cases nationally on Monday, bringing the total infected to 17,205, health officials said.

With hospitals in Wuhan overwhelmed, China will open a military-led field hospital Monday that was built in just 10 days to treat people stricken by the virus.

And with the Chinese economy suffering, the central bank announced it would release 1.2 trillion yuan ($173 billion) on Monday to maintain liquidity in the banking system — the day markets re-open after the long holiday break.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/skcx8y/article30723960.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CHINA-HEALTHINDONESIA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/coronavirus-deaths-in-china-pass-360-over-17000-infected-globally/article30723961.ece

“The plan poses a serious threat to the rules-based international order and the foundations of international law,” according to a position paper issued by the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Public Diplomacy and Policy Department on Sunday, Xinhua news agency reported.

It said that the proposed plan grants Israel “immediate rewards of annexation,” leaving Palestinians with no sovereignty at all.

“The US plan presents a disconnected and inviable archipelago of Palestinian communities stripped of any sovereignty or viability, engulfed in Israel’s belly and denied of any control over borders, airspace, territorial waters security or natural resources,” said the statement.

39,2020/02/03,U.K. to seek Canada-style free trade deal with EU,"Two days after Brexit, British officials pushed the European Union on Sunday for a Canada-style free trade arrangement as British Prime Minister Boris Johnson geared up for a key speech to spell out his government’s negotiating stance.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Sky News that Britain will seek a deal that imposes very few tariffs even though he said Britain will not seek to align its regulations with the EU.

“We are taking back control of our laws, so we are not going to have high alignment with the EU and legislative alignment with their rules,” Mr. Raab said. “We will want to cooperate and we expect the EU to follow through on their commitments to a Canada-style free trade agreement. That’s what we are pursuing. There is a great opportunity here for win-win.”

EU officials, despite offering friendly words to the British public over the weekend after the divorce that took effect on Friday night, warn that Canada only achieved largely tariff-free trade status by bringing many of its rules in line with EU regulations. EU officials fear that the U.K. could water down its environment or health and safety precautions, undermining EU businesses.

The trade talks are vital because now that Britain has officially left the bloc — the first nation ever to do so — Mr. Johnson hopes to have a wide-ranging new deal in place by the end of the year.

Johnson’s speech

After celebrating Brexit by banging on a gong in the final seconds before it took effect, Mr. Johnson plans to detail Britain’s trade stance in a speech Monday.

The early battle lines in what will be a contentious process have now been drawn.

European leaders have said that Britain will not be able to get a deal like Canada’s if it breaks significantly with EU rules on food safety, environmental standards, worker’s rights and other matters impacting on public well-being.

Irish PM Leo Varadkar on Sunday urged Mr. Johnson’s Conservative government not to follow the mistakes of his predecessor by establishing “rigid red lines” that make it much more difficult to reach an agreement.

Mr. Varadkar did say he believes Mr. Johnson’s reassurances that Britain “will not seek to undercut” the EU when it comes to labour standards, environmental standards, product standards and health and safety.

""I don’t believe that the U.K. is going to try to engage in a race to the bottom on issues like pay and workers rights and so on,” Mr. Varadkar told the BBC.

Britain will also start reaching out to other countries about new trade arrangements now that it is out of the EU, even though EU rules remain in effect during an 11-month transition period. Mr. Raab plans trips to Japan and Australia this week to ramp up this effort.

Mr. Johnson spent the weekend out of the public eye ahead of a week that will mark a turning point in his government, which won a major election victory in December. Officials need to shift from “getting Brexit done” - Mr. Johnson’s campaign slogan - to getting trade deals and actually governing the country.

Brexit’s first few days have passed without any major incidents, but British police are investigating a poster pinned on the Winchester Tower apartment block in Norwich, warning residents that “we do not tolerate people” speaking any language but English in the building.

Norfolk Police said they have seized copies of the poster, which has been taken down, and are treating it as a “racially aggravated” incident. The signs were titled “Happy Brexit Day.”",international,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-international/i789m5/article26294599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Th17-Despatch-VGBG5EB94J7jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/uk-to-seek-canada-style-free-trade-deal-with-eu/article30721361.ece
40,2020/02/03,Republicans prepare to defend Trump’s expected acquittal,"Republicans prepared to defend their expected acquittal of President Donald Trump, on Sunday’s TV talk shows, after their Senate votes to reject witness testimony at his impeachment trial sparked criticism they were aiding a cover-up and abdicating their duties.

Criticism only intensified late Saturday after U.S. media reported that U.S. officials cited presidential privilege in redacting 24 emails related to Mr. Trump’s hold on military assistance to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of his impeachment trial for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.

Mr. Trump on Saturday claimed his polling numbers were up after the Senate paved the way for his acquittal next Wednesday.

However, according to the RealClearPolitics website, Mr. Trump currently has a 44.6% approval rating in collated polls, almost exactly the same as when he came to office in January 2017.

His assertion, made on Twitter, came with Washington also awaiting the results of Monday’s all-important Iowa caucuses.

The first vote in the U.S. primary process will be closely watched as a sign as to which of 11 Democratic candidates are gaining early momentum to challenge Trump in November’s election.

As Democratic contenders raced across the Midwest state, the U.S. Senate on Friday rebuffed Democratic calls for witnesses at only the third impeachment trial of a US president.

Mr. Trump is all but assured of being acquitted by the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 seats to 47 for the Democrats. A two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, is needed to remove a president from office.

“Trump poll numbers are the highest since election, despite constant phony Witch Hunts!” the president tweeted on Saturday from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

He was impeached for abuse of power over pressure on Ukraine to open investigations including into a leading Democratic challenger, Joe Biden.

4 Republican votes

On Friday, just two Republican senators — Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine — joined Democrats in voting to introduce witnesses into the impeachment trial. Democrats argued that every other impeachment trial of U.S. officials has called witnesses.

But they failed to muster the four Republican votes needed to allow testimony from key witnesses from Trump’s former national security advisor John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and others.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called it a “grand tragedy.”

“America will remember this day -- a day when the United States Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, turned away from truth and instead went along with a sham trial,” Mr. Schumer said.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, which impeached Trump on December 18, accused Republicans of being “accomplices to the president’s cover-up.”

Democrats had been eager to hear from Bolton following reports that, in a forthcoming book, he says Mr. Trump told him military aid to Ukraine was tied to Kiev’s investigating former vice president Biden.

That is the crux of the case against Mr. Trump.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Trump ally, said House prosecutors — known as “managers” — had already presented enough evidence to make their case and there was no need for further witnesses.

Among the material was more than 28,000 pages of documents gathered during the House impeachment inquiry.

Just hours after the vote to reject any witness testimony, reports pointed to new potential evidence.

The administration’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) said in a court filing that it “has redacted portions of 24 documents pursuant to the Presidential Communications Privilege,” according to U.S. media.

These emails “reflect communications by either the President, the Vice President, or the President’s immediate advisors regarding Presidential decision-making about the scope, duration, and purpose of the hold on military assistance to Ukraine,” OMB’s deputy general counsel Heather Walsh said in the court document cited by media.

Mr. McConnell said the Senate would resume as a court of impeachment on Monday to hear final arguments, before voting on Wednesday on the two articles of impeachment passed last month in the House.

‘Partisan nature’

Republican Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who had been considered a possible swing vote on witnesses, said there was no need for more evidence.

“If you have eight witnesses who say someone left the scene of an accident, why do you need nine?,” he told NBC in an interview to air Sunday.

But, he added, “I think he shouldn’t have done it. I think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I’d say -- improper, crossing the line.”

Four contenders for the Democratic nomination — Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Michael Bennet — were required to be present at the impeachment trial.

Monday’s vote is headed to a photo finish, with leftist Sanders holding a narrow polling lead over Mr. Biden.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/6a97n/article30721438.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/thjc-Trump,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/republicans-prepare-to-defend-trumps-expected-acquittal/article30721439.ece
41,2020/02/03,"Iraqi cleric asks followers to stop stir, clear the roads","Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr urged his followers on Sunday to help security forces clear roads blocked during months of sit-in protests, calling for a return to normal life after the designation of a new Prime Minister.

Mr. Sadr, who had alternately sided with the anti-government protesters and the Iran-backed political groups they reject, urged his unarmed supporters known as “blue hats” to work with authorities to ensure schools and businesses can operate normally again.

Protests broke out immediately in Baghdad and several southern cities on Saturday night after President Barham Salih named Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi as Prime Minister in an effort to end the political unrest.

On Sunday, thousands gathered in Baghdad’s Tahrir square in protest. They banged drums and chanted against Mr. Allawi and Mr. Sadr, saying “Allawi is rejected and so are his parties”.

In a message issued on Twitter, Mr. Sadr said “I advise the security forces to stop anyone from cutting off roads and the Ministry of education should punish those who obstruct regular working hours, be they students, teachers or others”.

Some of his followers appeared to have helped already to clear out protest areas in Tahrir Square overnight, a Reuters reporter said.

Hours before Mr. Allawi’s appointment, the blue hats, armed with batons, attacked a skeleton building in Tahrir Square, known as the Turkish Restaurant, that demonstrators have occupied since October. The building was mostly empty on Sunday and the blue hats stood guard, occupying its gates and pacing with walkie-talkies outside it.

“They attacked us by surprise and forced us out of the building shouting that we didnt do any good to the country except ruining its economy,” said Rassoul, 20, a protester who has lived in the Turkish Restaurant since October.

Anti-government protests continued nearby, with demonstrators directing their ire towards Allawi. He was named on Saturday as part of a deal between Sadr and rival Iran-backed political groups, who have wrangled since November’s resignation of premier Adel Abdul Mahdi.

Mr. Allawi must form a government within a month and face a confidence vote in parliament. Iran welcomed his designation on Sunday.

Protesters demanding the removal of Iraq’s ruling elite and the creation of better jobs and services have regularly blocked main roads in Baghdad and southern Iraq since demonstrations erupted in October.

U.N. and EU flags

Some of the protesters in Baghdad on Sunday waved the national flag while others had United Nations and European Union flags. “We call on the UN to support and protect Iraqi protesters,” read several signs.

“Mr. Allawi is a member of the political game that has destroyed Iraq, he needs to go,” said Malek Jawad, a student and protester.

A dozen young Iraqis stood on a truck carrying massive speakers and cheered the crowed.

“Moqtada al-Sadr sent conflicted messages since the beginning but at the end he made it clear that hes against the protesters,” Jawad added.

Sadr supporters watched the protesters from in and around the Turkish Restaurant.

Mr. Sadr has directed anti-government unrest in previous years but he has not been able to control this round of demonstrations and many protesters oppose him as much as the rest of the political class.

Mr. Sadr’s supporters had previously bolstered the protesters and sometimes helped shield them from attacks by security forces and unidentified gunmen.

Many of Mr. Sadr’s supporters hail from eastern Baghdad slums and share the same grievances as many Iraqis over a lack of job opportunities, poor healthcare and education.

The unrest is Iraq’s biggest crisis for years. It has shattered nearly two years of calm that prevailed after the defeat of the Sunni Muslim extremist Islamic State in 2017.",international,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/iraqi-cleric-asks-followers-to-stop-stir-clear-the-roads/article30721682.ece
42,2020/02/03,Anti CAA protests: Strangers bear witness to acts of kindness,"Food, in fact, as we all realise can either unite or divide societies; the choice is ours. At the anti CAA protest sites, perhaps for the first time in the history of a country ridden with deep faultlines of language, class, caste, religion, gender and more, food is emerging as a symbol bridging these.

In spontaneous gestures of hospitality, which perhaps come instinctively to most Indians, food is pressed upon any one even casually visiting epicentres of political protest like Shaheen Bagh. “You must eat and go,” is a common refrain that is generously handed out even by the poor, with much to lose. When the protests first started, reports cited chaiwallas or cab drivers in Delhi offering free tea or parantha-subzi rolls packed from their homes as succour to protesters against the bitter cold.

In Mumbai, those who had gathered in solidarity reported juice, ice cream or snacks being passed around to random strangers. “One day, we were just standing around, and someone got out of their car and started distributing biscuits and sandwiches to everyone, without saying a word. These were similar to other spontaneous gestures of help — one day, as it started raining heavily, people came forward to fix a tarpaulin, and then found ways to drain the water off it, to shelter the protesting women,” points out photographer Tehreem Fatima, whose work took her to different protest sites. While it is the big gestures that have grabbed eye balls—biryani being cooked and distributed en masse or Sikh farmers cooking langar at Shaheen Bagh, there have been hundreds of smaller gestures made almost as a routine, those visiting the protest sites say.

Pranav Sawhney, a marketing executive who has been to several protests, analyses: “It is a very Indian thing to show concern through food — when people distribute home-cooked food or donate milk, sugar and tea, it is functional and practical. It is not as if people are consciously sitting down to share a community meal, these are instinctive gestures of kindness and hospitality which point to a spirit of solidarity which has emerged at these protests.” When Abhilasha Ojha, art curator and writer, decided to spend New Year’s eve at Shaheen Bagh along with her husband, the couple took makhana, biscuits and candy to distribute. “Ab khali haath kya jaayen (why go empty handed) we thought,” she says, adding, “Every one who came to the area brought something to share.”

Foodis being cooked in makeshift community kitchens too, run on donations. But this is shared with everyone regardless of religion, caste or creed. It is also a mistake to stereotype the kind of food available at the protest sites. While Moradabadi biryani hawkers may have set up stalls to cater their spicy fare to what seems to be emerging as “protest tourism” — visitors, including travellers from other cities coming to get a dekko of what exactly is happening — biryani is hardly the only eat available.

“One day, I was with friends and we were all tired and hungry, it had got dark,” says Fatima, “The women of the area urged us to eat and go. They made us sit on a takht (wooden bed/bench) and served us piping hot puris, aloo (potatoes) and kaddu ki sabzi (pumpkin) in thalis,” she recalls. In fact, this is the syncretic street food of Delhi, prepared by halwais, and eaten as much by guests at weddings as the common man on the street looking for an inexpensive satiating meal, made with common and “humble” ingredients.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/j8xlj1/article30726840.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4MPSHAHEENBAGHPROTESTREPUBLICDAYAGAINSTCAANRC,https://www.thehindu.com/society/anti-caa-protests-strangers-bear-witness-to-acts-of-kindness/article30726841.ece
43,2020/02/03,Anti-CAA/NRC: How tea unites the protesters,"The smell of freshly brewed tea is in the air at Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh. An old man pushes a cart of guavas past us. “₹10 a kilo,” he announces. Surprised by the low price, we buy a batch and pay him a little more. He shakes his head and returns the excess cash — this isn’t all about business.

This is about solidarity. Unity is the overriding sentiment here, solidified through shared meals of omelettes, biryani, puri-sabzi and tea.

For nearly two months, the women of Shaheen Bagh have been sitting inside a tent at one end of G. D. Birla Marg, in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The protesters — men, women and children — occupy most of the highway, their numbers extending up to 10,000 or more on certain days. Feeding this mighty crowd is not an easy task, but this community-led agitation has organised itself for the purpose.

“Every day, we have well-wishers coming up to the stage, and asking us what the situation is like for tonight’s dinner, or tomorrow’s lunch, and then we tell them how many plates we need, and how many have been arranged so far,” says Hena Ahmed, a volunteer. People from the area arrange these meals, either preparing small batches in their households, or mostly, coordinating with restaurants.

Some women are fasting as a way of protest, and they break their fast in the evening with samosas and chai. Mealtimes are hectic for the volunteers, they move in and out of the tent, making sure everyone has had something to eat. Outside, men line up to receive plates of puri and aloo.

“One person can’t feed everyone here, so we have mixed items — some get biryani, some pulao. Our Sikh brothers have also set up a langar here,” says Humera Sayad, another volunteer. The langar was set up by a farmer’s union from Punjab.

“All of us take up different responsibilities, but it’s not like one person will permanently be doing one job. If I get tired, somebody else will take over,” says Humera.

There is an unofficial ‘kitchen department’ to arrange for the food, “but if there are packets of biscuits or such smaller items, whoever is around will distribute them.”

The self-sustaining, grassroots nature of the protests at Shaheen Bagh has caught the nation’s imagination, and when people from Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal and other states come here, they often bring food. So much so that on stage, a volunteer has to explain to the protesters, “If you want to get food, please inform us first so that we can arrange for its distribution!”

Silent helpers

It is 6 p.m. on a Thursday in Mumbai’s Nagpada area. The women hold up placards, even as other protesters finish evening namaaz (prayers). Though a younger and smaller protest than that at Shaheen Bagh, this, too, is dependent on the kindness and solidarity of strangers.

“There are small-business owners who donate some food items and water bottles for the protesters, who have been sitting here for more than nine days. We don’t have any funding from any organisation,” says Sayeed Sultan, a volunteer.

These include businessmen like Aarif Khan and Mahesh Solanki, who are unable to participate in the protest, and hence do their bit by donating sandwiches, fruitcake, samosas and water bottles in bulk. “Most of the people who donate food to the protesters do not wish to be named,” says Sultan.

Another homemaker, who only identifies herself as a resident of Wadala, brought 25 packets of biscuits for the protesters.

“I have three children who go to a primary school and my husband works as an auto rickshaw driver. It is difficult for me to manage household chores, but keeping this alive is very important,” she says on condition of anonymity. She adds that her children accompany her here post-school, and she helps them with their homework there.

Household support

At Lucknow’s iconic Husainabad Clock Tower aka Ghanta Ghar, the crowd primarily comprises homemakers shuttling between their familial duties and this venue.

Numbers swell to about 5,000 between noon and 10 p.m. each day. At least 150-odd protesters stay the night, dividing themselves in batches so that the women can take turns staying at home with their families.

The people who want to make the time to be there but cannot, get hold of bawarchis to cook fresh food like puri-chole in bulk for those sitting in. This is usually done by about eight to 10 neighbourhood households joining hands — and funds — at a time, says social worker Sumaiya Rana.

“It is not just homemakers and families who help. On most nights, some hotels and restaurants nearby [who prefer to remain unnamed] pack whatever food is left at the end of their day and send it over.”

This usually ranges from Lucknowi biryani to keema and shami kebab, in whatever quantity these restaurateurs can muster for the day. “Sometimes, there is matar pulao for the vegetarians. And every evening, without fail, someone or the other manages to bring samosas and tea for about 2,000 people,” adds Rana.

There is a reason the food is prepared elsewhere — the clock tower is a historic monument, under the protection of the Archaeological Survey of India. Cooking within the premises is prohibited, as is the consumption of open, unpacked food.

“So the food is usually brought in packets: about two or three puris in each pack, along with some sabzi or chole,” she says.

Since many of the protesters are mothers who cannot leave their little ones at home, there are chocolate bars and biscuit packets for the children. However, it is the tea that comes in most handy, particularly at night when temperatures drop to about two or three degrees Celsius.

“The days, thankfully, are getting sunnier,” says Rana.",society,https://www.thehindu.com/society/j0nllz/article30726139.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3MPMUMBAIBAGHPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/society/anti-caanrc-how-tea-unites-the-protesters/article30726143.ece
44,2020/02/03,Meet the winners of Asia Young Designer Awards 2019,"How many of us know of the many ecosystems that lie hidden in our localities? How does one define ‘home’? What is the relevance of the Russian practice of building dachas or holiday homes? Recently, at the Asia Young Designer Awards 2019 by Nippon Paints, as many as 2,000 students across the country participated in an attempt to transform the future of built environments.

These are among the many questions that popped up, lining along the theme of ‘Forward: A Sustainable Future’. The winners, Mihir Desai (Architecture) and Purvi Tank (Interior design), who have qualified for the Asia Young Designer Awards 2020, to be held in Vietnam between March 11 and 14, speak to MetroPlus about their ideas.

Latent gems

Mihir’s background and interest lie in finding solutions to urban issues that deal with ecosystems and how land-based reserves tend to endanger them. Currently working as a consultant and researcher with Tata Institute, Mumbai, Mihir who lives in Goregaon, came up with this idea in early 2017. “I have been staying here for 25 years. Still, I didn’t know anything about the different ecosystems that surround the location until very recently. This very thought that none of us knew about the forest, mangroves and wetlands despite being here for so long, was a key entering point for me,” says the 25-year-old. He was also keen on how a city can produce citizens with no awareness on their immediate reality.

The reason why this is so is because most of these ecosystems barely have any access to residents. They are either under State-ownership or private ownership and almost always remain barricaded. “My project titled Land X Architecture, essentially looks at the very idea of first understanding how we can draw these patches on to an urban landscape through maps. The relationship between people and the landscape will be explicit on the map,” says Mihir, adding that in the developmental plan of Goregaon, these ecosystems do not even surface.

“When you draw the map of a landscape without portraying its existing realities, when it comes to a planner, they propose anything they want to without knowing the existing conditions.” Even while developing this idea, Mihir felt that his perspective is limited only to design. This led him to take up a course in Marine Biology — now he is able to rethink his project in a redefined way. “Earlier in my work, the non-human/animal aspect was missing which I later incorporated,” says Mihir.

Land X Architecture, thus, is a map, which can show us a way to practise and create equitable access to sustainable architecture, under the context of global climate change.

A place called home

Purvi Tank, on the other hand, tries to derive a balance between living with Nature in a community-oriented set-up. She always finds herself on an eternal search for ‘home’. The project titled ‘Dacha in the city: SML & XL, is devised from the perspective of millennials who are involved in shifting jobs.

“We are always travelling as students in an urban setting. Right now, I live in isolation. If I am a social person, what kind of housing can I look for, was a question that bothered me. In this day and age, a lot of young people have mental health problems that come from social isolation. How can integration happen?,” says Purvi (26), adding that the idea took form in four to five months, right after her graduation.

To formalise the idea, she took the social and housing conditions of Russia as point of comparison. On further research, she chanced upon the dacha concept in Russia: essentially a ‘weekend house’. Added to this, was Russians’ penchant towards co-living or community housing. Considering base as ‘volume’ instead of the area, the design gives a resident the opportunity to live in a house beyond just a flat plane. “What could be the ideal setting — an intermediary.

45,2020/02/03,Catching a glimpse of the ashy woodswallow on power transmission wires,"There are birds that are so at home on power transmission lines, that they weave their professional and personal lives around them. They may be gathered on them in a horizontal huddle, preen each other sitting on these aluminium benches in the skies, and launch their hunting expeditions from the perch, zeroing in on flying insects in a divebombing attack.

Some birds even raise their young in nests they have built in crooks of power posts and pylons and traffic signals. With their social and hunting behaviours closely associated with these wires, we have come to see them as birds of the wire.

Power transmission wires don’t go far back in time, and have a traceable history, and it may be fascinating to know how these birds meet their need to live, socialise, hunt from perches in times pre-dating these modern props of existence.

Obviously, it would have been trees. Certain bird species would also have had a preference for certain types of trees, before the adaptation happened. Certain bird species may stick to both proclivities, the new and the old, choosing spaces that provide for both.

The ashy woodswallow seems to be one such bird. On certain sections of East Coast Road, before Mamallapuram, I have seen the ashy woodswallow gathered on power transmission wires in small groups. A recent sighting was in a border area between Thiruvidanthai and Therkupattu.

This bird has a preference for palm trees. Sections of ECR closer to Mamallapuram are dotted with a striking number of palm and coconut trees.

At the height of summer, at places like Pattipulam, there will be vendors by the roadside doing brisk business selling palmyra fruits and tender coconuts.

That seems to explain why it is easy to catch of glimpse of the ashy woodswallow in these parts.

Long awaited

In the previous column, there was a plaintive note about the low occupancy levels at the wetlands. So, let me point out that the migratory ducks have started “squatting” on the Perumbakkam wetland in more numbers, but there are still signs that this is going to be a low-count season in terms of migratory birds.

46,2020/02/03,Only a few may benefit from tax rate cut,"The most awaited 2020 Budget proposals are out. Let us look at the key changes impacting individuals to see if the expectations of reduced income tax and simplified tax regime have been met.

The government has taken a very bold step by introducing a simplified tax structure for individuals. However, while the tax rates have been reduced, several exemption and deductions have been removed. Further, the simplified tax regime would be optional in the hands of the individuals who can continue with the current regime or choose the new regime.

The catch in the story here is that the individual has to forego the deductions and exemptions to avail the lower slab rates of tax. The benefits that an individual would have to give up is a fairly extensive list and includes house rent allowance, standard deduction, interest on housing loan for a self-occupied house property, deductions under Chapter VIA (like 80C that includes –life insurance premium, contributions to provident fund, etc.).

Individuals opting for the new tax regime would still be entitled to few deductions / exemptions such as employer’s contributions to pension scheme, conveyance allowance, allowance to meet cost of travel on tour or transfer, etc.

The individual would need to make a comparative analysis of taxes due under the current regime and the proposed simplified tax regime, as depending on the quantum of deductions / exemptions, the taxes under the current regime could still be lower. Broadly, individuals with taxable incomes in the range of ₹10 lakh to ₹15 lakh may only benefit under the simplified tax regime.

The other significant proposal is abolishment of dividend distribution tax. Dividend income is now proposed to be taxed in the hands of the individual at the applicable slab rates. Though this might encourage foreign investors, it might be a bane for domestic investors as the dividend may be taxed at a higher rate. This could bring in a change in the investment pattern of individuals, especially in mutual funds, given that the dividend income could be taxable at a higher rate as compared to capital gains being exempt/taxable at lower tax rate.

The other key notable change is the proposal to limit the tax benefit to employees on account of employer contributions to PF, NPS and SAF, to a combined contribution limit of ₹7,50,000 per financial year. This would increase the tax impact for employees with higher taxable salary income.

Proposed change to the definition for determination of residential status could particularly impact mobile individuals. Currently, a citizen of India or person of Indian origin staying outside India would qualify to be a resident only if his/her stay in India is 182 days or more during his visit to India. It has been now proposed to reduce the 182-day threshold to 120 days. Also, an explanation has been proposed, to imply that a citizen of India who is not liable to pay taxes in any other country (due to his/her residential status in the other country or any other criteria) shall be deemed to be a resident of India.

An individual who qualifies to be a resident gets further classified as ordinarily resident or not ordinarily resident based on the stay in India. Currently, an individual would qualify as a resident and not ordinarily resident if he/she satisfies either of the following conditions:

i) The stay in India was 729 days or less in the previous seven tax years

ii) Has been a non-resident in India for the nine out of ten previous tax years

The proposal eliminates the first condition and substitutes seven years in the place of nine years in the second condition. Therefore, if the individual has been a non-resident in India for seven out of ten previous tax years, then he would qualify as a not ordinarily resident and be liable to tax in India only on the India-sourced income.

Proposed inclusions to the currently existing provisions related to Tax Collection at Source (TCS) could impact individuals who are making foreign remittances through the liberalised remittance scheme of ₹7 lakh or more in a financial year and individuals purchasing overseas tour programme packages. Tax at the rate of 5% (10% in case of non-PAN/Aadhaar cases) is proposed to be collected at source.

The most important announcement in the Budget is the commitment to eliminate any form of tax harassment. Also, it is proposed to have an enhancement to faceless assessment and shifting of onus on the Donee as regards detailed reporting related to donations. Additionally, a one-time scheme ‘Vivad Se Vishwas’ is proposed as a measure to reduce litigation in the direct taxes. Under the proposed scheme, the taxpayer is required to pay only the disputed amount and gets complete waiver of interest and penalty, if settled by March 31,2020. Alternatively, the taxpayer can settle with additional amount (to be notified) by June 30, 2020.

Overall, it looks like while the taxpayers could benefit from the simplification in processes, in reality the benefit of reduction in tax rate would benefit only few individuals.

During the period under review, the company posted a 12% increase in its revenue from operations to ₹446.25 crore.

SPL adopted a lower rate of Income Tax after evaluation and hence the charge on account of Income Tax for the quarter under review was lower.

The company, on January 16, commenced the commercial operations of the first furnace of 9 MVA capacity to produce ferro silicon. The second furnace of similar capacity to produce silico manganese would be commissioned during the current quarter, said G.S. Rathi, wholetime director, SPL.

48,2020/02/03,Kinetic Green Energy bets on EVs for growth,"Pune-based Kinetic Green Energy & Power Solutions Ltd. is betting on electric vehicles (EV) and plans to raise $35 million (₹200 crore) through private equity to fund for its ventures.

“We are in advanced stages of negotiation with private equity players to raise the amount. It would be finalised within the next two to three months,” said Sulajja Firodia Motwani, founder and CEO, Kinetic Green Energy. However, it would not lead to a major dilution of our stake. We will still hold a majority stake,” she said.

The funds would be used for research and development activities, product development and increasing production capacity.

Founded in 2015, Kinetic Green Energy is the latest venture from the Kinetic and Firodia Group. It offers a full range of battery-operated three-wheelers such as e-autos, e-carts, buggies and cargo vehicles.

“In the last four years, we have sold 25,000 vehicles, more than that of organised players. Our vehicles have 90% indigenisation from the first e-rickshaw with a 70% import content,” she said.

The company has an order book for 20,000 vehicles. For FY21, the company plans to sell 23,000 units, equivalent to a turnover of ₹400 crore against an estimated revenue of ₹150 crore for FY20.

Stating that lot of disruption was happening in the automobile industry, she said: “The cost of lithium-ion batteries in EVs is coming down drastically compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE). Going forward, EVs with batteries will cost less than vehicles without fuel at point of sale.

Asserting that the Indian market currently was not conducive for electric cars, she said intra-city vehicles, that could ply up to 100 km such as two/three wheelers and buses, will be favoured by the general public. By 2030-35, about 40% of vehicles would be electric, she observed.",business,https://www.thehindu.com/business/pv2z42/article30728882.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/SAFAR-smart-1,https://www.thehindu.com/business/kinetic-green-energy-bets-on-evs-for-growth/article30728884.ece

50,2020/02/03,Eight J&K students back from China show no symptoms of coronavirus,"The Jammu & Kashmir administration on Monday said all eight students who recently flew back from China “are not showing any symptoms of any illness or presence of novel coronavirus”.

“Eight students from China have returned to J&K recently. They underwent check-ups at the Delhi airport and later in Kashmir, too. They are not showing any symptoms of illness or the coronavirus,” Dr. Sameer Mattoo, Director, Health Services, Kashmir, told The Hindu.

As a part of precautions, Dr. Mattoo said, “They continue to remain under surveillance but have not been isolated so far.”

Around 32 students from J&K are believed to be studying at the epicentre of the virus, Wuhan in China. Local leader Altaf Bukhari claimed he had approached the Ministry of External Affairs to evacuate the 32 Kashmiri students stranded in China.

However, contradicting the Director’s assertion, Deputy Commissioner, Baramulla, Dr. G. N. Itoo said he had inspected “the isolation and observation ward” on Monday, where the recently-returned students from China have been admitted.

He said he had organised a training-cum-awareness programme at the Government Medical College, Baramulla, “to generate awareness about symptoms and precautions to be taken to combat the coronavirus. Helpline numbers have also been set-up in the district for this purpose.”

Officials said seven more persons who have travelled to China in the past have arrived in Jammu and “remain under surveillance”, too.

53,2020/02/03,"Post DySP Singh’s arrest, slain, active militants houses, OGWs under NIA scanner","Family members of several active and slain militants, Over Ground Workers (OGW) and apple traders in Kashmir are under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) scanner as the national agency on Monday continued to pursue the case of recently arrested Deputy Superintendent of Police (DySP) Devinder Singh’s links with militant outfits.

Singh was arrested on January 11 while ferrying three militants, including Hizb-ul- Mujahideen commander Syed Naveeed Mushtaq alias Babu, on the Srinagar-Jammu highway and planning to shift them to safer locations in Jammu and Delhi.

Around 40 members of the NIA are camping in Kashmir and for the third consecutive day on Monday, multiple teams of the NIA raided several localities and questioned many in north and south Kashmir, including the ancestral house of Singh in Pulwama's Tral.

An official said the house at Ovary Gund village was searched. Locals said Singh was “not a very frequent visitor to Tral” after he shifted to Srinagar, where he reportedly owned two houses. According to the police, around Rs. 12 lakh was recovered from the house of Singh in Indira Nagar earlier.

The NIA teams raided the house of militant Shamsul Mengnoo, who was killed in January 2019 in an encounter, in Shopian. Mengnoo, a brother of 2012 batch IPS officer, was pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Unani medicine in a Srinagar college before joining militancy.

Officials said Farooq Ahmad Thokar, an OGW (a term coined by the security agencies for civilians supporting militants), was questioned for his links with militants. The house of Omar Dhobi, an active militant from Shopian, was searched.

The NIA has also shifted its focus to north Kashmir, where the house of a Power Development Department (PDD) employee was raided. The house of Fayaz Mir, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant arrested on January 30 from Kupwara’s Mir Mohalla Bumhama, was also raided.

Officials said the NIA seized a laptop, two mobile phones, two pen-drives and five passports from the residence of the PDD employee.

4 JeM ultras held

The J&K police said four Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) associates were held from Pulwama's Awantipora area.

The police identified them as Mohammad Amin, Mohammad Rafiq and Fayaz Lone, all residents of Khrew, and Maqbool Dar, a resident of Awantipora.

“They are involved in assisting militants. They were providing logistic support and shelter to the active terrorists of JeM, including JeM commander Qari Yasir and his other terror associates, who were recently killed in an encounter at Awantipora”, the police said.

A Bench led by Justice Arun Mishra issued notice on a petition filed by advocate G.S. Mani seeking the court to ask the governments at State and Central levels to file a report on the action taken against errant officials whose neglect led to the tragic deaths of children trapped in borewells.

55,2020/02/03,Maharashtra records highest number of missing women: NCRB,"The highest number of women and children who go missing in the country are from Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh respectively, according to a study by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The two States recorded the maximum number of cases of missing children and women among all other States in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

In 2019, the Supreme Court had directed the NCRB to “analyse the data on missing persons (especially on women and children) so that areas prone to persons being trafficked can be identified”.

The NCRB study was based on the annual Crime in India Report compiled by the agency for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

‘Not uniform’

The NCRB said that the study aims to identify the areas where registered cases of missing persons, specifically women and children, are higher than in other areas. “The need for the study arises because of the fact that incidents of missing women and children are not uniform across the country. Some parts of the country report higher incidents and such areas could be one of the source, transit or destination [sites] for child /women trafficking,” NCRB said.

According to the report, the three States where the highest number of women went missing in the three years are Maharashtra, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. In 2016, as many as 28,316 women went missing in Maharashtra, followed by 29,279 in the year 2017, and 33,964 in 2018.

Mumbai and Pune recorded the highest number of such incidents, with 4,718 and 5,201 women going missing in 2017 and 2018, while in Pune, the number of missing women for the same years was 2,576 and 2,504 respectively.

In West Bengal, the number of missing women for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 was 24,937, 28,133 and 31,299, respectively. Madhya Pradesh recorded 21,435, 26,587 and 29,761 missing reports of women in the three years.

Children reported

In the years 2016-18, a total of 63,407, 63,349 and 67,134 children were reported to be missing across the country. The maximum number of missing children reports were recorded in Maharashtra and West Bengal in the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

The study said that in Madhya Pradesh, Indore reported the highest number of missing children, with 596 in 2017 and 823 in 2018. The numbers for Satna district surged from 360 missing children in 2017 to 564 in 2018.

In West Bengal, Kolkata district had the maximum number of missing children reported in 2018, with 989 such cases, and Nadia district, bordering Bangladesh, showed a steep increase from 291 missing children reports in the year 2017 to 474 in 2018.

‘Vulnerable’

The NCRB quoted Wikipedia to define a missing person. The study said that “some young people run away from home due to unbearable conditions of abuse and maltreatment….they become vulnerable to trafficking, violence, drug addiction, prostitution and other risks of exploitation and involvement in crime,” and added that many missing persons end up getting trafficked.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/6vr6en/article30728973.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-missing-women-gr,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/maharashtra-records-highest-number-of-missing-women-ncrb/article30728296.ece

57,2020/02/03,Parliament proceedings | Opposition cries foul as Naidu refuses debate on CAA,"The Rajya Sabha Rulebook is redundant if it doesn’t give space to the Opposition, five Opposition parties said on Monday after the Chairman repeatedly refused to allow notices under Rule 267.

Majority of the Opposition parties gave notices under Rule 267, which allows suspension of the day’s business to debate issues of national importance, to debate the nationwide protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens. Following the Chairman’s denial, the House was adjourned four times through the day.

When the House met in the morning at 11:00 a.m., Chairman Venkaiah Naidu adjourned proceedings within 15 minutes following protests from the Opposition. At noon when the House met again, Opposition parties renewed their call to hold the debate, with the Trinamool Congress storming into the Well of the House and Congress members standing on their seats. The House was then adjourned till 2:00 p.m.

Later the post-lunch session, too, saw two adjournments, first at 2:00 p.m. for an hour and again after reconvening at 3:00 p.m. when it had to be adjourned within two minutes.

The Congress, RJD, DMK, NCP and CPI(M) addressed a joint press conference lodging their protest against the Chair’s ruling. Leader of Opposition and Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad said not only the CAA and NRC, even the National Population Register exercise is very problematic.

“NPR was done earlier too but it had very ordinary questions and was far simpler. This government through NPR wants to know date of birth and place of birth of your parents too. The BJP projects it as a Hindu-Muslim issue, which is flagrantly wrong,” he said.

Mr. Azad and NCP MP Vandana Chavan both said they will not be able to produce birth certificate or remember the date of birth of their parents.

“This is deliberate, because they have failed to deliver their promises like removing unemployment, bringing back black money, reducing inflation, doubling farmer’s income and so on. These are merely toys that they are handing over to common men to keep them engaged,” Mr. Azad added.

He alleged that in the States ruled by the BJP, over 30 persons who participated in protests against the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) have been killed.

“Rule 267 is to suspend business of the day to debate issues of national interest. This rule has become redundant now; it hasn’t been applied for any issue at any time. This is a pathetic situation. We are compelled to raise the issue again and again to reflect the sentiments of people of India,” DMK leader Tiruchi Siva said.

Ms. Chavan said that in her six-year tenure, she has not seen implementation of Rule 267. “If it’s not applied then why is it in the rulebook,” she asked, adding that Parliament is an apt forum to raise issues of national importance.

CPI (M) MP K.K. Ragesh said while the entire country is on the roads the government is refusing to listen to the voice of the people. “Unfortunately, they are trying to suppress the agitations by using lathis (sticks) and golis (bullets),” he said.

Deputy Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and Congress MP Anand Sharma said there was an environment of anxiety, fear and insecurity through out the country. He accused the BJP of orchestrating violence.

“Government is both arrogant and insensitive. Parliament is the highest forum of discussion and debate. If the opposition is not allowed to even mention the issue, which is unfortunate and undemocratic,” Mr Sharma said.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/qby10z/article30727947.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/raj,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-opposition-cries-foul-as-naidu-refuses-debate-on-caa/article30727948.ece

The Minister’s reply to a question posed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP from Odisha Aparajita Sarangi comes in the wake of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry (MoHUA) planning to redevelop the Central Vista, including demolishing and shifting the IGNCA from its current location on Man Singh Road to near Jamnagar House.

“As there is no large auditorium in Delhi with a large seating capacity, it was proposed by Ministry of Culture that a performing art auditorium may be constructed having seating capacity of 1,800 persons along with supporting public facilities like cafeteria, bookshop etc. in Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts (IGNCA) premises. However, no final decision has been taken yet,” the Minister’s reply read.

59,2020/02/03,Rajnath for expanding India’s defence ties,"Continued presence of terrorist infrastructure and state support to terrorists in the neighbouring country have tested India’s patience but as a responsible and powerful nation, India had displayed that it was able to disrupt and deter the activities of terrorist groups and their patrons, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday addressed Defence Attachés (DA) and called them to work to increase India’s defence exports.

“We need to be more focused to secure our interests. We have adopted pro-active measures to promote peace and stability in the region as well as to increase defence and security cooperation with the Indian Ocean rim countries so as to create a stable maritime environment,” Mr. Singh said at the third DA conference.

A large country like India cannot restrict its defence cooperation to a few countries. Efforts, he said, should be made to expand it continuously. In this direction, he announced the creation of 10 new Defence Wings so that 10 more DAs could be appointed. “This will further strengthen India's defence diplomacy,” he noted.

The establishment of two defence industrial corridors in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh is expected to increase defence manufacturing and exports. There was a lot of scope for DAs to work and attract FDI (foreign direct investment) in these corridors. India has also offered several defence Line of Credits (LOC) to friendly countries to allow Indian defence exports and increase their presence in the global market, he stated.

The government recently introduced a scheme to promote defence exports through DAs to their respective countries. Under this scheme, funds have been allocated for export promotion to 34 countries.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/96ksr4/article30727879.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/RAJNATHSINGH-NKV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rajnath-for-expanding-indias-defence-ties/article30727857.ece
60,2020/02/03,"Parliament proceedings | Congress, DMK target in LS Anurag Thakur for his remarks at poll rally in Delhi","Leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday said the government cannot silence people’s voice (boli) with bullet (goli) as members of the Congress and the DMK targeted Minister of State for Finance, Anurag Thakur, in the House.

Members of the Congress and the DMK, who were protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR), resorted to sloganeering every time Mr. Thakur answered a question during the Zero Hour for his controversial speech at an election rally earlier.

Speaker Om Birla and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi asked the members, who had come into the well of the Lok Sabha as soon as the Question Hour started at 11 am, to raise their concerns during the discussion on the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address.

As the Oppositions members didn’t relent, Mr. Birla announced an early lunch break soon after the Zero Hour had started.

As soon as Monday’s proceedings started, Opposition MPs, mainly from the Congress, started raising slogans against the CAA-NRC-NPR, prompting the Speaker to say the citizenship law had been discussed in detail.

“You can raise and discuss all issues that you want during the debate on the President’s address. You will get enough opportunity. You were elected by people through democratic process and it is my responsibility to give you opportunities to raise issues concerning people,” Mr. Birla said.

But the moment the Question Hour got under way and Mr. Thakur started answering questions relating to the Finance Ministry, the Opposition members were heard shouting Goli Maarna Band Karo (Stop shooting) in an obvious reference to the Minister’s objectionable comments for which the Election Commission had banned him and Parvesh Verma (also BJP) from campaigning in Delhi.

Amidst slogans of “Go Back” and “Shame Shame,” the MPs also displayed placards saying “Save India”, “Save Democracy” and “Save Constitution”.

“After the citizenship law was passed, common people are protesting against this. It is not something that is unjust. They are protesting with the Constitution in the hand, holding the national flag and singing the national anthem. But they are being fired upon and beaten mercilessly. The government cannot silence people’s voice with bullets,” Mr. Chowdhury said.

The action was against his controversial remarks at a recent poll rally, for which he has been barred by the Election Commission of India last week for four days. The Opposition members, including those from the Congress and the DMK, shouted “sharam karo” (have some shame).

In his speech, Mr. Verma praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and congratulated Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presenting the budget which, he said, “has given a sigh of relief to the common man.”

He accused the Opposition parties of indulging in vote bank politics and creating problems on issues such as Article 370.

On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), he said, “We will not take back CAA. It is a question of the country's integrity.”

Lord Ram gave the message of humanity but the Congress linked him with religion. “If Opposition members chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’, their sins will be washed away”. he said.“Ram and my government are not of a particular religion or region. My government talks of Ram mandir; it also talks about toilets”.

Participating in the discussion, Gaurav Gogoi, INC, asked the Opposition why no Cabinet Ministers were present in the House at the time. “People of India are quoting the Constitution and protesting in the streets. The ruling party thinks they can rule like dictators once they have won elections. Women and children are being portrayed as enemies,” he said.

“Ministers are making inflammatory statements, provoking attacks on protesters. Ministers are made to speak this way by their political masters. In fact a person banned by the Election Commission [Parvesh Sahib Singh] is speaking in the House as the main speaker of the BJP,” he noted.

Mahua Moitra, TMC, accused the government of betraying the people who voted for them and lacking humility. She said: “You have the betrayed the youth who were looking for jobs, the small businessmen with GST, tribals in Gujarat whose land you took away to build a statue.”

“You came to power because a very large section of ordinary people cast aside whatever reservations they might have had and believed you when you said ‘Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’. You have shattered their trust,” she added.

The move has opened the doors of discussion on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Parliament, which has witnessed nationwide protests.

President Ram Nath Kovind on January 31 hailed the CAA as “historic” in his address to the joint sitting of both houses of Parliament, prompting protests by some Opposition members.

Trinamool Congress MP Derek O’ Brien and Rajya Sabha chief whip Sukhendu Sekhar Ray have moved amendments on behalf of the party in Rajya Sabha pertaining to the “silence” of the President on the ongoing protest against the CAA and demanding that the speech include the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), and the National Population Register (NPR).

According to party sources, amendments will be moved in the Lok Sabha as well. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) has 22 MPs in Lok Sabha and 13 in Rajya Sabha.

The party has moved six amendments to the President’s address.

The sources said the TMC’s amendments say that at the end of the speech a “regret that the address fails to acknowledge the hardships and anxieties of people caused due to the passing of the CAA, and fails to allay the people’s fear of a nationwide NRC and NPR” be added.

Another sought the expression of regret that the speech did not take into account the “hardships of peaceful protesters, including students who were illegally detained, denied medical care, lathicharged, fired at and subjected to other forms of torture”.

Among the other amendments moved include “absence of the mention of economic slowdown, drop of India’s rank on the Global Press Freedom Index, EIU’s Global Democracy Index and a low rank on the Global Hunger Index, failure to condemn hate speech and divisive statements made by Ministers and MPs and silence over the six-month long detention of political leaders, including sitting MP from Jammu and Kashmir and former Chief Ministers of the State”.

The total attachment in the case now stands at Rs.4,750 crore.

The bank accounts of Multiple Resorts, St. Xavier’s College and Knight Riders Sports -- attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act -- have an overall balance of Rs.16.20 crore, the ED said.

Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan's wife Gauri Khan, actor Juhi Chawla's husband Jay Mehta and Venkatesh Mysore are the directors of Knight Riders Sports.

It has also attached 24 acres of landed property at Ramnagar and Mahishdal in Purba Medinipur, one acre of landed property at Jyoti Basu Nagar and a hotel in West Bengal, besides a flat at Dilkap Chambers in Mumbai.

The ED probe is based on the FIRs and charge sheets filed by the West Bengal police against the Rose Valley Group of companies and others. It is alleged that the companies fraudulently collected deposits of more than Rs.17,520 crore from the public with the intention to cheat them by falsely promising high returns on their investment.

An amount of Rs.10,850 crore was repaid, but the remaining still remains outstanding. The group diverted and siphoned off the funds. It had “no real business” that could generate money for repayment.

Earlier, the ED had identified and attached properties having a tentative market value of about Rs.4,680 crore, which included several luxurious resorts, hotels, vehicles, flats, lands, bullion and jewellery.

HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal said in the Lok Sabha that central universities are statutory autonomous organisations, and all administrative and academic decisions are taken by the university with the approval of its statutory bodies such as Executive Council, Academic Council and Court etc. and universities are also competent to deal with such incidents.

“There are reports of violence in the JMI and AMU. However, no such incident in the campus was reported by the AU. The JMI has made a request for constitution of a high-powered committee to inquire into the incident of violence in the campus,” he said during the Question Hour.

The minister said as the subject matter pertained to law and order, this request has been referred to the department concerned for appropriate action.

“The AMU and AU have not made such a request to the Ministry of Human Resource Development. As per provisions of the act of the university, the executive council of the university shall have the power for management and administration of the revenue and property of the university,” he said.

68,2020/02/03,Former IPS officer Abdur Rehman barred from addressing anti-CAA protest at AMU,"Former special inspector general of police (IGP) Abdur Rehman, who was set to address a protest at the Aligarh Muslim University against the amended citizenship law, was detained by police here and asked to return to New Delhi.

Mr. Rehman, who had resigned from his post in December last year in protest against the CAA, was detained at Lodha Police Station in Aligarh on Sunday.

The former IPS officer from Maharashtra told reporters that he was served a written notice by police stating that his presence at the AMU could lead to a law and order problem, and hence he decided to comply with this missive “and would come back” again after he gets permission.

Mr. Rehman said he was invited at the university on Sunday by the AMU Students Co-ordination Committee to address them on the Citizenship Amendment Act.

He had resigned from his post on December 11, 2019 in protest against the the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill which later got President Ram Nath Kovind’s assent, turning it into an act.

69,2020/02/03,SC to frame issues for 9-Bench hearing on religious rights,"Renowned jurist and senior advocate Fali Nariman has objected to the manner in which the Supreme Court turned a review of the Sabarimala case into an opportunity to set up a nine-judge Bench and examine whether certain essential religious practices of various faiths, including Islam and Zoroastrianism, should be constitutionally protected.

“Are you saying that when hearing the review of one judgment [Sabarimala in this case], we cannot refer such larger questions to a larger Bench?” Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad A. Bobde, heading the nine-judge Bench, asked Mr. Nariman on Monday.

“Yes, that is absolutely right. It will be outside your jurisdiction to do that,” Mr. Nariman replied emphatically.

The CJI observed orally that Mr. Nariman had a “formidable point there”.

He said the nine-judge Bench would not “abort the hearing” now. The objections raised by Mr. Nariman would be framed as an “issue” to be decided by the Bench. It would convene on Thursday to fix the dates of the hearings that would start from next week. The CJI clarified that the nine judges would confer and frame the issues for hearing.

Senior advocate K. Parasaran countered Mr. Nariman, saying the Sabarimala case had its genesis in public interest petitions. It was not an in personam (affecting a specific person) litigation. In a case emanating from a PIL, there is no restraint on a constitutional court in extending the scope or questions to be examined, he argued.

The Sabarimala case review by a five-judge Bench led by then CJI Ranjan Gogoi took a curious turn on November 14 last. The Bench sidestepped the task of reviewing the September 2018 judgment, which declared the prohibition on the entry of women of menstruating age into the Sabarimala temple as discriminatory. Instead, the Bench referred seven questions, including whether essential religious practices should be afforded constitutional protection under Article 26 (freedom to manage religious affairs), to a larger Bench. Further, the Review Bench tagged other pending cases on the prohibition of Muslim women from entering mosques, female genital mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras and the ban on Parsi women who married inter-faith from entering the fire temple to the reference.

Chief Justice Bobde, when he succeeded Justice Gogoi, promptly set up the nine-judge Bench to decide this reference.

On Monday, Mr. Nariman argued that the Gogoi Bench had no business to either drag other cases into the reference nor frame such “larger issues” when its sole mandate was to simply review the Sabarimala verdict.

Mr. Nariman said he could cite at least six judgments of the Court holding that a Bench sitting in review cannot frame new issues and refer them to a larger Bench. Review jurisdiction was rare and limited. The task of a review Bench was only to ascertain there was no apparent error or gross miscarriage of justice in the original judgment.

Chief Justice Bobde said the nine-judge Bench would not decide on the legality of the religious practices under challenge in the individual cases referred to it.

But Mr. Nariman intervened to say that courts “cannot decide the law without applying the facts of each case”.

‘Speculative opinions’

Senior advocate Shyam Divan added that courts cannot indulge in “speculative opinions”. “The November 14 judgment was speculative in nature,” he said.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan asked how the Sabarimala review could be kept in limbo. “A review cannot be adjourned or postponed as the November 14 judgment has done… How can you hear larger issues when the review is pending?”, he said.

The CJI said Mr. Nariman and others “may be correct in saying that law ought to be decided as and when cases come and not in anticipation or pre-emption of their coming”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/brc9np/article29987312.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/16tvpt-ayyappatemple1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sabarimala-case-sc-to-frame-questions-relating-to-discrimination-against-women-in-religions/article30724662.ece
70,2020/02/03,PM urged to condemn BJP leaders’ 'threats' during Delhi poll campaign,"Feminists, women’s rights activists and NGOs on Monday wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to break his silence and condemn alleged rampant threats of violence and rape issued by BJP leaders in the run-up to February 8 Delhi elections.

“What is this kind of communal hate and fear-mongering that you, as head of government, are encouraging, that seeks to make women of all communities feel more insecure and threatened? We have long suffered violence on our bodies, with little access to justice. We condemn this attempt to demean our histories of pain and fear by using it for cheap, divisive electioneering,” a total of 175 persons said in the letter.

During poll campaign in Delhi, BJP MP Anurag Singh Thakur and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath allegedly exhorted the use of gun violence against anti-CAA protesters, most of whom are women accompanied by their children. BJP MP Parvesh Verma had said: “Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh]. People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They’ll enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them.”

“Vote for BJP or you will get raped! Is this your election message to Delhi’s women? Is this how low your party has sunk,” the letter asked.

They urged Mr. Modi to “speak out against targeted violence and hate speech”, “take action, including under relevant criminal provisions of the penal code, against violence-mongering party members,” as well as fight Delhi election “in a manner that upholds the dignity of our Constitution and the security of India’s women”.

The signatories to the letter include feminist economist Devaki Jain, craft activist Laila Tyabji, former Ambassador of India Madhu Bhaduri, former member of Planning Commission Syeda Hameed, feminist historian Uma Chakravarti as well as organisations such as Saheli, Women against Sexual Violence and State Repression (WSS), All India Democratic Women’s Association, Muslim Women’s Forum, among others.

On Monday, Opposition members walked out of the Lok Sabha as Mr. Verma rose to initiate the discussion on Motion of Thanks on President’s Speech.

72,2020/02/03,Nagaland Dy. CM flayed for pejorative term,"Less than a year after “Miyah poetry” has kicked up a storm in Assam, Nagaland’s Dy. Chief Minister Y. Patton has attracted criticism for referring the Nagas of a specific area as ‘Miya’.

It is a pejorative term in the northeast meaning Bengali-speaking or Bengal-origin Muslims.

The National People’s Party (NPP) on Saturday issued a statement criticising Mr. Patton for equating the people of the Ralan area of the Wokha district with Miya. The Deputy Chief Minister, also BJP Legislative Party chief, allegedly used the term while speaking at a convention of the Lotha Students’ Union (LSU) at Maratchu on January 28.

“He nursed a long-held grudge for getting fewer votes from the Ralan area in the past Assembly elections, and despite being a Lotha himself, called them ‘Miya jaat [race]’,” NPP leader Hayithung Bill Lotha said.

Mr. Lotha said Mr. Patton had used the term “intentionally to connote a most appalling and derogatory category” of people, thereby insulting both the Muslims and the Lotha Nagas, one of the 16 official tribes of Nagaland.

Mr. Patton said his speech in the Lotha dialect had been twisted. He also denied having claimed to facilitate backdoor appointments through the Nagaland Public Service Commission (NPSC).

In a bid to defend him, the Lotha Students’ Union (LSU) admitted that the NPSC exams and interviews were not fair. The Deputy Chief Minister had made the speech at the LSU’s 51st general convention at Maratchu.

“Shri Y. Patton, directly made a point that any merit candidate from the Lotha community who qualifies in the NPSC written exam or any State department exam must come to him so that he will make sure proper justice will be done (sic)...,” LSU president Lipemo M. Tsopoe said in a letter to the apex Naga Students’ Federation on Sunday.

Mr. Mahato, the main leader of the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), was arrested in 2009 for building up a movement against the CPI(M) with the help of the outlawed Maoist party. He was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to life imprisonment. Opposing police excesses in Jhargram district, he led a tribal movement which catapulted him to prominence. At one point, he allegedly coordinated with the Maoists on one hand and the Trinamool Congress’ (TMC) leaders on the other, to build up resistance against the CPI(M) government.

People’s movement

The popular people’s movement under the banner of the PCAPA flagged alleged atrocities committed by local CPI(M) leaders over the years and the administrations’ high-handed approach. He was arrested, but the CPI(M) was also defeated in the area. Despite being in jail, Mr. Mahato contested in the 2011 Assembly polls and bagged nearly 20,000 votes, which “was an indication of his popularity in Jangalmahal,” Mr. Mahato’s wife Niyoti told The Hindu in 2016.

However, following his arrest and the killing of Maoist leader Mallojula Koteswara Rao (Kishenji), the people’s movement in the western districts of has Bengal fizzled out. The TMC also partially lost grip in the backward tribal areas of Jhargram and Purulia.

In the panchayat poll of 2018, the BJP bagged 42% and 33% seats in Jhargram and the adjacent Purulia respectively, far higher than its State average of 18%. In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, the TMC lost both the Jhargram and Purulia seats to the BJP and even the adjacent ones, partly dominated by the tribals.

“In this context, many in the area believe that Mr. Mahato can play a significant role in the area. He may form a party which can pull a percentage of anti-TMC tribal votes, which in the last elections went to the BJP,” said a CPI-Maoist sympathiser.

However, it would depend on Mr. Mahato’s crowd-pulling ability and “no one knows if he still is as popular as he was at the time of his arrest”.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/chhatradhar-mahato-released-from-prison/article30721834.ece
74,2020/02/03,Harmeet’s killing in Pakistan linked to fight over drug money,"The killing of Harmeet Singh “PHD”, the alleged Khalistan Liberation Force leader who was gunned down in Pakistan’s Lahore this past week, is the fallout of a rivalry between three groups over control on drug money, suspect enforcement agencies.

“There is an ongoing rivalry between Pakistan-based Khalistani groups led by Harmeet Singh, Khalistan Zindabad Force’s Ranjit Singh Neeta, and Paramjit Singh Panjwar of the Khalistan Commando Force. Initial reports suggest that drug money has been a major factor,” said an official.

Harmeet Singh was wanted by various Indian agencies, including the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Punjab Police, in 17 cases.

“The CBI is pursuing a case registered in August 2016, while the NIA is probing seven cases. Provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, Explosive Substances Act, and the Arms Act, have also been invoked against him,” the official said.

Heroin trafficking

The official said the recent spurt in trafficking of Afghan-origin heroin through traditional sea routes via Pakistan had led to generation of huge money for the syndicates that were also being used to push weapons into India for terror activities.

Preliminary investigations into the seizure of about 200 kg of heroin worth close to ₹2,000 crore in the international market in Amritsar’s Sultanwind village earlier this week have indicated that it was part of a bigger contraband consignment that landed at Mandvi in Gujarat last year via a sea route.

Punjab’s Special Task Force has arrested six persons, including an Afghan national, for their role in the smuggling. “The latest case also shows that Punjab has also become a destination for large-scale consumption of heroin,” the official said.

The agencies have come across several instances that establish sea routes taken earlier by gold smugglers in the 1970s are now being used for the trafficking of heroin.

Mozambique transit

While such drug seizures were recently made from Gujarat in India, and in Maldives and Sri Lanka, the latest case was reported from Mozambique, which is now said to have become a major transit point for the smuggling of Afghan-origin heroin via Pakistan to Europe.

In December, off the coast of the northern province of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique’s Navy and National Criminal Investigation Service (SERNIC) forces arrested 13 Pakistani nationals. They were allegedly attempting to smuggle more than 430 kg of heroin on a boat.

Earlier, in the same month, the Mozambican agencies had detained 12 Iranian nationals in a similar operation.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/fdjx9/article30720813.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02TH-THGRP-HARMEET,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/harmeets-killing-in-pakistan-linked-to-fight-over-drug-money/article30720298.ece
75,2020/02/03,"VHP, JDP clash over tribal mass wedding","Tension erupted in the Aatmail area in the Malda district on Sunday after activists of the Jharkhand Disom Party (JDP), a locally powerful party of tribals, blocked the national highway-34 protesting against a mass wedding organised by the Viswa Hindu Parishad (VHP), officials said. The members of the JDP and the VHP pelted stones and attacked each other with arrows leaving a few including a policeman injured.

The incident occurred when the JDP members alleged that the VHP was organising the adivasi mass wedding ignoring their rituals. A large police force was sent to the spot to control the situation, an official said.

“Today’s mass marriage, which was organised by the VHP, was being held as per Hindu rituals. We feel that by doing this the adivasis are being converted,” a leader of the JDP Mohan Hansda said. Mr. Hansda said the poor couples were paid ₹12,000 per family to participate in the event. North Bengal VHP convener Tarun Pandit said the programme concluded successfully.

Block Development Officer (BDO) of Old Malda Irfan Habib said the situation was brought under control by the police and people have returned from the site. Approximately 40 couples got married on Sunday during the programme, he said.

The incident took place at Debbari village in Amarpur subdivision on January 29. The half-nude woman could be seen crying and screaming while an irate mob of women assault her.

The woman registered a complaint on Saturday against the accused persons, an officer of the Birganj police station in Amarpur said on Sunday. “We have started an investigation and appropriate action will be taken against the culprits,” he said.

The footage shows the woman receiving heavy blows. Some women are even seen to be carrying sticks.

Police also suspect the involvement of the victim’s husband and her family members in the incident.

77,2020/02/03,Adityanath targets Kejriwal,"Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said Pakistan and AAP chief Arvind Kejriwal had felt pain when the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 was withdrawn.

Mr. Adityanath said the Shaheen Bagh protest was a “malicious attempt to disturb peace and normal life” in the national capital.

Addressing a rally at Badarpur here, he said that in the Delhi election, on one side there was the leadership of Narendra Modi for development and nationalism, and on the other, there was the Congress and Mr. Kejriwal who “support divisive forces”.

“The BJP is working with zero tolerance towards terrorism. But Kejriwal is busy sponsoring and offering biryani in Shaheen Bagh,” he said.

The U.P. Chief Minister appealed to the people in Badarpur constituency to vote for the BJP, saying that the whole country and the world were watching them as to whom they support in the Delhi election.

Questioning the motive of the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Adityanath alleged it was a “pretext to oppose abrogation of Article 370, court’s judgement on Ram temple and Triple Talaq ban.”

“The Shaheen Bagh protest is a pretext. They had to protest against the removal of Article 370 and construction of a grand Ram temple in Ayodhya. We can understand their problem. Their problem is ban on Triple Talaq.”

The protest at Shaheen Bagh in southeast Delhi, participated by large number of women, is going on since mid-December against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The Aam Aadmi Party on Sunday asked the Election Commission to ban Mr. Adityanath from campaigning in the national capital over his alleged provocative speeches and also sought his arrest.

Mr. Adiyanath also slamemd the Kejriwal government for “obstructing” various government schemes in Delhi.

He said the BJP will implement these schemes including Kisan Samman Nidhi and Ayushman Bharat health scheme after forming the government in Delhi.

Asserting that he ensured peaceful Kanwar Yatras in Delhi, Mr. Adityanath said he has warned that those trying to “attack” these religious processions will have to face police bullets.

“I gave directions to make proper arrangements to welcome Lord shiva’s devotees. People said riots will take place, but I said if anyone attacks Kanwar Yatras, then police bullets, and not merely words, will put sense into them.”

Referring to the anti-CAA protests in U.P., he asserted that his government dealt with it by declaring that protesters involved in damaging public property will have to compensate it.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/irq1gy/article30718993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/de01yogiART0GFB72FVCJ3jpgjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/adityanath-targets-kejriwal/article30722446.ece
78,2020/02/03,Doctors turn activists to fight Paraquat poisoning in western Odisha,"It may appear strange to see a few young doctors with stethoscopes around their necks talking to relatives of patients on the use of a particular herbicide in agricultural fields. Yet, this can be seen regularly in the corridors of the Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (VIMSAR) here.

What made these doctors take up such a subject? The VIMSAR, a major public healthcare centre for western Odisha and parts of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, has registered 157 deaths, mostly of farmers, since September 2017. The reason behind these deaths is the consumption of Paraquat — a herbicide used in agricultural fields. The tragedy stirred the conscience of young doctors, forcing them into the role of medical activists.

Fatal impact

The young doctors have undertaken hunger strikes, sent missives to their bosses, tried to sensitise the media, and held discussions with farmers’ associations. Together, they have drawn attention to the fatal impact of Paraquat — very few have survived after consuming it.

The constant pressure from the young medicos has forced the State government to withdraw its subsidy and stop the promotion of Paraquat. But what’s even more elating is the fall in the number of patients who arrive at VIMSAR with Paraquat poisoning over the last few months.

“It gives me immense satisfaction to stop people from coming to the hospital and then seeing them slowly succumbing to Paraquat poisoning, which does not have any antidote,” said Shankar Ramachandani, Senior Resident Doctor in VIMSAR, who has spearheaded the movement against use of Paraquat.

‘Not comfort zone’

“I cannot forget the episode when a woman put all her gold ornaments before me and literally touched my feet, urging me to save her husband who had consumed Paraquat. It forced us to come out of our comfort zone,” said Dr. Ramachandani.

The records say that, between September and December 2017, as many as 32 persons were admitted with Paraquat poisoning to VIMSAR. Of them, 31 did not survive, and one patient left against medical advice.

From January to December 2018, 64 patients with Paraquat poisoning came to the hospital. Of them, 59 died, one survived and four left the hospital. From January to August 2019, 53 persons were admitted with Paraquat poisoning; the doctors could not save 50 of them, while relatives shifted three patients to other hospitals.

From September 2019 till date only 24 patients with Paraquat poisoning have been admitted to VIMSAR. Of them, 17 died while six have left with the advice of doctors, and one person died outside VIMSAR.

Not all Paraquat poisoning deaths occur at VIMSAR; people could be dying in other district-level hospitals too.

No antidote

“Paraquat consumption leads to pulmonary fibrosis and patients find difficulty in respiration. Similarly, kidney failures occur. Even if a person survives, he will not be fully fit as pulmonary fibrosis worsens with the passage of time. Paraquat does not have antidote. We are treating patients symptomatically,” Dr. Ramchandani said.

The vast majority of the population in western Odisha and its bordering districts in Chhattisgarh are dependent on agriculture. Crop failures and family disturbances often drive people to look for poison to commit suicide and Paraquat, which is easily available at homes as well as in neighbourhood shops, becomes an “obvious” choice. There have also been cases of people becoming accidental victims when they absorb Paraquat while sprinkling it in agricultural fields.

“We spread the message about [the danger of] Paraquat by talking to people and conducting awareness campaigns with farmer organisations,” said Dr. Rajesh Mohanty, who also serves at VIMSAR.

VIMSAR’s medicos are demanding a complete ban on Paraquat, which is already in place in some States.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/doctors-turn-activists-to-fight-paraquat-poisoning-in-western-odisha/article30720765.ece
79,2020/02/03,Victims’ forum to challenge amnesty to NDFB members,"A victims’ forum of militancy in Assam has decided to go to court if members of all the factions of the extremist National Democratic Front of Boroland (NDFB) are granted a general amnesty.

Various groups representing the Bodo community had raised a demand to provide general amnesty to the members of the NDFB factions after the Bodo Peace Accord was signed in New Delhi on January 27.

The Forum for Terrorist Victim Family, Assam said the Bodo people deserved the welfare envisaged in the accord, but pardoning extremist leaders “responsible for bloodshed” would encourage militancy besides disrespecting the judiciary.

“A peace treaty that lets militants who killed innocent people be treated as VIPs will encourage others to take up arms. We will write to the Chief Justice of India and seek his intervention for the sake of justice,” said the forum’s founder Dhananjoy Saikia, whose father Kamala Saikia was killed by members of the United Liberation Front of Asom in 1991.

Other members of the forum have reminded the government of the serial blasts on October 30, 2008, which killed 88 people in Guwahati and three western Assam towns. A special court had in January 2019 sentenced NDFB founder-chairman Ranjan Daimari and nine others to life imprisonment for their involvement in the blasts.

Hagrama Mohilary, the chief of Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC), and the All Bodo Students’ Union have asked the government to withdraw the cases against Mr. Daimari and the others. After 1,615 members of the NDFB laid down arms on January 30 in accordance with the Bodo Accord, the Assam government said a proper rehabilitation plan would be worked out for the members of all its factions.

Some 2,900 more members of the NDFB factions are scheduled to lay down their arms on February 7 at the BTC headquarters, Kokrajhar on February 7.

80,2020/02/03,Move to review procurement policy will meet with stiff opposition: farmers,"As the debate surrounding the review of the open-ended procurement policy has started gaining momentum following a recommendation by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Price (CACP) to the Centre government, several farmers and farmer bodies in key grain-producing States of Punjab and Haryana have hinted that any move to stop or limit the purchase of wheat and rice at the Minimum Support Price (MSP) would be opposed in the strongest possible manner.

Agri-experts also believe that the current policy is in the best interests of the country and farmers and any deviation could have negative impact on them.

In its Price Policy for Rabi crops - the marketing season 2020-21, the CACP has said: “The open-ended procurement policy for rice and wheat has led to mounting food stocks and adversely affected crop diversification. These excess stocks create storage problems and also high storage and financing costs leading to high food subsidy burden. The Commission recommends that open-ended procurement policy should be reviewed.

“The CACP has given its recommendation in the backdrop of mounting food stocks, which raises the fear that the Centre would limit procurement as a first step towards putting an end to the MSP purchase. There’s no point in considering any such review. Any change in the MSP procurement policy will adversely impact the farmers and the economy of both States,” said Jagmohan Singh, State general secretary of the Bhartiya Kisan Union Ekta (Dakaunda).

Expressing similar sentiments Sarvan Singh Pandher, general secretary of the Punjab unit of the Kisan Mazdoor Sangarsh Smiti, said: “The farmers are managing to survive only because wheat and paddy here are purchased at the MSP. If this process is stopped or even limited, it would be nothing short of ‘signing their death warrant’. Farmers are already under financial distress. Most of the crops other than wheat and paddy don’t get remunerative price causing huge loss to farmers..”

Pargat Singh, who has sown wheat in his 14-acre farm at Rolu Majra village in district Rupnagar, said a reason cited by the CACP for review is that the policy has led to mounting food stocks and adversely affected crop diversification. “The reality, however, is that farmers are not being taken out of this cycle [wheat/paddy]. To bring crop diversification, the need is to fix proper remuneration and assured market. The government should ensure a mechanism where farmers can get an assured remunerative price for crops cultivated by them other than wheat and paddy.”

Under its present policy, the Central government extends price support to the two crops through the FCI and the State agencies. The wheat and paddy offered within the stipulated period and conforming to the specifications prescribed by the Centre are purchased at the MSP by the government agencies including the FCI.

The objective of procurement is to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices and do not have to resort to distress sale. It aims at serving the National Food Security Act and other welfare schemes so that subsidised foodgrains are supplied to the poor and needy and build buffer-stocks to ensure foodgrain security.

Noted economists at the Ludhiana-based Punjab Agricultural University, Prof. M.S. Sidhu said: “The present policy is in the best interests of the country. Wheat and rice are basic food items. How will the NFSA be implemented? We need to understand the fact that there are few surplus States and production of wheat is limited to a few States. There’s an inter-State movement of foodgrains — from surplus States to deficit States,” said Mr. Sidhu.

Haryana-based farmer leader Gun Parkash of the Bharatiya Kisan Union points out that the budgetary allocation for food subsidy has declined this year. “There has been a decline in the allocations to the FCI for lifting the foodgrains. This has resulted in the FCI being under huge debt. The concern now is that this would be used as a pretext to dismantle the open-ended procurement policy in the days to come,” said Mr. Parkash.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/move-to-review-procurement-policy-will-meet-with-stiff-opposition-farmers/article30720284.ece
81,2020/02/03,‘Rituals vital to Sabarimala temple’s essential practices’,"Rituals, ceremonies, observances and sacrifices performed by devotees, including the self-restraint exercised by the women devotees of the reproductive age in not entering the Sabarimala temple, are integral components of the essential practices associated with the temple since time immemorial, a senior member of the Pandalam royal family argued before a nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court.

“Devotees demonstrate their devotion and reverence to the disposition of Lord Shree Ayyappa as a Naishtika Brahmachari by strictly adhering to such codes. Such codes, which are non-secular, cannot be subjected to the test of Article 14,” said a four-page note, prepared by senior advocate K. Radha Krishnan, representing the Pandalam royal family member Raja Raja Varma.

A person who intends to worship at the temple has to subscribe to its “institutional morality”. “A person who does not subscribe to the code has no locus to call into question the essential practices, custom and usage of the temple,” the note said.

The Bench, led by Chief Justice of India Sharad A. Bobde, will assemble on February 3 to frame issues on a series of petitions, including the one on the Sabarimala temple’s prohibition of women of menstruating age. These petitions concerning multiple faiths highlight the tug-of-war between the equal right of women to worship and the right to religious practices.

The note said the right to religious practices and beliefs was not subservient to the right to equality. Courts could not impose the concept of “constitutional morality” to override religious practices.

The Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules, 1965, does not govern the temple. Though the temple is of a public character, its essential character of an unincorporated family temple could not be altered, Mr. Varma said. Thus, the members of the donor family — the Pandalam royal family — have a right and duty to protect the temple’s rites and rituals.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/1uqyhi/article30722020.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THSABARIMALA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/rituals-vital-to-sabarimala-temples-essential-practices/article30722021.ece

With Delhi Assembly elections scheduled for February 8, the ECI had reviewed preparations, including law and order, on January 31 and appointed a special police observer.

84,2020/02/03,Study on bats and bat hunters in Nagaland to be probed,"The government has ordered an inquiry into a study conducted in Nagaland by researchers from the U.S., China and India on bats and humans carrying antibodies to deadly viruses like Ebola, officials confirmed to The Hindu.

The inquiry comes as officials worldwide grapple with the spread of novel coronavirus 2019, from Wuhan, China, to 20 countries, that has resulted in over 300 deaths.

The study came under the scanner as two of the 12 researchers belonged to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and it was funded by the United States Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). They would have required special permissions as foreign entities.

The study, conducted by scientists of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in the U.S. and the Duke-National University in Singapore, is now being investigated for how the scientists were allowed to access live samples of bats and bat hunters (humans) without due permissions. The results of the study were published in October last in the PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases journal, originally established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The NCBS authorities were not available for immediate response.

“The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) sent a five-member committee to investigate. The inquiry is complete, and a report has been submitted to the Health Ministry,” a senior government official told The Hindu.

The U.S. Embassy and the Union Health Ministry declined to comment on the inquiry. In a written reply to questions from The Hindu, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta said it “did not commission this study and had not received any enquiries [from the Indian government] on it.” An American official, however, suggested that the U.S. Department of Defense might not have coordinated the study through the CDC.

The study, ‘Filovirus-reactive antibodies in humans and bats in Northeast India imply Zoonotic spillover’, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases states the researchers found “the presence of filovirus (e.g. ebolavirus, marburgvirus and dianlovirus) reactive antibodies in both human (e.g. bat hunters) and bat populations in Northeast India, a region with no historical record of Ebola virus disease.”

Bats often carry ebola, rabies, marburg and the SARS coronavirus. Many high-profile epidemics have been traced to bats, and scientists are discovering new bat-borne viruses all the time. Ebola and Marburg viruses are known to cause severe hemorrhagic fevers, which affect many organs and damage the blood vessels, killing more than 50 percent of the people they infect, according to the World Health Organization.

It adds: “Ebola has posed a global health threat several times, most notably from 2013 to 2016. It is a deadly disease, with a fatality rate of roughly 50 percent.” Now, according to health officials, 2019-nCoV, too, has acquired the ability to pass between people and can do so before symptoms appear.

The Nagaland study suggests bats in South Asia act as a reservoir host of a diverse range of filoviruses, and filovirus spillover occurs through human exposure to these bats. For the study done in 2017, 85 individuals participating in an annual bat harvest at Mimi, Nagaland, were picked. The majority of bat hunters were male, aged between 18 and 50, and participated at least eleven times in the harvest. The study says the potential virus present in the bats may not be an exact copy of the virus responsible for various outbreaks.

Given the widespread challenges from the newly discovered viruses, officials say they want to take no chance on their spread and will take action to ensure all medical studies in the country adhere to strict norms.",national,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/w708zs/article30722177.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Bats,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/study-on-bats-and-bat-hunters-of-nagaland-come-under-the-scanner/article30722099.ece

88,2020/02/03,Gandhi Hill custody row spurs Central Gandhi Smarak Nidhi’s intervention,"The Gandhi Hill, a monument built in city to pay homage to Mahatma Gandhi, is in the throes of a prolonged stand-off between members of the Gandhi Hill Foundation and the Andhra Pradesh chapter of the Gandhi Smarak Nidhi (GSN) over its custody.

The deadlock has its origin in the undivided State when Andhra Pradesh Smarak Nidhi (then in Hyderabad) constituted a Gandhi Hill Society at the local level in Vijayawada for upkeep of the hill since it was not possible for it to supervise the day-to-day affairs from Hyderabad. This society was later converted into a trust and named Gandhi Hill Foundation which is now helmed by former BJP MP Gokaraju Gangaraju.

After bifurcation, office-bearers of the GSN, New Delhi, which owns the property, constituted a separate Smarak Nidhi for Andhra Pradesh, authorising it to set up its office at the Gandhi Hill and work for the development of the place. A meeting, presided over by the Central Gandhi Smarak Nidhi general secretary Ramachander Rahi, held on Gandhi Hill on September 23 in 2017, decided to dissolve the Gandhi Hill Foundation since a separate AP chapter of the GSN was in place now.

‘Independent body’

Mr. Gangaraju, said to be nursing a grouse against the Central Smarak Nidhi for denying funds to develop the hill, struck a discordant note, claiming that the Gandhi Hill Foundation was affiliated to the Smarak Nidhi in composite AP but after bifurcation, it became an independent body. “Gandhi Hill now has no connection with anybody as the Central Smarak Nidhi owns only four acres of land while the remaining land belongs to the government.”

He said the place was completely abandoned and reduced to gamblers’ den and used by unscrupulous elements for five years. “I spent money from my pocket to bring back life here,” he said. Mr. Gangaraju recently handed over the site to the Vijayawada Municipal Corporation for development, an act that has unsettled members of the AP GSN, who apprised the Central Smarak Nidhi office-bearers about it.

“Ever since the AP GSN was constituted, we have made many attempts to sort out the issue to pave the way for development of the place but in vain,” said Gandhi P.C. Kaza, Chairman of the State body. He said they were in touch with the Central body.

‘Not a personal property’

“Gandhi Hill is not a personal property. The Gandhi Hill Foundation was set up for the upkeep of the place. Mr. Gangaraju has been violating all the rules and by-laws of the Smarak Nidhi. He is unapproachable,” Sanjay Singha, general secretary of the Central GSN told The Hindu.

He said the Central body was trying to talk to the Collector and sort out the issue. “Our team from Delhi will be there soon to fix the ownership and custodianship issues once and for all,” he said.

Tourist hub

The Collector, when contacted, said his only concern was development of the hill. “Gandhi Hill has a rich heritage. The Mahatma made six visits to this city and this memorial commemorates that. We want this place to be developed as a tourist hub, which in turn, will also promote Gandhian values,” said Mr. Imtiaz.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/wki7ud/article30729241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJPAGEGANDHIHILL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/gandhi-hill-custody-row-spurs-central-gandhi-smarak-nidhis-intervention/article30729242.ece
89,2020/02/03,CPI(M) alleges irregularities inLand Pooling Scheme in Vizag,"CPI(M) district committee secretary K. Lokanadham has alleged that attempts are being made to acquire land belonging to the poor by forging their signatures, at Anantavaram village in Padmanabham mandal.

Grama sabha

A grama sabha was held with regard to acquisition of land in the Survey numbers 214, 215, 216, 263 and 255 in the village under Land Pooling Scheme (LPS), on Monday. CPI(M) leaders Mr. Lokanadham, R.S.N. Murthy and Ravva Narasinga Rao raised several issues pertaining to the land acquisition before Special Officer Suryakala.

Mr. Lokanadham said that there were 105 Dalit and 120 BC beneficiaries. “All the Dalits have D Form pattas and some even have passbooks. The beneficiaries are cultivating cashew and fruits on the land. They have obtained loans from the SC Corporation in 2006-07 financial year and developed irrigation facilities,” he said.

There are 124 beneficiaries of other BC communities such as Rajakas, Padmashalis and toddy tappers who do not have pattas.

The Visakhapatnam Metropolitan Region Development Authority (VMRDA) and revenue officials conducted a survey on their lands for the Land Pooling Scheme.

Mr. Lokanadham alleged that the beneficiaries declined to part with their lands, but the authorities allegedly threatened them. “The signatures of beneficiaries were forged in the Form-3 to make it appear that they were willing to part with their land. The beneficiaries snatched the forged letters from the officials and staged a protest,” he claimed.

‘Names missing’

The CPI(M) leaders alleged that the name of the land owners were not written on the Form 3, but their thumb impressions were taken. “As per the provision, the beneficiaries should be given the Form-2 and Form 3 and they have to fill the details. But, here the signatures were forged. The LPS is being done in violation of the G.O. 94,” said Mr. Lokanadham and wondered as to how the people could expect justice when the government violates the rules.

He said the CPI(M) has demanded a probe into the issue by Collector V. Vinay Chand.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/cpim-alleges-irregularities-inland-pooling-scheme-in-vizag/article30729009.ece
90,2020/02/03,YSRCP MP urges Centre to lend a helping hand to State,"YSR Congress (YSRC) MP P.V. Midhun Reddy requested the Central government to fulfil the promises made to Andhra Pradesh (A.P.) under A.P. Reorganisation Act, 2014.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha on Monday, Mr. Midhun Reddy said the State was in deep financial crisis.

Therefore, A.P. required the support of the Central government for completing the Polavaram project, the establishment of the integrated steel plant in Kadapa district and Ramayapatnam port and other development works. He alleged that the TDP government had ruined the economy and wasted public money.

The YSRCP government went for reverse tendering in a few projects and saved public money and Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy has set up a judicial commission for reviewing the projects.

Mr. Midhun Reddy alleged that Amaravati was a scam in which TDP leaders and persons close to them purchased over 4,000 acres. The buyers included 780 persons who were below the poverty line, the MP pointed out.

GST dues

Kakinada MP Vanga Geetha said in the Lok Sabha that the Centre was due to compensate to A.P. a shortfall in GST amounting to ₹682 crore for October-November 2019 but the Central government was citing financial constraints for not doing so in the stipulated time frame.

She also asked what steps were being taken for resolving the issues in the GST Network (GSTN) and whether there was any proposal to withdraw the GST being collected from the LIC policy-holders.

Answering her questions, Union Minister of State for Finance and Corporate Affairs Anurag Thakur said Union Minister of Finance Nirmala Sitharaman has clearly stated in her Budget speech that the dues to States would be cleared in two instalments.

The GSTN issues were being looked and as far as the imposition of GST on LIC policies were concerned, the GST Council was competent to take decisions.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/npj0gn/article30728993.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04ONGMITHUN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/ysrcp-mp-urges-centre-to-lend-a-helping-hand-to-state/article30728995.ece
91,2020/02/03,Anantapur cricket coach scales Mt. Kilimanjaro to thank his mentors,"A cricket player and coach at Rural Development Trust stadium in Anantapur, Veerapala Sankar thanked the organisation in a unique way by scaling Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa, on January 24 for taking care of his entire education and honing his skills to become a cricket player.

Hailing from M. Agraharam village in Tadimarri mandal of the district, Mr. Sankar held aloft a photograph of Vincent Ferrer, the founder of the Rural Development Trust on top of Kilimanjaro at 5,895 metres, marching through most inhospitable terrain for eight days, to pay his respect to the organisation that took care of his studies and brought out the latent talent in him.

Not a piece of cake

As part of a 13-member team from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, he took up the expedition without any financial support from the organisation from January 18 to 26. Preparation was no easy task as he had to take a short-duration training at the Bhuvanagiri Rock Climbing Academy in Hyderabad and the 10-day rock climbing course at Sundarnagar in Himachal Pradesh. Only three from their team could make it to the Uhuru point (5,895 metres.), the highest peak on Kilimanjaro, while a girl from Telangana Social Welfare School made it up to the Stella point (5,756 metres.), the rest came up to Gilman Point (5,685 metres.).

A fan of Jagan

A fan of Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy, he carried a flex banner containing the CM’s photo and got himself photographed with it.

An NIS-certified Cricket coach at the RDT Stadium here, he was a Corporate Cricket League player till last March for three years in Bengaluru. Son of farm hands V. Narsimhulu and Narasamma, he is a science graduate and completed Bachelor of Physical Education before getting trained as coach from the National Institute of Sports.

“I cannot forget what the organisation has done for me,” Mr. Sankar told The Hindu on Wednesday. He hopes the entire world comes to know about the work being done by the RDT in Anantapur and Kurnool districts and supplements their efforts.

The continued absence of the erstwhile Governor E.S.L.

Miffed over some student union leaders raising slogans against him, he vowed not to participate in a convocation in Tirupati again and stuck to his stand till last year. He, however, had to attend SPMVV convocation last year, as Vice-President M. Venkaiah Naidu was the chief guest.

94,2020/02/03,"Now, good work will earn you an award","Government employees getting flak for mistakes or suspension for flouting norms or going against rules is commonplace, but Anantapur district administration will now recognise inspiring or exemplary work by government employees or general public by giving them ‘Spoorthi’ award every week.

Announcing the decision, District Collector Gandham Chandrudu on Monday told district officers during the Spandana programme at the Collectorate that any official from the lowest cadre to the department head in the district will be considered for this recognition.

“This is only to motivate the general public and officials to do their best in whatever they are assigned and go beyond their call of duty to reach out to the needy to make society a better place to live in,” the Collector said.

Setting the example

Last week, Penukonda Sub-Collector T. Nishanthi designed and initiated a new programme ‘Pillalu-Navvulu’ for the government school students in the Revenue Division for holistic personality development.

She roped in dentists to check the dental heath of students of the Turkapatnam ZP High School in Roddam Mandal. Her effort was recognised through the award and she received a special greeting card and a sapling through a special messenger.

She also identified some government schools in the Penukonda division for special coaching classes in Music, Dance, Karate, sporting and other such extra-curricular activities so that children find going to school an interesting affair.

A retired government employee Bala Prasad, who donated amount from his pension money to ‘Sundara Anantha’ initiative to make city cleaner and greener with people’s participation, was the second person to be recognised with ‘Spoorthi’ award.

Four Mandal Parishad Development Officers (MPDOs) S. Vishnu Prasad of Talupula Mandal, B. Nirmala Kumari of Putluru, V. Ramesh Babu of Kadiri and B. Shakuntala of Nallacheruvu, who achieved 95% of pensions disbursement on a single day on Saturday, were also appreciated and handed over saplings and Spoorthi Greeting Card signed by the District Collector as recognition of their efforts.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kg8jmz/article30728819.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGESPOORTHI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/now-good-work-will-earn-you-an-award/article30728820.ece
95,2020/02/03,Blowout: two fall sick due to suffocation,"Two persons fell sick at the gas well blowout site due to suffocation at Uppudi village in Katrenikona mandal of the district. They were rushed to a hospital.

According to sources, the victims were suspected to be employees of PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited. The blast occurred on Sunday when the two from the technical team of the agency were checking the gas leakage point. As they opened the valve of the closed well, gas gushed out with heavy pressure and led to the blast, they said.

However, officials said the details of the two were not yet known.

The AP State Disaster Response and Fire Services department, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC)’s crisis management team and experts from other agencies were trying to plug the leak when reports last came in.

RDO allays fears

Meanwhile, Amalapuram Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) B.H. Bhavani Shankar, who is monitoring the situation, said officials have taken all measures to prevent fire at the site and in Uppadi village.

Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi said the CISF and other wings were deployed in Katrenikona as a precautionary measure.

Minister blames firm

Social Welfare Minister Pinipe Viswaroop said the gas leak was caused due to the negligence of the PFH personnel, who were maintaining the well.

The Minister, who visited the site, said: “The PFH personnel unplugged the pipeline of the closed well without studying the condition of the abandoned well and have not taken any safety precautions while taking up the operation.”

Expressing anger over frequent gas and oil leakages in the region, he said the companies which were focussing on exploration of natural resources and expansion of their business, were not concentrating on safety aspects.

Not enough reserves

ONGC Area Manager B. Prasada Rao said following a survey the ONGC had closed the Uppudi well in 2007, as the reserves were very less and it had been abandoned since then.

The Kolkata-based PFH had taken the well on lease a year ago from the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) and the employees of the company had uncapped the pipeline which caused the blowout, said Mr. Rao, who is also the ONGC General Manager (Production).

According to ONGC officials, the depth of the well from the leakage point was about 2.2 km, and gas was gushing out from a six-inch diameter valve. However, there was no need for panic as only natural gas was coming out, they added.

The PFH company personnel were not available for comment.

Meanwhile, villagers blamed the government for giving the closed well on lease to a private company.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/blowout-two-fall-sick-due-to-suffocation/article30728079.ece

Addressing a press meet at Nagari, Deputy SP (Puttur) D. Muralidhar and Circle-Inspector (Nagari) Maddaiahchari said that acting on a tip-off, a special party was dispatched to the Tadukupeta checkpost. An SUV, carrying five smuggling operatives along with logs and sickles, was coming from Seshachalam Hills. On seeing the police party, the vehicle driver tried to give them a slip by overspeeding. But the police could overtake the SUV and intercepted it. Michael Raj from Chennai was leading the four other operatives who hailed from Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu. The seized logs were estimated to be worth at ₹8 lakh. The accused were produced before the local court and were remanded.

98,2020/02/03,High drama at Hathiramji Mutt during takeover by endowments officials,"The headquarters of ancient Hathiramji Mutt on the busy Gandhi Road witnessed high drama on Monday when the officials of the Endowments Department took over its reins by breaking open the locked rooms in the presence of revenue officials. The incident happened even as the BJP leaders were staging a dharna outside demanding a CBI probe into the alleged irregularities in the Mutt.

A brief lull followed the suspension of Arjun Das, the ‘Mahant’ of the Mutt, by the State government on charges of financial irregularities and nepotism last week, in whose place the Dharmika Parishat’s Commissioner appointed Srikahalasti temple Executive Officer C. Chandrasekhar Reddy as its in-charge. The team swung into action on Monday by breaking open the locked rooms and seizing important documents, purportedly pertaining to the Mutt’s invaluable properties. “We broke open the locked rooms in the presence of Tahsildar and revenue inspector and would inform the Dharmika Parishat Commissioner about the documents we have seized,” Mr. Chandrasekhar Reddy told the media.

BJP functionaries led by State spokesperson G. Bhanuprakash Reddy and secretary Samanchi Srinivas demanded that the government hand over the control of the Mutt to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD). It was the Mutt that controlled the Tirumala temple ahead of the TTD’s formation and it is only logical for the government to hand over its reins to the TTD, instead of the State directly meddling into its affairs, Mr. Srinivas said.

The Mutt has landholdings across the country, mostly in Mumbai city and Tirupati, most of which were encroached. “The huge properties received by the Mutt was only during its 90 years of golden era in maintaining Sri Venkateswara temple, which means the lands were donated only out of reverence to Lord Venkateswara. It is only logical that they belong to the TTD,” the BJP leaders reasoned.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/klgz09/article30727613.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGE5MUTT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/high-drama-at-hathiramji-mutt-during-takeover-by-endowments-officials/article30727614.ece
99,2020/02/03,Illegal procurement of sand continues unabated in Chittoor,"In spite of the new sand policy of the government in force, the illegal procurement of sand and its transport is going on unabated in V.Kota mandal of Palamaner Assembly constituency.

Farmers of a dozen of villages abutting rivulets and streams expressed their concern that indiscriminate lifting of sand to the tune of hundreds of tonnes every day and leaving huge pits in the rivulet beds would endanger the groundwater table.

As per reports, the illegal sand transport operators are said to be active at the areas of Pamuganipalle, Peddavanka, Gangamma Yeru, Enumula Cheruvu, Gonumakula Palle, Jetivanka, and rivulets connected to Palar river, apart from small rivulet and stream beds. Poor surveillance at the rural areas has enabled them to deploy tippers and private workers at their convenience to lift sand round the clock.

A rain-deficient mandal

Farmers at Pamuganipalle observed that almost all the villages in V.Kota mandal are facing the problem of depletion of groundwater. While most of the district saw good rainfall during the north-east monsoon, it was either nil or deficient in V. Kota and surrounding mandals, up to Kuppam. Several farmers and household members dug borewells till more than one thousand feet to fetch water, but in vain.

Balaji, a farmer at Gonumakula Palle said that lifting of sand in the rivulets beyond permissible levels was leading to depletion of groundwater levels in the nearby areas, affecting the fields. The grass growing along the river beds was also vanishing, affecting the livestock.

The sand material from V.Kota mandal is finding its way through the markets in Karnataka, where there is a huge demand, the farmers alleged. Though some of them had brought it to the notice of the mines and geology department officials and the local police, no tangible steps were to be seen, they complained.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/laslod/article30727417.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04VJPAGESANDMINING,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/illegal-procurement-of-sand-continues-unabated-in-chittoor/article30727418.ece

The students -- Assevadam, Naveen, Raja, and Edukondalu from Department of Journalism and English -- were suspended on February 1 on the charges of taking part in a demonstration opposing the relocation of capital from Amaravati.

The Vice-Chancellor on Saturday said the four students gave individual letters to the disciplinary committee promising that they would not take part in any demonstration on the campus thereby disturbing the peaceful atmosphere.

Later in the day, chief warden D. Ramachandran issued a notice to suspend the students. Condemning the action, leaders of the students joint action committee staged protests at the campus gate. JAC convener Ravipati Saikrishna termed the decision undemocratic.

Jagan Mohan Reddy was personally monitoring its progress to meet the deadline. Addressing the media at the project site in West Godavari on Sunday, Mr. Anil Kumar said work was going on at a brisk pace and strict guidelines were issued to the officials to follow the time line.

He observed that the previous government had failed to implement the R&R package and it had since been decided to construct around 18,000 houses for the people who faced displacement. A Central team had visited the project and issued a positive report, he said. The Minister said a sum of ₹5,000 crore was to be given by the Centre through NABARD for the project but only ₹1,800 crore had been released till date. Mr. Anil Kumar said the TDP government had completed only spillway works. Of the total estimated cost of ₹55,000 crore, the TDP government had spent ₹17,000 crore, but claimed to have completed 75% of the works.

105,2020/02/03,Villagers in grip of fear as gas leaks from pipeline at Uppudi,"Tension prevailed at Uppudi village of Katrenikona mandal in East Godavari district on Sunday as gas leaked from the pipeline being maintained by the PFH Oil and Gas Private Limited, a private agency.

The sound with which the gas leaked created panic in the village.

When The Hindu tried to contact the PFH officials, they were not available for comment.

Sources said the pipeline connected to the Katrenikona well passed through a few villages, including Uppudi.

Word of caution

“As the gas is inflammable, officials have stopped power supply to the villages and asked the residents not to light stoves, or firewood, or use any item that may ignite fire,” said a villager.

The gas smelt like petrol and spread to the nearby villages, said Satyavathi, another villager.

On receiving information, firemen and a technical team of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Rajamahendravaram, rushed to the spot to help the PFH personnel plug the leakage.

“We have asked the residents to be cautious. A few houses in the vicinity have been vacated as a precautionary measure,” said an officer monitoring the operation.

The leakage was not plugged till reports last came in.

This was the second such incident. A pipeline of the ONGC leaked at Antarvedi on January 31.

Plea to Ministry

P. Satyanarayana, a villager, blamed the PFH and ONGC managements for such frequent incidents in the region.

He appealed to the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and officials of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) to inspect the KG Basin, monitor the oil and gas exploration operations, and check the maintenance of wells and pipelines.

“Gas leaked during day at Uppudi. Had it leaked at night, there would have been a major tragedy. We request the government to take steps for the safety of the villagers,” said a farmer, G. Chinna Babu.

Collector D. Muralidhar Reddy rushed to the village to take stock of the situation.

The ONGC pressed its crisis management team from Rajamahendravaram into service, and was planning to deploy another team from Narsapur.

Police picket

Superintendent of Police Adnan Nayeem Asmi said people in a radius of 2- km had been evacuated. The police and revenue personnel were camping at the village and monitoring the situation, the SP said.

“Police pickets have been arranged at Katrenikona, Uppudi and other villages to prevent any untoward incident. Police personnel from Amalapuram, Razole and other places have been deployed at the spot,” the SP added.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/c4gegl/article30722100.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VJCITYPAGE5LEAK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/villagers-in-grip-of-fear-as-gas-leaks-from-pipeline-at-uppudi/article30722101.ece

On January 31, armed intruders barged into the house of 52-year-old Yedupati Padmavathi in Vijayawada and slit her throat. They then ransacked the house, and fled with jewellery, valuables and ₹6 lakh in cash from the house.

Police suspect the role of a gang from Uttar Pradesh in the daylight murder which has rocked the city. Police officials investigating the case said that the attackers might have conducted a recce of the house before deciding on an opportune time to break into the house. The ghastly murder occurred when Padmavathi’s husband Venkateswarlu was away.

“This is the handiwork of professional killers. The miscreants sprinkled chilli powder at the scene of crime to throw sniffer dogs off their scent. However, we have obtained a few leads and we are hopeful of cracking the case soon,” said Vijayawada Police Commissioner Ch. Dwaraka Tirumala Rao.

Students turn criminals

109,2020/02/03,"Gudisa children love their hamlet, above all","A 15-year-old Sadala Raja Reddi is pursuing education with a desire to become a teacher. But, he has made up his mind not to leave his hamlet. Similarly, a 39-year-old Kondala Somi Reddi, who went to Rajamahendravaram for training, returned to his tiny village within three days.

They are determined not to leave their native place of Gudisa in Rampa Agency in East Godavari district despite several attempts by officials to rehabilitate them from the forest for better education and job opportunities.

Mr. Somi Reddi has told The Hindu: “A few years ago, the ITDA officials offered me training in auto-rickshaw driving in Rajamahendravaram. However, I left the place within three days as I could not stay away from the forest which has been the home for our family for generations.” He was one among the three youths who quit the training to return to their hamlet.

According to Mr. Somi Reddi, in 2008, all the families (nearly 20) held a gram sabha and decided not to leave their hamlet whatever offer comes from the government under the proposed rehabilitation plan.

When this correspondent visited Gudisa, which is nearly 65 km away from ITDA-Rampachodavaram headquarters, many village elders shared a common view -- “We have everything -- forest, streams, land, and above all memories of our ancestors -- to live in our hamlet and believe that we have to leave all these if we are rehabilitated.” The 2011 Census shows that the hamlet’s population was 92.

Joint family system

A village elder, Sikkodu Pandu Reddi, says: “We follow the joint family system. In each of the 15 houses, at least two families are living together.” Sadala Suggi Reddi and his wife Chandrakala opine: “We never had the thought of leaving this forest for any better fortune in future.”

In recent years, the ITDA laid 14-km pukka road connecting Gudisa with Vollangi village, indicating that the government would no longer wish to proceed with the idea of rehabilitating the families from Gudisa. Presently, the nearest upper primary school and primary health centre are nearly 14 km from Gudisa.

ITDA Project Officer Nishant Kumar says: “Now, there is no proposal for the rehabilitation of the hamlet. We are offering every service which they needed.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/q7kk8s/article30722037.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30ONGGUDISA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/they-love-their-hamlet-above-all/article30722038.ece
110,2020/02/03,Three members of rice-pulling gang arrested in Kuppam,"High drama prevailed at Gudupalle mandal in Kuppam on Sunday following the arrest of three members of a rice-pulling gang, operating along villages bordering with Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.

According to the Deputy SP (Palamaner), based on a complainant, Naveen from Tirupattur of Tamil Nadu that he was cheated by a rice-puller gang in Kuppam, the police swung into action and took three men, all from Karnataka, into custody. “We received the complaint several days ago from Naveen. Acting on a tip-off, we took three members of the inter-State rice pulling gang into custody,” the Deputy SP said. The modus operandi of the gang was to lure villagers at the tri-State junction with rice-puller objects, collecting huge amounts.

In this process, the gang was carrying a vessel (rice-puller) to be handed over to a client, but was reportedly attacked by a rival gang and the object was taken away. “At present, we do not have any information about the nature of the vessel and the alleged attack. It is all confusing now. We have launched a full-fledged inquiry into the episode,” the official said.

Meanwhile, responding to the allegations against the sub-inspector (Gudupalle) that he had connived with the gang over deals running into ₹2 crores, the Deputy SP said: “The sub-inspector neither attended the duty nor applied for leave today. His phone is switched off. We are inquiring into the allegations.”",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/three-members-of-rice-pulling-gang-arrested-in-kuppam/article30722029.ece

112,2020/02/03,Shastric knowledge rudimentary for conduct of business: P.S. Narasimha,"Supreme Court senior advocate P.S. Narasimha has emphasised the need for court arguments, parliamentary debates, planning by bureaucrats, rational thinking in science, technology and archaeology and ethical conduct of business to be based on sound Shastric knowledge.

Speaking on ‘Importance of Sanskrit for the future of law and governance’ at the 23rd Convocation of Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha (RSVP) here on Sunday, he urged Sanskrit students to reach out to policymakers. “We have great Sanskrit scholars on one side and great professionals like doctors, engineers, lawyers and bureaucrats on the other. Both sections are wide apart and this ‘disconnect’ has made us suffer for seventy years,” he lamented, indicating the need for Sanskrit scholars to disseminate the essence of ancient Indian practices to present day politicians, bureaucrats and professionals.

Elaborating, he explained how the knowledge of ‘Vaiseshika Shastra’ could help one argue trade mark, patent, goods and services related cases. While logic-based debates had been going on from the days of Adi Shankaracharya, Mr. Narasimha regretted the manner thousands of cases were being argued sans logic due to the lack of ‘Shastric base’.

Referring to the enrolment of 25 RSVP students for civil services, Chancellor N.Gopalaswami expressed contentment that his suggestion made in the past had been considered. He wanted to see Sanskrit students at the decision-making levels in the State and Central governments. He also commended the university for coming out with fifteen publications under the union government’s Sri Bhagavat Ramanuja 1000 years’ celebrations scheme by publishing, editing and digitising rare manuscripts.

113,2020/02/03,Velampalli refutes allegations on Endowments lands,"Endowments Minister Velampalli Srinivas refuted media reports that the State government gave away lands of the Endowments Department without following norms.

Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Mr. Srinivas said that the State government was committed to the protection of the Endowments lands, and added that it considered the lands owned by temples as ‘holy lands’.

“Not even one square yard of Endowments land can be sold without the permission of the High Court. TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu and his team have lost sight of this simple fact and are levelling baseless allegations,” Mr. Srinivas said “False reports were carried in a section of media on Bhimili lands,” he added.

“The previous State government gave away the ‘mutt’ lands on lease at its whims and fancies. The temple lands are not being gifted away unlike in the previous government. Stringent action would be taken against those who are involved in the misuse of Hathiramji Mutt properties,” he said.

Andhra Pradesh State Brahmin Corporation chairman Malladi Vishnu alleged that a section of the media was resorting to false propaganda on Archaka Welfare Fund. Former chairman of the corporation Vemuri Anand Surya levelled baseless allegations that ₹234 crore of the Archaka Welfare Fund was diverted. There is no truth in the allegations, Mr. Vishnu said.

“The Archaka Welfare Fund was created as per the directions of the Supreme Court. As much as ₹171 crore was in the form of fixed deposits, which would be utilised as per guidelines. Nobody has the power to withdraw the deposits. It would amount to a violation of Supreme Court orders,” he said.

“The Archaka Welfare Board extends financial help to the archakas, who perform thread ceremony and marriages of their children; for education purposes and health expenses. During 2019-20, the Board spent about ₹10 crore on thread ceremonies, marriages, education, retirement and other benefits.

The unit is likely to commence its production and exports by the middle of March this year.

Later, Mr. Reddy also visited W.S. Industries, which was closed after Cyclone Hudhud struck Visakhapatnam, and had remained shut for the past five years. He discussed the possibility of its revival with a fresh investment of ₹100 crore by a new company named Win Win Specialty Insulators Limited. The change of ownership has been approved by the unit approval committee of APSEZ.

The unit has also been given extension of approval for five years with the provision to review their performance on a yearly basis by the Board of Approval, the country’s highest body for SEZs. The company wants to introduce state-of-the-art technology, which not only saves three lakh units of power per annum but would be able to produce world-class ceramic insulators for the power projects across the globe achieving lot of earnings in respect of foreign exchange, Mr. Reddy said.

Out of the 18 licenses issued to the units at APSEZ spread over 1,900 acres, four units are inoperative at present, and two are likely to commence production before the end of the current financial year while two more units are under revival. “We are trying to revive all the sick units in APSEZ and have advised the Zonal Manager, APIIC, who is also the developer, to improve the ambience and facilities inside the zone to attract investments,” he said.",andhra pradesh,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/pa06hi/article30724194.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03-VZ-APSPECIALECONOMICZONE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/apsez-poised-to-achieve-turnover-of-4500-crore/article30721827.ece

Hiremath has called upon the people to transform the agitation into a second freedom struggle.

He was speaking at a district-level convention organised on CAA, NRC, and NPR by the Anti-CAA Progressive Organisations’ Forum on Monday.

Describing CAA as an Act formulated to divide the nation on religious lines, he said that even the British did the same to rule over India during the invasion.

“Today, we have to fight similar ideologies that is conspiring to divide the nation. We must all come together and show the world how a second freedom struggle looks like,” he said.

Criticising Union Minister Anurag Thakur for raising a slogan that called for shooting people who are against CAA, Mr. Hiremath said: “It is utterly disgraceful and shameful of a Union Minister to stoop this low,” he said.

Praising the women of Shaheen Bagh in Delhi, who are sitting on a dharna for nearly two months, Mr. Hiremath said they are an example of how to protect the Constitution.

In his address, activist and progressive thinker Shivasundar asserted that while Dr. B.R. Ambedkar wanted equality for all, V.D. Savarkar wanted Minorities and Dalits to be second class citizens of India.

“Today, it is a fight between the ideology of Ambedkar and Savarkar. The BJP wants to implement the ideology of Savarkar with the help of CAA, NRC and NPR, and we must fight against all fascist forces to save the Constitution of Ambedkar,” he said.

Accusing the BJP of trying to convert India into a ‘Hindu Rashtra’, Mr. Shivasundar urged the people to spoil every such attempt of the BJP.

Stating that the BJP was spreading canards that only Muslims were opposing CAA, he said that every Indian who believes in the Constitution irrespective of their religious belief is protesting against CAA.

He asserted that their agitation against CAA will continue till the government withdraws the Act.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/ie56l4/article30728501.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGHIREMATH,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/transform-stir-against-caa-nrc-and-npr-into-second-freedom-struggle/article30728502.ece

122,2020/02/03,Coronavirus: Border districts on high alert,"Following the detection of three confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV) in Kerala, the border districts of Mangaluru, Kodagu, Chamarajanagar, and Mysuru have been put on high alert.

The State Health and Family Welfare Department has stepped up surveillance in the districts and has advised people to immediately report to the State Surveillance Unit if they develop any symptoms of the virus.

B.G. Prakash, State Joint Director (Communicable Diseases), told The Hindu on Monday that the State had geared up to tackle the virus. Of the 44 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, 29 had tested negative and the results of 15 are awaited.

Asserting that the State has strengthened surveillance and control measures, Dr Prakash said: “Till date, 51 travellers from coronavirus-affected countries had been identified and 46 were under home isolation, four had left the country, and one had been admitted in the isolation ward at Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS) in Hubbali.

Meanwhile, the number of people visiting the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD) out of panic is increasing. “While we have been getting many inquiries, we collected only three samples on Monday. All those whose samples have been collected have been advised home isolation for 28 days,” said RGICD director C. Nagaraja.

People can call 104 Arogya Sahayavani (call centre), where two seats have been reserved for receiving calls and guiding people. Till Monday, 312 calls had been handled, Dr. Prakash said.

Advising precautions, the doctor said people should follow cough etiquette by covering the nose and mouth using handkerchief/towel while sneezing/coughing, apart from frequently washing hands with soap and water.

123,2020/02/03,Sedition case: Police interrogate Bidar school students for fourth time,"Policemen in plain clothes visited Shaheen School in Bidar again on Monday and interrogated the students, for the fourth time, as part of the investigation into the sedition case against the school authorities for staging a play in which some characters allegedly “insulted” Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

According to eyewitnesses, four policemen, along with two female members of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), arrived in the school around 10.30 a.m. and remained in the school’s office questioning the teaching and non-teaching staff. By 12.30 p.m., Deputy Superintendent of Police Basaveshwara Hira joined the team and began grilling seven students. Some of the students, who were interrogated on Monday, were not part of the play. The questioning lasted for two hours.

It is learnt that the investigating officers repeated the same questions asked in the previous interrogations, such as who gave them the script, who taught the specific dialogues, and where the rehearsal was done.

“I cannot understand why the police are repeatedly subjecting the children of 9 to 12 age group to mental torture. The harassment will affect them in the long run. The police don’t understand if we tell them,” Tauseef Madikeri, CEO of Shaheen Group of Institutions, said.

Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Hira said claimed that it was not interrogation, but examination of witnesses. “Interrogation is done for accused. The investigation is in progress and I cannot comment any further,” he said.

The interrogation of the children by police in uniform on January 28 had drew widespread criticisms after a photograph of the interrogation went viral. The police then visited the school in plain clothes on January 31 and interrogated the students. They returned on February 1 and interrogated around 60 students.

The children had staged the play during the annual day celebrations on January 21 on the theme of Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. A character said she would beat anyone asking for documents during NRC with footwear. Other kids were heard asserting that they would not show the documents to prove citizenship. Following a complaint by Neelesh Rakshyala, an activist, who alleged that some of the dialogues amounted to “insulting” Mr. Modi , the police filed an FIR.

On January 30, the police arrested Nazbunnisa, mother of the child who delivered the dialogues, and Fareeda Begum, the teacher who supervised the play, based on the child’s confessions.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xmd3z6/article30728022.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBIDARSCHOOL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/sedition-case-police-interrogate-bidar-school-students-for-fourth-time/article30728023.ece
124,2020/02/03,Mysuru taluks bordering Kerala on high alert,"The areas bordering Kerala in Mysuru have been put on high alert in the wake of the third case of coronavirus infection being confirmed in Kerala on Monday.

The Health Department has begun carrying out an awareness programme in the taluks of H.D. Kote and Nanjangud in the district to ensure that persons showing symptoms of coronavirus infection after visiting China or coming in contact with people visiting China approach the health authorities immediately.

Apart from distribution of handbills, pamphlets and other publicity material, appeals have been made by the authorities through radio. Distribution of handbills is underway at bus stands, railway stations and places of tourist interest including Mysuru palace and zoo. Screening of passengers has also been taken up at the Mysuru airport, said District Health Officer Venkatesh.

In case the health officials come across any suspects, they will be brought to K.R. Hospital in Mysuru, where facilities for their isolation and treatment are in place.

The district health officials have also identified two persons, who had returned to Mysuru after a visit to China last month. “But, they are showing no symptoms of the virus. But, we will continue to keep a watch on them”, said Dr. Venkatesh.

Mysuru District Vector-borne Diseases control officer S. Chidambara, however, sought to clarify that the authorities are focusing only on persons showing the symptoms and had returned from Wuhan in China, where the infection is believed to have originated. “Only persons who visited China during December 2019 and January 2020 and showing symptoms will be isolated. For, there are other respiratory viruses”, he said.

Contending that there was no need for panic over the confirmation of positive cases of coronavirus in Kerala, Dr. Chidambara said the health officials in the neighbouring State had quarantined an estimated 1,000 people, who had returned from China during the last two months.

“As per the standard protocol, they will be allowed to go out only after spending the mandatory 28 days in isolation without showing any symptoms”, he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/mysuru-taluks-bordering-kerala-on-high-alert/article30727282.ece
125,2020/02/03,Coronavirus scare: Kodagu DHO tells planters not to send their workers to Kerala,"With Kerala reporting three confirmed cases of Coronavirus, the health authorities in Kodagu have stepped up surveillance and asked the coffee planters not to send their workers to Kerala or bring new workers to their plantations from the neighbouring State until February 15 as a precautionary measure.

Kodagu shares its border with Kerala and workers are often brought for work in the estates during the coffee harvesting season.

Kodagu District Health Officer K. Mohan, however, clarified that there is no need to panic as the district administration and the Department of Health and Family Welfare had taken adequate precautionary measures following the virus scare. So far, there have been no suspected cases in the district.

He said extreme caution was necessary since the virus spreads from the infected person to a healthy person and therefore the public needs to be watchful against those suffering from excessive cold, cough, fever, breathing difficulties, dysentery as they were the symptoms of the disease.

The health authorities have urged the public to use mask or cloth to cover their nose or mouth while sneezing or coughing in public places. It is better to wash hands with soap for personal hygiene and use triple-layered mask in public places.

If people face difficulty in breathing, they should immediately consult doctors. Importantly, meat should be consumed after thorough cooking. There is no definite treatment for the disease but treatment has to be taken based on the symptoms, they said.

Meanwhile, a Kodagu district-level Task Force on Novel Coronavirus had been constituted and is headed by the District Surveillance Officer. Likewise, in the taluks, the taluk medical officers will head the task forces. They will take steps against the spread of the disease besides putting in place all necessary preventive mechanisms.

The district task force comprises the Surveillance Officer (9449843263), an Entomologist (9480730364), Health Supervisor, Senior Health Assistant, representative from the District IEC Division, and lab technician from Department of Health and Family Welfare.

In complying with the guidelines for the treatment of novel Coronavirus patients, a special ward with five beds had been established at the district hospital in Madikeri for the treatment of patients. In Virajpet and Somwarpet, two beds had been set aside for the patients in the taluk hospitals.

Dr. Mohan appealed to the public not to get perturbed over the forwards in social media and urged them to take necessary precautions as suggested by the department.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/coronavirus-scare-kodagu-dho-tells-planters-not-to-send-their-workers-to-kerala/article30726564.ece

128,2020/02/03,Revanna opposes move to close new engg. college,"The State government has decided to reject the proposal for Visvesvaraya Technological University’s (VTU) affiliation to the new engineering college at Mosale Hosahalli near Hassan, leaving the students worriedM As many as 186 students, of which 100 are girls, are studying in the college started last year.

Former minister and JD(S) leader H.D. Revanna, in a press conference here on Monday, said that the government had decided to close the college just because it was sanctioned by H.D. Kumaraswamy, during his tenure as Chief Minister. Citing a letter signed by Deputy Chief Minister Ashwath Narayan, who also holds the Higher Education portfolio, the JD(S) leader said the party would oppose the move strongly.

The college was approved during the JD(S)-Congress coalition government. At present, it is functioning in a building belonging to the Industrial Training Institute (ITI). The new building for the engineering college is coming up on 15 acres of land at a cost of ₹58 crore.

Then the BJP had opposed setting up of the college at Mosale Hosahalli, about 15 kilometres from Hassan, where already one government engineering college is functioning.

Ashwath Narayan, the DCM, in his letter, stated that engineering seats in government colleges had been remaining vacant. Opening another college at Mosale Hosahalli would not serve any purpose. He also suggested that the building being constructed could be utilised for skill development.

When The Hindu contacted Rangaswamy, principal, he said the college got clearance from AICTE and the VTU also granted affiliation. “Our students have appeared for the first-semester examination. The second-semester classes will start on February 10. In fact, the admissions in our college are very good. A majority of the students are from rural areas of north Karnataka. The construction of the building is going on. It would be handed over to the college in April.”

The college has got 22 teaching faculty. Eight bright students have got a scholarship, offered by a private company, which supports their education for four years, he said.

Protest planned

Mr. Revanna said that the party would stage a protest opposing the government’s move. “Initially, we will stage a protest in Hassan and later stage a dharna in front of the Chief Minister’s residence in Bengaluru.”",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/revanna-opposes-move-to-close-new-engg-college/article30725858.ece
129,2020/02/03,BJP pulls up Hegde for remarks against Gandhiji,"The BJP on Monday issued a show cause notice to its MP Anant Kumar Hegde for his comments against Mahatma Gandhi.

Karnataka State president of the BJP Nalin Kumar Kateel said the party’s central leadership served the notice on Mr. Hegde, taking strong objections to his remarks and sought an explanation from him.

In controversial comments on Saturday, Mr. Hegde had questioned the freedom movement led by Gandhiji and described it as an “adjustment” with the British rulers.

“Freedom fighters who did not sacrifice anything made the country believe that it attained independence through ‘Upavas Satyagrah (hunger strikes)’ — Gandhi’s preferred mode of agitation — and became ‘mahapurush’ (great persons),” the MP from Uttara Kannada said at an event in Bengaluru.

Responding to the remarks, Congress leader Brijesh Kalappa appealed to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to conduct a “medial inquiry into the sanity” of the BJP MP. In a letter to Mr. Birla, Mr. Kalappa said, “as per the Article 102 of the Constitution, an insane member cannot continue as a member of the Lok Sabha”.

“If he (Mr Hegde) is found to be medically fit, impose requisite punishment within the framework of the Constitution for feigning madness, or forthwith refer him for treatment to any qualified psychiatrist, pending which his Karwar seat may be declared vacant warranting election,” Mr. Kalappa urged to the Speaker.

‘PM must clarify stand’

The Congress also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi must clarify his stand in Parliament on Mr. Hegde’s remarks. “They are disparaging the national movement,” Congress leader Anand Sharma said at a press conference.

”If the Prime Minister and the BJP government are sincere about Mahatma Gandhi’s 150th birth anniversary celebrations, we demand that Mr. Modi come to Parliament and clarify his position,” Mr. Sharma said.

“They are desperate for ... elections and only to get some votes, they are inflicting deep wounds on the soul of India,” he said.

The Congress said the time had come for Mr. Modi to clarify whether his loyalty was to the Mahatma or to his assassin Nathuram Godse.

Several Congress leaders took to social media to attack the BJP; some even demanded a sedition case against Mr. Hegde, a former Union Minister. Senior leader Jairam Ramesh tweeted: “Anant Kumar Hegde is perhaps reflecting the views of his masters. If he is not, his comments should invite the strictest possible action from his party.”

130,2020/02/03,‘BJP leaders in power are strengthening caste system’,"“We the people of India are in the worst conditions under anti-Dalit rulers in the Union government,” said artist and activist K.T. Shivaprasad.

Speaking at a seminar organised as part of Hassan district Kannada Sahitya Sammelan here on Sunday, Mr. Shivaprasad said people were losing their fundamental rights. “B.R. Amebdkar gave us the Constitution. If those in power now were in power when India got Independence, Ambedkar would have not got a chance to draft the Constitution,” he said.

For years many organisations fought against the caste system, but the BJP leaders in power had only been strengthening the caste system. They would in all probability ensure the system remained for a long time, he said.

Recalling his days as an activist of Dalit Sangharsh Samiti in the 1980s, Mr. Shivaprasad said he and other leaders of organisations fought against atrocities committed on the Dalits of Ballupete in Sakleshpur taluk. “We fought for the rights of Dalits in the village. But, the disappointing fact is that even years after the struggle, the status of Dalits has not changed. This shows how organisations which took birth to fight for the rights of Dalits dismantled over the years,” he said.

H.D. Umashankar, assistant professor of Kannada, said samiti had split into many factions, weakening the struggle for Dalit rights. “It may be impossible to expect all the factions to come together. At least they should extend issue-based support for the cause,” he said. He further said that Kannada Sahitya Parishat should open its door to downtrodden sections of society. “The organisation should not become a coterie of only a few sections,” he said.

131,2020/02/03,‘Fight against CAA should be a mass movement’,"Legal experts highlighted the ‘lack of legal and constitutional backing’ for the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on the grounds that it was discriminatory and hence ought to be rejected by the people of the country.

At a seminar on the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC), former Supreme Court Judge V. Gopala Gowda said on Sunday that the opposition to it should be a mass movement in what he described as the second freedom struggle.

Mr. Gowda said sovereignty rests with the people and not the government and its days will be numbered in case it fails to realise this. “You can constitute a government on winning a majority but cannot enact a law that goes against the basic doctrine of the Constitution,” he said.

He said the Act was discriminatory on many counts as it left out not only the Muslims but also people seeking refuge from other neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka and Myanmar and exclusion was antithetical to the constitutional norms.

Expressing concern over the draconian powers that will be vested with lower rung officials to determine on who is a citizen or not, Mr. Gowda said people without proper documents would be dubbed as doubtful citizens and this is dangerous as it can be used to suppress political opponents and dissent. Such people will be sent to detention centres while their cases will get dragged on in courts for decades, he added. Questioning the need for such an Act and an exercise in the first place, Mr. Gowda said State after State was rejecting the NPR and NRC exercise and the fight against it was intensifying.

Former Advocate-General Ravivarma Kumar said there was no mention of NPR in the Constitution or the Citizenship Act of 1955 and hence it lacked a parental law. It was only introduced in 2003 but was never implemented. He said the exercise will affect not just the Muslims but other people also including women as it was an RSS agenda. “It is the RSS – with its headquarters at Nagpur - that is ruling the country and not the BJP, otherwise Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa need not have to seek permission from others for Cabinet expansion,” he said.

This issue did not pertain to Muslims alone but concerned all citizens of India, said Mr. Kumar, and added that there were protests against the law from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and the government should listen to the people of the country.

“The then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh heard out Anna Hazare who was leading an anti-corruption rally in Delhi. But this government is trying to throttle any opposition and displaying the mindset of a thug out to suppress dissent,” remarked Mr. Kumar, expressing concern that all democratic and constitutional bodies were being compromised.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/q62qkk/article30721939.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/02BGMYSURUSIDJUDGE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fight-against-caa-should-be-a-mass-movement/article30721940.ece

“I appeal to people, particularly the residents of Kalaburagi, to actively participate in the sammelan. I appeal to them to extend a warm welcome to the delegates, guests and artistes who are coming from different parts of the State and beyond by cleaning the premises of their houses and shops, decorating their buildings, and drawing rangolis in front of their houses,” he said.

He, along with Police Commissioner M.N. Nagaraj, was addressing a press meet at the main venue of the literary event on the Gulbarga University campus on Sunday.

Briefing about the preparations made for the literary fest, Mr. Sharat said all the 15 committees had almost completed the preparations entrusted to them. “We have identified 113 places for providing accommodations for guests, delegates and artistes. This includes 10 hotels, 17 schools, 10 wedding halls, 15 hostels, nine guest houses, and five government quarters. We have also made arrangements to transport the guests, delegates and artistes. We have asked the North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation to increase the frequency of city buses for the three days, and also are trying to convince the authorities to operate the buses for free,” he said.

To a question, the Deputy Commissioner said that the colourful procession, in which sammelana president H.S. Venkatesh Murthy will be brought to the venue, would begin from S.M. Pundit Rangamandir. “Hundreds of cultural troupes showcasing different cultural forms and representing different parts of the State will take part in the procession. Artistes will also perform at all the venues every evening. There will be one star performer every evening,” Mr. Sharat said.

On the security arrangements in place, Mr. Nagaraj said that around 4,000 police personnel, including 500 women personnel and 700 traffic policemen, would be deployed in vital locations. “Four Superintendents of Police, 15 Assistant Commissioners of Police, 25 circle inspectors, 200 PSIs, four platoons of Karnataka State Reserve Police, and 500 home guards will be deployed. We have already installed 700 additional CCTV cameras across the city, including around 100 at the venue,” he said.

133,2020/02/03,Bidar sedition case: Congress leaders come out in support of school,"Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee working president Eshwar Khandre and MLA for Basavakalyan B. Narayana Rao condemned the Bidar police for slapping sedition charges against the Shaheen School. They termed it an attempt by the government to suppress the voice of the people.

In two separate, but similar, statements released on Sunday, the Congress leaders defended the schoolchildren who staged a play on the theme of Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) during the annual day celebrations at the school.

“More than 70% of the people in the country are opposing CAA, NRC and NPR (National Population Register), which pose a threat to democracy and people’s interests... In a democracy, everybody has the right to oppose measures that are against the interests of the country. People are protesting and organising big rallies and demonstrations against CAA, NRC and NPR. The government is resorting to all measures to suppress the protests and curb the voice of the people... Booking a sedition case against Shaheen School for its kids staging an anti-CAA and anti-NRC play is the latest example for it,” they said.

They also hailed the school as a secular institution offering education to students of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Jain, Farsi and other communities without any discrimination. “No incident that could hurt the sentiments of anyone or any community has happened at the institution for the past three decades,” they said.

They demanded that the government withdraw the case immediately. “The sedition case filed against Shaheen School should immediately be withdrawn. The government should stop its efforts to curb freedom of speech. Otherwise, we will have to start a protest,” they said.

The sedition case was filed on January 26 following a complaint lodged by Neelesh Rakshyala, an activist who alleged that some of the dialogues delivered by the schoolchildren in the play amounted to “insulting” Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Some of the characters in the play were heard opposing NRC by asserting that they would not show documents to prove their citizenship.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/bidar-sedition-case-congress-leaders-come-out-in-support-of-school/article30721723.ece
134,2020/02/03,Cabinet expansion on February 6: Yediyurappa,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced on Sunday that he would expand the Cabinet on February 6. Thirteen Ministers would be inducted into the Cabinet at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday. This is the first time the Chief Minister has specified a date for expansion, ending several weeks of speculation. He said the formula for expansion was “10+3”, meaning 10 members who crossed over to the BJP and won in the byelections and three party old-timers.

When asked who among those who won in the bypolls would not be inducted, the Chief Minister refused to divulge the names. When quizzed whether it would simply be an expansion or more than that, Mr. Yediyurappa only said: “It will be decided soon.”

Hours later, intense lobbying began for the portfolios and there was also dissatisfaction in the party. Mahesh Kumathalli expressed his disappointment after learning that he may not be inducted into the Ministry. Those who joined BJP along with him, especially Ramesh Jarkiholi, came out in his support. Meanwhile, the choice of three Ministers from among the BJP’s old-timers has left many disappointed and angry. Some of the aspirants who seem to have not made the cut, reportedly held a meeting and have decided to put pressure on the Chief Minister and even approach the party high command, sources said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/cabinet-expansion-on-february-6-yediyurappa/article30721695.ece

Sriramulu, who had earlier set his eyes on the Deputy Chief Minister’s post, on Sunday said he would not embarrass the government by seeking the post for any leader of his community.

“It is true that we were asking the Deputy Chief Minister’s post for a Valmiki community leader. But now, we have come to an understanding to let the party decide on it,” Mr. Sriramulu told reporters at Gomatesh Vidya Peeth here.

“I have been given a certain responsibility by the party in the government.

136,2020/02/03,Those defeated in bypolls cannot be made Ministers: CM,"Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Sunday clarified that none of the disqualified MLAs who were not yet become members of either of the legislature Houses — R. Shankar, who did not contest the December 2019 bypolls, and A.H. Vishwanath and N. Nagaraju (MTB) who contested but lost in the bypolls — can be made Ministers now.

“The Supreme Court order had upheld disqualification of the MLAs. There are technical issues in making them Ministers. They must understand that,” he said. Article 164 (1B) of the Constitution bars a disqualified MLA from being made a Minister till the end of the tenure of the Assembly or till when the MLA becomes a member of either of the Houses, whichever is earlier. While remaining silent on Mr. Vishwanath and Mr. Nagaraju’s prospects, he said Mr. Shankar would be made an MLC and Minister in due course, as was promised to him during the bypolls.

With all these three leaders belonging to the Kuruba community, the development has taken a caste turn. Halumata Mahasabha, Kaginele, has issued a statement demanding that all three of them be given ministries as was promised. If the Chief Minister failed to keep his promise, it would be akin to what the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy did, the mahasabha stated.

Mr. Nagaraju has alleged that the BJP was responsible for his defeat and demanded that disciplinary action be initiated against party MP B.N. Bache Gowda.

Sources close to the Chief Minister maintained it was a coincidence that all three were from the same community and pointed out that B.A. (Byrathi) Basavaraj, also from the same community and who won the bypoll, was being made a Minister now.

Name finalised: Savadi

Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi on Sunday said the BJP had finalised his candidature for the lone seat in the Legislative Council for which the election is scheduled for February 17.

“The party has also discussed filing of nominations with me. Since I am the Deputy Chief Minister, it goes without saying that I will have to become a member of the Council in six months,” he said.

Mr. Savadi, who lost the 2018 Assembly polls from Athani, was inducted into the Cabinet on August 20, 2019 and later made Deputy Chief Minister. He has to become a member of either of the Houses within six months to retain his Ministry.

When asked about other aspirants for the sole MLC seat from among the new entrants to the BJP, he said four seats would become vacant in June 2020 and others would be accommodated then. “All of those who have been promised a Ministry will get their chance. They will have to wait,” he said.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/snmlei/article30721604.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BGCM,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/those-defeated-in-bypolls-cannot-be-made-ministers-cm/article30721605.ece
137,2020/02/03,Intense lobbying for key portfolios,"Hours after Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa announced that he would expand the Cabinet on Thursday, lobbying for key portfolios picked up pace.

Ramesh Jarkiholi, who met the Chief Minister at his residence to discuss the issue of his follower Mahesh Kumathalli not being inducted into the Cabinet, reportedly placed demand for Water Resources Ministry, which was held by Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar in the erstwhile coalition government.

Mr. Jarkiholi’s rivalry with Mr. Shivakumar was one of the reasons that triggered rebellion, leading to the fall of that coalition government. Mr. Jarkiholi is also said to have demanded that he be allotted the same room in the Vidhana Soudha that Mr. Shivakumar held when he was a Minister.

Two Bengaluru MLAs now confirmed to make it to the Cabinet, B.A. (Byrathi) Basavaraj and S.T. Somashekhar, have expressed their inclination to be assigned Urban Development and Bengaluru Development departments, respectively. However, the two leaders said that while they preferred these portfolios, they would not demand them and would handle any portfolio the Chief Minister assigns to them.

K. Sudhakar, Chickballapur MLA, also met the Chief Minister at his residence on Sunday morning and requested for a “good portfolio”.",karnataka,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/xy31bz/article28702241.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/25BGRAMESHJARKIHOLI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/intense-lobbying-for-key-portfolios/article30721577.ece

139,2020/02/03,Kerala private bus operators withdraw strike call,"The joint action council of private bus operators has decided to call off its proposed indefinite strike from Tuesday following talks initiated by Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran. Leaders of the council who held discussions with the Minister at the government guest house here on Monday said they would wait till February 20 to assess whether the government was committed to a solution to their concerns.

Addressing media after the discussions, Mr. Saseendran said the Ramachandran commission, constituted to look into fare revision, would conduct a hearing within February 20 to address the issues raised by the operators. The commission was also asked to submit a report after its hearing, he said.

Admitting that the bus operators were going through a crisis, the Minister said the government would strive to address their complaints. “The complaints regarding increased vehicle tax will have to be discussed at a higher level. Considering their request, the deadline for fixing the Global Positing System in buses has been extended to December 31,” he added.

Referring to the demand to hike students’ concession fare, the Minister said the government would review the system. The possibility of digitalising student concession cards would be considered after discussions with student union leaders and bus operators.

Mr. Saseendran agreed to present some of the operators’ demands before the Union Finance Minister. Calculation of vehicle tax based on the number of seats is among the demands.

Demand on fare

Bus Operators’ Joint Action Committee chairman Lawrence Babu, general convener T. Gopinath and convener K.B. Suresh Kumar attended the meeting. The bus operators declared the strike mainly seeking a revision of the minimum fare from ₹8 to ₹10.

140,2020/02/03,Assembly rejects Opposition motion to recall Governor,"The Assembly on Monday rejected a ‘substantive motion’ moved by Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala to recall Governor Arif Mohammed Khan.

Mr. Chennithala had pressed the proposal on the ground that Mr. Khan had disparaged the Assembly for the passage of the unanimous resolution demanding the abrogation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Assembly voted on party lines. The ruling front benches cast 74 ballots against the motion while the Opposition polled 36 votes in favour.

Earlier, the Business Advisory Committee had rejected Mr. Chennithala’s demand by majority opinion, with United Democratic Front members expressing their dissent in writing. Independent MLA P.C. George, who had aligned with the Bharatiya Janata Party, abstained. The sole BJP legislator, O. Rajagopal, was absent.

The voting came at the end of an hour-long dispute between the Opposition and the government over whether the Assembly should discuss Mr. Khan’s conduct.

Opposition’s stance

Mr. Chennithala said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had rolled out the red carpet for the very Governor who had publicly belittled his government for appealing against the citizenship law in the Supreme Court without the ‘permission’ of Raj Bhavan.

Mr. Vijayan said Mr. Chennithala had ‘incited’ the Governor to reject the Ordinance that sought to increase the number of elected offices in local bodies. Simultaneously, Mr. Chennithala wanted the government to assail the Governor by seeking his recall. The government could not abide by the Opposition’s ‘Janus-faced nature.’

‘Do not agree with views’

He said Mr. Khan espoused the causes of the BJP-led Union government with more ‘fervour’ than the Centre itself. The government did not agree with his ‘passionate’ views. However, the government had to consider legislative precedent.

Past and current Congress leaders had dissuaded the House from debating the Governor’s conduct as a matter of political propriety. Moreover, the Governor could not come to the House to defend himself though he was a part of it.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/assembly-rejects-opposition-motion-to-recall-governor/article30729255.ece
141,2020/02/03,Why isolation is mandatory for nCoV surveillance,"Half-truths, lies, and misinformation on novel coronavirus (nCoV) are flooding the public sphere in Kerala. Many still wonder if it is necessary to isolate people and keep them under observation if the virus is not as deadly as Nipah.

“Coronavirus is nothing new. But nCoV is a new strain that has undergone genetic changes and is aggressive in nature. The mortality rate is 2% to 3%,” says K. Mohandas Nair of the Institute of Maternal and Child Health, Government Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode.

Though the mortality rate for Nipah infection is around 80%, it spreads only through close contact with the patient who is in a critical stage. “The nCoV infection, however, is asymptomatic. Even when the patient does not exhibit any symptoms, it can spread to another person,” Dr. Nair said.

Those at risk

Also, one infected person could spread it among two or three others. “That is why anyone who stands a chance of infection should not go out in public to avoid spreading it among more people,” he said.

Dr. Nair said the nCoV might lead to a mild infection among the majority. “But, small children, senior citizens, those with diabetes and respiratory illnesses are more at risk if they are infected,” he added.

WHO efforts

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s technical risk communication and social media teams are tracking and responding to the myths and rumours in the wake of the high demand for “timely and trustworthy information about 2019-nCoV.” In the latest report published on its website, the WHO says “the 2019-nCoV outbreak and response has been accompanied by a massive ‘infodemic’ -- an over-abundance of information – some accurate and some not – that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.”

Refuting rumours

The organisation is working 24 hours a day to identify rumours that can potentially harm the public’s health, such as false prevention measures or cures through its headquarters in Geneva, six regional offices and its partners.

Social media channels

“...These myths are then refuted with evidence-based information. The WHO is making public health information and advice on the 2019-nCoV, including myth busters, available on its social media channels, including Weibo, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and website,” says the report.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/c3zilr/article30725015.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/COROK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/why-isolation-is-mandatory/article30729236.ece
142,2020/02/03,Electric autos can now swap batteries in Kochi,"Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), a Maharatna company in the oil and gas space, has forayed into the electric vehicle arena with the launch of its ‘e-Drive – stop, swap, go’ initiative in Kochi and Lucknow.

The battery-swapping system for three-wheelers in the two cities was launched by D. Rajkumar, CMD of BPCL, through videoconferencing from Chennai on Monday. The system is the first of its kind in the country, officials said.

The benefits of the model are that it is affordable and the driver does not have to invest in purchasing the battery. The driver would have to give a specified amount as rent to BPCL. Above all, the waiting time to recharge batteries is eliminated through swapping batteries that are low on charge with fully charged ones made available at charging hubs in fuel stations. The swapping takes around three minutes.

Mr. Rajkumar said that because of concerns over rising air and noise pollution and rapid urbanisation, electric vehicles are set to have an increasing share in urban transportation. “We have collaborated with IIT, Madras, for technological support and with Kinetic Green as mobility partner.”

In this model, the three-wheelers will be owned by Kinetic Green. BPCL, with support of IIT, Madras, would provide lithium-ion batteries. The IIT has finalised the IT infrastructure for the swapping process. In Kochi, about two dozen electric-powered three-wheelers have been leased out to a cooperative society of autorickshaw driver unions.

“Accountability is fixed by scanning the QR code of each battery. A pair of batteries can power a three-wheeler for 60 km, following which it can be swapped at fuel stations for fully charged ones. A GPS enables tracking of number of kilometres travelled, battery performance, charge available, etc.,” said Sudheendran P.C., Assistant Manager (Sales) Retail of BPCL.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/o6nz8z/article30729216.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/IMG-20200203-WA0034,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/electric-autos-can-now-swap-batteries-in-kochi/article30729217.ece
143,2020/02/03,nCoV sample testing begins in Alappuzha unit of NIV,"Testing of samples for novel coronavirus (nCoV) has started at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) unit in Alappuzha.

All facilities have been made available at the Alappuzha unit and it takes 7-8 hours to test a sample. “We have started testing samples (blood and swab) of suspected cases from across the State at the unit,” said an official of the NIV Kerala unit.

For lack of permission from the Centre, the State had depended on the NIV, Pune, to test the samples. The samples of the first two confirmed nCoV cases in the State, one in Thrissur and another in Alappuzha, were tested at Pune. Taking into account the time and risks involved in transporting the samples to Pune, the State government last week sought the Centre’s permission to carry out laboratory analysis of the samples here.

Upgraded

Sources said the nod for testing samples in the unit situated at the Government Medical Hospital, Alappuzha, would help identify positive cases faster. “During the Nipah virus outbreak, the samples were tested at the Alappuzha NIV along with the Manipal Institute of Virology and NIV, Pune. However, at the time, only results from Pune were considered for confirmation. This time, the results of samples tested at Alappuzha will be considered official,” said a source.

Fully equipped

The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has classified laboratories into different categories from Biosafety Level (BSL) 1 to 4 on a combination of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment, and laboratory facilities. According to the NCDC biosafety manual, contagious and dangerous pathogens such as nCoV should be tested in a BSL-4, maximum containment laboratory. For that reason, samples from across the country are tested at the NIV, Pune. However, NIV Alappuzha, has now been made fully equipped to test samples for coronavirus, sources said.

Meanwhile, the construction of a permanent building for the NIV unit in Alappuzha is progressing at Kuravanthodu. Earlier, the project was delayed on various accounts. Although the main structure is almost complete, allied facilities are yet to be finished. Once the unit was shifted to the new building, its functional reliability for testing samples for viral diseases would be scaled up. The project is implemented with funding from the Centre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/yapxkg/article30729196.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/4tval1--NIV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/ncov-sample-testing-begins-in-alappuzha-unit-of-niv/article30729198.ece

The celebration, held at St.Dominic Cathedral here, commenced with a procession at 10.15 a.m. Cardinal Mar George Alencherry, Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church, was the chief celebrant of the function. Metropolitan Archbishop Mar Joseph Perumthottam and Bishop Mar Mathew Arackal were the concelebrants.

146,2020/02/03,Dying tribal craft finds a haven in museum,"‘Aaanaviratty’ was once a lifesaver for the tribespeople, who used the bamboo device to chase away crop-raiding wild elephants. The device was filled with kerosene and lit from below. It produced a burst and fire balls, scaring away elephants. Another useful tool was ‘kallu villu,’ made of bamboo stick and a sturdy wild vine. It was used for hunting wild animals and collecting fruits from trees. These are among the items on display at the tribal museum on the first floor of the Velliyamattom grama panchayat. Artefacts, wild seeds, bamboo products, and forest produce are the other exhibits.

The grama panchayat houses many ethnic tribal communities, including Urali, Mala Araya, and Hill Pulaya and has the second largest tribal population in the district after Adimaly. “Many a tribal know-how has vanished. Their instruments too are not in use any more. The idea for setting up the museum was conceived as part of a project ‘Oorum Unarvum,’ while collecting details of the early life of the tribal communities in the panchayat,” P.M. Abdul Samad, the grama panchayat president instrumental in setting up the museum, told The Hindu.

Unique knowledge

Mr. Samad conveyed his idea to M.P. Ajith Kumar, additional director, panchayat, who encouraged him to make it happen. “The unique knowledge of the tribes needs to be protected and their expertise in creating artefacts, preserved. The Urali community is a rich source of indigenous knowledge. The farming instruments they used were unique,” he added.

The bark of the ‘arayanji maram’ was used for clothes by their forefathers. The bark is kept in water for long and is crushed.

It is soft like a woollen overcoat. The bark finds a place in the museum in addition to ‘chenakaya,’ a wild fruit which is powdered and used as soap. They had separate rat traps for paddy fields and upland areas. These days, very few people can make them, Mr. Samad said.

Mirror-like mat

The museum is an effort to familiarise the public with the yesteryear life of tribespeople. Visitors are curious about items made of coconut shells and bamboo. ‘Kannadipaya,’ a mat made from the soft portion of bamboo, is a classic example of tribal expertise. The thin mat looks like the surface of a mirror. The seed of the ‘pathiri maram’ looks like a snake and the juice from its roots is a remedy for snakebite.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/270m2m/article30729168.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04tvpage4honey,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/dying-tribal-craft-finds-a-haven-in-museum/article30729161.ece

152,2020/02/03,Wild boar threat to Pathanamthitta villages,"Wild boars have become a major threat to crops as well as people residing even in villages situated far away from the forests in Pathanamthitta.

A rapid increase in wildlife population and the pressure on the fringe areas due to cultivation of crops along the forest borders have been identified as two major factors leading to frequent straying of wild animals into human habitation.

The trend of wild animals straying into human habitations along the forest fringes is particularly high in the months leading to summer when the water sources in the forests dry up in the scorching heat.

Wild boars destroying crops in villages situated far away from the forests like Naranganam, Kadammanitta, Kattoor, Cheukol, Ayroor, Kozhencherry, Thumpamon and even in Adoor has become common in recent times, says T.R. Balagopalan Nair, Janakeeya Kashaka Samrakshana Samiti (JKSS) president.

Mr Nair says there are also farmers who have stopped cultivation due to the threat of wild boars attacking their farmlands. The hapless peasants fear wild boar attack on their crops any time, he says.

The samiti organised a march to the Divisional Forest Office in Konni recently, demanding effective steps to protect their crops from the ever-growing boar menace. The farmers have also urged the government to pay them adequate compensation for crop losses.

Though the State had permitted shooting down of crop-raiding wild boars way back in 2011, stipulations fixed for killing the animal stand as a hindrance, says Mr Nair. The norm that the crop-raiding boars should be shot down only after obtaining permission from the Forest Department is grossly impractical, he feels.

The farmers also voiced similar concerns. They feel the authorities still consider wild boars as part of wildlife and hint at action against those who attack the animal.

Meanwhile, the Forest Department has declared the crop-raiding wild boars harmful animals and the Government Order has been subsequently modified giving permission to the Divisional Forest Officers and Wildlife Wardens to kill such boars.

Habitat

Experts are of the view that raiding of crops by wild boars is an adaptation trait shown by the animal in the wake of its natural habitat and food base shrinking progressively.

According to them, the wild animals are forced to stray into human habitations owing to changes taking place in the forest eco system fuelled by climate change and excessive human intervention.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/wild-boar-threat-to-pathanamthitta-villages/article30729084.ece

154,2020/02/03,nCoV outbreak declared a State calamity in Kerala,"With the confirmation of a third case of the novel coronavirus (nCoV) infection in the State, Kerala on Monday declared the epidemic a State calamity/

The apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority met Chief Secretary Tom Jose to propose the decision to ensure that the outbreak is controlled.

As on Monday, 2,239 travellers from China and other nCoV-affected countries have been placed under surveillance in Kerala.

Among them, 2,155 are under home isolation and 84 have been admitted to hospitals with isolation facilities in various districts, a bulletin by the State Health Department said.

Of the 140 samples sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, so far, 46 have tested negative. Hospital authorities have confirmed that the condition of all symptomatic persons under isolation in hospitals is stable.

GoM set up

Meanwhile, a high-level group of Ministers has been constituted on the directions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review management of the outbreak.

Confirming the third case of the nCoV infection in a student who returned recently to Kasargod from Wuhan, the Union Health Ministry said, “The patient...is in isolation in the hospital. The patient is stable and is being closely monitored.”

Meanwhile, five people, who were shifted to the Army’s Base hospital from a quarantine facility in Manesar after showing symptoms of cough and cold, have tested negative for nCoV. The five were among the 247 persons evacuated from the Hubei province in China. The symptoms of the coronavirus infection start with fever and dry cough followed by breathing problems, according to doctors.

Intensive surveillance

The Kerala Health Department has taken adequate preparatory measures and framed detailed guidelines as soon as the WHO issued a global health alert and this helped the State respond appropriately when nCoV struck, Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said in the State Assembly.

The Health Department’s disease surveillance teams are now trying to get an estimate of the exact number of students who have returned to Kerala from Wuhan.

“The natural assumption would be that we might have many more positive cases from amongst the Wuhan returnees in the coming days. Kerala does have a sizeable presence in Wuhan with a number of students pursuing undergraduate medical studies there,” State Nodal Officer for Public Health Emergencies Amar Fettle said.

Airport surveillance and coordinated surveillance and monitoring measures with the help of various departments and local bodies helped the Health Department keep track of those who have returned to the State from China. The logistics management by the department ensured a green channel for the smooth transfer of anyone (on home quarantine) developing flu symptoms to isolation facilities.

The State only required an intimation from China returnees and the rest was taken care of. A call to the 24x7 helpline (DISHA 1056) ensured that a person (who had developed flu symptoms) was picked up in a special ambulance and transferred to selected hospitals with isolation facilities.

Control rooms have been opened at the State and district level and all activities were being reviewed on a daily basis, Ms. Shylaja said.

A senior health official in the State said, “The national guidelines say that only samples of patients isolated in hospitals be sent for testing. But we have revised it so that we will be collecting samples for testing from all persons who have returned from Wuhan after January 15 and are on home quarantine.”",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/4oqpi9/article30728354.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CORONAVIRUS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-declares-coronavirus-as-state-calamity-after-third-positive-case/article30728355.ece
155,2020/02/03,Coronavirus outbreak being declared State calamity,"The novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak was declared a State calamity after the apex committee of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) met here with Chief Secretary Tome Jose in the chair on Monday and made such a proposal to ensure that the outbreak is controlled.

Health Minister K.K. Shylaja said the declaration was not to create a scare or panic but to keep the public on alert and to remind them that they needed to observe the directives issued by the Health Department. A few persons were giving authorities the slip and avoiding quarantine measures. Such people were posing a serious hazard to their own life and the life of others.

Implications

The declaration brings the epidemic under the ambit of the Disaster Management Act. It enables the government to spend money from the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for activities undertaken to contain the threat. Now, the overall coordination comes under the executive committee of the SDMA headed by the Chief Secretary. The panel includes the Secretaries for Home, Health, Disaster Management and Finance.

At least two hospitals have been readied with isolation facilities in all districts and adequate personal protection equipment has been arranged in all hospitals, she added.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/u8lwls/article30730114.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04TVKI-CORONA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/coronavirus-epidemic-being-declared-state-calamity/article30727715.ece
156,2020/02/03,Centre’s decision on revenue deficit grant fails to cheer State,"Even after the Centre accepting the Union Finance Commission’s revenue deficit grant award of ₹74,000 crore, the State government is concerned over the time and quantum of funds to be devolved over the years.

The concern is largely based on the Centre’s practice of slashing the grant progressively in the previous years. Citing financial constraints, if the Centre defers the allocation, it would rattle the State’s finances.

The 15th Union Finance Commission, in its interim report, had awarded ₹74,000 crore for the grant to States, but Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitaraman in her budget speech had said that the Centre would provide a substantial share in this score and it was whittled down to ₹30,000 crore.

Political duress

Subsequently, under political duress, mainly from the non-BJP ruled States led by Kerala, the Centre accepted the award in toto.

Of the ₹ 74,000 crore awarded by the commission, Kerala ,Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal were expected to share about ₹38,000 crore and the remaining component was to be apportioned among the North-Eastern States.

The grant is awarded to States that bear the burden of persistent deficit for bridging the revenue and expenditure gap. Kerala had been looking forward for a support in this regard since it is eligible for a sum of ₹14,000 crore.

Rise in speculation

Rumours were rife that the 15th UFC would do away with the grant, but it was found to be bountiful in its award. Ms. Sitaraman’s announcement that it would give a substantive sum as grant had given rise to speculation.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac had voiced concern against the bid to slash the grant. And that too at a time when the revenue collections have dipped, the Centre had refused to heed the State’s demand for raising the annual borrowing limit and also reduced the devolution from its divisive pool.

During the past five years too the devolution of funds as revenue deficit grant was inconsistent. After awarding ₹5,000 crore in the first year, it came down to ₹4,000 crore and tapered down the years.

Negative side

Kerala like other States that had registered remarkable progress in health and family planning sectors is being forced to pay heavily for the dividends it gained in containing the population growth.

The UFC decision to go by the 2011 census report, wishing away the assurance given earlier to fix the awards on the basis of the 1971 census in view of the State’s efforts in population control, too is feared to take a heavy toll on the apportioning of funds from the Centre.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/centres-decision-on-revenue-deficit-grant-fails-to-cheer-state/article30727277.ece
157,2020/02/03,Kerala Tourism to rein in houseboat operations,"In the wake of a spate of accidents involving houseboats, Kerala Tourism will step in to regulate the craft operating in backwaters, check environmental pollution, and ensure service standards, safety and security of holidayers.

The move comes in the wake of the thinking among tourism planners that the Tourism Department should have a major say in houseboat operations. At present, the licence and fitness of the houseboats are certified by the Department of Ports and the pollution aspects are taken care of by the Kerala State Pollution Control Board. Yet it is the Tourism Department that gets all the brickbat from holidayers for any mishaps or accidents.

The department is now contemplating a committee with members from the Department of Ports, Fire and Rescue Services, Tourism police, and Kerala Tourism with legal backing to carry out inspection of the houseboats to ensure that the operators adhere to the safety and security standards, provide the prescribed service, and follow the rules notified.

The department wants to ensure that all houseboats have valid licence, fitness, insurance, including third party one, and a system for taking legal action against those flouting rules. Valid licence will be made mandatory for technical staff such as boat drivers, shrank and laskar. Cook and hospitality staff deployed in houseboats will be provided adequate training.

Police clearance certificate for all staff, health card for those handling food, and food safety licence and registration for all houseboats have been mooted.

Uniform is being planned for the personnel and so is a five-day annual training for cooks and hospitality staff. Training by Fire and Rescue Services for all personnel in the houseboats has also been suggested.

Ban on smoking

Banning of smoking and drinking, linking of the GPS installed in the houseboat to the police control room, and safety and security guidelines for the holidayers have also been suggested.

Meanwhile, Tourism Minister Kadakampally Surendran told the Assembly on Tuesday that the government is considering setting up a regulatory authority to control the houseboats operating in the State. “Stringent regulations are needed to control houseboat operations. There is a proposal before the government to constitute a regulatory authority for the purpose. We are mulling legislation in this connection at least in the next Assembly session,” he said.",kerala,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/valznc/article30745637.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/2tvalHB,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/kerala-tourism-to-rein-in-houseboats/article30726823.ece
158,2020/02/03,SDPI infiltrates peaceful anti-CAA protest: CM,"Accusing the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) of infiltrating peaceful protests in the State against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act with a view to creating communal divisions, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said his government will not tolerate any attempts to create disharmony in society.

He was replying to a question raised by K.C. Joseph, MLA, in the Assembly on Monday.

""The SDPI, which holds extremist views, have infiltrated some protests and tried to create communal division between people at a time when we are all going ahead with united protests. This will not be tolerated. The police have taken action against such attempts,"" he said.

This led to an uproar from the Opposition benches, at which point the CM asked, ""Why are you getting worked up at criticism against the SDPI?"" Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the United Democratic Front had no reason to support the SDPI and accused the CM of making misleading statements.

Mr. Vijayan said no case has been filed against anyone in the State for participating in protests against the CAA. However, action has been taken in case of incidents of violence during protests.

Mr. Vijayan said 27 cases have been registered over attempts to create communal tension in protests related to the CAA. A case has been registered against 100 people for raising communal slogans related to the Gujarat riots during a pro-CAA protest rally organised by the BJP at Kuttiyadi in Kozhikode district. An explanation has been sought from the sub-inspector of the Mattannur police station and Iritty police for allegedly participating in a pro-CAA rally wearing their uniforms.

He accused the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) of infiltrating the peaceful protests with an aim to create communal divisions. He was replying to a question raised by K.C. Joseph, MLA, in the Assembly on Monday.

“Kerala has witnessed widespread protests against the CAA by several political and non-political organisations. The government has not taken any step which would adversely affect these protests. No case has been filed against anyone involved in peaceful protests. However, if someone crosses the limits and indulges in violence, action will naturally have to be taken. That will be the case under any government. There is no need to link such cases with that of the anti-CAA protests,” he said.

‘Communal slogans raised’

Mr. Vijayan said that 27 cases were registered over attempts to create communal tension in protests related to the CAA. A case was registered against 100 people for raising communal slogans related to the Gujarat riots during a pro-CAA protest rally organised by the BJP in Kuttiyadi in Kozhikode district. An explanation had been sought from the SI of Mattannur police station and Iritti ASP for allegedly participating in a pro-CAA rally wearing their uniforms.

Mr. Joseph said that the Chief Minister should not depend on police reports alone. Cases were filed against 62 persons, including Kozhikode District Congress Committee president T. Siddique, last month, even though there had been no destruction of public property.

Roji. M. John, MLA, alleged that a case had been registered against around 200 people who participated in a peaceful protest organised by a Mahallu committee in Angamaly. In his reponse, Mr. Vijayan said that several Mahallu committees had organised anti-CAA protests peacefully.

“However, the SDPI which holds extremist views has infiltrated some protests and tried to create communal divisions between people, at a time when we are all going ahead with united protests. This will not be tolerated,” he said.

161,2020/02/03,"In Kerala, 2,130 islands brought under CRZ regime","As many as 2,130 backwater islands of Kerala, including Maradu, have been brought under the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) regime thereby imposing curbs on development activities.

No new development activity will be permitted in these islands in an area between High Tide Line (HTL) and 50 metres towards the landward side, which is the CRZ area of these islands. The HTL is the line on the land up to which the highest water line reaches during the spring tide.

Major violations

The islands of Mulavukad, Chendamangalam, Kothad, Pizhala and Kadamakudy of Ernakulam where some major CRZ violations have been reported are there in the list of 1,068 islands of the district.

The 474 islands of Alappuzha and the 184 of Kollam are also in the list. Thiruvananthapuram has the least number of islands, 43.

Going by the rules, for the land owners of Maradu apartments, which were razed for violating the CRZ notification, construction will be possible in an area beyond the 50 metres from the High Tide Line.

It was by invoking the provisions of the CRZ 2011 notification, which made special provisions for Kerala considering the “unique coastal systems of backwaters and backwaters islands along with the space limitation in the coastal stretches of the State of Kerala,” that the islands were identified.

Within the 50 metre CRZ area of these islands, only the repair and reconstruction of existing dwelling units of local communities will be permitted. Beyond the 50 metre limit, the local communities could construct new dwelling units with the permission of the local body, said the notification.

However, the CRZ area of these islands has been reduced to 20 metres in the subsequent CRZ notification issued in 2019, allowing more land for construction towards the water body. One may have to wait for some more time for availing of the benefits of the CRZ 2019 notification, as it is yet to come into force.

Till the 2019 notification comes into effect, the 2011 notification will hold good, sources said.

First list of islands

This is for the first time that the list of the Kerala islands is being drawn up.

The list of the islands was prepared by the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, Thiruvananthapruam, for the Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA).

Though ultimately Mugen Rao won the season, Losliya was one of the most talked-about contestants during the course of the show.

Though there were reports that she would debut with actor Aari in another film, now it has been announced that her first official signing would be in former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh’s debut Tamil film, Friendship.

Friendship is directed by John Paul Raj and Sham Sundar who earlier made Chennaiyil Oru Naal 2 and Agni Devi. This comes as a huge break for the TV star who will hope to follow in the footsteps of former Bigg Boss stars such as Yashika and Oviya, who made it big after their stints on the reality show.

Friendship is jointly produced by JPR and Stalin.

I Still Love You’, ‘The Chef Show’ and more","The first month of the year brought with it a slew of incredible offerings such as the final season of Bojack Horseman, the return of Sex Education, Vir Das’ new special For India, and so on, that started off 2020 on the right note. Even with slight disappointments like Ghost Stories and the Dracula reboot, it was an enjoyable month of binge-watching, leading into February that is headlined by Adam Sandler’s critically-acclaimed Uncut Gems.

Though not as content-heavy as January, this month also brings with it plenty to love for fans of romedy, as it’s Valentine’s Day soon after all! Apart from the release of the much-anticipated To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You (the sequel to the smash hit To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before), there are also other long-time favourites such as Little Things, The Kissing Booth, When We First Met, etc to comfort-watch... with a loved one or not.

But if neither of these work, then here are some picks among the new stuff: The Pharmacist is an original docu-series that follows a small-town pharmacist who ends up exposing the opioid epidemic, Who Killed Malcom X? reignites the case decades after the assassination of African American leader Malcolm X, the third season of The Chef Show marks the return of Jon Favreau and Roy Choi at their good-natured best, while Sundance drama-thriller Horse Girl, directed by Jeff Baena (she co-wrote the screenplay with star Alison Brie), is another hotly-anticipated affair.

Taj Mahal 1989 and Amit Tandon: Family Tandoncies are exciting Indian viewers as well, but let’s face it, can anything compare to the hype around the new Pokemon movie? But no, it doesn’t take after the super-realistic style of animation that made Ryan Reynolds’ Detective Pikachu such a big hit internationally. Rather, it’s a remake of 1998’s cartoon film Pokemon: The First Movie, and has been titled Pokémon: Mewtwo Strikes Back—Evolution, and follows a completely CGI style of animation.

170,2020/02/03,"Unless you are unique to you, you’re not going to succeed: Rana Daggubati","The second day of the Under 25 Summit 2020 on February 2 saw actor, producer, television personality, visual effects supervisor, and entrepreneur Rana Daggubati take the stage to raucous cheering. Dressed casually and wearing a cap that read ‘Tyson’ in bold, the 35-year-old multi-hyphenate took part in two sessions: Careers in entertainment industry with founding partner of KWAN Dhruv Chitgopekar and moderated by co-founder of Under 25, Anto Philip; and Technology in entertainment industry with founder and CEO of Anthill Ventures Prasad Vanga.

The audience got some revelations: he failed the class 10 board exam (don’t cheer for that, Rana laughingly admonished the crowd), he has a Star Wars phone case and he is single. He also had some advice: “if you want to get into films, get to work right away whether it is making a short film or doing theatre”. Stating that he “loves movies”, Rana stresses that he enjoys telling stories, adding that “the want for content and talent is at its highest now”.

Sitting down for a quick chat, the star is understated and approachable, even apologising for “talking a lot”. One of the things that Rana mentioned during the session was that the audience starts to expects a certain persona from a star and this may creatively inhibit said star. So, how does he deal with it?

Agreeing that a lot of stars face this problem, he says, “They are not able to consistently do different things because it requires them to come down from a certain number and return. Now, I have made a choice. If I don't have a story to tell, I might as well stay in office. It is a simpler job than going ahead and doing something I don't like. Between the two Baahubali films, I did a film called Ghazi which was an extremely small film. It doesn't matter what the size of the film is; if it is a story you want to tell, just go ahead and tell it. So, it is really a choice that one makes. Like the question was asked about what I consider success. You need to make that yardstick and stick to it. It doesn't matter if somebody next to me is doing X or Y. This is what you do. When the audience is watching you in the theatre, the lights are off, they are not watching anybody’s split screen. They just want to be engaged in that story. Rana adds, “In the world of arts, unless you are unique to you, you're not going to succeed. I can’t be doing what somebody else does because it's already being done. You can’t emulate success; it’s got to be your own.”

In the pipeline Telugu film Virata Parvam, directed by Venu Udugula

Haathi Mere Saathi, a multilingual film, directed by Prabhu Solomon

Producing/distributing Krishna and His Leela, directed by Ravikanth Perepu

Coming from a visual effects background and still being engaged in the field (having collaborated with startups to incorporate technology in films), what does he think of VFX in India and whether Hollywood should be considered as setting the standard?

Says Rana, “There are two very fundamental differences between the West and India. We have seven or eight very successful industries within one country. Hollywood is an ecosystem that is built along with content and technology. if you see a company like Walt Disney, as much as it is a great content company, it is also a huge technology company. Here in India, convergence is very little, especially in the arts. Because as careers or culture, arts is looked down upon. It is slowly changing in the metros, but it is still not an influence of culture. Being an animator or a visual effects supervisor is still not (considered) a great career path. And the reason I am here at events like this is to kind of find that. Because there are a lot of people with an interest but they don't know the direction to head in. Since we don't have that ecosystem that is there (in Hollywood), it is important for filmmakers or for other industries to kind of come together. How is the tech in India? It’s sharp, we can build a lot of things but that technology is not being used by other industries in India. And we shy away from innovation as a culture because there is a sense that ‘okay, this works, let us use it till it works’. But what happens is today's world is not like that.”

He adds, “It is not a step-by-step world anymore; it is a consistent learning world. It is a different system that has evolved in the last couple of years. I think we need to understand that as a culture and then really promote the arts. How do we get better visual effects or better concepts? When you think of school, how many of them take drawing class seriously? Take it as seriously as math. When you do, it will all change. I think that is really the culture we're trying to inculcate at a micro level.”",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/pv4k3j/article30726319.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGMRANA2,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/unless-you-are-unique-to-you-youre-not-going-to-succeed-rana-daggubati/article30726320.ece
171,2020/02/03,Jennifer Lopez and Shakira stand up for Latin rights with powerhouse Super Bowl 2020 performance,"Jennifer Lopez and Shakira brought an energetic jolt of Latina star power to Sunday’s Super Bowl halftime show, delivering hip-shaking choreography and a medley of infectious hits to one of the world’s glitziest stages.

Latin artists Bad Bunny and J Balvin appeared as surprise guests in the extravaganza, which signaled its Latin American influences from the onset, when Shakira greeted the stadium audience in Spanish with “Hola, Miami!”

Dressed in a sequined, ruby-red outfit with matching boots, Shakira led her team of dancers through snippets of hits such as Whenever, Wherever and Hips Don’t Lie before giving way to Jennifer Lopez.

Lopez made her entrance in black leather and studs on a stage set resembling the top of the Empire State Building, as ”Jenny from the Block” proudly announced she was from the Bronx, New York.

The 12-minute halftime show, along with commercials, has become a popular feature of the Super Bowl spectacle on par with the game itself, which draws some 100 million television viewers in the United States.

In Miami, a majority Latino city, where the Kansas City Chiefs played the San Francisco 49ers for the championship of the National Football League, the show’s organizers had discreetly built up expectations for a display of girl power with a Latina twist.

The backgrounds of the two headliners fit two of the demographics the National Football League is trying to attract to expand its fan base: women and Latinos.

J-Lo, 50, is the Bronx-born child of Puerto Rican parents who, as her own hit Jenny from the Block attests, rose from humble roots to become an international star of Hollywood movies and popular music with her own fashion and fragrance lines.

As her set progressed, J-Lo changed in a wink into a lacy body suit, unfurling a rectangular boa with the U.S. flag on one side and the Puerto Rican flag on the other. It was a subtle reminder that Puerto Ricans — hit by a Category 5 hurricane in 2017 and more recently set back by a series of earthquakes — are Americans, too.

She then strutted to On the Floor, a 2011 hit, and Let’s Get Loud, a track from her debut 1999 album, featuring a girls’ choir.

Shakira, 43, who is from Barranquilla, Colombia, in building up the show she let it be known she sympathized with Latinos in the United States, where anti-immigration rhetoric has become more open in recent years.

“Latinos are going through a difficult time in the U.S. right now, and I think it’s very important for us to convey a message of unity and also to show what a relevant force the Latin community is in this country,” Shakira told reporters on Thursday.

This year’s Super Bowl broke ground for women in high places, including in the ownership of both teams (Denise York of the 49ers and Norma Hunt of the Chiefs), and on the sidelines, where San Francisco’s offensive assistant Katie Sowers became the first woman to coach in a Super Bowl.

“That statement alone is empowering,” Lopez told reporters on Thursday, referring to the women owners and halftime headliners.

The Super Bowl halftime show started out 53 years ago with university marching bands, a high school drill team and two guys flying with jet packs. It has since evolved into a showcase for A-list talent, including Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Madonna and Lady Gaga.

One of the more notable performances came in 2004 when Justin Timberlake tugged on Janet Jackson’s clothes, briefly exposing a breast adorned with a nipple shield. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission sought to fine broadcaster CBS $550,000 for indecency over the incident, which Timberlake famously dubbed a “wardrobe malfunction,” but the fine was overturned in the courts.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/vqz09a/article30725990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/FOOTBALL-NFL-SUPERBOWLHALFTIME,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/jennifer-lopez-and-shakira-stand-up-for-latin-rights-with-powerhouse-super-bowl-2020-performance/article30725991.ece
172,2020/02/03,‘Uncut Gems’ review: Adam Sandler’s mesmerising crime thriller is an all-out sucker punch,"Adam Sandler’s performance as Howard Ratner, the jeweller with a gambling problem is riveting — easily one of this year’s most memorable, and possibly the actor’s best. Uncut Gems, while being mesmerising, also makes for rather stressful viewing. This is not a movie you can watch to unwind. It grabs you by the collar and bedazzles you with glitter-sharp cuts, which seem in tandem with your rapidly-increasing heart rate.

The movie starts in 2010 when Ethiopian Jewish miners find a rare, black opal. The camera zooms into the brightly blinking facets of the stones and just as you lose yourself in the sparkling facets, you find yourself looking at a monitor for a colonoscopy! Ratner is undergoing the procedure to rule out cancer that runs in the family.

Uncut Gems Director: Josh Safdie, Benny Safdie

Cast: Adam Sandler, Lakeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, Kevin Garnett, Idina Menzel, Eric Bogosian

Storyline: A jeweller with a weakness for gambling is up against all kinds of odds to stay alive and afloat

Runtime: 135 minutes

From that point on, we are riding on Ratner’s shoulder seeing and hearing the world from his perspective. Ratner’s world, where he is a jeweller in Manhattan’s diamond district is a cacophonous, dizzyingly bright place where everyone is out to rip off everyone else. So there is Ratner of course, who is deep in debt and like every other addict looking to make good with the next bet. He is on the verge of divorce from his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), while also having an affair with his employee, Julia (Julia Fox). There is also Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), Ratner’s assistant selling fake watches.

Over the Passover weekend, Ratner who learns of and buys the opal, is hoping to auction it for a million dollars even as he dodges his creditors playing one off against the other. There is the Passover dinner to get through, his daughter’s school play to watch, a superstitious basketball player (Kevin Garnett as himself) to placate, a raucous party to crash, an auction to attend, even as he waits for the results of his colonoscopy. Just remembering all that goes on in the movie is enough to make you breathless.

The movie is bookended by in-depth photography of the opal, inspired according to the directors by the gemological photomicrography of Eduard Gübelin and Danny J. Sanchez. The movie, like the ST Coleridge’s ancient mariner, fixes you with its glittering eye. However, unlike the poem where you can take a breath when the ship is becalmed “like a painted ship upon a painted ocean,” Uncut Gems does not let up at all — there is no breather, no break, just a relentless tightening of the coils of the plot, which in the final count is exhausting.

173,2020/02/03,My sensitivities to religions will always be on point: Karan Johar on ‘Takht’,"Filmmaker Karan Johar, who is set to direct period drama Takht, says his sensitivities to religions across the world will be on point as it is something he takes care of.

The magnum opus, which features Anil Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Ranveer Singh, Vicky Kaushal, Alia Bhatt, Janhvi Kapoor and Bhumi Pednekar, is set in the Mughal era.

When asked how he will strike a balance in Takht as Bollywood period films have often been criticised for endorsing Islamophobia, Karan told reporters, “You’re talking to someone who has directed My Name is Khan.”

“My sensitivities to religions across the world will always be on point. That’s something I believe as a human being and as a citizen of this great country and of the world. Sensitivity to everyone and everything is something we take very deep care of. Takht is not a story I wrote, history wrote that story. I’m only telling it,” he added.

Takht marks Karan’s first attempt at directing a period drama which traces the relationship between Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and his brother Dara Shukoh.

Hussain Haidry has penned the dialogues for the film, with screenplay by Sumit Roy.

174,2020/02/03,"‘Giri/Haji’ review: An ultraviolent thriller that is ambitious, but ultimately flawed","“Someone threw a stone in a pond a long way away and we’re only just feeling the ripples.”

The eight-episode series, Giri/Haji, opens with a bang. Somewhere in London, a Japanese man fixes two drinks and opens the door. The next thing we know, he is dead, a sword lodged in his back.

In a Tokyo restaurant, men who work for Yakuza boss Fukuhara (Masahiro Motoki) are killed in a hail of bullets. It transpires that the sword belongs to Fukuhara and the man it killed was the nephew of a rival Yakuza head, Shin Endo.

In Tokyo, Chief Inspector Hayashi is worried that the peace of many years is on the verge of collapsing. And so, he, along with Fukuhara, go to detective Kenzo Mori’s (Takehiro Hira) home to tell him some hard truths: one, that his brother, Yuto (Yosuke Kubozuka), presumed dead, is likely alive considering it was he who last had the sword. Two, Kenzo has to go to London, find said brother and bring him back to Japan and thereby prevent a gang war. Three, it has to be done without the knowledge of the London police, necessitating the cover story of Kenzo travelling there for an exchange programme.

There are people trying to prevent Kenzo from finding Yuto as he realises soon enough when he discovers that his contact in London is working for a criminal named Abott (Charles Creed-Miles). While at a pub, Kenzo meets a junkie working as a rent boy, Rodney Yamaguchi (Will Sharpe). Rodney agrees to help Kenzo get entry into what he (Kenzo) thinks is an exclusive club. While there a man talks about a Yakuza who was in a fight (rendered in animation). And so the myth of Yuto builds (akin to but not on the same level of who is Snoke in Star Wars).

Giri/Haji (Duty/Shame) Cast: Takehiro Hira, Yōsuke Kubozuka, Kelly Macdonald, Will Sharpe, Aoi Okuyama, Masahiro Motoki, Justin Long, Charlie Creed-Miles, Yuko Nakamura

Directors: Julian Farino, Ben Chessell

Runtime: Each episode is nearly 1 hour

Storyline: A Tokyo detective is tasked with finding and bringing his criminal brother home from London to prevent a gang war on the streets of Tokyo

As for the story, it takes many a turn and makes room for numerous subplots. There is Kenzo’s sulky daughter, Taki (Aoi Okuyama), who runs away from Tokyo and finds freedom to be herself in London; Kenzo and Rei ( Yuko Nakamura) who feel trapped in their marriage; Kenzo’s actions many years ago when he helped his brother that has probably led to this situation; Sarah (Kelly Macdonald), the police detective conducting the programme, who is isolated from her coworkers owing to earlier actions; Abbot’s desire to go back to being a proper gangster and not listen to his American partner Vickers (Justin Long. Long time, no see)… it’s a lot.

The format of the series is such that the first three episodes don’t reveal much about Yuto; just snippets in the form of Kenzo’s memories (the aspect ratio changes to make sure the audience is well aware that it’s a flashback). The answers though come only in the fourth episode when we are given Yuto’s backstory; a little too late.

The series, while engrossing in the beginning, soon starts tapering out. The characters, interesting in the beginning, make such bone-headed decisions by the end, that it becomes impossible to feel any empathy, forget rooting for them. In the family dynamic of Kenzo, Rodney, Sarah and Taki, who come together out of a shared loneliness, it is Will Sharpe and Aoi Okuyama who shine. Charles Creed-Miles and Justin Long too do justice to their roles.

There is a strange moment towards the end that is tonally off when several characters take a timeout in the middle of a dramatic moment to give vent to their feelings through a contemporary dance (yes, it’s clear that it’s not actually happening, but that does not help).

Stray thoughts

1) Excellent drums with the opening credits

2) Taki meets a girl called Annie but at the end we don’t know what happens to her. Annie, are you ok? Are you ok, Annie?

3) Sarah seems to have no sense of priority unlike Abbot. When two people are thrown together in an intense situation and dead bodies are piling up, yes, things can happen (we have all watched Speed), but shouldn’t the state of your relationship be a question for much later?

175,2020/02/03,‘Joker’ star Joaquin Phoenix calls out film industry’s ‘systemic racism’ at BAFTAs,"Actor Joaquin Phoenix targeted the British Academy of Film and Television for overlooking “people of colour” in its nominations and urged the industry to dismantle a “system of oppression” in his Bafta acceptance speech.

The actor, who won the best actor Bafta for his portrayal in the title role in Joker, said he felt “conflicted” receiving the award as so many of his deserving fellow actors didn’t have that same privilege.

“I think that we send a very clear message to people of colour that you’re not welcome here. I think that’s the message that we’re sending to people that have contributed so much to our medium and our industry, and in ways that we benefit from,” he said onstage at the Royal Albert Hall.

Both British Academy of Film and Television and Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences were heavily criticised for the lack of representation and diversity after the nominations were announced.

The acting categories had shut out people of colour while no women directors were recognised in the directing segment.

“I don’t think anybody wants a handout or preferential treatment, although that’s what we give ourselves every year. I think people just want to be acknowledged, appreciated and respected for their work. This is not a self-righteous condemnation because I’m ashamed to say that I’m part of the problem,” Phoenix said.

Calling himself “part of the problem”, the 45-year-old actor said more than creating a diverse working environment, the issue at hand was about understanding “systemic racism“.

“I have not done everything in my power to ensure that the sets I work on are inclusive, but I think it’s more than just having sets that are multicultural. We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism.

“I think it is the obligation of the people that have created and perpetuate and benefit from a system of oppression to be the ones that dismantle it. So that’s on us,” he said.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/78dacu/article30725186.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/AWARDS-BAFTA1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/joker-star-joaquin-phoenix-calls-out-film-industrys-systemic-racism-at-baftas/article30725187.ece
176,2020/02/03,"Disney+ debuts surprise looks of ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’, ‘Loki’ and ‘WandaVision’","The Marvel Cinematic Universe is all set to make the transition from big screen to small.

Disney+ excited a plethora of fans across the globe, when it dropped a surprise look at three of its most expected Marvel series during Sunday’s Super Bowl: The Falcon and The Winter Soldier, WandaVision, and Loki.

The Falcon and The Winter Soldier that is set to feature Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson and Sebastian Stan’s Bucky Barnes, also stars the return of Daniel Bruhl as Baron Zemo, who went head-to-head with the Avengers in Captain America: Civil War. He looks to be the villain in the series, as fans still wait to see if Sam will become the next Captain America after Chris Evans relenquished the role at the end of Avengers: Endgame.

‘WandaVision’

There was also footage from WandaVision, which is a sitcom-of-sorts show headlined by Elizabeth Olsen’s Wanda Maximoff and Paul Bettany’s Vision. The show is an experimental take, sometimes goofy, mostly madcap, and the teaser stars Vision in black and white and Wanda in several eccentric costumes. This is a massive departure for the MCU in terms of their programming, as Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige had earlier dropped hints that it could be a ‘comedy show’. But didn’t Vision die at the hands of Thanos in Infinity War? This mystery remains to be resolved.

‘Loki’

“I’m going to burn this place to the ground,” he growls in the teaser, and we certainly can’t wait! Finally, Tom Hiddleston is back to his devilish best as Loki —and boy, have we missed him. Thor’s more interesting brother also met his end thanks to Thanos in the Avengers movies, but this new mini-series will see him in an alternate universe, that will trace the timeline when Loki stole the Tesseract and disappeared, when the Avengers went back in time during Endgame. Much binge-watching awaits.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/dd0ao1/article30725048.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/winter,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/disney-debuts-surprise-looks-of-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-loki-and-wandavision/article30725049.ece
177,2020/02/03,Abhishek Pathri on his parody of ‘Samajavaragamana’ from 'Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo',"What happens when a wife makes the husband do all the chores at home? The frustrated man can only voice his anger and pain through a song; that forms the crux of a new parody of a chartbuster, created by Abhishek Pathri. The song Naa Collar pattuku vadalananadi chude na wifeu... by him is a parody on the hit number ‘Samajavaragamana’ from Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo. Ironically, newly married Abhishek was supported by his wife in this parody in mixing and mastering the audio. So far, Abhishek has created 20 parodies, and loves to act and direct. He has also done a few short films and an independent film Nenena.

Grandson of the legendary film comedian (late) Padmanabham, Abhishek has been in the USA since 2017 and currently works for a family-owned manufacturing company in Michigan. The design engineer considers his family his biggest support system. “I am blessed with a crazy bunch of people who are unveiled superstars,” he says. While his father, Rajasekhar Pathri works as senior sub editor in Nellore (“He is the most joyful and wittiest person alive”) his mother Bhavani, a retired business woman is a naturopathy healer; his sister Neeraja Pathri, a senior engineer in USA anchors and finances his endeavours. He

Tell us about your journey?

My parents enrolled me in Sri Satya Sai Primary school in Puttaparthi. That’s where my talent in acting, dancing and playing instruments was discovered and honed. I performed in the school band, violin groups and dramas. My love for theatre arts began here. Years later, my stint in IITfelt like a pressure cooker with no outlet or opportunities other than academics. That gave birth to my witty streak and I became a popular mimic, so much so that lecturers would stop five minutes before the class ends and asked me to perform a mimicry act.

While studying KL University, Vijayawada, I wrote and performed multiple plays, parodies and received several awards at the college cultural fest, including as the best actor, singer and song performer. I was also a doubles player for the university badminton team.

After graduation, I was picked by Defense Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) as a design engineer. Six months later, my dream to pursue masters brought me to USA.

Was music an interest even in childhood?

I used to tag along with my sister for music classes and learned the basics. We would endlessly engage in music and that’s when I was acquainted and fell in love with AR Rahman and get lost in his songs. I’ve taught myself to play the flute, harmonica and guitar. Now I can play a song on any instrument.

How do you balance work and your passion to sing?

Once I step out of office, I am back to my creative self. It takes a couple of hours to finish a parody but I have to be 100% satisfied before I record it. I send it to my sister and a couple of my friends for honest feedback.

Any memories of your grandfather Padmanabham?

Comedian, producer, director and legend, Basavaraju Padmanabha Rao aka Padmanabham is my maternal grandfather. My interactions with him were during summer holidays. He would give pocket money to buy whatever I want. He was a kind, patient, and playful grandpa. He would answer all my crazy questions and pamper me endlessly. He passed away when I was 19.

Growing up as a child, I didn’t know the magnitude of privilege being his grandson. Now I understand why I see such excitement and enthusiasm from people when they realise my ancestry. I’m super lucky to be his grandson and expereince a moment of pride every time I see him on screen. His legacy is something I wish to continue.

Do you have a dream to act?

I’ve got a few offers from Sivabalaji (actor) and a few others but I know the film industry can be volatile. It’s our collective decision that I embark on it with a good resilience plan in hand. I know I will be regarded as Padmanabhan’s grandson but I believe invitations to act and success will follow my abilities and my talent.

Presently YouTube and Facebook are my medium to publish my work. I have begun writing a full-length comedy script and it should be complete by the end of this year.

How has your journey as a parody lyricist been ?

I have been writing since school days but never got a chance to publish them. Then, at a KLU cultural fest, when I parodied ‘Inumulo hridayam molichene’ (from Robo) as ‘First sem lo o subject egirene’ I became popular in KLU and had my first shot at fame on YouTube.

I have written normal lyrics too, for ETV telefilms and serials Choodu Choodu Tamasha and Aame Evaru directed by ace cameraman Syed Meer. He calls me his aashtana Arudra. I have also written lyrics for private albums.

How do you define your parodies?

My parodies have a theme and the lyrics align perfectly with the tune. My parodies have no vulgarity or profanity, so anyone can sing them. They are not only funny but informative .

My favourite parody is of ‘Yamaha nagari’. I penned the entire song backstage in a span of 15 minutes and rendered it as a tribute to my lecturers and professors at KLU on the farewell day. My dream is to create a parody on Shankar Mahadevan’s ‘Breathless’.

That smile I see on people’s faces when they hear my grandpa’s name, that’s my benchmark. I wish to earn that sort of place in the hearts of people.",movies,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/4z2tvc/article30724633.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym31abhishek1,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/abhishek-pathri-on-his-love-for-parodies/article30724636.ece

179,2020/02/03,"Class V, VIII public exams only for uniform and fair assessment, no need to panic, says School Commissioner","Commissioner of School Education Sigy Thomas Vaidhyan said on Monday that the public examinations to be conducted for classes V and VIII from this year were mainly to have a uniform and fair assessment of learning outcomes of students.

In a statement appealing to parents not to panic, she said that the 40 marks for formative assessment of students will continue to happen at the school level, and only the remaining 60 marks of summative assessment will be done through a common question paper. She said that conducting public examinations for summative assessments by the Directorate of Government Examinations (DGE) was to improve the quality of question papers and to bring uniformity and fairness in assessing the learning outcomes of students.

Ms. Vaidhyan said that while question papers will be set at the State-level, the evaluation of answer sheets will happen at the level of Cluster Resource Centres (CRC) within each district. “The answer sheets will be exchanged between schools within the CRC and evaluated marksheets will be sent to respective schools,” she said.

Since 2012-13, Tamil Nadu has been following the Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation method for students from Class I to Class VIII. This includes 40 marks of formative assessment and 60 marks of summative assessment. While formative assessment is done based on experiments, creating models and unit tests, summative assessment is done through exams conducted at the school, block, or district level.

The statement comes in the backdrop of intensified opposition against conducting of public examinations for Class V and Class VIII.

In a statement on Monday, he said that Archaeological Survey Of India should release its report on excavations in Adhichanallur undertaken 15 years ago in 2004, after due process.

“The report is likely to present surprising facts about Tamil civilisation. Carbon-dating of items excavated has proved that one item was from 905 BCE and another was found to be from 971 BCE. Other circumstantial evidence seem to suggest that Adhichanallur civilization could be 3,500 years old. The report could prove that Tamil civilisation is the oldest one,” he added.

He claimed that the skulls found in the site suggests that Tamil civilization could have performed neurosurgery, though there is no evidence to prove that the civilisation could write yet. Ramadoss said that Adhichanallur excavation suggests that it is much older than the recent Keeladi excavations in Madurai which are believed to be 2,600 years old.

“Despite four excavations, there has not been a definitive report on its findings.

Mansoor Ali was taking a late evening walk at the Government Boys Higher Secondary School’s sports ground, when he was hacked by helmet-masked men on two morotcyles. According to the police, Mansoor Ali was among over 50 walkers in the sports ground.

Mansoor Ali, on finishing his walk had sat on a bench to rest, when two motorcycles bearing some 5 helmet-clad men had come in to the school ground. The motorcyclists encircled the victim and hacked him leaving him with multiple injuries. The incident had stunned the onlookers and caused tense moments in the area. The victim was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

According to the police, Mansoor Ali was involved in real estate and finance businesses. He was in the habit of taking late evening walks on the sports ground. A bid on his life was made in 2014, when he, along with his friend John Basha, a local real estate shark, were kidnapped and held for ransom. This was also done during their their evening walk. Mansoor Ali and John Basha were stabbed multiple times, before the police cracked down on the kidnappers and rescued them.

185,2020/02/03,"Prison Department flags violations by inmates, staff","A circular of the Prison Department, issued by the Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Prisons, has flagged corruption, favouritism and other irregularities in prisons across the State.

DIG Prisons R. Kanagaraj, on behalf of Inspector General of Prisons, sent a circular to all officers of central prisons, district prisons, women prisons and the borstal school in Pudukottai.

The circular said: “It came to the notice of the prison administration that corruption, favouritism to a few and other irregularities are happening in Tamil Nadu prisons, following a discreet enquiry by an appropriate authority. It found that corruption is deep-rooted in prisons and with a motive to gain themselves, a few prison staff demand money from prisoners for providing all facilities inside prisons.”

“Prison staff are abusing their official position for personal gain, the enquiry revealed. Such maladminstration led to the abetment of notorious rowdies and gangsters who indulge in criminal acts beyond the walls, even when they are in prison,” it added. A prison staff in a central prison was found to have close contact with mediapersons and was regularly passing on information about the happenings inside.

Action to be initiated

In another central prison, a male nursing assistant took money from the relatives of a prisoner and smuggled medicines from the prison clinic and sold them to a private clinic.

“A transferred Grade-I warder continues to indulge in irregularities with the help of officers. A district jail superintendent forces the relatives of prisoners to buy groceries, vegetables and pay electricity bills,” said the circular.

A Grade I warder showed caste discrimination inside the prison and a sub-jail superintendent and other prison staff allowed visitors to meet prisoners on holidays.

186,2020/02/03,Teacher held for sexual assault on minor,"The All Women Police Station (AWPS) at Thudiyalur in Coimbatore on Saturday arrested a teacher attached to a government-aided school in a rural area for alleged sexual assault on a minor girl in the staff room reportedly in December last year.

Though the teacher was arrested based on a complaint filed by the father of a class VI student, investigation by the All Women Police Station (AWPS), Thudiyalur, found that the accused had subjected at least seven other students to sexual abuse in the school.

According to the police, the 50-year-old teacher was arrested on Saturday afternoon.

He was the class teacher of class VII.

The girl first told her class leader about the incident. The class leader told her that she too was abused by the teacher. They reported the incident to the class teacher, who asked them to write a complaint and drop in the complaint box.

“Our investigation found that the school authorities reported the incident to officials with the Social Welfare Department and the School Education Department. Officials from both departments conducted an inquiry and six other students — two more from class VI and two each from VII and IX — raised similar complaints against the teacher. The eight students told us that each of them was made to write statement that they did not have any complaint against the teacher.

The school authorities also did not inform these incidents to the parents of the students,” said AWPS inspector M. Meenambigai.

Following the inquiry, the teacher called the class VI student who first raised the complainant to the staff room and allegedly threatened her that she would be given poor marks in examination.

As no action taken on the complaint, she reported the incident to her father and he lodged a complaint against the teacher, who was arrested under Sections 7 (Sexual assault) and 8 (Punishment for sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He was produced before court and remanded in judicial custody.

When contacted, an official from the School Education Department said that an inquiry will be initiated into the incident on Monday. While accepting that the Department was informed about the incident, the official refused to comment on the alleged delay in initiating action against the teacher.

187,2020/02/03,‘Taxpayers’ charter should ensure stability of rates’,"The proposed taxpayers’ charter in the Income Tax Act should include assurances that the government would live up to its commitment and does not suddenly tweak a proposed tax structure or go back on its promise, V. Ranganathan, chartered accountant, said on Sunday at a post-Budget session in Chennai.

‘Tax stability’

“A foreign company has so many options to invest outside India. What they look for is tax stability. Frequent changes and tinkering with tax rates upsets people,” he said.

The programme was organised by Hindustan Chamber of Commerce in association with Rajaji Centre for Public Affairs and Rasika Ranjani Sabha.

Similarly, Mr. Ranganathan said there were several doubts in the minds of tax payers such as whether the new rates announced in the Budget will continue for three years or so.

“There is no restriction on Parliament to change anything. With the new tax rates coming with restrictions, the proposed tax payers’ charter should assure them that the rates will continue for a considerable period of time,” Mr. Ranganathan added.

Mr. Ranganathan welcomed the abolition of dividend distribution tax at both the company and mutual fund levels and said it would now be taxed at the hands of investors.

He termed the call for abolition of dividend distribution tax in some quarters as an utopian idea and said it was a theoretical expectation.

Shekar Kupperi, ANova Corporate Services, said that the Budget looked liked a vision statement and the key was in the blueprint and its implementation.

188,2020/02/03,‘Tangedco can verify captive generation plant status’,"The Tamil Nadu Electricity Regulatory Commission (TNERC) said Tangedco can conduct verification of the captive generation plant status, rejecting a plea of stakeholders that it should be done by an independent agency.

In a recent order, the State regulator laid down the procedure to be followed for verification of the status of captive generating plant (CGP), as per directions of the Madras High Court.

The Centre and the State governments promoted the captive power model to ensure more competition. Under the model, a group of consumers come together and set up plants to meet power requirements, without depending on the State utility or grid.

They can sell the surplus power to the State grid and are excluded from levy of cross-subsidy charges. As per existing norms, the owners of captive power plant need to consume 51% of the power and the remaining can be sold to other industrial users, who are required to own 26% in the captive power plant. Non-compliance with the procedures would result in loss of captive power status and they would have to pay the requisite charges.

“Most stakeholders have objected to the delegation of powers of verification of CGP status of generators to Tangedco. Their request is for determination of captive status either by the Commission or delegating the verification process to an independent agency like the Chief Electrical Inspectorate to Government (CEIG) or to a committee that shall be constituted by the Commission,” TNERC said.

In its response, Tangedco said the number of captive generators and consumers is distinctively high in this State, pointing out that there are about 7,300 generators in captive mode and 3,000 captive consumers. Verification by a third party agency or even by the CEIG would require considerable manpower and training, it added.

The TNERC said the High Court had clearly permitted Tangedco to do the verification.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/tangedco-can-verify-captive-generation-plant-status/article30722162.ece

190,2020/02/03,"Marginal hike in scholarships, says Dalit body","The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights, an independent organisation, on Sunday said that despite uproar from students across India about increase in college fee, the allocation for post matriculation scholarships (PMS) in the Union Budget had only marginally increased.

“PMS has only nominally increased from ₹2,926 crore to ₹2,987 crore. Up to December 2019, only ₹1,731 crore has been utilised. The scholarship schemes have been consistently under funded with limited outreach,” said a release from the organisation.

“In restructuring the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), the schemes for SC/STs are being categorised as the ‘Core of the Core’ but a scrutiny of the budgetary outlays reveals that most schemes have remained stagnant and, at best, is an exercise of incremental budgeting,” it added.

No direct impact

191,2020/02/03,OPS reiterates demand on funds for welfare schemes,"Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam, who welcomed the Union Budget, has reiterated the State government's request to allocate funds for various welfare schemes.

In a statement, Mr. Panneerselvam (also handling Finance portfolio) said that the Union Budget would protect the interests and address the requirements of all sections of society and hence he congratulated the Union Finance Minister.

Listing various features of the Budget such as efforts to boost spending power of the people, tax exemption to new investments, among others, Mr. Panneerselvam said these efforts would help country's economy.

The Deputy Chief Minister referred to the 15th Finance Commission recommendations which allowed more funds to Tamil Nadu from 4.023% to 4.189%. He pointed out that share of Central taxes to Tamil Nadu would be up by 1.8%. ""Besides, the 15th Finance Commission has recommended a special grant to bridge the revenue deficit to Tamil Nadu. We hope Tamil Nadu will get about ₹1,600 crore,” Mr. Panneerselvam said.

Following various efforts made by the Union government for the benefit of farmers in the country, Mr. Panneerselvam, also the convenor of ruling AIADMK, an ally of the BJP, said not just farmers but the entire society was thanking the government.

The AIADMK convenor lauded Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman for having quoted from celebrated Tamil works of Tirukkural and Athichoodi in her Budget speech in Parliament.

192,2020/02/03,"Denial of venue for T.M. Krishna book release: ‘Manu dharma’ mindset to blame, says Thirumavalavan","Days after Kalakshetra Foundation withdrew permission to use its auditorium to release Magsaysay awardee T. M. Krishna's book on mridangam, Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) leader Thol. Thirumavalavan on Sunday charged that it was proof that the country was being ruled by those who had faith in ‘Manu dharma’.

After Kalakshetra Foundation, an autonomous body under the Union Ministry for Culture, cancelled the permission at the last minute, the book release function took place at the Asian College of Journalism (ACJ) in Chennai.

Participating in the release of the book, Sebastian and Sons: A Brief History of Mrdangam Makers, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the author had shed light on the mridangam makers not to evoke pity or sympathy, but to ensure democratisation in society.

“Democratisation alone can reduce the contradictions and confrontations in society and pave way for better understanding between various sections,” he said.

Mr. Thirumavalavan said the relationship between mridangam makers and players was actually a manifestation of the relationship and confrontations in society and history.

Government support

Recalling the request made by the mridangam makers that he should get government support for them as they were not considered for awards and other recognitions, he wondered if this was the status of mridangam makers, what would be the respect enjoyed by those making ‘parai’.

“Parai is the music instrument of the working class and it was the first percussion instrument of humans. All instruments need skin of the cow and the agony in the mind of Palghat Mani Iyer for using the skin has been powerfully captured in the book,” he said.

Mr. Krishna himself said the relationship between mridangam maestro Palghat Mani Iyer and his mridangam maker Fernandes was difficult to comprehend as it was trapped in time.

He brought to the venue mridangam makers from Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and released the book in their presence.

“Criticise the book. If it raises questions in the mind of the reader, the book will serve the purpose,” he said.

Writer Rajmohan Gandhi, who received the copy, said the book was “remarkable and path-breaking” and captured the hierarchical Indian society, which was inter-dependent.

“The top layer needs the bottom layer. In the relationship, there is mutual need for each other. There is also ignorance and contempt at one side and silent indignation on the other side.

193,2020/02/03,Sasikala Pushpa switches over to BJP,"Sasikala Pushpa, a Rajya Sabha member who was expelled from the AIADMK, and whose term in Parliament will end in April, joined the BJP in New Delhi on Sunday.

She was welcomed by BJP leaders P. Muralidhar Rao and Pon. Radhakrishnan during a press conference at the party’s headquarters. Mr. Rao described Ms. Pushpa as a “very aggressive and very vocal leader in Tamil Nadu”.

He added that her induction into the party will strengthen it ahead of the Tamil Nadu Assembly election in 2021.

Ms. Pushpa had earlier served as the Mayor of Thoothukudi and the chief of the AIADMK’s women’s wing.

“Issues facing fishermen were resolved only after the BJP came to power. The BJP is the only party that can address such problems. That is why I have joined the BJP,” Ms. Pushpa said.

In 2016, after she slapped DMK Rajya Sabha member Tiruchi Siva at the Delhi airport, then AIADMK leader and Chief Minister Jayalalithaa summoned Ms. Pushpa and admonished her. It was learnt that the CM had asked her to resign as a Rajya Sabha member.

However, in the Rajya Sabha, Ms. Pushpa claimed that a senior AIADMK leader had slapped her, and her life was under threat. She alleged that she was being compelled to resign as an RS member.

194,2020/02/03,Thanjavur temple gets ready for big event,"With Thanjavur getting ready for the ‘kumbhabhishekam’ (consecration) of the 1,010-year-old Brihadeeswarar Temple or the Big Temple, a debate is on whether the temple, built by emperor Rajaraja Chola I (985 CE -1015 CE), has seen only five such ceremonies so far, as stated by the authorities.

As per the customs of Hinduism, ‘kumbhabhishekam’ is done once in 12 years. According to the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) department, the temple had ‘kumbhabhishekam’ in 1010, 1729, 1843, 1980 and 1997.

“Our information is based on the records we have,” says a senior HR & CE official.

However, R. Nagaswamy, the 89-year-old archaeologist, who has been studying the Big Temple for decades, has a different view. He believes there must have been at least 10 such events.

He asserts that between 17th century and 19th century, there were four ‘kumbhabhishekams’, which, he claims, have been mentioned on inscriptions on the ‘kalasam’ (dome) of the temple’s ‘vimana’ (tower).

“It is part of traditions of Hinduism that when an addition is made to a temple, ‘kumbhabhishekam’ is performed,” he points out.

He goes on to cite that the Amman shrine was built by a Pandya king around 1400 CE; the Subrahmanya shrine by a Nayak ruler in the 16th century and one for Ganesha by a Maratha ruler, Serforji II. The Nayak and Maratha Kings had built Nandi Mandapam and Nataraja shrine. On all these occasions, the temple must have had ‘kumbhabhishekams’, Dr. Nagaswamy says, adding that his account is exclusive of what took place in 1729 and 1843.

Even though other experts broadly concur with him and say that the temple might have had more than five consecrations, they say the available records do not support such a conclusion.

S. Rajavelu, former epigraphist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and now with Alagappa University in the capacity of Adjunct Faculty and Professor at the Department of History, says the available inscriptions and palm leaf manuscripts at the Saraswathi Mahal Library, Thanjavur, refer only to 1729 and 1843.

‘Not credible’

Kudavayil Balasubramanian, former curator of the Library and author of a seminal Tamil book, Rajarajechcharam, and T. Satyamurthy, former Superintending Archaeologist of the ASI and founder-president of the Rural Education and Conservation of Heritage (REACH) Foundation, concede that there are no records, as of now, to establish that more than five consecrations took place.

At the same time, they feel that it does not look credible that no ‘kumbhabhishekam’ had taken place for the temple between 11th century and 18th century.

On April 3, 1980 when the State was under President’s rule, the consecration took place after 137 years. In 1997, it was planned for June 8, but was held the next day (June 9), as a fire broke out at the “yagasalai” on the evening of June 7, triggering a stampede which led to the death of 46 persons and 107 persons getting injured. The next day, M. Karunanidhi, who was the then Chief Minister, visited the temple and comforted the affected families.

Meanwhile, preparations are in full swing for the consecration on Wednesday, says M. Govinda Rao, Thanjavur Collector, adding that Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam and other senior officials of the government are reviewing the arrangements.

The HR & CE official says that in the light of the fire in 1997 ‘kumbhabhishekam’, bursting of firecrackers has been banned as this was the cause for the fire then. Instead of thatched sheds, metal sheds have been erected. The Collector adds that a large number of officials of the Fire and Rescue Services department have been pressed into service.

The official says several departments of the State government, such as the Public Works Department, Tourism, State Archaeology, Art & Culture and Revenue, apart from the Thanjavur Municipal Corporation, have set apart around ₹ 22.6 crore for executing works.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/j3b9q0/article30722132.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/th03templebw,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/thanjavur-temple-gets-ready-for-big-event/article30722134.ece
195,2020/02/03,‘None in T.N. hospitals with symptoms of coronavirus’,"Minister for Health and Family Welfare C. Vijaya Baskar on Sunday claimed that not a single person kept in special isolation wards in hospitals across the State had exhibited symptoms of the novel coronavirus so far.

Addressing the media after taking part in a stakeholders’ meeting with personnel from different departments to discuss the precautionary measures and intensive monitoring being carried out to prevent the spread of the virus, he said 12 persons were currently in isolation wards only because protocol demanded it.

“We have been receiving instructions from the Government of India periodically on the protocol to be followed. Based on that, these 12 persons have been put in isolation wards because of their travel history or possible contact with infected people,” he said. The 12 persons included 10 in Chennai, one in Tiruchi, and one in Ramanathapuram.

Samples collected from 9 of them have been sent for testing. “Four samples were sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune and another five to The King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research. It will take 24 to 48 hours for us to get the results,” the Minister said.

He did not provide information on how many of them were Indian nationals. He argued that specific information regarding these persons, particularly where they were from, may lead to unnecessary panic. “We are fully alert and are taking all possible measures,” he said.

He said 5,543 people who had arrived at (four international) airports in Tamil Nadu had been subjected to thermal screening so far. As many as 799 of them, including 646 who came from China and 153 from neighbouring countries, were being closely monitored, he said. “People from Public Health (Directorate of Public Health and Preventive Medicine) are periodically calling them over the phone to determine if they have any symptoms,” he added.

196,2020/02/03,"AIADMK, PMK responsible for CAA chaos: Stalin","“The ruling AIADMK and its ally, the PMK, are responsible for all the protests, rallies, turbulence, lathi-charge incidents, gunfire and violence (related to the anti-CAA/NRC protests) in the country,” DMK president M.K. Stalin alleged on Sunday.

He launched a signature campaign at Kolathur as part of a wider campaign organised by the DMK-led Opposition to register their protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register.

To divert the people’s attention from the ‘pathetic’ economic situation, the Central government had introduced the CAA, which was detrimental to minorities, especially Muslims and Sri Lankan Tamils, he said.

“Had they (the AIADMK and the PMK) not voted for the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, it would not have been passed. Therefore, people must remember that the AIADMK and the PMK are responsible for all the violence and turbulence,” he said. “Now, the BJP-led Centre wants to implement the NPR and the NRC too. Both the Prime Minister and the Home Minister have shown a dictatorial attitude and are determined to implement all of them, ignoring public protests,” he said, adding, “But the opposition to them is growing. The governments of Punjab, Bihar, West Bengal and Kerala have announced that they will not implement them. The AIADMK government is afraid to take a stand as they know that the government will fall if they oppose the CAA.”

Launching the campaign at Saidapet, CPI leader R. Nallakannu said assaulting students was like attacking the country’s democracy. “Lakhs of people across the country have come together to oppose the CAA, the NRC and the NPR. Many States have declared that they will not implement them. It is a pity that they (proponents of the CAA) have attacked the students of JNU,” he said. He urged the people of the State to come forward and be a part of the campaign.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/leixh6/article30722122.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03DMKSTALINMASSIVESIGNATURECAMPAIGNAGAINSTCAANPRNRC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/aiadmk-pmk-responsible-for-caa-chaos-stalin/article30722123.ece
197,2020/02/03,‘Private companies behind attempts to discredit BharatNet’,"Senior IAS officer Santhosh Babu’s decision to seek voluntary retirement, and his subsequent transfer from the Department of Information Technology, have led to allegations from DMK president M.K. Stalin that the officer had been under pressure to tweak the tender process for the ₹2,441-crore BharatNet project. Mr. Stalin has demanded a probe by the DVAC into the matter. However, Revenue Minister R.B. Udhayakumar has denied any wrongdoing in the project and has alleged that private companies with vested interests are trying to discredit the scheme. Excerpts:

IAS officer Santhosh Babu, who was responsible for implementing the BharatNet project, has opted for voluntary retirement. It is alleged that he took the decision as he was unable to endure the pressure from the government to tweak the terms of the tender...

Mr. Babu has worked in a number of departments. In 2007, when I was made the IT Minister, he was posted as Secretary in my department. I was subsequently shunted out, but he continued in his post. When I became a Minister again, he worked with me again. This cycle has been going on. Now, he has been posted to another department. Whatever has been in practice is now being blown out of proportion.

What about the allegation that he was asked to tweak the tender process?

We suspect that those in the private sector, who thought they could implement the project, are trying to cause confusion because the government is now implementing it. Private companies like SCV (Sumangali Cable Vision, in which Mr. Stalin’s nephew has a stake) are trying to create confusion. When they (DMK) were in power, they tried to curtail Arasu Cable and promote SCV. We suspect they (DMK leaders) are trying to stall the project so that they could privatise the internet connectivity to villages for the benefit of their families.

BharatNet is a Central government scheme. It is a long-term project. For the first time, the government is going to take internet to the villages, just like cable TV. The Centre has issued guidelines. The government’s intention is to ensure that the project is of a high quality and has a long life. We have got the funds only now. Buildings are ready in 12,540 gram panchayats. The laptops that we gave [under the free laptop scheme]…the kids are using them there. If we provide high-frequency internet connectivity to them, it will start a revolution.

But private companies will participate in the tender process, right?

Yes. But overall, the government is going to implement the project. The OFC has to be laid – 35% underground and 65% towerline. We are studying how some States have implemented this.

Mr. Stalin has demanded a DVAC probe...

Only when the tender conditions are fulfilled will the government give its nod. As of now, work has not started; not a single paisa has been given. The responsibility and accountability is on us, right? They (DMK) can say all this only if we had assigned the work to someone and they had not done it properly. Our question is this – Why are you raising such doubts when the project has not been awarded to anyone?

The Leader of the Opposition has also questioned the appointment of a junior officer as Managing Director of TANFINET...

There are junior officers who are talented and ready to take up challenges and succeed. Only if you give them opportunities will you get to know their abilities. The government has confidence in their abilities.

What is your opinion on Mr. Babu’s decision to opt for VRS?

I don’t want to get into this topic. Has the government released any statement on this? Nothing. Has he said anything about this? Nothing. The DMK’s concern is not about the IAS officer but about preventing the government from getting a good name by rolling out this revolutionary scheme.",tamil nadu,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/479lrs/article30722113.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03EGOVERNANCEREVIEWMEETINGRBUDHAYAKUMARSANTHOSHMISRA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/private-companies-behind-attempts-to-discredit-bharatnet/article30722114.ece
198,2020/02/03,"Adichanallur excavation reports submitted a month ago, says ASI","The reports on the excavations at Adichanallur in Tirunelveli district, which have been awaiting publication for the past 15 years, were submitted to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) a month ago.

Confirming this to The Hindu a day after the Centre announced a proposal to set up a museum at Adichanallur, ASI Superintending Archaeologist (Chennai Circle) A.M.V. Subramanyam said, “The ASI’s publication division would examine them and decide on publishing them.”

Retired ASI Superintending Archaeologist T. Satyamurthy, who led the excavations, said two reports had been submitted. “I submitted the second part, and heard that the first part was also submitted recently,” he said.

Welcoming the Centre’s announcement, Mr. Satyamurthy said on-site museums would help in storing the findings at the site. “Unlike in the case of minor sites, the findings at major sites should not be taken elsewhere and should be kept in the same place,” he added. The excavations at Adichanallur were undertaken during 2004-05.

However, Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture K. Pandiarajan (who also handles the Archaeology portfolio) said the ASI had only submitted an interim report and not the final one.

Skeletal remains

When the Tamil Nadu government’s Department of Archaeology attempted to set up a museum at the site, the ASI had objected to the proposal, maintaining that no structure should come up within 200 metres of the site. “Anyway, it is welcome that the ASI will now set up a museum. It should also publish the report soon,” he said.

Though some human skeletal remains were found at the archaeological site, they haven’t been studied yet due to a lack of experts.

Commissioner of Tamil Nadu's Department of Archaeology T. Udhayachandran said the remains were eventually handed over to the Anthropological Survey of India (AnSI). “The study could not be undertaken since there was no physical anthropologist,” he said.

203,2020/02/03,Shopkeepers yet to vacate bus stand to facilitate reconstruction,"The deadline for shop keepers to shut their business to facilitate construction work at the new bus stand in Vellore ended on Friday

The latest order from Vellore City Municipal Corporation stated that the work would start from February 9. But there is no sign of traders vacating the shops to allow the workers to start preparatory works such as making measurements. The traders were making soaring business as usual.

But its a matter to think why they are unwiling to vacate and provide the space for the contractors to begin their work, a social activist said.

The State Transport Corporation officials said that relocation of barricades and re-routing some of the buses are being arranged. Accordingly, buses to Chennai and Tirupattur side would be operated from the eastern side of the bus stand near Selliamman Koil. All other buses will be operated from old bus stand on Anna Salai. But there are no sign of relocating the shops in that bus stand too.

Under the Smart City scheme, the Vellore new bus stand would be rebuilt at a cost of ₹45.61 crore. Vellore City Municipal Corporation has finalised tenders for the same. The work on demolishing the existing shops and floor space were to be started from January 1. The earlier contracts for the maintenance of public conveniences and shops ended on December 31. The shop keepers were asked to remove their stocks before the end of December 2019, to enable the private contractors to commence their work on time.

It was decided to construct a single tier bus terminus with all modern facilities in it.

“84 bus bays including 11 idle bays and eight bays for local bus services, would be provided and a car parking facility near the bus terminus also coming up,” said an official from the Vellore Corporation.

206,2020/02/03,"Laser for erasing tattoos, scars","Deeply etched memories are hard to erase. So are tattoos on the body. A few people who want to remove names of their former partners after failed relationships or marriages, approach dermatology departments in Telangana government hospitals.

Earlier, surgical method was followed to erase tattoos. In a few weeks, laser machines at Gandhi Hospital will be available for the procedure — which costs over ₹ 50,000 in private hospitals depending on size of the tattoo.

Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender inaugurated three forms of laser machines at Gandhi Hospital on Monday. The equipment is used to erase tattoos, for reduction of scars, unwanted hair removal. People who want to join either armed forces or police department too opt for the procedure at the government hospitals.

Senior doctors from the Dermatology, Venereology and Leprosy Department at the hospital said that people who fell out of relationships did approach them for expedited procedure to get ‘de-inked’. Senior assistant professor at the department, Dr M Bhumesh Kumar said that earlier they opted dermal abrasions technique to remove tattoos. This involves administering anaesthesia. The laser machines are adjunct to the methods available for the procedure.

Head of the DVL department, Dr G Narsimha Rao Netha said that private establishments charge ₹ 50,000 to ₹ 70,000 to remove tattoos using laser machines. This will be performed free of cost at the Gandhi Hospital after a few weeks.

“Candidates who were rejected during selection for Armed forces too approached us. We used to perform surgical methods to remove tattoos. Now, laser machines serve as an adjunct. Depending on depth, colours of a tattoo, number of sittings vary. It takes three to four weeks for six sittings. We judiciously select cases for the procedure. Priority will be given to people whose life is affected because of the issues,” Dr Netha said.

Salient features of revised tattoo policy for candidates appearing for Service Selection Board (SSB) interviews details who are permitted to have tattoos, where they are permitted, and non-permissible tattoos. For example, a tattoo with lewd or offensive content or indecent figures fall under the ‘non permissible tattoos’ category.

People who have superficial scars because of acids or burns and want to get it reduced, who want to get unwanted hair removed, too can approach the DVL department. The doctors said that it would take two or more weeks to start offering treatment using the laser machines.

212,2020/02/03,Swarms of locusts spotted in border villages of Punjab,"Swarms of locusts were spotted in two border villages of Punjab’s Fazilka district, prompting the state Agriculture Department to sound a high alert.

Emanating from Pakistan, the swarms of pests — three to four-km-long and one-km-wide — settled at the trees in these border villages on Sunday evening, officials said on Monday.

However, timely action against the attack ensured their elimination, the officials said, adding that no damage was caused to crops.

“Swarms of locusts were spotted at Wareka and Roopnagar villages of Khuian Sarwar block of Fazilka on Sunday,” said Punjab Agriculture Department Director Sawtantar Kumar Airi said, adding that locusts came from the Pakistan side.

As soon as swarms of locusts were spotted near the villages, a team including members from the Agriculture Department and fire brigade was pressed into service to eliminate pests, Joint Director Gurwinder Singh said.

“About 400-500 tonnes of insecticides were used to eliminate the locusts,” Mr. Singh said, adding that boomer and tractor-mounted high velocity sprayers besides fire brigade vehicles were used to control the pests.

The operation started Sunday night and was completed by Monday morning, officials said.

A few days ago, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to raise the issue with Pakistan.

The Chief Minister had warned that any failure to control the pests could lead to serious implications for agriculture production in India, especially in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, which will ultimately hit commodity prices and food security.

Locusts, popularly known as ‘tiddi dal’, were earlier spotted in some villages of Fazilka, Muktsar and Bathinda districts.

Locusts are short-horned grasshoppers.Their appearance in winter months is a new phenomenon.

No crisis after 1962

India has not witnessed any full-blown locust cycles after 1962. However, during 1978 and 1993, large-scale upsurges were observed.

213,2020/02/03,Mukti Caravan mobilising people against child trafficking,"A Mukti Caravan, flagged off here last week, is mobilising people against child trafficking with the focus on generating awareness about preventive procedures in place to combat forced labour, exploitation and sexual abuse of children. The caravan will travel to eight districts of Rajasthan during the next two months.

Led by the child labour survivors, the caravan will reach out to villages and towns prone to human trafficking. The participants will distribute pamphlets and hold discussions with the people at public places and organise activities such as skits, poem recitation and screening of short films with an appeal to take action against trafficking.

Police join campaign

Director-General of Police Bhupendra Singh flagged off the caravan at the iconic Albert Hall Museum here on Friday. The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation (KSCF) and Rajasthan Police have joined hands to run the campaign, which will be joined by the Superintendents of Police in the districts of their jurisdiction.

KSCF activists will also engage with the policemen to sensitise them about dealing with the crimes against children as well as the children in conflict with law. Bachpan Bachao Andolan executive director Dhananjay Tingal said the partnership with police and the anti-human trafficking units would help in the efforts to make Rajasthan a child-friendly State.

The National Crime Records Bureau’s latest report has placed Rajasthan at sixth position in 2018 in terms of victims of trafficking being found. Mr. Tingal congratulated the police for rescuing 137 children of the State from Surat, Gujarat, in December 2019 and said the caravan would serve the purpose of eradicating children’s exploitation.

Helpline number

The caravan will cover Jaipur, Tonk, Bhilwara, Udaipur, Rajsamand, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh and Banswara districts, which are prone to human trafficking. Activists will provide a helpline number to the people for quick action to deal with the instances of child trafficking.

Spreading awareness

Mukesh, a former child labourer rehabilitated at Baal Ashram in Viratnagar, said he had learnt to lead an independent life after being rescued and would spread awareness about the menace of trafficking during the caravan’s journey.

214,2020/02/03,Assam river on fire after crude spillage,"A stretch of a river in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh district burned for two days following the spillage of crude oil from “punctured pipelines”. The fire was extinguished by Monday noon.

Officials of Oil India Limited (OIL), headquartered at Duliajan in the district, said the crude that trickled into the river Burhidihing after midnight on January 31 could have been recovered had the stretch not been set on fire.

OIL as well as the district authorities, however, did not rule out accidental fire in that stretch about 500 metres long.

“Our team specialising in crude oil recovery and damage restoration after any spillage had done its job that very night when one of our central tank pumps had an instrument failure making a valve stop instantly. Almost 99% of the spillage was on land but the rest fell in a leader drain that is linked to the Burhidining,” OIL’s senior manager (corporate communications) Tridiv Hazarika told The Hindu from Duliajan, about 400 km east of Guwahati.

Crude extracted from OIL’s wells in eastern Assam is pumped into the central tank pumps where it is processed and sent to the century-old Digboi refinery on one side and refineries elsewhere in the country on the other.

“Because the valve closed, a reverse pressure was created in the pipelines and crude spilt from resultant punctures in the pipelines in two places. By the time the leakage was identified, the spillage happened in the leader drain which was not noticed immediately at night,” Mr. Hazarika said.

‘Loss minimal’

OIL officials said the crude, if not ignited, would have settled in time for the specialised team to recover and insisted that the loss due to burning of the crude was minimal.

215,2020/02/03,"Mamata comes to Kejriwal’s rescue, calls BJP opportunists","Dubbing the leaders of the Bharatiya Janata Party as “most opportunist” and those encourage “vandalism” and “hooliganism” through their utterances, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday came to the rescue of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by saying the BJP calls “everyone a terrorist when elections are around”.

“What is this? Whenever there is election anywhere, they do this. They say everybody is a terrorist. Who are they then? The biggest nationalist? They are most opportunist,” Ms. Banerjee told journalists at the State Secretariat.

Her remarks come in response to BJP leader and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar’s remark calling Delhi Chief Minister an “anarchist” and a “terrorist”.

Accusing the BJP of delivering any good, either to the nation or to the people, Ms. Banerjee said, “They are only talking like this to encourage vandalism, hoologanism and goondaism, which is not the path of Gandhi, or Netaji (Subhas Chandra Bose), or Sardar Balalabhbhai (Patel) or (B.R.) Ambedkar”.

The Trinamool Congress has urged the people of Delhi to vote for the Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP) and during the day the party chairperson urged the people of Delhi to believe in those “who work for people, rather than in those firing bullets”.

216,2020/02/03,Tejashwi Yadav takes a swipe at Nitish,"Rashtriya Janata Dal leader and Leader of the Opposition in Bihar Assembly Tejashwi Yadav on Monday took a swipe at Nitish Kumar over the Chief Minister hitting the Assembly election campaign trail in Delhi alongside BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. Mr. Yadav alleged that Mr. Kumar is “defending the indefensible” in his speeches while sharing the stage with Mr. Shah, whom he called the CM’s “mahboob”.

“You can’t give an account of your 15-year rule [in Bihar] but you went to Delhi to seek an account of the opposition’s government… this is absolutely defending the indefensible,” said the RJD leader, who is also campaigning for his party candidates in some constituencies of Delhi. The RJD, which is in an alliance with the Congress, is contesting four seats in Delhi.

Mr. Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) is in the fray in two Assembly seats — Burari and Sangam Vihar — as part of the BJP-led NDA alliance, and on Sunday he addressed public meetings in both of them while sharing the dais with Mr. Shah and BJP president J.P. Nadda.

‘Uttering lies’

“Nitish Kumar shared the stage yesterday with his mahboob Amit Shah in Delhi for the Assembly elections and showed his political compulsions, shrewdness and plight despite his best efforts to hide them. He broke all his past records of uttering lies in calling national capital Delhi as a city worse than Bihar,” said Mr. Yadav, reminding the Bihar CM that “crores of Biharis have been migrating to Delhi”.

While claiming that the Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government has failed to perform on all fronts, Mr. Kumar, while making an oblique reference to his Delhi counterpart, said during his speeches on Sunday that “some people have the habit of praising oneself… the government which got the mandate to govern Delhi did nothing on any front in the last five years”.

“If you think infrastructure, healthcare system and education of Delhi are worse than Bihar, then only God can fathom your mental state. You should say in Delhi [rallies] how many factories and companies were set up in Bihar and how many youth got employment there,” said the RJD leader, attacking the Bihar government over its alleged failure on several fronts such as the death of hundreds of children due to AES in Muzaffarpur, sexual abuse of 34 girls at a shelter home in the same city and unprecedented waterlogging in Patna and deaths of several people due to flood and heat strokes.

“Instead of demanding special category status and a special package for Bihar, assistance for flood victims or demanding Bihar’s right in the Central pool [of taxes] from the government, you termed those who are trying to snatch citizenship and change the Constitution as popular and great leaders,” he said.

JD(U) leaders hit back

JD(U) leaders in Bihar wasted no time in hitting back at Mr. Yadav.

217,2020/02/03,Chinmayanand granted bail in Shahjahanpur case,"Former BJP Minister Swami Chinmayanand was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court in the alleged sexual exploitation case of a law student studying in his college in Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.

Mr. Chinmayanand is accused of misusing his authority to seduce or induce the law student to have sexual intercourse with him, among other offences.

The law student who made the allegations against him was granted bail in December in connection with the extortion case against her by Mr. Chinmayanand. A Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi granted bail to Mr. Chinmayanand on a personal bond and on furnishing “two heavy sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned”.

The court also directed that the trial of both the cases — sexual exploitation and extortion — be transferred from Shahjahanpur to a court in Lucknow.

“...the court concerned at Lucknow is directed to take both the cases on priority basis, if possible on day to day basis,” the court observed.

“The police chief of Lucknow is also directed to ensure the security and safety of the law student, her family members and witnesses during the entire trial period by deputing an officer to the rank of Senior Sub Inspector and armed constables,” the court said.

Commenting on the case, the court said, “At this stage it is very difficult to adjudicate as to who exploited whom? In fact, both of them used each other.""

“... at this juncture, this court draws its conclusion that it was a complete matter of quid pro quo but over a span of time the greed for extracting “more”, she along with her accomplices seems to have advanced for hatching a conspiracy against the applicant [Mr. Chinmayanand] and tried to blackmail him for ransom, through the obscenic (sic) video clips recorded by herself,” the court order read.

‘Blurred changes’

The court also said that since the chargesheet in the case was already filed and the “magistrate has already taken cognizance of the offences” it had “blurred chances” of any tampering of evidence at this stage.

While granting bail to Mr. Chinmayanand, the court also observed that the law student was already granted bail so “there is no justifiable reason to deny the bail to the present applicant — Chinmayanand”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/jemz2v/article30729012.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03-CHIN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chinmayanand-granted-bail-in-shahjahanpur-case/article30729013.ece

A few days ago, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh had shot off a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, urging him to raise the issue with Pakistan.

The CM had warned that any failure to control the pests could lead to serious implications for agriculture production in India, especially in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat, which will ultimately hit commodity prices and food security.

Locusts, popularly known as ‘tiddi dal’, were earlier spotted in some villages of Fazilka, Muktsar and Bathinda districts.

Locusts are short-horned grasshoppers with highly migratory habits and voracious feeding behaviour. Their appearance in winter months is a new phenomenon. India has not witnessed any full-blown locust cycles after 1962. However, during 1978 and 1993, large-scale upsurges were observed.

Localised locust breeding was controlled in 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007 and 2010.

Since 2010, the situation remained calm and no major breeding and swarm formation has been reported.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/b2jh4f/article30727662.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/INDIA-AGRICULTURE-ENVIRONMENT-LOCUSTS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/swarms-of-locusts-spotted-in-punjab-villages-threat-neutralised/article30727663.ece
220,2020/02/03,PDP patron Muzaffar Hussain Baig’s utterances unsettle party,"Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) patron Muzaffar Hussian Baig’s recent utterances have left the party unsettled, with other party leaders convening meetings in Jammu to pledge support to “the vision of late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed on the political future of J&K” and “back the leadership of incarcerated president Mehbooba Mufti”.

PDP sources said Mr. Baig’s move to pass a resolution at the party headquarters in Jammu was scuttled by the local leaders on January 30. Mr. Baig was planning on passing a resolution calling for the restoration of Statehood and seeking Constitutional guarantees on land and jobs as under Article 371. However, no senior PDP leader in Jammu agreed to attend the meeting.

Sources said former deputy Chief Minister Mr. Baig, who is insisting on a joint party resolution, intends to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the coming weeks with these fresh demands, even as PDP president Mehbooba Mufti remains behind the bars.

‘Peace with dignity’

Unsettled by Mr. Baig’s move to refashion the party’s narrative, a Jammu-based PDP spokesman told The Hindu that in a meeting held on Saturday, the party resolved to back party founder late Mufti Muhammad Sayeed’s policy of “peace with dignity”.

“The participants expressed full confidence in the leadership of the PDP president Ms. Mehbooba Mufti, resolving in unison to support her each and every endeavour aimed at getting the people out of the cycle of uncertainty and steer the region towards peaceful and tranquil times,” he said.

The PDP leaders’ pledge came just a day after Mr. Baig told The Hindu that the party’s focus will not be self-rule or restoration of Article 370 but “Statehood and Constitutional guarantees on land and jobs” after the Centre’s August 5 decision to revoke J&K’s special status.

‘Individual opinions’

“Dissent and disagreement is a part of democratic spaces. However, individual opinion cannot represent the ideology of the party. Any political stand on J&K post August 5 has to be taken by the party’s Political Affairs Committee (PAC). Till the party president is released and the PAC holds a meeting, all leaders are entitled to have individual opinions,” former legislator and PDP leader Firdous Tak told The Hindu.

Earlier, in January, the PDP expelled ex-legislator Javaid Hussain Baig, nephew of the senior Mr. Baig, for being “part of the parleys that go against the interests of J&K, the official position and core beliefs of the party”. Mr. Javaid Baig had joined hands with ex-PDP leader Altaf Bukhari, who also advocates Article 371-like Constitutional guarantees from the Centre.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/rmcck/article30727615.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04BAIG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/pdp-patron-muzaffar-hussain-baigs-utterances-unsettle-party/article30727616.ece
221,2020/02/03,Woman beaten up and locked inside house in West Bengal’s South Dinajpur district,"A schoolteacher was dragged on the road while she was beaten up allegedly by Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters who wanted to “forcibly” acquire her land for a road in the village.

The incident that took place in Nandanpur panchayat in West Bengal’s South Dinajpur district on Friday came to light when a video of it went viral on the social media. The episode kicked up a storm with the Opposition accusing the TMC of “letting loose goonda raj” in the State. However, the ruling party’s leadership rubbished the allegations as “baseless.”

The woman, identified as a teacher at a government high school and BJP supporter, Smritikana Das, her mother and other family members were assaulted by the group led by panchayat members in Gangarampur block, the police said. So far nobody has been arrested in connection with the incident.

TMC expels perpetrator

A video grab of the purported attack showed Nandanpur panchayat ‘up-pradhan’ (deputy chief) Amal Sarkar and some others involved in the act, the police said. The TMC district leadership on Sunday expelled Sarkar from the party for his alleged involvement in the incident, party sources said.

The video showed that the teacher fell down on the road when the attackers tied her hands and legs, and dragged her for nearly 30 ft while constantly raining blows on her. The assaulters then locked her inside a house belonging to a TMC block level worker. Her sister Soma was also beaten up by the attackers when she tried to rescue her.

The teacher, who was discharged from a local hospital after preliminary treatment, lodged a complaint against Sarkar and four TMC supporters at Gangarampur police station, a police officer said. “We are probing the incident and also talking to eyewitnesses,” he said.

Blame game

According to locals, the panchayat had recently taken up a project to build a road that would pass through the woman’s land, but she was not giving her land for the purpose. The incident triggered a political blame game.

BJP State General Secretary Sayantan Basu said, “These incidents are just a reflection of the goonda raj that has been going on in the state. The TMC has institutionalized hooliganism in the state. Just because the person was a lady teacher, such kind of torture was meted out to her.”

CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty echoed similar views. TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee said action has been taken against the accused and iterated that the party never supports such actions. Several civil society groups are planning to move human rights commission against the incident.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/woman-beaten-up-and-locked-inside-house-in-west-bengals-south-dinajpur-district/article30727144.ece
222,2020/02/03,Chinmayanand granted bail by Allahabad court in Shahjahanpur sexual abuse case,"Former BJP Minister Swami Chinmayanand was granted bail by the Allahabad High Court in the case of alleged sexual exploitation of a law student of his college in Shahjahanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.

Among other offences, Mr. Chinmayanand is accused of misusing his authority to seduce or induce the student into having sexual intercourse with him.

The student who made the allegations against him was granted bail in December in a case of extortion filed against her by Mr. Chinmayanand.

A Bench of Justice Rahul Chaturvedi granted bail to Mr. Chinmayanand on his furnishing a personal bond and “two heavy sureties of the like amount...”

The court directed that the trial of both cases be transferred from Shahjahanpur to a Lucknow court. “...the court concerned at Lucknow is directed to take up both cases on a priority basis, if possible on a day-to-day basis,” the court said.

The Lucknow police chief was directed to ensure the security and safety of the student, her family and witnesses during the entire trial period by deputing an officer of the rank of Senior Sub-Inspector and armed constables, the court said.

The court said, “At this stage, it is very difficult to adjudicate as to who exploited whom. In fact, both of them used each other.” “...At this juncture, this court draws its conclusion that it was a complete matter of quid pro quo, but over a span of time, with the greed for extracting “more”, she, along with her accomplices, seems to have advanced for hatching a conspiracy against the applicant [Mr. Chinmayanand] and tried to blackmail him for ransom, through the video clips recorded by herself.”

The court said that since the chargesheet had already been filed and the magistrate had already taken cognizance of the offences, there was no chance of any tampering with evidence.

It said the student had already been granted bail, so “there is no justifiable reason to deny bail to the present applicant: Chinmayanand.”",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/vvs6uc/article30126873.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE01MINISTER,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/chinmayanand-granted-bail-by-allahabad-court-in-sexual-abuse-case/article30726016.ece
223,2020/02/03,108 Popular Front of India supporters detained in Uttar Pradesh,"In a fresh crackdown on Islamic outfit Popular Front of India (PFI), the Uttar Pradesh police have arrested 108 persons associated with it on charges of allegedly instigating violence during the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) on December 19 and 20.

Last month, 25 persons associated with the outfit were arrested after arson and vandalism in some districts of the State during the protests. This takes the total number of PFI members and associates arrested to 133, as per police.

Out of the 108 persons arrested over the last four days, the maximum arrests were in Meerut (21), Varanasi (20), Bahraich (16), Lucknow (14), Ghaziabad (9) and Shamli (7) and Muzaffarnagar (6). Police also arrested five in Kanpur, three in Sitapur and one each in Hapur, Gonda and Jaunpur.

DGP Hitesh Chandra Awasthi said on Monday the PFI members were accused of instigating people for unlawful activities and promoting “anti-national” activities in several districts.

The Additional Chief Secretary, Home, Awanish Awasthi, said the government was gathering more information about the organisation and its “financial transactions.” It was also taking the support of Central agencies in this regard, he added.

In December last, the police identified PFI members as the alleged “masterminds” behind the arson and vandalism that took place in Lucknow on December 19.

Several people, including Wasim Ahmed, PFI ad hoc committee U.P. president; Mohammad Nadeem, PFI U.P. treasurer, and another member Qari Ashfaq were arrested.

The PFI, however, had denied the charges as “baseless allegations” and accused the police of falsely implicating its associates out of “vendetta”.

While it is yet to respond to the fresh arrests, the PFI on January 31 on the release of its U.P. ad-hoc convenor from jail said the grant of bail to several accused persons “exposed the conspiracy of the State government that continue to put the whole blame of its own law and order failings on the organisation”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/ha0gdp/article30410084.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH26LUCKNOWSECURITY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/108-popular-front-of-india-supporters-detained-in-uttar-pradesh/article30725964.ece

Naveed had claimed that he was in touch with Mr. Rashid, they said.

Mr. Rashid, popularly known as ‘Rashid Engineer’ and leader of the Awami Ithehad Party (AIP), contested as an Independent candidate in the 2014 Assembly constituency from Langate in North Kashmir.

He is at present in judicial custody at Tihar Jail after he was arrested by the NIA on August 9 in connection with a case related to finding of terror activities in the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir.

The officials said the agency would soon approach the court for seeking a production warrant for summoning Mr. Rashid and question him about his association with Naveed alias ‘Babu’, whose full name is Syed Naveed Mushtaq Ahmad.

He is at present under the custody of the NIA till February 6.

225,2020/02/03,Watch | Assam river burns for two days after crude oil spillage,"A stretch of a river in eastern Assam’s Dibrugarh district burned for two days following the spillage of crude oil from “punctured pipelines”. The fire was extinguished by Monday noon.

Officials of Oil India Limited (OIL), which has its headquarters at Duliajan in the district, said the crude that trickled into the Burhidihing river after midnight of January 31 could have been recovered had the stretch not been set on fire.

OIL as well as the district authorities, however, did not rule out accidental fire in that stretch of about 500 metres.

“Our team specialising in crude oil recovery and damage restoration had done their job that very night when one of our central tank pumps had an instrument failure making a valve stop instantly. Almost 99% of the spillage was on land but the rest fell in a leader drain that is linked to the Burhidihing,” OIL’s senior manager (corporate communications) Tridiv Hazarika told The Hindu from Duliajan, about 400 km east of Guwahati.

Crude extracted from OIL’s wells in eastern Assam is pumped into the central tank pumps where it is processed and sent to the century-old Digboi refinery on one side and refineries elsewhere in the country on the other.

‘Damage minimal’

“As the valve closed, a reverse pressure was created in the pipelines and crude spilt from resultant punctures in the pipelines in two places. By the time the leakage was identified, the spillage happened in the leader drain that was not noticed immediately at night,” Mr. Hazarika said.

OIL officials said the crude, if not ignited, would have settled in time for the specialised team to recover and insisted that the loss due to burning of the crude was minimal.

Dibrugarh Deputy Commissioner Pallav Gopal Jha said the fire was extinguished but the administration was upset with the incident. “An expert committee comprising the administration, Pollution Control Board and OIL officials have been monitoring the situation for minimising the environmental damage. “I have sought a report on how the spillage happened and the fire started. Other aspects are also being explored,” he added.

Environmentalists said OIL or any other exploration agency should take a lesson from the accident. “Spillage of crude or processed oil in river bodies threatens aquatic life, which an ecologically delicate State like Assam can ill afford,” said green activist Soumyadeep Dutta.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/q3zk1n/article30725235.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/assamJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/assam-river-on-fire-for-two-days-after-crude-oil-spillage/article30724994.ece
226,2020/02/03,12 killed in accident near Maharashtra village,"At least 12 people were killed and five injured after a dumper truck rammed into an SUV in Jalgaon district in north Maharashtra on Sunday night, the police said.

The accident occurred near Hingola village in Yawal tehsil (450 km from Pune). According to the police, all the victims were believed to be members of a single family. “The family and kin of Prabhakar Narayan Chaudhari were on their way to their homes in Chinchol, Mehul and Nimbol villages after attending a wedding in Chopra when the mishap occurred between 11 p.m. and 11.30 p.m.,” an official from Faizpur police station said.

A dumper truck coming from the opposite direction hit the SUV. The intensity of the collision caused Chaudhari, his wife, and eight others of their kin travelling in the SUV to die on the spot, the official said. Two others succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment.

The deceased have been identified as Chaudhari (60), his wife Prabhabai (in her mid-40s), his son Shivam Chaudhari (19), Mangalabai Chaudhari (65), Sonali Chaudhari (34), Priyanka Chaudhari (29), Ashlesha Chaudhari (28), Riya Chaudhari (29), Sumanbai Patil (55), Sangeeta Patil (40), Sonali Mahajan (34), and the driver of the vehicle, Dhanraj Tayde.

Five others, including a nine-year-old girl, sustained injuries and were taken to hospitals in Jalgaon where they are presently being treated.

The Jalgaon police said the driver of the dumper, Mukund Ganesh Bhangale, who too was injured, was arrested and booked for rash driving and negligence under sections of the Indian Penal Code. A pall of gloom descended upon Chinchol and Nimbol villages as the bodies were handed over to their kin.

This is the second major accident to rock north Maharashtra in little more than a week.

227,2020/02/03,Conservationists concerned over Assam’s shrinking Ramsar site,"Assam’s only Ramsar site has shrunk by at least 35% since 1991, raising an alarm among conservationists on World Wetlands Day on Sunday.

The day marks the date of adoption of the Convention on Wetlands on February 2, 1971, in the Iranian city of Ramsar on the Caspian Sea shore. A Ramsar site is a wetland designated to be of international importance under this convention.

Deepor Beel, a freshwater lake on the south-western edge of Guwahati, was designated a Ramsar site in 2002 for sustaining a range of aquatic life forms besides sustaining 219 species of birds. The beel officially has an area of 4,014 hectares or 15.5 square miles.

The area of the beel was about 6,000 hectares in the late 1980s, hydrological experts said.

“Satellite imagery makes it apparent that Deepor Beel is shrinking fast and since 1991, at least 35% of its water coverage area has declined. This is primarily because the wetland is losing connectivity with small rivers like Kalmoni, Khonajan and Basistha that used to flow via the Mora Bharalu channel,” Bibhav Talukdar of green group Aaranyak told The Hindu.

Expansion of the city, encroachment upon the natural channels through Guwahati and from the hills around and a municipal waste dump at Boragaon almost on the edge of the wetland are factors, he added.

“The government is apparently not worried about the health of this wetland that also sustains a major population of wild elephants from the adjoining Rani Reserve Forest. If it had, the municipal waste dump would have been removed following an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT),” environment activist Rohit Choudhury said.

Mr Choudhury had petitioned the NGT in 2014 for removal of the garbage dump, seepage from which has contaminated part of the wetland. The NGT had a year ago ordered the local administration to remove the garbage dump by December 31, 2019.

Officials of the Guwahati Municipal Corporation and the local development authority said four alternative sites had been identified. But the garbage dump could not be shifted because of opposition from the local people there.

Deepor Beel is not the only wetland that is fragmented and losing its aquatic wealth, green groups said. One of them is Sohola Beel, which continues to be the largest wetland in Kaziranga National Park despite area shrinkage due to siltation.

230,2020/02/03,Citizens’ group praised by Nitin Gadkari on Twitter,"In a move aimed at reducing road accidents, a citizens’ group in Goa has so far painted over 130 speed breakers in the State white to increase their visibility, which has earned them praise from Union Minister Nitin Gadkari.

The group has been carrying out this activity under the #RostoGoa campaign.

‘Blind spots’

Activist Cecille Rodrigues, who is leading the campaign, said, “The speed breakers had turned into blind spots, causing road accidents. The RostoGoa initiative began from my own constituency — Taleigao — and spread to other areas, including Calangute and Baga, which are prominent tourist spots.”

Ms. Rodrigues said the initiative began with a small group of like-minded people. “Later many others joined as the initiative through social media,” she said, adding that she had earlier met with an accident due to a speed breaker.

Mr. Gadkari, the Road Transport and Highways Minister, recently tweeted about the initiative and appreciated the group for its efforts. “Cecille Rodrigues, Seema Chimulkar and Prakash Malani have developed unique road stamp ‘Rosto’ which cautions drivers of blind spots, thus reducing accidents on the road. #RoadSafetyHeroes (sic),” he said in the tweet.

231,2020/02/03,BJP leader Babanrao Lonikar in soup for calling woman tehsildar ‘heroine’,"Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Maharashtra minister Babanrao Lonikar has landed in the soup after an audio clip surfaced on social media in which he purportedly called a woman tehsildar a “heroine”, although he did not take anybody’s name.

While speaking at a function in Karhala village in Jalna district on Saturday, Mr. Lonikar also said a “heroine can be roped in” for a planned farmers’ rally.

The comments invited the ruling Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) ire, with the party saying that his “unacceptable” remarks amount to outraging the modesty of a woman.

However, Mr. Lonikar defended the use of the word saying that ‘heroine’ was not an abusive term, and he meant it as a “leader who does good work.”

In the audio clip of his speech, the BJP leader can be heard saying, “If farmers want an aid of ₹25,000 from the government, then we can plan the biggest rally in Marathwada here in Partur. We can involve 25,000 to 50,000 people in it. If zilla parishad and panchayat samiti members decide then we can have the biggest march in the State in Partur.”

“We can call (former chief minister) Devendra Fadnavis, (former ministers) Chandrakant Patil and Sudhir Mungantiwar. You tell who should be called…We can call a heroine for it. If not, then we have our tehsildar madam as heroine,” he said.

When contacted on Sunday, Mr. Lonikar said, “I have not insulted our tehsildar through my statement. The word heroine or hero is used for a leader who does good work. You can check the dictionary. This is not an abusive word and it does not have a negative meaning,” he said. Mr. Lonikar said he was only planning a rally over the issue of aid to farmers.

BJP spokesperson Shirish Boralkar defended the leader saying he was speaking about development of farmers. “His statement was presented in a twisted manner by the media,” Mr. Boralkar said.

Senior NCP leader and MLC Vidya Chavan criticised Mr. Lonikar for his remarks. “His comments against the woman tehsildar are completely unacceptable and it reflects the BJP’s mentality. Instead of respecting the working women, the BJP leader is bringing shame to them by making comments on their looks,” she alleged.

232,2020/02/03,‘Appoint separate SIT to probe clashes’,"Even as the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government granted yet another extension to the two-member commission set up to probe the causes behind the Bhima-Koregaon clashes, Ambedkarite outfits like the city-based Republican Yuva Morcha (RYM) have demanded that the State constitute a separate special investigation team (SIT) to probe afresh the riots that rocked Maharashtra on January 1, 2018.

Rahul Dambale, president of the morcha, said the very fact that the commission had recently complained to the MVA government of a severe fund crunch confirmed the worst suspicions of Ambedkarite outfits that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, which had set it up, had no wish for the truth behind the riots to emerge.

The RYM has also demanded that Mr. Thackeray’s government immediately direct the Pune Rural Police to file a charge sheet in the case and set up a trial court to probe the role of Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote and Sambhaji Bhide.

“While the inefficacy of the Bhima-Koregaon judicial commission has been proven time and again, we urge the State government to appoint a separate SIT to probe the clashes from scratch while mandating it to submit a report within a fixed period,” Mr. Dambale said while speaking to The Hindu.

On Saturday, the MVA granted the fifth extension to the commission, comprising retired Kolkata High Court chief justice J.N. Patel and former Maharashtra chief secretary Sumit Mullick, which was set up by the Devendra Fadnavis government to probe the incident. Violence broke out in Bhima-Koregaon and the adjoining villages on New Year’s Day in 2018, when lakhs gathered to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the 1818 Bhima-Koregaon battle, leaving one person dead and heightening social tensions across the State.

Mr. Dambale said the commission, whose work was further hamstrung by its lack of resources, had yet to examine several witnesses.

“While the Uddhav Thackeray government is mooting the formation of a SIT to probe the Pune Police’s investigation into the Elgaar Parishad case, the probe into the main clashes at Bhima-Korgaon itself has been ignored. And it is obvious that the two-member commission has made no significant progress even after two years of the violence,” said Mr. Dambale, who claimed to have filed the first affidavit before the commission.

FIRs had been lodged on January 2, 2018 (a day after the clashes) against radical Hindutva leaders Milind Ekbote, who heads the fringe outfit ‘Samasta Hindu Aghadi’, and Sambhaji Bhide ‘Guruji’, founder of the Sangli-based, right-wing ‘Shiv Pratishthan Hindustan’. While Mr. Ekbote is out on bail, Mr. Bhide has never been probed.

Mr. Dambale alleged that the judicial commission had been operating under pressure from the BJP government, which had shielded Mr. Bhide and Mr. Ekbote.

“The RYM had demanded soon after the riots that the government appoint a sitting judge and not a retired judge as part of the judicial panel. Had a sitting judge been appointed, he would automatically have been able to command facilities and the resources necessary to conduct the probe. Furthermore, the present commission can only give recommendations and has no powers to prosecute,” said Mr. Dambale. He also said the commission had done nothing significant despite 500-odd affidavits being submitted in the case, detailing atrocities on Dalits by Hindutva forces in Bhima-Koregaon.

He remarked that the deliberately ‘weak’ nature of the commission offered an insight into the disposition of the BJP, which was determined to protect the orchestrators of the clashes right from the start.

Taking issue with the investigation of the Pune rural police, Mr. Dambale pointed out that neither the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act nor the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, 1999 (MCOCA) was ever applied in the FIRs against Mr. Ekbote and Mr. Bhide registered immediately after the clashes.

“In October 2001, Mr. Ekbote had come under the police scanner in connection with a rioting incident in Saswad and top district authorities had mooted action against him under the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities (MPDA) of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug-offenders and Dangerous Persons Act, 1981. Yet, despite Mr. Ekbote being a repeat offender, even the MPDA was not applied to him by the Pune rural police in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon clashes,” Mr. Dambale said.

Likewise, besides hollow assurances from Pune Rural police authorities, not a single charge sheet had been filed by them in spite of 23 FIRs being lodged by members from Ambedkarite outfits and others in connection with the clashes.

“Only 104 persons among 1,400-odd people identified as the rioters have been arrested or investigated till date by the Pune rural police, which is less than 10% ,” Mr. Dambale said.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/27a9sk/article30722406.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BMBHIMAKOREGAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/appoint-separate-sit-to-probe-clashes/article30722407.ece

234,2020/02/03,Renowned Odia poet Rabi Singh passes away,"Renowned Odia revolutionary poet and freedom fighter Rabi Singh passed away at his residence here at Khapuria on Sunday morning. He was 89 and is survived by two sons and a daughter. His wife had died more than 30 years ago. Family sources said he was ailing for several days.

The poet’s mortal remains were consigned to flames at the Satichoura crematorium here with full State honour. His elder son Pinaki Singh lit the funeral pyre as hundreds of people from different walks of life bade a tearful farewell to the poet, who had immensely contributed to Odia literature and philosophy without any formal education.

Expressing his condolence, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik described Singh as a very talented poet, and a true patriot. State Culture Minister Jyoti Prakash Panigrahi, Culture Secretary Manoranjan Panigrahi and several other eminent persons from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack paid their last respects to the poet.

Recipient of several awards and honours, Singh was conferred with the Odia Sahitya Akademi award and the Ati Badi Jagannath Das Samman also.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/renowned-odia-poet-rabi-singh-passes-away/article30722163.ece
235,2020/02/03,Disconnection drive part of plan to auction discoms: Odisha CPI(M),"The CPI(M) in Odisha has alleged that the proposed disconnection drive to collect dues by power utilities — SOUTHCO and NESCO — from February 16 is part of a plan to auction the two to private companies in the near future.

SOUTHCO and NESCO have taken this decision after a similar measure by the CESU, another power distribution utility of the State. State CPI(M) secretary Ali Kishor Patnaik said, “CESU has already been auctioned to Tata Power. It seems the government wants to please and attract the corporate houses to take over the other discoms — SOUTHCO, NESCO, WESCO — by collecting the arrears before initiating the auctioning process.”

As per reports, NESCO has arrears of over ₹1,526 crore in five north-eastern districts, while SOUTHCO has around ₹1,357 crore dues in eight southern districts. Meanwhile, CESU has collected over ₹61.4 crore and disconnected power supply to 18,730 consumers till January 31.

‘Govt. dues higher’

Odisha CPI(M) has decided to oppose this exploitation. “The government agencies and private companies have large power dues. If the power utilities start harassing the general public by threatening disconnection in stead of collecting dues from the government and private companies, a strong people’s resistance will be built in Odisha,” said Mr. Patnaik.

He also alleged that the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) has failed to safeguard the interests of power consumers. According to State CPI(M), Odisha was the first State to go for privatisation in 1996, but has not learnt from past, while several other States are still not adopting the Odisha model.

The CESU, earlier known as CESCO, was managed by American company AES, which withdrew from the CESCO in 2001. In 2005, OERC cancelled its license but dues could not be collected from AES, said Mr. Patnaik.

In 2015, OERC revoked licences of Reliance Infrastructure which was managing three other discoms. The outstanding dues are ₹2,650 crore, alleged CPI(M) leaders.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/disconnection-drive-part-of-plan-to-auction-discoms-odisha-cpim/article30722147.ece
236,2020/02/03,"End ordeal of IIT-Guwahati professor, urge academics","A group of 42 scholars and academics from across the country have issued a statement expressing concern over the ordeal of Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati (IIT-G) faculty member Arupjyoti Saikia, who was summoned and grilled by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Saturday.

The NIA did not specify why Professor Saikia had been questioned for about four hours. His colleagues suspected it was in connection with the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in December last year.

‘Distressed, concerned’

“We... write in distress and with concern with regard to the ongoing ordeal of... Professor Saikia is one of the country’s most distinguished and respected historians. The author most recently of a landmark history of the Brahmaputra river, he has also written significant works on forest and agrarian history,” the statement said.

“That a scholar of such standing, and a human being of such decency, has been called for intensive grilling by the NIA is deeply distressing. We urge that the NIA treat him with the dignity and respect he deserves, and allow him to continue his professional work unimpeded,” the statement added.

Among the scholars and academics who signed the statement are Dr. Ramachandra Guha, Professor Niraja Gopal Jayal, Professor Pratap Bhanu Mehta, Professor Geetha Venkataraman, Professor Nandini Sundar, Professor Nayanjyot Lahiri, Dr. Janaki Nair and Dr. Raziuddin Aquil.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/end-ordeal-of-iit-guwahati-professor-urge-academics/article30722136.ece
237,2020/02/03,Tribal leader Mahato released from jail,"One of West Bengal’s most significant leaders, Chhatradhar Mahato, who emerged from non-mainstream politics and led a successful people’s movement, was released from jail on Saturday.

He immediately left for his home town in Lalgarh, on the Bengal-Jharkhand border, the epicentre of the Maoist movement a decade ago.

Life imprisonment

Mr. Mahato, the main leader of the People’s Committee Against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), was arrested in 2009 for building up a movement against the Communist Party of India (Marxist) with the help of the outlawed Maoist party.

He was convicted in 2015 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Opposing police excesses in Jhargram district, Mr. Mahato led a predominantly tribal movement, which catapulted him to prominence. At one point, he allegedly coordinated with the Maoists on one hand and the Trinamool Congress leaders on the other, to build resistance against the CPI(M) government.

The movement flagged alleged atrocities committed by the local CPI(M) leaders over the years and the high-handed approach by the administration. Eventually, Mr. Mahato was arrested but the CPI(M) was also defeated in the area.

Despite being in jail, Mr. Mahato contested in the 2011 Assembly polls and bagged nearly 20,000 votes, which “was an indication of his popularity in Jangalmahal”, Mr. Mahato’s wife Niyoti told The Hindu in 2016.

After Kishenji’s killing

However, following his arrest and killing of Maoist leader Mallojula Koteswara Rao (Kishenji), the people’s movement in Bengal’s western districts fizzled out.

Meanwhile, the TMC also partially lost its grip in the backward tribal areas of Jhargram and Purulia.

In the panchayat polls of 2018, the BJP bagged 42% and 33% seats in Jhargram and adjacent Purulia respectively, far higher than its State-average of 18%. In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, the TMC lost both the seats to the BJP and even the adjacent ones, partly dominated by the tribals.

“In this context, many believe that Mr. Mahato can play a significant role in the area. He may form a new party which can pull a percentage of anti-TMC tribal votes, which went to the BJP in the last elections,” said a CPI(Maoist) sympathiser.

However, it would depend on Mr. Mahato’s crowd pulling ability and “no one knows if he still is as popular as he was at the time of his arrest”.",other states,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/iop6sf/article30722128.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE03CHATARDHAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/tribal-leader-mahato-released-from-jail/article30722129.ece
238,2020/02/03,Jiddu Krishnamurti’s life - an unusual portrayal,"“Truth is a pathless land,” said Jiddu Krishnamurti, sage, philosopher, thinker and the man who spoke nearly a million words in a lifetime that spanned 90 years and three continents. And yet, it is the sandy path that weaves between trees and shrubs that many will walk this week to reach Vasanta Vihar to understand his version of the Truth.

The white colonial bungalow, tucked away in a leafy, quiet corner of Chennai is where Krishnamurti lived, held talks and discussions on the meaning of life for nearly five decades. It is a repository of his thoughts and the venue for ‘The First Step is the Last Step’ — an exhibition, curated walks, a music concert and book launch that are part of the year-long celebrations that began last May, to mark Krishnamurti’s birth anniversary.

Krishnamurti, a tall, striking figure, was born at the end of the 19th Century in Madanapalle and ‘discovered’ by theosophist Charles Leadbeater on the banks of the Adyar. Raised under the tutelage of Annie Besant (Vasanta Vihar, built in the 1930s was named for her) and Leadbeater, Krishnamurti travelled to England with his brother to be educated and gave his first public speeches during the First World War. His public orations that touched upon life, education, love, religion and the discovery of the self, were to roll like a juggernaut until his death.

On the words chosen to be highlighted at the exhibition, SP Kandaswamy, secretary, Krishnamurti Foundation India, that is headquartered at Vasanta Vihar, says, “A few years ago, the worldwide foundations of Krishnamurti decided that the teachings should be made available to everyone; they are available on the Foundation’s website and on YouTube. So, in that sense, the material for the exhibition is available in the public domain. However, it is the curation and the presentation of this material — text, photographs, audio clips and videos painstakingly archived from across the world — which has been the primary endeavour of the exhibition.”

The exhibition draws its title from Krishnamurti’s dialogue with Pupul Jayakar in 1970 in which he first used the phrase, underlining that the transformation of the individual does not lie in time-indexed practice but in an instant and total perception of the truth, that is available to anyone willing to see it.

Conceptualised and designed over two months by Miti Desai, materiality has been a very important element of the exhibition that also travels to Varanasi and Bengaluru. “I have worked with the use of transparency through cloth and acrylic; offsetting that with bamboo and wood and finally detailing concepts metaphorically through the use of ropes, mirror and water. All the materiality has manifested through different dimensions of engagement,” says Miti.

The exhibition is scattered across Vasanta Vihar’s stately building and its shaded grounds and is conceptually visualised in four spaces —The Voice, The Life, The Teachings (which has seven themes in it) and The Study.

“It’s hard for me to pick, but I would say my favourite are two: The Voice — because of its experiential aspect that reveals itself through the grandness, interactive element and the intervention of sound and light — and Death in The Teachings. I am drawn to it because of its simplicity of conception — the rope going through all seven panels, symbolises the umbilical cord. Finally, the last panel on the door is also the exit. The most difficult to conceptualise was Love. I hope to assimilate that kind of spatial integration in the other venues too,” says Miti.

At Vasanta Vihar February 7, 6 pm: Music of the Mystics, a public concert by Monali Bala and Vedanth Bharadwaj.

February 8, 5.30 pm: A curated walk with designer Miti Desai to help the viewer understand the exhibition design process.

For details, write to rajesh.aalaap@gmail.com

The exhibition winds its way past a grand wooden staircase, a terrace bordered with bougainvillea, the study, up and down iron steps and a cement floored hall. It encompasses Krishnamurti’s life in a series of striking photographs from child to man, his work and words of many decades that leap out to grab your attention from aesthetically displayed cloth panels, and finally comes to fruition under a wild badam tree that dominates the landscape.

Here, from its branches that lance the sky, under which Krishnamurti addressed those who sought him, hang ropes with tiny placards of his quotes. When you stand under it you can hear The Voice.

The exhibition is on till February 8 at Vasanta Vihar, 124, Greenways Road.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/k1hmum/article30726279.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04mpjidduJPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/jiddu-krishnamurtis-life-through-an-unusual-exhibition/article30726280.ece
239,2020/02/03,Rare tribal rugs from Central Asia on display at a Chennai exhibition,"“Rug collection for me is a kind of a helpless obsession. My house is filled with rugs from the villages of Central Asia and the Caucasus mountains, yet my journey continues,” says Danny Mehra, curator of rare tribal rugs for the past 25 years. The collector was in the city to showcase his collection last week at The Folly, Amethyst.

“Each carpet you find here is the unique creative expression of the woman who had woven it. The design has been imagined by her and it cannot be replicated. The art is abstract, spontaneous and naïve,” explains Danny.

He talks about how the ethnographic context in which these carpets were made is now nearly extinct. “The soul is gone. Some communities over there are involved in the revival process, which is why I think these are precious.”

He has also created an art display by mounting remnants of carpet trimmings on canvas. Over the years, as the rug fragments came in from around the globe, they needed some repair and conservation work, and damaged parts cut off. His wife Renuka and her artist friend Mohua Roy decided to mount the remnants on canvas with a colour-coordinated background.

“So much work had gone into the making of these rare and antique rugs, it was difficult to just discard the pieces, and I am glad these pieces can now be preserved as artefacts for a longer period,” he says.

“Most of my carpets have found a home in Chennai. Sometimes, I do visit these homes to see how they are maintained. Buyers send photos of how they have displayed it in their homes,” he says, adding with a chuckle, “When a buyer has made up his mind to buy one of my collections, I give them 20 reasons why they should not buy.” He says he does this to make sure they understand how to conserve it. Then admits, it is also because he finds it hard to part with it.

240,2020/02/03,The works of artist Roshan Sahi mirror his take on Nature,"Bright colours occupy almost all of Roshan Sahi’s canvases where landscapes are depicted in fluid, and sometimes, abstract form.

“I believe that by exploring the landscape in this way, one also sees a reflection of themselves. Your emotions and imagination are reflected in the way you see a landscape and how you find ways of expressing it,” says Roshan.

Having spent the early years of his childhood on the outskirts of Bengaluru, in surroundings devoid of urbanisation, Roshan has been blessed with a rare perspective of Nature at her untarnished best.

While a lot of his work depicts the countryside by day, there are a few which seem to capture eventide. According to Roshan, “Colours emerge from darkness, they are actually different shades of darkness. Some of my work also has to do with the seasons as well as the emotions I experienced while being present at that particular scenic location.”

For Roshan, his abstracts are an expression of his experiences. “They could be manifold, not just one perspective. I believe you could enjoy an infinity perspective born out of exploring one’s sense of being during the time spent at that beautiful spot.”

The canvases on display are the work he has done for over 10 years. Apart from oils, Roshan also works with other mediums, constantly experimenting with texture and form, not just as an artist but an educator as well.

“I believe art is an integral part of the learning process and I am interested in the idea of how craft can not only be leisure or work, but also a way of learning,” says Roshan who has been involved with incorporating art into the curriculum of government schools since 2005.

While the idea might seem farfetched to some, for Roshan, art is a way of exploring the environment with locally available supplies. “The use of mud — not just for pottery — but as a pigment to paint. Then, there are stems and seeds you can crush. One should learn to localise material; the landscape is constantly changing and it pushes you to find a connection. So, you can't just give up,” says the artist.

Art by Roshan Sahi is on display at The Courtyard, KH Road, till February 6.",art,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/mjyl93/article30724818.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/Roshan2JPG,https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/an-infinite-perspective-of-the-world/article30724823.ece
241,2020/02/03,National weightlifting championships | Jhili Dalabehera pips Thushmita for 45kg title,"Jhili Dalabehera shrugged off her last year’s disappointing performance to claim the women’s 45kg title on the opening day of the National weightlifting championships here on Monday.

Jhili, a former World junior bronze medallist who had crashed out of the medal contention after returning three ‘no lifts’ in the last edition in Visakhapatnam, totalled 160kg and managed to beat her Railways teammate M.V. Thushmita.

Jhili recorded a ‘no lift’ despite hoisting 71kg in her final snatch attempt for an identical 69kg with Deepali Gursale of Maharashtra. With Deepali failing to impress in clean and jerk, the title race eventually remained between Jhili and Thushmita.

Jhili could not lift 93kg in her final effort, while Thushmita tasted success for the same weight. Nevertheless, Jhili walked away with the crown to celebrate her 21st birthday.

Shubham Kolekar of Maharashtra defeated an experienced Gururaja of Services to win the men’s 61kg crown.

Gururaja was full of confidence after bettering his National record of 118kg in snatch by one kg in his second attempt.

Both Kolekar and Gururaja did 152kg in their second clean and jerk effort before the Maharashtra lifter opened up a lead with a record performance of 157kg and new record aggregate of 272kg.

In his final appearance, Gururaja tried 157kg in vain.

Youth Olympics gold medallist Jeremy Lalrinnunga overcame two ‘no lifts’ in snatch to emerge as the men’s 67kg champion.

The results: Men: 55kg: 1. Sanket Sargar (Mah) snatch 108kg [NR, Old 106kg, R. Madhavan], clean and jerk 135kg [NR, Old 134kg, Shubham Todkar], total 243kg [NR, Old 241kg, A.Gunasekar]; 2. A. Gunasekar (RSPB) 106kg, 135kg, 241kg; 3. Ch. Rishikanta Singh (Mani) 106kg, 133kg, 239kg.

242,2020/02/03,"Domestic game has evolved big time, says Parthiv Patel","At 34, he is a veteran of 191 First Class matches, including 100 in Ranji Trophy, but Parthiv Patel yearns for “perfection” as a cricketer who “performed” when the team most wanted him to. “Not that I have not made some winning impacts but not to the extent I had desired,” said the genial wicketkeeper-batsman from Gujarat.

Parthiv made his Test debut a good two years and two months before he figured in his first Ranji Trophy match in November 2004 at Ahmedabad. “I remember the match vividly. We should have won that match against Delhi. I played against some established players on the circuit like Ashish Nehra, Aakash Chopra, Ajay Jadeja, Gautam Gambhir, Mithun Manhas, Amit Bhandari, Sarandeep Singh, Vijay Dahiya. Delhi was 102 for nine chasing 156. We almost won. It was a good start to my career.”

Recalling his journey, Parthiv pointed out the progress made by Gujarat from the time he made his debut. “The Ranji Trophy title (2017) by beating Mumbai in the final was unforgettable. It showed the status of cricket in Gujarat. We had evolved as a team and to become the champion was very special indeed.”

Parthiv shared his experience of playing domestic cricket.

“It has evolved big time since I have started. The matches have become very competitive. To sustain as a performing team for two months is hugely challenging. The travelling, different playing conditions, pitches make the process a great experience to grow up with. Thanks to the domestic structure, you can see how well the Indian team is performing in all formats of the game. I feel proud of being part of this system.”

On his role in the team, Parthiv noted, “My role is to guide the players in the right direction. I know I have to play the part of a senior but I don’t impose myself. All these years I’ve learnt that it is best if you become one of the team and not bask in what you’ve done. That’s what I’ve always believed in.”

His 100th Ranji Trophy match came last week against Vidarbha. Gujarat won the game with Parthiv making 58 as opener and an unbeaten 41 at No. 7 to finish the contest. “It was a special moment,” said Parthiv, who will, however, miss the match against Delhi starting here from Tuesday.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/hwv09p/article30729119.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04PARTH,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/domestic-game-has-evolved-big-time-says-parthiv-patel/article30729120.ece

245,2020/02/03,Ranji Trophy | Delhi desperately needs a win,"A desperate Delhi returns to home turf in search of a win against an in-form Gujarat and stay alive in the hunt for a place in the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy cricket here.

As things stand on the eve of this key-clash, Gujarat (26 points from six matches) is placed second, behind Andhra (27). Delhi (17 from six) is ninth and faces a must-win situation in what is the penultimate clash for these teams in the league.

Delhi emerged victorious in both its previous home encounters. But what has hurt the host is the addition of just five points from four outstation engagements.

Prove a handful

Gujarat, having won its last two matches, could well prove a handful for Delhi, which is without an injured Ishant Sharma and utility-man Lalit Yadav.

Even without Parthiv Patel, who scored just 159 runs in eight innings spread over five matches, Gujarat looks formidable considering the form of Bhargav Merai (399 runs from 10 innings) and Priyank Panchal (344 from nine). In addition, Manpreet Juneja (268) and Samit Gohel (256) have done their job.

Among the bowlers, left-arm medium pacer Roosh Kalaria (24 wickets), medium-pacer Chintan Gaja (22) and left-arm medium pacer Arzan Nagwaswalla (20) have played their part in Gujarat winning four out of six matches. This week, the trio could again make the decisive difference in conditions conducive to fast bowling.

Maximum damage

Similarly, Delhi will expect Simarjeet Singh (21 wickets), comeback-man left-arm medium pacer Kulwant Khejrolia and young all-rounder Kunwar Bidhuri (7) to cause maximum damage.

Delhi overly relies on Nitish Rana (467 runs), skipper Dhruv Shorey (276) and Kunal Chandela (273). Unless more batsmen apply themselves, Delhi cannot complete a much-needed win.

“I expect at least two batsmen from Delhi top-order to bat long,” said coach K. P. Bhaskar and continued, “after all, we are desperately seeking a win. Unless we give our bowlers enough runs to bowl out the opposition twice, we cannot advance. The boys are keen to win the last two matches. We hope for the best.”",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/qhxgg9/article30727599.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04RANA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/delhi-desperately-seeking-a-win/article30727600.ece
246,2020/02/03,Injured Rohit Sharma out of remainder of New Zealand tour: BCCI source,"In a blow to India, batsman Rohit Sharma was on Monday ruled out of the upcoming ODI and Test series against New Zealand after sustaining a calf injury during the fifth T20 International in Mount Maunganui.

Rohit retired hurt after scoring 60 off 41 balls after he pulled his calf muscle while going for a quick single during the match that India won on Sunday.

“He is out of the tour. Right now, it’s not looking good. The physio is assessing him. We will get to know how bad it is but he is not taking any further part in the series,” a top BCCI source told PTI on conditions on anonymity.

India are set to play three ODIs, starting Wednesday, and two Tests after that.

Going by the pecking order, Mayank Agarwal is likely to be the reserve opener in the ODI format just like during the home ODIs against the West Indies. However, Shubman Gill, with a double-hundred in the ongoing A series Tests against New Zealand A, is also back in the mix.

The old selection committee under MSK Prasad will be announcing the replacement but it might take some time as convenor of the selection committee, secretary Jay Shah, is on his way to New Zealand along with treasurer Arun Dhumal.

“Once the secretary’s approval comes, the replacement will be announced,” the source added.

In the Tests, the experienced KL Rahul could well be back donning the India whites while Gill and Prithvi Shaw are likely to fight for the reserve opener’s slot.

It has still not been ascertained whether Rohit has had a calf muscle tear but he looked in severe pain even after physio Nitin Patel attended to him.

Despite pain, smacked a six off Ish Sodhi but had to be replaced after it became unbearable for him.

Rohit’s injury is a big blow to the Indian team especially after his stupendous show across formats in 2019.

He continued his match-winning efforts first against Australia at home followed by two fine knocks in the recently concluded T20 International series against New Zealand, which India won 5-0.

247,2020/02/03,Bangladesh’s Tamim Iqbal tunes up for Test comeback with record domestic triple-century,"Tamim Iqbal warmed up for his Test comeback with a triple-century on Sunday -- the highest first-class score ever recorded on Bangladeshi soil.

The left-hander became only the second Bangladeshi to score a triple ton while smashing an unbeaten 334 for East Zone against Central in the Bangladesh Cricket League.

He overtook former Under-19 teammate Roqibul Hasan’s 313, before surpassing Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara’s 319 -- against Bangladesh in a Test match in 2014 -- to also chalk up the highest individual innings in Bangladesh.

“This is really a special feeling. Everyone has a dream, but I never thought that it would come in this match,” Tamim told reporters after his innings.

“Scoring 300 is always difficult against any opposition at any level. If it was easy, you would see someone scoring 300 every month.

Tamim could not have timed his record innings better, as he is preparing to return to Test cricket after skipping Bangladesh’s previous three matches, against Afghanistan and India.

He took a break from international cricket after a dip in form, and also opted out in November to be with his expectant wife.

Bangladesh’s top run-scorer in all three formats, Tamim struggled at the World Cup in England last year scoring just 235 runs in eight innings at an average of 29.37.

He was later made interim captain for a three-match one-day series in Sri Lanka in the absence of injured skipper Mashrafe Mortaza, but the leadership role failed to bring out his best and he scored just 21 runs in three matches as Bangladesh lost 3-0.

Tamim, named in the Bangladesh squad for the first Test against Pakistan in Rawalpindi from February 7-11, returned to domestic first-class cricket to prepare for the top flight.

“The wicket was very good. There was no spin and the wicket didn’t behave differently,” he said.

Tamim was given a guard of honour by his teammates as he returned to the dressing room, and the Bangladesh Cricket Board also hosted a small ceremony to celebrate his knock.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/94l1m4/article30725591.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TAMIMKB,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/bangladeshs-tamim-iqbal-tunes-up-for-test-comeback-with-record-domestic-triple-century/article30725592.ece
248,2020/02/03,U-19 World Cup | Fancied India meet Pakistan in first semifinal,"Four-time champions India will back themselves to reach their third successive final at the Under-19 World Cup when they face arch-rivals Pakistan in a last four clash here on Tuesday.

Both teams go into the semifinal unbeaten. While India beat Australia in the quarterfinals, Pakistan outplayed Afghanistan.

Pakistan captain Rohail Nazir played down the hype surrounding the game but an India-Pakistan contest is always a high-pressure one which tests the character of players on either side. Doing well in the game makes them overnight stars and the players know that.

“It is a high pressure game and has a lot of buzz in the world. We will play it like a normal game and hope to do well,” said Pakistan opener Mohammad Huraira after the win over Afghanistan.

Like at the highest level, the India juniors have had the upper hand over Pakistan of late, having beaten them in the Asia Cup last September when they emerged tournament winners.

India, who are the defending champions of the U-19 World Cup, had inflicted on Pakistan a 203-run hammering in the last edition in 2018.

However, history counts for little and the Priyam Garg-led India will have to play their best cricket to knock Pakistan out of the competition.

Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has been the backbone of India batting, scoring three half-centuries in four games including against Australia.

The rest of the batsmen have not done much to write home about and if the lower-order had not rescued India in the quarterfinal, the outcome of the game could have been different. Not to forget the match-winning spell from pacer Kartik Tyagi.

Atharva Ankolekar and in-form leggie Ravi Bishnoi shared a 61-run stand for the seventh wicket to give their team a fighting chance. In the end, India won rather comfortably.

Facing Pakistan fast bowlers Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Amir Khan and Tahir Hussain will be a challenge for the Indian batsmen.

Opener Huraira made an impressive debut in the last game, scoring 64 to lead his team to a comprehensive win over Afghanistan after the bowlers nicely set up the game.

249,2020/02/03,Kohli’s India reminds me of Pakistan under Imran Khan: Manjrekar,"Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar on Monday said Virat Kohli’s India reminded him of the Pakistan team under Imran Khan for their strong self-belief and ability to win matches from the jaws of defeat.

“India under Virat in NZ reminds me of Pakistan under Imran. Strong self belief as a team. Pakistan under Imran found different ways of winning matches, often from losing positions. That only happens when the self belief is strong,” Manjrekar tweeted.

The cricketer-turned-commentator expressed his opinion after India completed a rare 5-0 whitewash with a seven-run victory over New Zealand in the final T20 International in Mount Maunganui on Sunday.

Manjrekar also lauded KL Rahul, now also shouldering wicket-keeping duty, for his impressive showing in recent times.

“Find of the T20 series in NZ for me is the ‘batsman keeper’ K L Rahul. Absolutely brilliant!

“Samson & Pant... the next batting brigade of India obviously have the skill & the power game they just need to infuse a small dose of Virat’s batting ‘smarts’ (mind) into their game,” Manjrekar wrote.

The victory at the Bay Oval saw India stretch their record for most successive T20I wins.

This was their eighth win in a row, bettering the previous three instances when they won seven successive matches.

250,2020/02/03,Umar Akmal faces sanctions for misbehaving during fitness test: Report,"Pakistan’s out-of-favour wicketkeeper Umar Akmal could face disciplinary action after he reportedly asked a trainer “where is the fat” while exposing himself completely during a fitness test.

The matter has been reported to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and according to an ESPNcricinfo report, they are fully aware of the incident that took place at the National Cricket Academy and are looking at potential punishments for bringing the game into disrepute.

The junior Akmal, who is reported to have exposed himself in frustration after failing to pass one of the fitness tests, is now faced with the prospect of being banned from the country’s next domestic tournament.

He is said to have asked a staff “bataye charbee kaha hain (tell me where is the fat)“.

Fitness has been an issue with the Akmal brothers for several years now with Umar falling out with the PCB on the same grounds during Mickey Arthur’s time as head coach.

This comes at a time when the PCB, under the stewardship of former captain Misbah-ul-Haq, has pledged its commitment to maintaining high fitness standards not just in international but also in domestic cricket.

As per Misbah’s instructions, each provincial side is required to regulate fitness tests on a quarterly basis.

Umar’s elder brother Kamran, who himself skipped two fitness tests, before failing in nearly all departments when he finally did take one, said the incident at the NCA was simply a “misunderstanding”.

Once seen as a bright prospect, Umar scored a century on Test debut against New Zealand in 2009, and remained a regular feature for some years until poor form and fitness led to him being dropped in favour of Sarfaraz Ahmed.

In 16 Tests, Umar made 1003 runs with one century and six fifties. While in 121 ODIs, he has 3194 runs with two centuries — the best being 102 not out.

In 84 T20 Internationals, Akmal has made 1690 runs with the highest score of 94 and eight half-centuries to his name.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/4vd6ku/article30724607.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/THNAKPAKISTANAKMALSUSPENSION,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/umar-akmal-faces-sanctions-for-misbehaving-during-fitness-test-report/article30724608.ece
251,2020/02/03,Little nuggets from Sunil’s diary,"How many of you knew about M.S. Dhoni’s passion for Hindi film music and his ability to sing them in a clear, crisp and nuanced manner?

Sunil Subramanian, the Indian team administrative manager from August 2017 to September 2019, recalled several nuggets from his tenure during a conversation with The Hindu here on Wednesday.

Sunil travelled back to a memorable night that stretched well into the early hours of the morning.

It was December 2017 and India, reduced to 29 for seven, had been given a hiding by Sri Lanka in the Dharamshala ODI.

It was biting cold in those parts then, and the team sat around a bonfire around 8 p.m. to keep themselves warm and lighten the mood.

Sunil remembered, “Gradually, we started to play antakshari of Hindi film songs, where a new song had to be sung from the last letter of the previous song.”

And the antakshari went on and on. And Dhoni, as he does so often on the field of play, assumed centrestage.

Astonishing

Sunil said, “Dhoni’s knowledge of Hindi film music was astonishing. He sang songs from the 60s, 70s, 80s and the 90s. In fact, he even rendered a few numbers from the 50s. Kishore Kumar, Mohammed Rafi, Mukesh, you name it.”

The former Tamil Nadu and South Zone left-arm spinner added, “His voice was profound and stood out. He sang with passion and heart. Dhoni sang very well.”

The antakshari was so engaging, and Dhoni’s singing so engrossing, that it went on till 2 a.m. Mentally, the pain of the defeat had been erased. The Indian team was fresh again, and went on to win the series.

And Sunil, during his two-year tenure, recalled many instances when coach Ravi Shastri lifted the morale of the players.

“Ravi was ruthless about the performances on the field. Off the field, he understood the temperament of every cricketer and knew how to deal with and what to say to each one of them. His man-management was exceptional.”

Sunil recollected, “India was playing Australia at the Eden Gardens in 2017. Somehow Kuldeep Yadav seemed uncomfortable on the field that day. He appeared to be having the weight of the team on his shoulders.”

Transformation

He added, “Then Kuldeep came to the dressing room for a rub from Patrick Farhat. Then, Ravi walked to Kuldeep and said, ‘Put your collar up and bowl out there. You are going to win the match for us.’ The words boosted Kuldeep. He went back to the field and achieved a hat-trick.”

And Sunil said Rishab Pant’s laugh should be patented. “It is unique. It is shrill with a tune.”

Those were the days and times that would forever be etched in Sunil’s memory.",cricket,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/pz6r0p/article30720772.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02DHONI,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/cricket/little-nuggets-from-sunils-diary/article30720774.ece

253,2020/02/03,Waste from commercial firms set on fire in corporation limits,"Waste from commercial establishments and power looms continue to be dumped on roads and set on fire causing environmental pollution in many parts of the corporation limits as residents want strict action to be taken against the violators.

Conservancy workers are involved in door-to-door garbage collection from houses and commercial establishments in all the 60 wards in the corporation. The corporation has also inducted more garbage collection vehicles to expedite the process of making the city free of dustbins on roads by the end of this year. However, commercial establishments, power loom units and other small units functioning at Veerappanchatram, Ashokapuram and other parts of the city continue to dump the waste materials, including carton boxes, waste cotton and cloth materials, and set it on fire on the roads during night and morning hours.

Speaking on anonymity, a resident of Anna Theatre Road, said that waste from the nearby power loom units are dumped at the corner of the road and set on fire during night hours. “Black smoke emanates from it making it difficult to breath for the people in the area”, she said and wanted action to be taken against dumpers. Since waste is dumped on the road, it encourages people from other areas also to dump here, said a shopkeeper Murugan. He said that people in two-wheelers and autorickshaws dump the waste during night hours and set it on fire frequently.

256,2020/02/03,Diseases claimed more elephant lives in Coimbatore division,"Diseases accounted for the maximum deaths of elephants in the Coimbatore forest division between 2014-15 and 2019-20.

According to statistics provided by the Forest Department, of the 87 elephant deaths over six years (up to December 31, 2019), as many as 33 animals died due to various diseases. Natural causes led to the death of 24 elephants, and 13 died of complications resulting out of injuries in the wild.

According to a senior forest veterinarian, the number of elephant deaths was well within the levels of expected mortality rate of the animal in the wild.

“The seven ranges in the forest division house a large number of elephants that move between the Kerala and the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. Deaths due to ageing, diseases and injuries caused by infighting will definitely be much lower than the birth rate,” said the veterinarian.

Human intervention

Data shows that 17 elephants were killed due to direct intervention of humans, in the form of electrocution, poaching and accidents.

While eight elephants were electrocuted during the period, mostly due to illegal electric fencing, two fell victim to poaching. Seven elephants were killed in accidents, many of them hit by trains on the track that falls under the Madukarai forest range.

Chief conservator of forests, Coimbatore circle, Debasis Jana, said efforts were being taken to tackle problems such as use of illegal electric fencing by farmers and accidents on the railway track near Madukarai.

To address the problem of elephants coming in contact with low-lying electric lines, the department is working with Tangedco to rise the level of the lines.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/ev0kx9/article30722026.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH02ELEPHANT,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/diseases-claimed-more-elephant-lives-in-coimbatore-division/article30722027.ece
257,2020/02/03,BIT students make biodegradable bags from recycled cotton fibre waste,"Three students of the Bannari Amman Institute of Technology (BIT), Sathyamangalam, received a cash purse of ₹ 1 lakh for developing biodegradable non-woven bags from recycled fibre waste at the Bootcamp 2020 held at the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras.

As many as 200 teams were selected to present their start up ideas, in which 19 teams were short-listed for the final round. The team comprising S. Vijayakumar, R. Ramkumar and L. Muralidharan, final year students of the Department of Textile Technology, BIT, had made the bags using natural binding agents as a replacement for the non-biodegradable bags made from polyethylene and polypropylene materials. They won second prize for their prototype idea.

The students said that the usage of non-biodegradable bags made from synthetic polymers was a major problem now as an average Indian family uses nearly 1,000 plastic bags a year. “Once dumped in the soil, polymer bags take about 500 years to degrade.”

The team decided to make eco-friendly single-use bags at affordable cost. “About 100 tonnes of recycled cotton fibre are thrown as waste a day in the country and hence we decided to develop shopping bags from it,” they said.

They used natural resins as an adhesive to produce these bags that can hold materials weighing six to 12 kg. These bags decompose within a month after disposal, they claimed.

Bags can be produced in different colours, printed with designs, logos, shop names, address, any style and sizes based on the customers’ requirement and the manufacturing cost of the bag is about ₹ 3 to ₹ 4. “These bags are good alternative for plastic, paper and woven shopping bags”, they said.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/oaovel/article30722024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ER03BANNARIAMMAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/bit-students-make-biodegradable-bags-from-recycled-cotton-fibre-waste/article30722025.ece

264,2020/02/03,FSSAI destroys artificially coloured eggs,"Officials of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) in Coimbatore on Sunday destroyed 3,900 leghorn eggs that were artificially coloured to look like eggs of country chicken, which are superior in terms of quality.

They found that the sellers were using colourants, including decoction of tea, to give the brownish tint to the egg shell.

K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of the FSSAI in Coimbatore, said that simultaneous checks were conducted at various markets namely the whole sale fish market and retail fish market at Ukkadam, Uzhavar Santhais at Vadavalli, Singanallur and R.S. Puram, and MGR Market Anna Market on Mettupalayam Road.

“The checks were conducted based on a complaint which said that vendors were selling white leghorn eggs as country chicken eggs after colouring them. Food Safety officers found that egg sold by at least 10 vendors were coloured white leghorn eggs. A total of 3,900 coloured eggs were seized and destroyed,” he said.

According to Dr. Tamilselvan, most of these vendors were procuring white leghorn eggs of small size from poultries in Namakkal and Salem and later colouring them to give the effect of country chicken eggs.

“While one leghorn egg is sold for ₹5 to ₹5.50, the vendors were selling coloured eggs for ₹7 and above.

They were selling such coloured eggs as eggs of free-range country chicken which is superior to eggs laid by chicken grown in farm,” he said.

Food Safety officials did spot checks to find the adulteration by soaking suspected eggs in water and the colour was found dissolving in the water. Apart from destroying the 3,900 coloured eggs, officials warned the vendors not to sell adulterated eggs in the future.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/jnaf6a/article30721713.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB03-EGG,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/fssai-destroys-artificially-coloured-eggs/article30721714.ece
265,2020/02/03,Joint action to curb smuggling and sale of banned tobacco products,"The crackdown by the police and Food Safety Department on the sale of banned tobacco products is yet to cut the inflow of the contraband from other States to Coimbatore.

On Friday, the police seized 214.5 kg of banned tobacco products from a resident of P.N. Pudur on Maruthamalai Road. The seized products included multiple brands of gutka, manufacture and sale of which are banned in many States, including Tamil Nadu.

The police and Food Safety officials cite manpower constraints as a hurdle for full-fledged and dedicated action against the smuggling and sale of banned tobacco products. On an average, five to 10 cases are registered by the Coimbatore city and rural police a day under provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act (COTPA), 2003. The numbers go up on days when special drives are conducted, say officials.

Coimbatore city police alone registered close 1,400 cases under the COTPA in 2019, majority of which were registered against those running petty shops. Sources with the Coimbatore rural police said that around 1,500 cases were registered in the rural limits for the offence in the same period.

In Coimbatore city, Police Commissioner Sumit Sharan has tasked Deputy Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) L. Balaji Saravanan to enforce the ban by deploying police personnel attached to the 15 law and order police stations. A senior police officer attached to the city police said that the main challenge in enforcing the ban was manpower constraints. The official admitted that police were also not able to take investigation to the next level to trace the supply chain of the contraband due to the same reason.

Officials with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) said they were hopeful of bringing down the sale of banned tobacco products as the Food Safety Department recently empowered Designated Officers in each district to issue spot fine to those found stocking or selling the items.

K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of the FSSAI in Coimbatore, said that it booked 50 persons, most of them running petty shops and grocery stores, for stocking and selling prohibited tobacco products.

“We expect that the spot fining will bring down the sale of gutkha in Coimbatore as the fine amount slapped on the offender is high. Fine amount to the tune of ₹2.5 lakh was collected from the offenders during special checks conducted to enforce spot fining in the last one month,” he said.

While first time offender is slapped with a fine of ₹5,000, the fine amount doubles to ₹10,000 when a person is caught selling the products for a second time. A fine of ₹25,000 and cancellation of FSSAI’s registration certificate are the penalty for third-time offender.

District Collector K. Rajamani said that a meeting of officials from the police, FSSAI, Revenue Department and the local bodies will be held soon to discuss modalities to enforce the ban.",coimbatore,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/27iefk/article30721671.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CB03-RAIDD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/joint-action-to-curb-smuggling-and-sale-of-banned-tobacco-products/article30721672.ece
266,2020/02/03,Jallikattu enthrals spectators at Alagumalai,"Thousands of spectators thronged the jallikattu at Alagumalai village in Tiruppur district on Sunday, which saw participation of 784 bulls and 600 tamers.

According to police estimates, nearly 25,000 spectators were present at the venue, even though the gallery was arranged to accommodate only around 15,000 spectators.

The event was organised by the Tiruppur District Administration in association with Alagumalai Jallikattu Bulls Welfare Association. Minister for Animal Husbandry Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan inaugurated the sport at 8 a.m.

Prior to the inauguration, he told mediapersons that the jallikattu was held at 60 locations across the State this year, out of 146 locations for which the Ministry’s permission was sought. Mr. Radhakrishnan asserted that the guidelines provided by the Central government’s Animal Welfare Board of India to conduct jallikattu were followed in all the events.

Tamers struggled to keep pace with the bulls that bolted out of the vaadi vaasal (entrance for the bulls into the arena). Many bulls ran untamed across the arena into the collection point, in which case the bulls were declared to have won. Those tamers, who managed to embrace the bulls by its hump for a period of 30 seconds or for a distance of 15 metres or control three of its jumps were declared winners.

The sport saw intermittent delays as some of the bulls from the collection point ran back into the arena, prompting its owners to catch it using ropes.

A member of the Alagumalai Jallikattu Bulls Welfare Association said that prizes for the winners and bull owners during the individual rounds included plastic chairs, bicycles and motor pumps.

The tamers, who tamed the maximum number of bulls were felicitated with gold coins and gifts such as two-wheelers, he said.

N. Alex, a 24-year-old tamer, said that he had been participating in the Alagumalai jallikattu since 2018. Hailing from Palamedu in Madurai district, he claimed that he also participated in various jallikattu events in Madurai and won prizes such as mobile phones and vessels. Similarly, O. Pandi, 24, was from Usilampatti in Madurai district and said that he had been a tamer for the past five years.

His remarks come a few days after the Election Commission (EC) issued a show cause notice to BJP MP Parvesh Verma for allegedly calling Kejriwal a “terrorist”.

His remarks come a few days after the Election Commission issued a show cause notice to BJP MP Parvesh Verma for allegedly calling Kejriwal a ""terrorist"".

Addressing a press conference here, Javadekar raked up the issue of Kejriwal ""staying a night at the Moga residence of Khalistan Commando Force chief Gurinder Singh during the Punjab Assembly polls"".

""You knew it was a militant's house. Still, you stayed there. How much more evidence do you need?"" he said.

""Kejriwal is now asking with a sad face, 'am I a terrorist?' You are a terrorist and there is a lot of evidence to prove that. You yourself had said you are an anarchist. There is not much of a difference between an anarchist and a terrorist,"" the senior BJP leader said.

Flanked by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and Union minister Anurag Thakur, Javadekar said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) was supporting Shaheen Bagh, where slogans of ""Assam ko azadi"", ""Jinnah wali azadi"" were being raised. ""Supporting such slogans is also terrorism"".

He alleged that Kejriwal stood with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), where ""anti-India slogans were raised, and did not grant sanction to prosecute (those who raised the slogans)"".

""On January 26, you threatened that you would stop their prosecution. How much more proof do you need? The people of Delhi now know that you are the chief of liars, you are an anarchist and sympathise with terrorists.

""You are supporting Shaheen Bagh, JNU, the slogans being raised there and all such anarchists...then you are definitely a terrorist. This is your identity, no matter how innocent face you make,"" he said.

268,2020/02/03,"A day after firing, security beefed up at Shaheen Bagh protest site","Security has been beefed up in Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of anti-CAA protest in the national capital, a day after a man fired two rounds in the air near the venue.

Two layers of barricades have been put up at a distance of 100 metres each and have been placed on both sides of the road leading towards the protest venue, a senior police officer said.

On Saturday, a 25-year-old man fired two rounds in the air at Shaheen Bagh and was later taken into custody. No one was injured in the incident.

There are many by-lanes which pass through the residential colonies and market area. People also take these internal roads to reach the protest venue, police said.

“Whenever, the police tries to make an announcement or appeal to the people on any issue, there is a sharp reaction from the public,” the officer said.

False messages about police coming to vacate the venue are also being spread through the social media.

“To avoid any kind of untoward incident, we have put up two layers of barricades and thorough checking is also being done to verify who is entering the area,” the officer added.

A senior police officer said: “We have sealed two major entry points on Road 13 A in the area. Police teams are also keeping track of the situation and checking on entry points from the Kalindi Kunj side. To avoid any clash, we also dispersed other agitators who came to protest against road blockage.”

The situation is under control and protest is being carried out peacefully at Shaheen Bagh, the official said.

Locals said some volunteers, who work in shifts, have also been appointed to manage the checkpoints.

“Luggage or bags of each protester or media person is being checked to ensure safety and security. If required, identify cards are also being checked, said Ragib, a volunteer.

On Sunday, several Assamese and local artists joined the protesters at Shaheen Bagh, where protests have been going on for over a month. The protesters carried posters which read “reject NRC, CAA and NPR and “hum goli nahi chalayenge”.

The political parties are trying to take advantage and create communal disharmony but we will not allow this to happen.We are fighting for our rights.”",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/a-day-after-firing-security-beefed-up-at-shaheen-bagh-protest-site/article30722383.ece
269,2020/02/03,Lovely’s personal connect with people on display at roadshow,"With trumpets, dhols (drums) and bursting of crackers, Congress candidate Arvind Singh Lovely’s roadshow on Saturday looked more like a victory march than a padyatra meant for public outreach.

While ensuring to walk through each lane in the colony and at times entering few of the residences, Mr. Lovely remarked, “I have a one-to-one connect with each of the family here. All the people you see here have come out on their own to show support.”

“The election scenario in Gandhi Nagar is completely different. Even though there is a strong BJP presence, whenever I contest, people extend their support for me as a candidate,” Mr. Lovely said.

The candidate from east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar constituency and a three time MLA said: “Whatever work I did till 2013 has remained the same. Nothing seems to have moved forward, be it new hospitals, schools or community centres. This area is also a huge trading centre and people over here have got nothing apart from harassment due to sealing and as a result of which businesses are on the verge of collapse.”

“Traffic is a huge problem here and not even a single DTC bus operates in the area. Thanks to the poor fleet that they have currently,” said Mr. Lovely amid being continuously approached by residents of the colony with sweet boxes and garlands.

Mr. Lovely had also contested the Lok Sabha polls from the East Delhi constituency in 2019 but didn’t emerge successful.

When asked about the same, he said, “Even though I did not win, people were still forcing me to contest this election as they want a familiar face who will work for them.”

Public opinion

Seventy-year-old Mithilesh Sharma, a housewife residing in the colony said: “What has the government done for us in the past? Though it keeps talking about CCTVs, we can’t really see any in our lanes. They also haven’t made any clinics here. Compared to that, Lovely had worked for us a lot in the past as well. So we will support him.”

Referring to the constituency’s previous MLA, who was with the Aam Aadmi Party but later joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, businessman Mohit Jaitely said: “Anil Bajpai, our previous MLA never showed his face in the constituency. However, Mr. Lovely has a personal connect with all over here and makes it a point to meet people of the constituency whenever he is here. Humare yahan se toh Lovely hi hain (It’s Lovely from our constituency for sure). The Congress can be assured of one seat at least.”

For the February 8 polls, Mr. Lovely will be contesting against Mr. Bajpai and AAP’s Naveen Choudhary.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/84p1zw/article30722234.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL03-LOVELY2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lovelys-personal-connect-with-people-on-display-at-roadshow/article30722235.ece
270,2020/02/03,EC removes South-East Delhi DCP after two firing incidents,"The Election Commission on Sunday removed Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-East Delhi) Chinmoy Biswal after two incidents of firing took place at the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protest sites in the district within three days.

With the Delhi Assembly elections scheduled for February 8, the EC had reviewed preparations, including law and order, on January 31 and appointed a special police observer. The review, though routine, took place a day after a young man shot at anti-CAA protesters in Jamia. On February 1, another firing incident took place at Shaheen Bagh.

“As decided by the Election Commission, this is to convey that Chinmoy Biswal, IPS (2008), DCP (South-East) stands relieved from his present post with immediate effect and shall report to MHA [Ministry of Home Affairs],” an EC spokesperson said on Sunday.

The spokesperson added that “in view of the ongoing situation”, the EC has put Kumar Gyanesh, a 1997-batch DANIPS officer and the most senior Additional DCP in the district, in charge.

The MHA or Delhi Police Commissioner were asked to send a panel of three names to the poll panel so it could post a replacement.

An EC team, headed by an observer, had visited Shaheen Bagh on Sunday morning and submitted a report to the Commission. The decision to remove the DCP was taken after the report, said sources.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ec-removes-south-east-delhi-dcp-after-two-firing-incidents/article30722223.ece
271,2020/02/03,"In Okhla, AAP holds sway","Vinod Kumar, a resident of the Aali village in Okhla constituency, observes with a tinge of philosophy: “Dilli abhi dur hai” [Delhi is far away].”

The Assembly polls might be less than a week away, but in Mr. Kumar’s constituency, to which belongs Delhi’s most discussed spots — Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia Islamia — a week might seem like a long time, where the election fortunes could swing and sway every day. On the apparent, AAP seems the local flavour, with BJP’s polarisation politics drawing a lot of stick, but a late twist can’t be ruled out.

Dominated by the Muslim community in localities such as Zakir Nagar, Batla House, Guffar Manzil, Jasola, Shaheen Bagh and others, the Okhla constituency has returned a candidate from the same community in every Assembly election since it’s inception in 1993. So do they hope this time, as Amanatullah Khan, Minister in the Delhi government, is bracing to defend his turf.

The Congress has put up ex-MLA from the area, Parvez Hashmi, forgoing Arif Mohomad Khan, who managed to win the seat in the 2013 Assembly election. An agitated Arif had even filed his nomination but later withdrew his candidature. The BJP has furnished a ticket to local leader Bhram Singh, who Amanatullah had beaten by over 60,000 votes in the previous polls.

Groundswell of support

AAP has groundswell of support from all quarters. “My vote is going to the Aam Aadmi Party, there’s no question,” said Israr Ahmed Kahn (48), a shopkeeper in the narrow lanes of Zakir Nagar. “Look at the work they’ve done for schools, health, water, electricity. They’ve done work. All this talk focus on the protest has no bearing on the elections,” he observed.

Farhan Khan, an IT employee, said he would support the party which “asked for votes on the basis of their work.” He listed out the strides AAP made in sectors such as electricity, education and health.

Danish Mirza, who works in a multinational company said he didn’t get an electricity bill for three months, apart from which “They don’t talk about Hindu and Muslim, they don’t talk about Pakistan,” he said. But he added: “Voting for the Congress would be a waste of time too.”

“If Arif Mohammad [Congress leader denied ticket] was standing then there might have been something to think about but now it’s clear,” he said.

For others such as Sajid Khan, voting for AAP was not a matter of rewarding good work but an ideological stance. “I still get a very high electricity bill. Most of their claims are untrue,” he said. “But looking at the situation today, I don’t care for AAP but we need to defeat the BJP,” he said.

The BJP’s campaign has found several detractors from here and elsewhere. “All the issues being created are misdirection so that no real questions are asked,” said Sajad Ahmed Khan, a businessman.

‘Polarised environment’

Commenting on an increasingly polarised environment being created, he argued: “None of our basics is being taken care of, like unemployment, education, cleanliness. How does it matter then if we are killed in riots? We are dying slowly anyway.”

Distraught by the BJP and sections of the media, Yusuf Khan, a shopkeeper in Jasola, says: “What is this kind of dialogue being used? These people are attacking our demonstrations because they’re failing to do anything right. They’ve brought this country down to the knees.” For him, the upcoming elections are not about local issues but issues that are “troubling the country at large”.

“This is the first time I’m seeing this type of an election,” said Vinod Kumar from Aali village. “No real issues are being talked about, the media is sold out, it’s all about scaring people and polarising communities,” he added.

While Mr. Kumar says he doesn’t need “freebies” offered by the AAP government, he will vote for them. “But the way the campaign is going, you don’t know which way this will go,” he said.

Yashpal Singh, a Congress supporter from the same village concurs: “The BJP has nothing to show, so they run this narrative of Hindu-Muslim. Why aren’t they removing them [the protesters at Shaheen Bagh] if it’s such a problem?” he said, arguing that it was an attempt to keep tensions simmering.

In Sarita Vihar, which has a large number of dairies and is dominated by Gujjar and Jaat communities, every person The Hindu spoke to said they supported the BJP. However, among the BJP supporters too, many said that the protests were being “allowed” to go on in order to reap electoral benefits.

“As long as the issue is kept hot, it will benefit the BJP,” said Yashpal Singh, an electrician. He also said that he was “secular” even though he voted for the BJP. “But if they [protesters] weren’t willing to move back even a little then why should we? I feel like as a Hindu I should vote for my party,” he said.

“When the elections began, it was certain that AAP would win, but now, looking at the things coming out of these protests, talks of cutting up Assam, my thoughts have also changed,” he added.

Others such as Manish Kumar (34) argued against various free schemes offered by AAP, and reckoned that some of it would negatively impact the economy. “Where is the money for this going to come from?” he argued. “The focus should be on jobs,” he asserted.

Declaring her support for the BJP, Anju Agarwal said that the party was doing a good job at the centre. “AAP has done nothing in the last five years. And six months before elections they started declaring all sorts of schemes,” she said, dismissing claims of improvement in school education and mohalla clinics, made by the party. Others such as Ram Kumar (43) a labourer from Madanpur Khadar, and Bhola (25), a street vendor, said they would vote for the BJP, because of Prime Minister Modi. “I don’t even know the MLA of the area but my vote will go to Modi,” said Kumar.

Upto 3,35,077 are listed in the electoral rolls for the Okhla constituency. With shootings having taken place twice in three days at different protest sites in the constituency and fears of violent outbreak looming, the polls could turn out to be an unpredictable affair. As Vinod Kumar said philosophically, Delhi is still far away, even though the polls are less than a week away.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/xuyznc/article30722215.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/CAAPROTEST,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/in-okhla-aap-holds-sway/article30722220.ece

Spread across 500 hectares, Rakhigarhi is the largest Harappan site in the Indian sub-continent.

‘Proud moment’

Welcoming the news, former Sarpanch, Rakhigarhi, Dinesh Sheoran, said it was a moment of pride for all of them.

“We are very happy to hear this announcement. It will put Rakhigarhi on the international map. I have been associated with this project for years and I feel proud. I also express my thanks to former Deccan College Vice-Chancellor Vasant Shinde, whose efforts have made this possible,” said Mr. Sheoran.

Meanwhile, Mr. Shinde said that the initiative would stop the destruction of the site and also help showcase or rich cultural heritage to the world.

Mr. Sheoran said that the villagers distributed sweets after the news came in. Jaiveer Fauji, another villager, said that developing the village as an iconic site would increase tourism and create jobs for the locals.

“It will also improve the connectivity of the region with the Capital,” he added.

Deputy Director, Department of Archaeology and Museums, Haryana, Banani Bhattacharyya described Rakhigarhi as a “prestigious project” for the government and added that the announcement would help the students, archaeologists and researchers. “It is a good news for all,” said Ms. Bhattacharyya.

Other sites

Besides Rakhigarhi, Hastinapur in Uttar Pradesh, Shivsagar in Assam, Dholavira in Gujarat and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu will also be developed as iconic sites with national museums.

Rakhigarhi is one of the largest sites of the Harappan civilisation and the major objectives behind the excavation there were to trace its beginnings and to study its gradual evolution from 6000 BCE to 2500 BCE, besides protecting it from encroachment by the locals since the village is settled exactly on top of it.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/lqyv90/article30722210.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL03HARAPPA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/haryanas-harappan-site-to-create-jobs/article30722211.ece

“For the last five years they didn’t even pay any attention to the plight of the people of Delhi, but suddenly they have focused all their attention on Delhi. In all their rallies, they are targeting Arvind Kejriwal, someone makes fun of his health, personal remarks are made on his appearance, on his family members. The BJP is resorting to dirty politics in these elections,” Mr. Chadha said.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/bjp-star-campaigners-attacking-cm-personally/article30722201.ece

277,2020/02/03,"District administration, ASI at odds over poll event at Qutub Minar","A voter awareness programme organised by the South Delhi district administration at Qutub Minar on February 1 has irked Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) officials, who say they had allowed cultural activities outside the monument but not the cooking and serving of food at the event.

The District Magistrate, B.M. Mishra, however, denied allegations, including that cooking, took place in the area and said ASI officials were trying to “settle their ego” by hyping up a non-issue.

In a letter on January 31 granting permission for the programme ahead of the February 8 Delhi Assembly polls, the ASI said the competent authority had approved the “proposal for organising a cultural programme outside the premise of Qutb Minar” on February 1 and 2.

An ASI official said the district authorities had only asked for permission for cultural activities, but on February 1, started to ask for approval for hosting a dinner at the site. The official said the ASI refused to allow this as such activities are not allowed in protected monuments, including the 12th Century Qutub Minar, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site as well. With the ASI officials refusing permission, the official said the district election authorities returned with an order for taking over the site.

The order, by Mehrauli Assembly constituency returning officer Sudhakar, asks the site, Sun Dial park at Qutub Minar, to be handed over, failing which “the same shall be obtained with the help of police and action shall be initiated against you for noncompliance as per the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 for impeding the smooth conduction of the General Elections 2020 of the Delhi Legislative Assembly”.

The DM, Mr. Mishra said that the order was issued since ASI staff were not allowing the use of a documentary hall/guest house in the vicinity for its bathroom.

The ASI official said with the order, the district authorities “took over” the site, with the help of the police and held the event, including cooking food on an open fire. The site, with the Qutub Minar looming over it, was left strewn with garbage that was cleared by ASI staff on Sunday afternoon, the official said. Mr. Mishra said that no cook toking place and denied that garbage was left uncollected, stating that the area had been cleared up after the event got over but ASI officials took pictures of the site as it was winding down to support their claim.

Another ASI official said that the matter would be taken up on Monday, including with relevant authorities like the Election Commission of India and the Delhi government.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/af82q1/article30722197.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DEL03-QUTABMINAR,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/district-administration-asi-at-odds-over-poll-event-at-qutub-minar/article30722198.ece

“It is strange that the EC does not act against Adityanath. He should be banned from campaigning in Delhi and the EC should lodge an FIR against him for his divisive speeches. If the EC does not give time to meet the AAP delegates by 12.00 p.m. tomorrow [Monday], we will protest outside its office,” Mr. Singh said.

He added that the party has attached a clip of Mr. Adityanath’s speeches in the letter to the EC. “The EC can’t remain indifferent to this grave issue. It is the misuse of democratic and constitutional institutions,” Mr. Singh added.

He alleged: “He [Adityanath] is not ready to explain the reason behind the failures of his own government and how the law and order situation in the U.P. is deteriorating. He is not ready to talk about electricity, water, roads, education, and health. He spits venom here and tries to divide the people on communal lines,” Mr. Singh alleged.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/aap-writes-to-ec-demanding-campaign-ban-on-up-cm/article30722195.ece
279,2020/02/03,Adityanath addresses public rally in Badarpur,"Addressing a rally at Badarpur Assembly constituency in the Capital, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath attacked the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and also talked about the efforts of the Modi government at the Centre.

Having arrived two hours late, Mr. Adityanath said: “I would have been here at five o’clock. I had planned my programme accordingly but because of Shaheen Bagh...”

He then started speaking about the various efforts made by the Modi government such as the Ayushman Bharath Scheme, Swachh Bharat Mission and others.

He said the Kejriwal government did not allow various schemes of the Centre to be implemented in the Capital.

He said Arvind Kejriwal (Chief Minister) was trying to create tension in the city by supporting protesters in Shaheen Bagh. He also told the crowd: “Do you want a BJP government or a government of people feeding Shaheen Bagh biryani?”

He dismissed the stirs as “excuses”, saying that the protesters want the removal of Article 370 and triple talaq.

The protesters are against the win in the Ayodhya temple case, he added.

In relation to CAA, he said action has been taken against people protesting against the Act in Uttar Pradesh.

He said properties of protesters in his State were seized to recover the costs of public damage.

Yogi on Kanwar yatras

280,2020/02/03,Campaign hots up on last weekend before Delhi polls,"On the last Sunday before the Delhi Assembly polls, the political parties made use of the weekend to reach out to voters by deploying several star campaigners to seek votes for their local MLA candidates.

Unlike previous elections, there were no large public rallies with the parties resorting to roadshows, small public meetings, and door-to-door campaigns.

Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday addressed two roadshows at Kirari and Mundka Assembly constituencies and then held three meetings at Vishwas Nagar, Laxmi Nagar and Rithala.

CM on illegal colonies

Mr. Kejriwal in Kirari said AAP has worked towards the transformation of unauthorised colonies and alleged that the Congress and the BJP are against providing free amenities to the people of Delhi.

“All the unauthorised colonies in Delhi had the same fate as Kirari. In the last five years, we have built roads and drains, installed water and sewer pipelines, installed CCTV cameras but some colonies are left because the work pending for 70 years cannot be completed in just five years,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He added: “If you vote for AAP, the provisions of free water, electricity, healthcare, bus rides, etc, will continue. The BJP has already said in its manifesto that they will neither provide free electricity nor free bus rides for women. Opposition leaders have time and again maligned my image for providing free electricity and water. So, I appeal to the people to think and vote.”

The BJP said senior leaders, including Amit Shah, J.P. Nadda, Prakash Javadekar, Shyam Jaju and Manoj Tiwari, would take stock of poll preparations at party election offices located across all the Assembly constituencies here between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m.

In favour of CAA

Earlier during the day, Union Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan flagged off a bike rally from the Delhi BJP office in support of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Mr. Shah and Mr. Nadda also led a programme which included 1,00,782 party workers intending to directly contact “every house” in each of the 70 constituencies.

Union Minister Jitendra Singh addressed a public meeting in favour of the party’s candidate from Rajendra Nagar constituency, R.P. Singh, where he raised issues related to potable water.

“For the last five years, the Kejriwal government has been making a fool out of people. They could not provide clean water to Delhi even after bringing 67 seats. The situation in this colony is similar to that in most areas of Delhi,” he alleged.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also entered the political fray here addressing a public meeting along with Mr. Nadda in support of Sangam Vihar Assembly Alliance candidate, Dr. Shiv Charan Lal Gupta.

“Mr. Kejriwal said the people of Bihar come to Delhi with a ticket of ₹500 and get treatment of ₹5 lakh for free. Do the people have to take the permission of the Kejriwal government to come to Delhi?” Mr. Kumar said.

Mr. Kumar, who shared the stage with Mr. Nadda and LJP leader Chirag Paswan at a rally in Sangam Vihar constituency in south Delhi, hit out at Mr. Kejriwal without naming him saying that “some people” were interested only in publicity.

“Those who got the mandate to govern Delhi did nothing,” he said, adding that Bihar being a poor State has done a “phenomenal job” in education, electricity and health sectors, and also strengthened road and developed better transport infrastructure.

Cong. takes a jibe at BJP

Former Congress MPs Shatrughan Sinha and Sandeep Dixit campaigned for Arvinder Singh Lovely in Gandhi Nagar and Arbind Singh in Karawal Nagar respectively.

Mr. Dixit alleged that the BJP was scared of making the public angry in various parts of the country, including Delhi, and is bent upon instigating communal violence here to win the polls.

“We have to be very alert in our fight against this communal politics and state terror,” Mr. Dixit said.

Punjab Chief Minister Amrinder Singh, former Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda and senior Congress leader Nagma Morarji and Sachin Pilot also addressed rallies across Delhi.",delhi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/ymy29p/article30722189.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02BJP,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/campaign-hots-up-on-last-weekend-before-delhi-polls/article30722192.ece
281,2020/02/03,"Delhi 2020: Congress promises unemployment allowance, free electricity up to 300 units","The Congress on Sunday released two manifestos for the Delhi Assembly elections — the first one focussing on creating jobs, new pension scheme, and cashback schemes for water and electricity and the second one on ways to curb the rising air pollution in the Capital.

Party stand on CAA

The Congress said if voted to power, the party would by February 21, pass a resolution in the Delhi Assembly demanding the Center to drop the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. It added that it would also not let the Centre implement the National Population Register (NPR) in its current form as well as the National Register for Citizens (NRC).

The manifesto also mentions that it stands in solidarity with everyone who has raised the National Flag in support of the Constitution and in opposition to the BJP’s version of NPR, NRC and CAA. The party promised that within the first six months, it would introduce a strong Lokpal in Delhi.

Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra, manifesto committee chairman Ajay Maken and Rajya Sabha MP Anand Sharma while releasing the document said unlike the BJP and AAP that only made false promises, their party has a track record of fulfilling promises. The leaders said even in other States, which are being ruled by the Congress, the party had fulfilled all promises made ahead of the elections.

Mr. Maken said Congress’ social welfare schemes have been included after working out their financial viability — like unemployment allowance and the pension scheme.

He said unemployment allowances have been modelled on the patterns of Congress-ruled States like Punjab and Chhattisgarh while some other points in the manifesto have also been drawn from other Congress-ruled States like Madhya Pradesh. He said unlike in Delhi, the power subsidies in the Congress-ruled States are going into the kitties of government companies.

The party promised to launch “Yuva Swabhiman Yojna”, which seeks to provide unemployment allowance of ₹5,000 for graduates and ₹7,500 for postgraduates per month. It will also provide them skill training to help them get employed. The party said they will start an incentive for young entrepreneurs to open startups with the Delhi Congress investing ₹1,000 crore per year for the next five years. The Congress promised industrial power at ₹6/unit to promote non-polluting industries. This will also ensure that the industries do not move out of the city and help provide employment.

The party promised to launch schemes to provide incentive to conserve electricity and water. They said they would introduce a cashback scheme in which money will be directly transferred to the consumer if the household consumes less than the amount of water/electricity that will be provided free.

The party said it will provide free electricity upto 300 units and a 50% discount to consumers using 300-400 units. The consumers using 400-500 units and those between 500-600 units will be given a 30% and 25% discount respectively. It added that instead of transferring money to private companies like in the case of the AAP government, customers would be benefited by as there will be direct transfers.

The manifesto said the party will spend 25% of the Budget each year on fighting pollution and improving transport facilities. The party said it will increase the green cover to 30% and make Delhi India’s first “electric vehicle city” via The Delhi Electrical Vehicles Initiative (DEVI) by procuring 15,000 electric buses.

It has also promised to work with governments of Punjab and if possible with the governments of Haryana and U.P. to help convert rice stubble to energy with an aim to solve the problems of smog.

In the healthcare sector, the party has promised to build 10 super-speciality hospitals in the next five years and add 5,000 maternity beds. For the benefit of senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and transgender persons without any source of income, it has promised — Sheila Pension Yojna — under which ₹5,000 will be given to the above-mentioned categories.

The party has also promised to regularise all unauthorised colonies and spend ₹35,000 crore in five years for the upliftment of these colonies. It has promised in-situ rehabilitation to jhuggi dwellers where each family will get a 350 sq-feet flat at the same place on the lines of projects that the Congress had taken up in Kathputli Colony and Kalkaji.

Alleging that the State and Central governments have colluded with the concessionaire to allow double the charges originally agreed upon, the party’s city secretary M. Srinivas said it is resulting in unbearable burden on common man.

As per original agreement, the charges should range between a minimum of ₹ 8 and a maximum of ₹19, which may be increased by 5% year on year, Mr. Srinivas said, and questioned how the price has been revised to ₹10 to ₹60.

These charges are “scandalous”, especially in view of the viability gap funding of ₹1,458 crore availed by the HMRL, in addition to several tracts of land for real estate. The concessionaire has failed to stick to the deadlines of project completion, and to provide facilities such as parking, he alleged.

“The viability gap funding was extended by the Centre with a view to help the concessionaire against the prices fixed in the original agreement. The prices have been revised notwithstanding the funding. As a result, Metro Rail is out of reach for common man,” Mr. Srinivas said, and demanded that the prices be brought down, and an audit be conducted into the financial transactions of the concessionaire firm.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/reduce-metro-rail-fares-cpim/article30729146.ece

Mr. Owaisi was speaking at a women’s protest conference in the city. He said that the ‘fight’ is long and against those “who have been conditioned by Hindutva forces”. “We will take a decision on the time we will embark on the jail bharo andolan soon. Jails can hold 3 lakh people. If we come out on the roads, Indian jails will be inadequate,” Mr. Owaisi said. He added that the country cannot forget “Delhi police’s high-handed response” while dealing with university students. He also spoke on how “police entered the varsity and misbehaved with women students”. He criticised Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath for reportedly saying that he would ‘take revenge’ merely 24 hours after the protests.

Mr. Owaisi also criticised the Karnataka Police for reportedly filing a sedition case against employees of a school and remarked how law was being applied selectively.

Speaking about the ‘peaceful’ protests, he said, “These protests are not such that we protest for a day or two and then sit at home. This is a long fight. Remember that those against whom you are protesting are not just politicians.”

Mr. Owaisi stated that he had moved the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens.

He criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “trying to destroy the Constitution of India”.",hyderabad,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/asaduddin-talks-of-jail-bharo-movement-soon/article30724272.ece

293,2020/02/03,31.5 kg gold worth ₹13 cr. seized,"A whopping 31.5 kg smuggled gold worth ₹13.3 crore was seized and 12 people arrested by sleuths of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, in the last two days. The contraband was being smuggled to Warangal and Hyderabad from Chennai in trains and buses and the accused were intercepted by the DRI officials of Hyderabad, Vijayawada and Nellore zones.

According to the officials, the first case was detected on Saturday by the Nellore unit, who intercepted three passengers travelling to Warangal from Chennai in Jaipur Superfast Express at Vijayawada railway station. They were carrying 7.22 kg gold concealed in bags. “The accused confessed that they purchased the gold bars from Chennai and were travelling back to Warangal to hand over the contraband to the kingpin,” officials said.

In the second case, three more people smuggling 7 kg gold in GT Express from Chennai to Warangal were nabbed at Vijayawada railway station in the wee hours of Saturday.

The accused were taking the gold to Warangal after purchasing it in Chennai.

In another case, three persons, who were trying to smuggle 6.47 kg gold to Warangal, were arrested at Kanakadurga Varadhi bus stop in Vijayawada on Saturday evening.

The arrested passengers told DRI officials that they boarded a train at Chennai, but had to get off at Kavali railway station and from there had to board a bus to Ongole. “Thereafter, they got on a bus to Guntur, and subsequently a bus from Guntur to Warangal via Vijayawada,” they said, adding that the contraband was concealed in clothes.

It is suspected that in all the three cases, the accused were working for a kingpin in Warangal on whose instructions they purchased gold from the grey market in Chennai.

Meanwhile, the Hyderabad unit of DRI intercepted three passengers from Secunderabad railway station on Sunday morning. They arrived by the Chennai-Hyderabad Superfast Express and were carrying 10.70 kg gold worth ₹4.53 crore. “The passengers confessed that they have procured the gold from a grey market in Chennai and were supposed to deliver it in Hyderabad,” an officer said.

294,2020/02/03,Maker Village to partner with AICTE,"The Maker Village here plans to associate with the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) by launching pioneering schemes that promote entrepreneurship and innovation.

The Maker Village is a joint initiative of the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and the Indian Institute of Information Technology and Management-Kerala established by the State Government.

AICTE Vice Chairman M.P. Poonia visited the Maker Village at Kalamassery recently and held talks with top officials of the facility that has around 75 startu-ps developing state-of-the-art hardware electronic products in divergent areas.

Prof. Poonia said he was “truly impressed” by the kind of innovations and the cutting-edge products shaping up at the Maker Village. The AICTE will explore the possibility of arriving at a broader framework of understanding for engaging with the Maker Village. The AICTE will “seriously consider” three initiatives: getting the Maker Village, along with an academic institution, partner with the AICTE for entrepreneurship development programs, conduct a national-level hardware hackathon of AICTE at the Maker Village and an AICTE innovation ambassador programme at the Maker Village.

Prasad Balakrishnan Nair, CEO of the Maker Village, said a collaboration with the AICTE will enable the Maker Village to launch projects based on innovative ideas, improving the incubator’s performance level. “Connecting with the all-India network of the AICTE will add tremendous value to us,” Mr. Nair said adding that inking a pact with the AICTE can woo the country’s brightest entrepreneurial minds from the technology student community to the Maker Village.

The start-ups in the Maker Village are into developing products in areas such as automation, robotics, drones, Internet of Things, autonomous vehicles, biomedical instrumentation and energy management, among others. Most of the start-ups leverage cutting-edge technologies such as machine-learning, artificial intelligence, augmented reality and virtual reality to make their products innovative and globally competitive.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/6sog09/article30728748.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/MVAICTE-VisitPic-1,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/maker-village-to-partner-with-aicte/article30728750.ece

Wrestler Ravinder Kumar was on Friday banned for four years for failing a dope test, but the NADA created confusion by identifying him as a World U-23 silver medallist which was not the case.

It was Ravinder Dahiya — not Ravinder Kumar — who had won a silver medal in the U-23 World Championships last year. Ravinder Dahiya said he had not been tested by the NADA.

“Error Clarification: This is to inform you all that we recently posted an order by the Anti-Doping Disciplinary Panel (ADDP) against Mr. Ravinder Kumar.

298,2020/02/03,‘Demand for regulation of e-com firms not met’,"Owners of small and medium-sized trading ventures in the city have expressed disappointment over the Budget proposals.

As far as small trade is concerned, the Budget is a cause for some mortification, said G. Karthikeyan of Kerala Merchant Chamber of Commerce. He added that demands from traders like more Government control over e-commerce companies had not been heeded to.

Traders had sought a level-playing field as micro and small traders bore the brunt of heavy discounts offered by e-commerce companies, he said.

At the same time, traders are disappointed that they are a category of operators who do not get any consideration when it comes to social security and health care cover.

While farmers get subsidised or even zero per cent loans, traders do not have the facility.

Though traders are not seeking zero per cent interest loan, the Government could have considered providing them low-interest loans, he said. Similar is the case with health insurance schemes. The Government could have considered providing health cover to traders under any of its schemes.

Mr. Karthikeyan felt that the proposal to do away with auditing of accounts of trade and small enterprises with a turnover of up to ₹5 crore was not helpful.

With the high level of electronic transactions required for getting the exemption, the Budget proposal will end up with even those units now enjoying exemption now having to go in for auditing, he said.

There is, however, some consolation in the removal of the dividend distribution tax proposal, he added.

Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Sunny L. Malayil called it a “continuity” Budget. It is a balanced one, rather than a big bang one and continues in the direction of bringing in policy changes, reducing red tape and taxes, and allocating more to agriculture and rural economy, MSMEs and health care.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/demand-for-regulation-of-e-com-firms-not-met/article30721965.ece

“The people who have taken to the streets will win the fight and this act will be repealed,” he said.

“Going to jail has only made my resolve stronger,” he said, referring to his recent spell at Tihar Jail after he led a protest march in Delhi.

The serpentine rally was led by hundreds of women and children, holding the national flag and photographs of B.R. Ambedkar aloft, and chanting that they would not cower in fear.

Protesters and organisers stressed the significance of such a rally in Kodungallur, a town steeped in history of communal harmony, and still houses centuries-old places of worship of different religions, including Judaism and Islam.

301,2020/02/03,Ernakulam market renovation: no clarity on rehabilitation of merchants,"The ₹100-crore worth renovation of the Ernakulam market under Cochin Smart Mission Limited (CSML) has run into rough weather with little clarity on the rehabilitation of stall owners.

A draft Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) prepared by CSML and to be signed by the Kochi Corporation and Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association had been approved by the Corporation council on Tuesday.

However, stall owners maintained that their suggestions did not make it to the draft MoU and have requested for a meeting with the Mayor to discuss the issue. “We received a copy of the MoU last week and realised that our suggestions on rent in the new complex, aspects of rehabilitation of stalls while work is on at the complex, and owners finding space and licences in the new building have not been incorporated,” said C.J. George, president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association. “These are issues that can be discussed and resolved,” he added.

A meeting is likely to be held soon with CSML and Corporation officials, and representatives of stall owners.

The 213 stalls are to be moved to an abandoned nearby school building for two years while the complex is renovated at its current location. But a dispute over the property has kept the entire project on hold, with a case pending over it in the High Court.

“An alternative location for rehabilitation will not be feasible – businesses and customers are all here. The dispute will have to be resolved,” said G. Karthikeyan, president, Kerala Merchants Chamber of Commerce. “Since a temple is situated nearby, fish and meat stalls will not be allowed to function out of the building,” Mr. George said. Temporary arrangements would have to be made for the five meat stalls and small fish vendors, and owners were willing to cooperate, he said.

The ₹100-crore renovation project includes the construction of the new complex along with a solid waste treatment facility, a multi-level car park in the vicinity and a skywalk that will connect the market to Marine Drive. A tender for the new complex was floated this month. Once an agreement is arrived at with stall owners, another tender will have to be floated to set up stalls and their electricity and water connections at the temporary location. It could take three months to ready the building to house stalls, CSML sources said.

“The dispute over the property is likely to be resolved soon. If there are amendments to be made to the MoU, it would have to be placed before the Corporation council again,” Mayor Soumini Jain said.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/sigkix/article30721842.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03KIBROADWAY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/ernakulam-market-renovation-no-clarity-on-rehabilitation-of-merchants/article30721843.ece
302,2020/02/03,"8 years on, corpn. yet to get a health officer","In around eight years, the Kochi Corporation has not had a permanent Government-appointed doctor as its health officer.

A health supervisor has been holding additional charge of health officer. “As per the Kerala Municipal Act, the health officer should be a doctor. The appointment is made directly by the State Government, but despite multiple requests over the years, the post remains vacant,” said Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar.

The Corporation council at its meeting on Tuesday had rapped the health officer in-charge for the department’s lukewarm efforts towards conducting requisite inspections to enforce plastic ban in the city. The health officer in-charge, Thomas Joshy, informed the council that 125 shops had been inspected within the city limits but none of them were found to be distributing single-use plastic items. This was countered by councillors and Mayor Soumini Jain on the grounds that several establishments within the city continued to distribute banned plastic items.

“When an official is given an additional charge they are not qualified for, they will have limitations,” Mr. Premakumar said. “Particularly when contagious diseases are doing the rounds, a qualified doctor is required for the post.”

The health supervisor was currently overburdened with the additional responsibilities of the health officer, affecting the department’s work, said V.P. Chandran, member of the Health Standing Committee.

“Doctors are often hesitant to take up such posts if better, more remunerative opportunities are available elsewhere. Since the position has the qualification requirement of the applicant being a doctor, the vacancy has been difficult to fill in some Corporations across the State,” said Anu R.S., Corporation Secretary. A doctor was appointed for a brief while by the Corporation on contract basis a few years ago, but the official quit soon after.

The health officer is tasked with the maintenance of primary health centres and the supply of medicines to these centres, besides dealing with diseases and their outbreak. The Corporation currently employs 22 health inspectors and 68 junior health inspectors for its 74 divisions.

No PSC appointments

The positions of 31 junior health inspectors have also not been filled on a permanent basis for years. In the absence of Kerala Public Service Commission (PSC) appointments, the Corporation was currently hiring inspectors on contract basis through the employment exchange, Mr. Premakumar said.

“A PSC exam was held and the rank list was released, but it was disputed. After the case went to the High Court, we have resorted to hiring temporary junior health inspectors,” Ms. Anu said.

“A permanently appointed doctor and inspectors would be more accountable and independent, and less likely to be dominated by political interests,” said another councillor.",kochi,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/8-years-on-corpn-yet-to-get-a-health-officer/article30721835.ece
303,2020/02/03,"These juttis don’t bite, says The Cinderella Story founder Sabista Khan","According to 27-year-old jutti designer Sabista Khan, one of the main reasons people hesitate to wear juttis is the shoe bites.

“I call these people the non-believers,” she says, “and it took me a very long time to work with my karigars to come up with leather that isn’t really hard. We pre-print our juttis, following by an oiling and sun-drying process way before we sell them for the sake of customers’ comfort. Unlike many brands out there, we have a leather that is very soft to the touch, avoiding rough friction. Nine out of 10 people tell me my juttis don’t bite.”

Originally from Mumbai, Sabista started her brand The Cinderella Story (TCS) in Hyderabad after getting married, and she quickly picked up celebrity clientèle including Soha Ali Khan, Samantha Akkineni and Neha Sharma.

As the weather warms up, Sabista offers up a quick jutti guide and also turns some common misconceptions away.

Tips and tricks

Colour choice “If you’re styling juttis with a western outfit, go for a lot of threadwork. If you go for something pearl or diamond-heavy or sequins, it obviously becomes very heavy. We also have printed juttis which pair well. At the moment we are developing ‘sneaker juttis’ which lace up; these work well with summer dresses.

The sailboat juttis by The Cinderella Story

Go with fun or pastel colours, rather than deep reds or greens which are traditional. Stylists are also taking note of this. We worked on Rhea Kapoor and Masaba Gupta’s collaboration where a pair of our casual pastel pink Notty And Nice juttis were used with a vibrant Indo-Western ensemble, and it worked very well.”

Go for oddities “Quirky juttis with fun motifs are a good idea too. We have some with filled up beer jugs and ones with sailboats on them. The beer ones were popular for the New Year’s time because a lot of girls wanted to avoid heels. We’ll be launching them officially at the upcoming Label Bazaar though.”

Myth-busting

‘Juttis are not sustainable’ “It completely depends on how you’re wearing them. In my opinion, they are quite sustainable and if you’re taking care of them right, they will last a long time. In historical films Kesari, Parineeti Chopra wore juttis; these costumes are true to the time period, people back then wore them because they’re terrain-proof and comfortable. That said, make sure you buy juttis made from durable and soft leather. Embroidered juttis aren’t as durable so be mindful. We provide a care card for customers, advising customers on how to tighten or loosen them, for fit.”

‘Juttis are just for girly girls’ “No! Once again, it depends. Yes, most juttis out there have a more feminine aesthetic, but there are juttis for men too. Recently more people have opted for juttis over sneakers for comfort.”

The Notty & Nice juttis worn in the Masaba Gupta x Rhea Kapoor campaign shoots

‘They are only for people with slim feet’ “I have a Patan lineage where we have very big bones so my feet are very wide. It was a design dilemma I faced when starting my line. I did not want to make dainty juttis only to leave out people like me! People have approached me and said, ‘no, this won’t fit me’ but when they try it on, they actually mould to fit the natural contours of their feet, without waiting to break it in. Some people have bought 20 pairs in one shot because they really appreciated the inclusivity. Our size range has also grown and we are launching those in about four to six months.”

Sabista adds that TCS juttis also have double cushioning to help with arch support, so that one does not feel that they are walking in complete flats. That said, Sabista has proudly converted many people to become pro-jutti!

304,2020/02/03,How Flying Cobbler is designing shoes with a difference,"Two years ago, Pranavnath G and his brother Kishen, launched the service, bringing cobbler services to customers’ doorsteps. “I wanted to identify talented cobblers who set up shop on the city’s pavements, provide them orientation, and employ them for a monthly pay. The idea is to empower them,” says Pranavnath, whose father is a leather exporter.

He set up a workshop at his father’s company and the team currently comprises a pattern designer and a master shoemaker, who supervise seven cobblers. They repair and refurbish used footwear. Now, they are being trained to handcraft footwear with various materials, customising them as per customers’ requirements.

Pranavnath says that he initiated service to make bespoke footwear affordable. Brides, for instance, when designing their wedding outfits, can set aside half a metre of the fabric and approach Flying Cobbler. “We will create footwear using the fabric on the upper region and insole, and for the base, we use thermoplastic rubbers for durability. The rest is made of leather,” explains Pranavnath.

The women’s range starts at ₹1,200. The team is game for upcycling as well: so you can give them an old silk sari or skirt to turn into a new pair of sandals.

Flying Cobbler recently collaborated with a men’s fashion store in the city for creating a line of shoes and sandals. “For these, we source suiting material even as customers place orders for getting them tailored,” he says, adding, “Every aspect of the design can be decided by customers: height of the heel, shape, size, design, embellishment if required, colour combinations, fabric to be used... We take their measurements accordingly.”

He adds that Flying Cobbler wishes to remain a B-to-C company, as they value direct interaction with end-users.

They also offer services for the differently-abled, people who have undergone feet injury. The company sends staff to measure the foot size of such customers, as well as showing them models to choose from. Pranav recently designed for a septuagenarian who had fractured his upper thigh. “He was finding it hard to walk in regular footwear, so we spent some time assessing his foot dimension. He had a mild limp and would drag his foot, so the sandals had to be very light. He also wanted slip-ons, instead of having to struggle with buckles,” he says.

He had also designed shoes for an accident victim whose feet were injured “The focus here is giving the most comfortable base, and ease of walking,” explains Pranavnath.

For individuals who do not have design ideas, Flying Cobbler provides design consultation. “Flip flops and sandals with cotton fabric on them are among our most popular products,” says Pranavnath, adding “College students love them since they are a pocket-friendly option.”

Flying Cobbler also has an app through which customers can upload an image of their damaged footwear, seek an estimate, and schedule a pick-up.

307,2020/02/03,450 Olive Ridley eggs collected so far,"RAMANATHAPURAM

The Olive Ridley season has begun in Dhanushkodi and around 10 Forest Department personnel are engaged in collecting turtle eggs along the 20- kilometre stretch of the beach from Mukuntharayar Chatram to Arichamunai.

The collection of eggs started as early as mid-December last year. However, only 452 eggs have been collected so far. “Collection of less number of eggs is due to delayed onset of the egg-laying season. The water current is stronger in the sea compared to last years and it could be a reason for the delay in turtles’ arrival,” said G. Venkatesh, Forest Range Officer, Mandapam.

Every year, hundreds of Olive Ridley turtles reach the shores of Dhanushkodi to dig nests on the beach and lay eggs. The turtle is considered a highly endangered species and only about one tenth of the hatchlings survive. The coast of Arichamunai in Ramanathapuram is one among the few existing hotspots for the threatened Olive Ridley, where it takes refuge during winters.

There are five varieties of turtles found in the region. Every day, the Forest personnel start searching for eggs as early as 3 a.m. and continue the exercise till 7 a.m. “We have identified four nests. The eggs are collected and sent to the turtle hatchery in Dhanushkodi, where they will be incubated for 48 to 60 days, after which the turtle hatchlings will be let into sea. Last year, due to Gaja Cyclone, the egg laying season was impacted and we collected 13,500 eggs. However in 2018, we collected 20,500 eggs – the highest number in the past five years,” added Mr. Venkatesh.

Environmentalists say the fast-changing climatic conditions and the ecosystem of the sea have affected the arrival of the turtles and the pocket of Arichamunai should be protected and tourism should be at least during the Olive Ridley season.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/450-olive-ridley-eggs-collected-so-far-ramanathapuram/article30729327.ece

Another person, who accompanied them, was killed in an attack by the gaur inside the forest, preliminary probe said.

According to officials, S. Mariappan of Thondimalai near Bodi and two others – identified as Shaju and Rajesh from Rajakumari in Idukki district in Kerala – had ventured into the forest without permission, carrying country-made guns.

Deep inside the forest, they came across a herd of Indian gaurs and shot at the animals, in which one of the gaurs was injured.

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday reserved orders in the case pertaining to Sankarapuram village panchayat (Sivaganga district) election. Two candidates were declared elected to the panchayat president post reserved for woman (General) in the rural local body election.

310,2020/02/03,"Four persons, who returned from China, under observation: Collector","Four persons who have returned from China after visiting the country as tourists have been isolated and are being monitored constantly though they did not show any symptoms of coronavirus infection, Collector Sandeep Nanduri has said.

Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Mr. Nanduri said the four persons had been kept in their houses under monitoring though the preliminary health investigation done at the airport did not show any adverse results. They would be in isolation for the next three weeks and monitored by government doctors every day.

“Moreover, we are constantly monitoring the crew of the ships getting berthed at VOC Port. If anyone is showing abnormal health parameters upon investigation, he will be taken to the special isolation ward created at Thoothukudi Medical College Hospital for treatment of coronavirus infection,” said Mr. Nanduri.

Asserting that the Department of Public Health had been geared up to deal with coronavirus infection, the Collector said people suffering from prolonged high fever with cold and cough should immediately come to Thoothukudi Government Medical College Hospital.

He said 41 cardholders in the district had purchased essential commodities under ‘intra-State ration card portability scheme’ on day one as the scheme was launched in the district on trial basis on February 1. On the second day, the number rose to 121. Since the scheme would lead to increased supply of essential commodities to some ration shops, 5% additional quantity had been sent to select shops.

On the appeal received for conducting jallikattu at Srivaikundam, Mr. Nanduri said the report on organising the rural sport had been sent to the State government after obtaining separate reports from the Departments of Police, Revenue and Animal Husbandry for a final decision.

The body has been taken to the government hospital in Sivakasi.

Immediately upon getting a complaint about the girl missing, the Malli police had registered a case and a massive search was launched by the Virudhunagar district police. Over 100 police personnel, led by the Additional Superintendent of Police, S. Marisamy, searched everywhere in the farmlands, bushes and various wells.

According to police, the girl had gone out to graze the along with her older sister. The older sister, studying in class IX, told her family members that the younger child had returned home at around 4.30 p.m. Only after the older daughter arrived home at around 6 p.m. did the family realise that the younger daughter was missing.

However, during interrogation, the older girl had said that both the sisters had a quarrel over the grazing of the goat and the younger girl, who was crying, had gone near the well. Police, who had been searching for her on a 4 km radius around Vendurayapuram till late in the night, then went back to the well where they found the body floating.

312,2020/02/03,Confidentiality of personal details given during NPR will be compromised: MMK,"Personal details given for National Population Register (NPR) would be made public and the confidentiality of personal information under the Census Act could be compromised, said Manithaneya Makkal Katchi leader M.H. Jawahirullah.

Addressing the cadre of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK)-led Secular Progressive Alliance on the occasion of inaugurating a signature campaign against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) here on Sunday, he said information given by individuals under the census exercise should be kept confidential. “It is a crime not to share details of family during census enumeration. At the same time, the enumerator is liable for a three-year jail if the confidential information is shared. But, in the light of CAA, the personal information of people, including the mobile phone numbers of all members of the family, their Aadhaar number and other details will be made public like the voter list. This will lead to lot of undesirable consequences,” he said.

Stating that the Centre had miserably failed in maintaining the vigour of the economy of the country, he said the major revenues had been through the ₹1.76 lakh crore received from Reserve Bank of India. Now, the Centre wants to get revenue through disinvestment of public sector units. Such being the poor status of economy, the Centre wants to divert the attention of people through the unconstitutional CAA,” Mr. Jawahirullah said.

Stating that the CAA was trying to split the people of the country on the lines of religion, he said that it was not only against the Muslims, but other communities also.

“Anyone who is not able to give documents to show the date and place of birth of their parents will be declared doubtful citizens. Like people who were forced to stand in queues in front of banks during demonitisation, now people will be forced to stand before taluk offices seeking documents,” he said.

He said the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) was responsible for passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill as its Rajya Sabha members supported it, even as the allies of Bharatiya Janata Party like Janata Dal (United)-led government in Bihar rejected NPR. But the AIADMK did not take any such decision.

The signature campaign was meant to put pressure on the State and the Centre over CAA, NRC and NPR. “Through this campaign, we will tell the government that the people are not ready to give any details during NPR enumeration,” he said.

Representatives from various parties - G. Thalapathy (DMK), V. Karthikeyan (Congress), R. Vijayarajan (CPI-M), M. Saravanan (CPI), M. Boominathan (MDMK) and V.

313,2020/02/03,No new clinic of GRH kindled this much hope,"When transgender Urvashi consulted a doctor at a private hospital in Madurai with a complaint of stomach pain, she was directed to a gynaecologist who asked her if her menstrual cycle was regular. “When I corrected her, she told me I too was a type of woman,” Ms. Urvashi said. As a transwoman, she said the ignorance of a medical practitioner pained her and added that this was not a stray incident.

For many like Urvashi, medical care in Madurai comes at a price - the stigma and high cost of health care. Urvashi also recalls times when paramedical staff giggled in her midst and resorted to treating her disrespectfully because of her gender. When she heard about a new clinic for transgender people being constructed at Government Rajaji Hospital in Madurai, she was happy and relieved. “The clinic is not yet open. When I went to GRH last week to help a friend get transgender identity card, it was locked,” she said.

In June 2018, Health Minister C. Vijayabhaskar told the Assembly that special clinics for transgenders will be set up at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital in Chennai and GRH in Madurai. The Chennai clinic is functioning since June 2019.

The promise

GRH authorities say the clinic, constructed at a cost of ₹30 lakh, will function primarily as an outpatient ward for transgender persons and served by specialists from departments such as urology, endocrinology, gynaecology, psychiatry and plastic surgery. “In due course, the medical board will decide whether it can do the formalities and issue the transgender identity card. Those opting to have sex reassignment surgery will also have to approach this clinic,” a doctor said. The clinic will also serve those coming for treatment for sexually transmitted infection, HIV and AIDS.

It is estimated that there are 300 transgender persons in Madurai district, as per official records.

In September, former Dean K. Vanitha said “the clinic will be established and inaugurated within the month-end, but it never happened.

The need

Transgender activist Priya Babu, while welcoming the government’s move to set up the special clinic, said it must be ensured that doctors, paramedical staff and the security team catering to transgender patients are well trained prior to opening the clinic.

“Doctors, particularly psychiatrists, should not treat us like their regular patients. Our problems are different from theirs. They must be able to hear us out and be trained in dealing with pre and post surgery counselling,” she said.

Apathy towards patients at big hospitals like the GRH where thousands of people, particularly from low socio-economic background, come for treatment is very high. “Most transgender people prefer private hospitals because there is dignity in paying for consultation. The doctors there usually treat us better. But what about those who cannot afford it?” she asks.

Transgender persons must feel safe and cared for at the GRH, Ms. Priya Babu said.

“Transgenders have a set of hospitals that they go to for sex reassignment surgery, emasculation surgery and vaginal construction through plastic surgery. If the GRH offers these services at a low cost, several people will make use of it,” she said.

Ms. Urvashi said some transgender persons resort to begging and sex work because they are desperate to transform physically for their own mental peace and societal acceptance. Since mainstream workplaces reject them, they have no choice but to work as menial labour but still hope to save enough for the surgery. Some people, unfortunately, receive terrible scars from the surgeries because doctors are not well-trained. “If the surgery is done at a government hospital itself, transgender people will not have the pressure to do menial jobs to pay for the surgery. Moreover, when doctors are better qualified to do the surgery, we can rest assured of seamless transformation,” she says.

Dean J. Sangumani said the clinic will be opened this week. “The inauguration was postponed due to procedural delay and I will ensure that it is manned by a best team of doctors,” he said.",madurai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/6m272h/article30723049.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03MACITY-TRANSGENDERWARD,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/no-new-clinic-of-grh-kindled-this-much-hope/article30723050.ece

Seithunganallur police on Sunday altered the section of the case from suspicious death (174 of IPC) to abetting the student to commit suicide (IPC 306) against teacher Sahaya Katherine Annal of Child Jesus Higher Secondary School. “It was altered based on the Child Welfare Committee report and our investigation,” said Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan.

Family members and relatives, seeking action against two teachers, received the body only after the case was booked against the teacher on Sunday.

Meanwhile, a representative of the school, Jeyarani, and Christian Educational Institutions’ Protection Peravai representative Ravi alleged that the school teachers were booked only because of pressure mounted on the police by a religious group.

The first information report filed by Seithunganallur police stated that the girl’s parents had cited stomach ache as the reason for the girl’s absence from school on the day when she committed suicide, their statement said.

“The student did not attend school the previous day too. However, it was falsely fabricated that the girl came to school on January 29 and left after she was scolded by the teachers,” the statement added.

316,2020/02/03,Bal Shalyakriya Mission a ray of hope for poor parents,"Sarju, a native of Bagalkot district, noticed deformity in the legs of his two-year-old son when the latter was nine-months old. This January, he approached doctors at the Kasturba Medical College and Hospital (KMC), Attavar, here, who assessed the deformity and suggested surgery. Sarju, who earns a living by selling chicken, admitted his son to the hospital four days ago.

Deformity in his legs makes it difficult for class 4 student Hemant to walk normally. He also has difficulty in eating. “Despite this, he has continued with his studies. I hope my son gets relief from surgeries that are planned here,” said Hemant’s mother Asha.

Hemant’s case is among the 60 complicated paediatric and orthopaedic problems that have been taken up in the fourth edition of Bal Shalyakriya Mission week that commenced at KMC on Sunday.

The annual Bal Shalyakriya Mission is jointly conducted by KMC in collaboration with Peedh Parai Foundation, Houston, U.S., and Bantwal Ananth Mallya Charitable Trust. Children are offered treatment for free. Apart from doctors from KMC, a team of doctors from Houston and other parts of the U.S. are involved in the treatment.

Among cases taken up this week include children with swelling of kidney, without food pipe, those needing lung resection, and those who have undescended testis. “We hope to bring a change in the quality of life of children,” said paediatric surgeon Jayatheertha Joshi, who along with paediatric surgeon Sadashiva Rao, is involved in the programme since four years.

Sumit Gupta, who heads a team of 10 orthopaedics from University of Missouri, U.S., said cases here look the same as in the U.S. “But the change is that the problems are detected late here, which poses a challenge in addressing them,” he said.

Deputy Commissioner Sindhu B. Rupesh inaugurated the fourth edition of Bal Shalyakriya Mission. Pro-Chancellor of Manipal Academy of Higher Education H.S.

The organisers had installed a large time clock at the start, and the end points of the run. Devices to record time were at some points while volunteers were posted at other points along the route to record the timings of runners. “This is for the first time that the association has made this arrangement for a marathon,” said an official jury member.

The event started at 6.30 a.m. at the Mangala Stadium with the flagging off of the elite 10K run. This was followed by the open 10K run and the 10K run for school students. D. Vedavyasa Kamath, MLA, flagged off the three runs.

318,2020/02/03,‘Reduction in MGNREGA funds will hit the poor’,"Reduction in the allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) scheme in the Union Budget is nothing but denial of work to labourers, said Ivan D’Souza, MLC, here on Sunday.

Talking to reporters, Mr. D’Souza said that the allocation to MGNREGA and other 219 schemes of the Union government related to 27 departments have been cut down. The allocation to MGNREGA has been reduced from ₹71,000 crore in 2019-20 to ₹61,500 for this fiscal.

“The shortfall is ₹9,500 crore. This is nothing but denial of employment to the needy,” Mr. D’Souza said.

The Union government has also cut down on food subsidy and thus made it difficult for the State governments to provide 20kg of rice and other cereals to poor families.

“The Budget has little to offer for farmers in boosting their income. Instead of making more investment in setting up cold chain at the district level for the storage of perishable commodities, the government has announced UDAN scheme that would only help a section of farmers. Cut in fertilizer subsidy will lead to rise in the input cost for farmers,” he said.

He said that the Budget had little to offer for Karnataka from where the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has been elected to the Rajya Sabha and from where 25 BJP MPs were elected to the Lok Sabha.

“Though announcing that the government would provide 20 % of equity and facilitate external assistance up to 60% of project cost for the 148-km-long suburban rail project for Bengaluru, Ms. Sitharaman has failed to make any allocations for this much delayed project,” he added.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/xny82w/article30721912.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BGIVAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/reduction-in-mgnrega-funds-will-hit-the-poor/article30721913.ece
319,2020/02/03,Hillock abutting Pumpwell flyover’s down ramp poses potential danger,"The opening of Pumpwell flyover has brought relief to road users, but hose travelling south on NH66 face a potential danger immediately after the down ramp of the flyover towards Thokkottu.

A small hillock that also accommodates the water pipeline to Ullal has remained as it was for a long time, where the service road from Pumpwell joins the carriageway after the ramp.

Consequently, the carriageway becomes narrower and there are chances of vehicles from the service road and the ramp coming close to each other.

The carriageway has just two lanes abutting the hillock and does not even provide space for pedestrians to walk and the problem existed even before the construction of the flyover.

The carriageway continues to be narrow for some distance after the hillock, while residents of Gorigudda on the left side of the NH have to climb a steep ascent to reach the highway.

There also exists an opening in the median to allow vehicles from either side of Gorigudda to reach other sides, but this was seen closed on Saturday morning, apparently by the traffic police to prevent any mishap.

NHAI informed

A senior traffic police officer told The Hindu that the police had already informed NHAI about the potential danger of allowing the hillock to remain as it was.

“We should have ensured it was razed before allowing opening of the flyover,” the officer said.

NHAI Project Director Shishu Mohan told The Hindu the authority was aware of the issue.

He has directed concessionaire, M/s Navayuga Udupi Tollway Pvt. Ltd., to remove the hillock by two months. The stretch will be properly widened eliminating obstacle, he said.

Meanwhile, the concessionaire will also complete all the pending works associated with the Pumpwell flyover, including removal of debris, asphalting of service roads and other works, shortly, Mr. Mohan added.",mangaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/qgrh4c/article30721887.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/3BGHILLOCK,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/hillock-abutting-pumpwell-flyovers-down-ramp-poses-potential-danger/article30721888.ece

The hospital is located at Mudugiliyar near Saligrama in Udupi district.

Speaking after unveiling the statue, H.R. Nagendra, Chancellor of Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) University, said that efforts were on to bring a regulatory body for the disciplines of Yoga and Naturopathy.

A Bill in this regard was likely to be introduced in the Parliament shortly.

Swami Vivekananda had said that Yoga was not just about “asanas” but a way of life. Stress was now a big issue in the world and also there was an increase in lifestyle diseases. Yoga was the best antidote to stress and its related problems, he said.

D. Veerendra Heggade, Dharmadhikari of Sri Kshetra Dharmasthala, said that Yoga and Naturopathy was now known all over the world. India should export Yoga and Naturopathy to the rest of the world. It was Swami Vivekananda who showed the glory of the country to the rest of the world.

He always said that a strong youth led to a strong country. Spiritually, India was strongest country in the world, he said.

Some of the courses which have low enrolments are being redesigned, said Vice-Chancellor P.S. Yadapadithaya on Sunday.

Speaking to reporters, Mr. Yadapadithaya said the admissions review committee of university has been revived and it will look intoreasons for low enrolment in some of the undergraduate and postgraduate courses. “Some of the courses have single-digit admissions. We are here to strengthen such courses and make them relevant,” Mr. Yadapadithaya said.

The committee will look at having civil aviation, tourism and Yakshagana B.A courses. New courses like M.Sc in Forensic Science and Digital Forensics are being considered. The committee, which comprises senior professors and deans from Education, Science and Arts departments, will have its first sitting in a week. From the first week of March, it will visit the departments and affiliated colleges, and it will come out with a report by March 31. “We will get statutory clearances, if necessary, and have redesigned and new courses from the coming year,” he said.

Faced with these challenges, Mr. Das has taken steps to bring banking in India up to standard via a restrained approach to governance,” it said.

324,2020/02/03,Volkswagen unveils made-for-India SUVs,"Almost 18 months after announcing its India 2.0 strategy, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India on Monday unveiled the first products developed for India — two SUVs viz. Skoda’s Vision IN and Volkswagen’s Taigun.

In 2018, the Volkswagen Group had announced an investment of €1 billion in India till 2021, while giving Czech firm Skoda Auto the responsibility to take the lead to achieve a combined target of 5% market share by 2025.

Ambitious plans

Stating that the firm had ambitious plans for the Indian market, Skoda Auto chairman of the board of management, Bernhard Maier called for “predictability” in policies in India. “Together with Volkswagen, we are investing €1 billion, which clearly shows we, together, mean business. With such a high investment, I have to say the fundamental thing for us is predictability,” Mr. Maier said.

Talking to reporters, he added that consistency in regulations was very important, and tight lead times put the entire industry under pressure, referring to the switch from BS-IV norms to BS-VI norms. “That helps neither the environment nor the customer…”

He added that there was also a need for a clear roadmap for electric vehicles.

On the India market, he said, “we have seen some volatility in the market in the past few years here but the overall long term picture remains positive.”

Replying to a question on what makes the company confident of gaining market share in the Indian market, Mr. Maier said they have learnt a lot from the past and are now using a completely different approach. “India is probably the most competitive market in the entire world... In order to come up with competitive prices... So, we have to develop products in India and source from India. This is what we are doing now... We have now reached a 90% localisation, heading towards 95%.”

Additionally, Jürgen Stackmann, member of the board of management of the Volkswagen brand responsible for sales, marketing and after-sales, said that in India the brand will focus on SUVs and will launch four new models in the next two years. Mr Stackmann added, “India continues to remain an important market for Volkswagen... world over, SUVs are gaining popularity among our customers, which is why we are introducing Volkswagen’s SUV offensive in India, this year.”",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/454q58/article30728845.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUVW,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/vw-unveils-made-for-india-suvs/article30728846.ece

The SSRC came into effect on November 1.

The RBI had invited applications from its staff, from grade B to grade F, to apply for the specialised cadre in January.

They were given the option to either opt in or opt out. The deadline to exercise the option ended on January 31.

According to sources, around 1,500 exercised the option, of which less than 150 decided to opt in.

There were 3,500 candidates eligible to be in the cadre.

The requirement for the specialised cadre was 1,100.

As a result of the lacklustre response from the staff, the central bank has now decided to extend the deadline by six months.

Sources in the RBI said that the absence of any incentive in this cadre had made the employees reluctant to opt in. Also, they did not want to stick to one area and would rather want to gain knowledge of various aspects of central banking.

The human resources sub-committee, which met in January, discussed the possibility of extending some benefits for those employees who opted for specialised supervisory and regulatory cadre. However, it could not be confirmed what exactly those benefits would be.

328,2020/02/03,Regulator suspends trading in Coffee Day,"Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has suspended trading in the shares of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd. (CDEL) from Monday.

Sources said that breach of listing obligations by not submitting audited financial statements could be the reason behind the suspension.

The shares of the firm were last traded on Saturday (February 1) when the market was open for Budget announcements.

Earlier, the regulator had informed CDEL that delay in declaration of earnings beyond January 29 could lead to halting of trade in company’s shares due to breach of listing regulations.

However, the company has sought more time for submission of audited results citing to non-completion of internal investigations.

In August last year, the company assigned Ashok Kumar Malhotra, retired DIG of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to investigate into the purported letter written by its founder chairman the late V.G. Siddhartha.

He was also assigned to scrutinise the books of accounts of the firm with the help of an accounting firm.

“As the assignment is under progress and is likely to take few more weeks for completion, there will be delay in submission of unaudited financial results [with the limited review by the auditor],” the company had said in a filing on January 29.

Sources in the company said the Bengaluru-headquartered firm has written to SEBI requesting more time. “We are yet to hear something from the markets regulator,” said the person.

329,2020/02/03,"Taxing investor on dividends will hurt REIT, InvIT funding","The proposal in the Union Budget to tax dividend in the hands of unit holders/ investors would hurt future InvITs and REITs, say real estate and infrastructure industry officials and analysts.

A team of industry executives is planning to meet Finance Ministry officials in New Delhi on Tuesday in this regard.

Calling for a roll-back, they said such a decision is contrary to the government’s move to encourage InvITs and REITs to provide tax stability to long-term infrastructure investors.

Uncertainty in the tax regime would hurt the sentiment of foreign investors who are already wary of the stability of tax regime in India, they added. The resultant tax burden on the part of investors will put at risk plans for raising about $100 billion with regard to INVITs and REITs, they said.

Till this Budget, business trusts in India had a single level of tax at source, or the corporate tax paid by the special purpose vehicles (SPVs) that owned the assets. The SPVs paid tax only on their annuity income.

Under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, no dividend distribution tax is now chargeable on any amount declared, distributed or paid by a 100% SPV by way of dividends (whether interim or otherwise) to a business trust out of current income.

Bobby Parikh, founder, Bobby Parikh Associates said the REIT / InvIT taxation framework was designed to provide a taxing outcome where income would effectively be subject to one level of tax.

But following the Budget announcement, resident unitholders may be liable to tax in such income at rates that could go up to 43% while non-resident investors may be liable at rates that could go up to 20%.

“This tax was levied on the income of the asset-owning SPV; after-tax profit, distributed by the SPV to the REIT / InvIT and by the REIT / InvIT to the investors were tax exempt. This was achieved by exempting dividend distributions by the SPV from DDT and by further exempting the REIT / InvIT and the investors from tax in such income distributions from the SPV,” he said.

“But the 2020-21, Budget seeks to replace DDT with the more conventional method of taxing dividends. As a result, DDT has been abolished; instead, shareholders are now taxable on dividend income that they receive at applicable rates. This taxing framework is also proposed to be applied to REITS / InvITs,” he added.

“Accordingly, the Budget provisions would now operate such that the SPV will pay tax on its income (the first level of tax, as was the case under the existing law); dividends distributed by the SPV will not attract DDT; the REIT / InvIT would be exempt from tax on such income; but the unitholders would be liable to tax on such income distributed by the REIT (resulting in a second level of tax),” he said.

“All of this would be incremental tax as a result of the proposed Budget amendments. This could have a material impact on the effective returns that investors would generate and could affect the attractiveness of REITS / InvITs as investment vehicles / products,” he said.

Under Section 10(23FD) of the ITA, while distributed income in the nature of interest received or receivable from an SPV (which is upstreamed by the InvIT as a pass through entity) is taxable in the hands of the unitholders, income in the nature of dividend is exempt from tax in the hands of unitholders.

Thus, there were no taxes on distribution of dividend income by the SPV to the business trust, and on subsequent distribution by the business trust to the unitholder, analysts said.

Gautam Mehra Partner & Leader, Tax & Regulatory Services, PwC said “While the DDT change is an overall positive structural change which should benefit small shareholders and MNCs, one piece which needs to be relooked at is the increase of tax for InviTs and REITs, especially since there was a separate carve-out from DDT to these players under the existing tax regime.”

Following the changes, the government’s plans to list some InvITs may come under a cloud. Some of the largest government-run infrastructure entities, such as the National Highway Authority (NHAI), Power Trading Corporation, PowerGrid Corp are looking to monetise their road and transmission assets through InvITs and these could be impacted.",industry,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/taxing-investor-on-dividends-will-hurt-reit-invit-funding/article30728767.ece
330,2020/02/03,LIC stock market listing: Government yet to take call on quantum of stake sale,"The government is yet to take a call on the quantum of its stake to be offloaded from the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), whose stock market listing was announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in the Budget.

Financial sector disinvestment is expected to yield around ₹90,000 crore of the government’s ambitious target to raise ₹2.1 lakh crore from PSU privatisation and stake sales, Department of Investment and Public Asset Management Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey told The Hindu on Sunday.

The ₹90,000-crore target factors in proceeds from LIC’s initial public offer and the sale of the government’s 47% residual stake in IDBI Bank, but doesn’t necessarily preclude more financial entities being added to the disinvestment queue during the coming year.

“In the LIC’s case, the quantum is difficult for us to say now because we have to listen to advisers, listen to LIC, look at the numbers. So it’s a bit early,” Mr. Pandey said. “There could be legal hurdles to cross as well, such as the need for possible amendments to the LIC Act. 1956,” he added.

Asked whether the sovereign guarantee enjoyed by the LIC policyholders would persist after its listing, Ms. Sitharaman said: “We’ve only said it will be an IPO. We’ve not given the complete ownership to somebody.”

The expressions of interest for BPCL will “come very soon”, said Mr. Pandey, adding that the sale of three big companies — BPCL, Concor and Shipping Corporation of India — might be concluded by the first half of 2020-21.

He said, “Ours is a job- strapped nation as a majority of our jobs are in the informal sector. If we can mobilise all parties, governments and private players, we will be able to formalise as many as 70-100 million jobs. This would mean at least 10% extra income in the hands of people.’’

Missing middle layer

Speaking at a fireside chat here on Monday in connection with the release of the book, ‘Bridgital Nation’ — jointly authored by him and Roopa Purushothaman — he said, the country currently had this strange scenario of high skill and high productivity and low skill and low productivity layers.

“The middle layer is totally missing and we need to build this middle layer by augmenting technology,’ he said. He also observed that processes were weak in high-skilled jobs. For instance, he elaborated, specialists or doctors could do only 50% of their jobs as they had to take care of tasks which were not part of the job profile due to paucity of qualified people in the middle layer.

“It is important we demystify the job of specialists so that half of their work can be taken up by bridgital workers.”

He said the fundamental difference between India and the Western countries was that the latter used technology to drive efficiency. In India, the country did not have a market itself, so it was important to use technology to provide access and develop markets, which can lead to distribution, consumption, jobs and income growth.",markets,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/1il5qo/article30728791.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04THBUCHANDRA,https://www.thehindu.com/business/markets/india-can-create-70-100-million-formal-jobs-easily-says-chandra/article30728792.ece
332,2020/02/03,Bond yields fall as Centre avoids extra borrowing,"The yield on government bonds fell sharply on Monday — the first trading session after the Union Budget presentation on Saturday — as the government avoided extra borrowing and also opened certain government securities for non-resident investors.

The yield on 10-year benchmark government bonds closed the day at 6.51%, down 10 bps from its previous close on Friday.

Bond markets were closed on Saturday. Despite missing the target for fiscal deficit of 3.3% for FY19, and projecting a fiscal deficit target of 3.5% for the next financial year, the gross borrowing programme of the government was retained at ₹7.1 lakh crore for the current financial year. Gross borrowing for the next year is pegged at ₹7.8 lakh crore which is in line with market expectations.

The fiscal deficit for FY19 will be 3.8% of the GDP, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in her Budget speech. “The Budget delivered credible numbers in terms of its fiscal deficit estimates, raising the deficit by 50 basis points (bps) this year and the next. The Budget used up the 0.5% GDP leeway provided by the FRBM, instead of sticking to the fiscal consolidation path that laid out a target of 3% for FY20-21,” Abheek Barua, Chief Economist, HDFC Bank, said.

“We expect the 10-year G-Sec to trade between 6.5%-6.6% in the short run as markets are likely to get some relief in terms of no additional borrowings this year and in line with expectations [on the] borrowing target for next year,” Mr. Barua added. Though bond yields are expected remain range bound, market participants ruled out the possibility of any further rate reduction. This is because higher fiscal deficit may push up headline inflation, which is already high due to a spike in food prices.

Status quo likely

The RBI is expected to maintain status quo in the sixth bimonthly monetary policy review, which will be announced on Thursday.

“With fiscal policy taking a growth-supportive role, on the back of the monetary policy being ahead of the curve last year, the calibrated policy mix should bode well for growth. We look for the central bank to remain on an extended pause on rates [even as supply-induced shocks dissipate] but maintain an accommodative bias to ensure the cost of capital remains stable and favourable,” said Radhika Rao, senior vice-president and economist, DBS Group Research.

The broader market breadth, however, was weak with more than 1,500 stocks losing ground against 945 gainers.

“We believe in the absence of any major announcements in the Budget may weigh on the investor sentiments in the short-term and we may continue to witness volatility,” he added.

After swinging over 300 points in early session, the 30-share BSE index was trading 125.45 points or 0.32 % lower at 39,610.08, and the broader NSE slipped 21.30 points, or 0.18 %, to 11,640.55.

In the previous session, Sensex logged its biggest single-day plunge in more than a decade on Saturday after the Union Budget failed to live up to market expectations of growth-boosting measures and fiscal discipline.

Sensex settled 987.96 points or 2.43 % lower at 39,735.53, and Nifty plunged 300.25 points or 2.51 per cent to close at 11,661.85.

Meanwhile, on a net basis, foreign institutional investors sold equities worth ₹ 1,199.53 crore, while domestic institutional investors purchased shares worth ₹ 36.64 crore on Saturday, data available with stock exchanges showed.

ITC, Hero Motocorp, M&M, Tata Steel, HDFC Bank and ONGC were among the top laggards, while Asian Paints, IndusInd Bank, Nestle India, HUL and Bharti Airtel were trading with gains.

According to analysts, the market is disappointed as the budget lacked any significant measure to stimulate demand and did not provide any relief on capital gains tax as expected from budget.

Presenting the Union Budget for 2020-21 in Parliament, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman pegged the fiscal deficit at 3.8 % for the current fiscal, compared to the earlier target of 3.3 % of GDP.

She also proposed lower income tax slabs for those foregoing various exemptions, and removed dividend distribution tax on companies, effectively shifting the tax burden to the recipients.

337,2020/02/03,It’s time for the Shaheen Bagh protests to end,"The protesters at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi have made their point. The picketers, primarily Muslim women of the area, have demonstrated their resolve to stand up not just for the rights of the Muslim minority but, more importantly, for the secular spirit of the Constitution. Waving the national flag, carrying photos of Mahatma Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar, and reciting the words of the Constitution’s Preamble, they have challenged the government’s narrative that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was merely an attempt to fulfill Gandhi’s wishes. The Shaheen Bagh protests will become a part of both the history of India’s democratic movements and of the chronicle of women’s empowerment.

However, there is a time when protest movements become counterproductive and the organisers and participants of such movements should have the sagacity to recognise this fact. For the Shaheen Bagh protesters that time is now. The principal reason for this conclusion is that with the Delhi Assembly elections around the corner, they have increasingly become pawns in the electoral game being played in the national capital.

The wrong message

It was a fundamental mistake on the part of the protest’s organisers to allow leaders of political parties to use their platform to make speeches that not only served partisan ends but also were unnecessarily provocative and sometimes uncivil. This combined with extremist pronouncements by some of the people, such as Sharjeel Imam, associated with the protests have sent the wrong message that the protests were not only undertaken for partisan reasons but had also fallen into the hands of extremist elements. The shutting down of one of the main roads in the area for a long time added to the negative image of the protests around Delhi.

Moreover, there have been two shooting incidents near the protest venue. Although no one has been killed, there is no guarantee that the next one may not inflict grave injuries or cause fatalities. While the protesters are not involved in such incidents, many hold them responsible for the deteriorating law and order situation. With the U.P. Chief Minister’s entry into the Delhi electoral fray and his incendiary speeches, and the Hindu Sena’s threat that it will clear Shaheen Bagh by force, the situation is becoming volatile. The Shaheen Bagh protesters will be blamed if this escalating inflammatory rhetoric leads to a communal riot.

Many negative consequences

The protesters must recognise that all this serves the interests of both the Congress and the BJP. For the Congress, which is in the doldrums in Delhi, the protest is an invaluable stick to beat both the BJP, which is adamant that the CAA must be implemented, and the Aam Aadmi Party, which has been talking out of both sides of its mouth regarding the Shaheen Bagh protests and the CAA. But the greatest beneficiary of the continuing protests is the BJP. The protests help the party consolidate the Hindu vote behind it and allow it to paint the AAP and the Congress as anti-Hindu. This is why the Central government has allowed the protests to continue without interference by the Delhi police.

Therefore, it is time for the protesters to recognise that their actions are leading to far more negative outcomes than positive ones. The entire exercise has outlived its usefulness. It is time for them to wind up their sit-in after issuing a statement that the protest has achieved its objective: they have squarely registered their dissent against the CAA and successfully linked the discussion of the CAA with the National Register of Citizens. They should learn from the Mahatma who did not desist from calling off protest movements when he recognised that they had outlasted their effectiveness. The termination of the Shaheen Bagh sit-in does not preclude the fact that those opposed to the CAA and NRC may continue protesting in a fresh mould free of political capture attempts after the Delhi elections are concluded.

338,2020/02/03,My little adventure across Wagah,"It was with some trepidation that I accepted the invitation to speak in Lahore. After all, I was born in India and did not know how I would be received there given recent relations between India and Pakistan. But I had always been curious to see Pakistan for myself and thought it would be a friendly gesture to go there before going to India for a lecture tour during which I would be speaking on ‘My Adventures in the Ribosome’.

Leaving Lahore for Bengaluru by air meant a long journey via Dubai or Colombo. However, I noticed that Amritsar was less than 60 km away and there was a direct flight from there to Bengaluru. As a bonus, I could see the Golden Temple and Jallianwala Bagh for the first time. Reaching Amritsar by land meant crossing the border at Wagah, a bit like crossing Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War. There was also the comically dramatic flag-lowering ceremony at the border, carried out each evening by the Indian and Pakistani border forces.

At the Lahore Thinkfest

My arrival in Pakistan went without a hitch — I was received warmly by everyone, from the immigration official to my hosts and fellow participants in the Lahore Thinkfest, which, like the Hay or Jaipur literary festivals, had a range of talks and panel discussions on themes ranging from current affairs to history and literature. I may have been the only science speaker.

I had intended to see some of the sights of Lahore on my penultimate day, but parts of the city were blocked off owing to an anti-U.S. demonstration against the assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. So, on the rainy and cold morning of my departure, my host Yaqoob Bangash and his friend Abraham showed me the Wazir Khan and Badshahi mosques, and the Fort. On our way to the border, we stopped to see the Shalimar Gardens, which had an eerie quality in the rain and mist.

By this time, I was starting to worry. It was past 2 p.m. and the border closed at 4 p.m., but Yaqoob was unperturbed. As we approached the border, my passport was checked about every 50 metres before we reached the immigration checkpoint in Pakistan.

There, I was asked a series of questions by an intelligence official. Why was I in Pakistan? For how long? Where did I work? What did I do? And, oddly, why was I going to India? He wrote down all my answers, and apparently satisfied, waved me on to the actual emigration counter, where a woman with a three-year old child on her lap checked my papers and stamped my passport. I had officially “left” Pakistan, and it was time to say goodbye to my hosts and walk towards India.

Entering Indian territory

In front of me was a fence with a gate, behind which was an enormous stadium with a sign saying ‘India’ and ‘India’s First Line of Defence’. At the gate, a guard checked my papers and waved me through. Right away, another guard asked me for my papers. Irritatedly, I said, in Hindi, “I just showed my papers to your friend” — pointing to the person only a few feet away. He bristled and said, “He’s Pakistani; I’m Indian!” In my general confusion, I had been oblivious of the fact that by going through the gate, I had crossed the border: I was now in India.

The immigration office to officially admit people to India was almost a kilometre away. To get there, I had to walk past the stadium where hordes of people had already gathered to watch the ceremony, with loud patriotic music blaring. Beyond the stadium was a small hut, where someone checked my passport and told me to board a waiting bus. It was empty and there was no sign of a driver. My watch said 3.20 p.m.

I turned on my mobile and found a frantic message from Mariam Ram, who had sponsored my tour. She had kindly arranged for Kuri Abraham, who manages the lectures, to meet me on the Indian side, and said they were all worried since it was late and there was no sign of me. I assured them I was in India, waiting for a bus to take me to the terminal. A few minutes later Kuri called to say that the immigration office was closing and I needed to get there in the next few minutes. How could this be? There were still over 30 minutes to spare. But I had completely forgotten the half-hour time difference between Pakistan and India.

Now worried, I told an official in the hut my predicament, but he blithely said, “The office will wait for the bus.” The driver eventually arrived but showed no signs of moving. Finally, he looked at me dubiously — I was lugging a roll-on suitcase while wearing a fleece, sandals, and a backpack — and asked, “Are you a doctor?” I told him I was actually a scientist. He said, “Oh, you’re the person I was waiting for!” It turned out that my Pakistani hosts had contacted the Indian High Commissioner, who told the immigration office to expect me. Luckily, they were indeed expecting me, and as a courtesy, checked me through even though it was late.

A member of the Indian intelligence who worked there kindly took us back to see the ceremony. There were two things that puzzled me, I told him. The first was that if someone left Pakistan and entered India, and the immigration office closed before they could reach it, what would happen? Why did they have it so far away? Would it not be better to have a separate gate on the side of the stadium for those crossing the border, leading directly to an immigration office? He admitted I had a point, but said if someone exited Pakistan, Indian immigration was obliged to deal with him, no matter the time.

Next I asked, what would prevent me from mingling with the hundreds of Indians gathered to watch the ceremony and simply make my way to Amritsar? Apparently, officials keep an eye on those who cross the border to make sure they board the bus, but if I managed to elude them, I would be in trouble when I leave India since there would be no entry stamp on my passport. And they would get in trouble too, for letting me slip through!

Hope for more crossings

The ceremony itself was every bit as comical as I had expected. The large Indian crowds dwarfed the much smaller Pakistani turnout and made such a loud din that I could not hear the Pakistani side at all — perhaps that was the point. Despite the display of jingoism, the soldiers on both sides are actually quite friendly and exchange sweets at Eid and Diwali. Wagah is the only crossing in the 1,500-km border between India and Pakistan. In contrast, France and Germany, which fought vicious wars over centuries, now have essentially invisible borders with dozens of crossings. Hopefully, there will eventually be similar mobility among the peoples of this ruptured subcontinent.

When I reached my hotel room in Amritsar, I finally relaxed. I had greatly enjoyed visiting Pakistan and meeting many people there, but it was good to be in India again.

339,2020/02/03,The Budget’s blurred social sector vision,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman began her speech by saying that the Union Budget was “woven around three prominent themes” — aspirational India, economic development for all and building a caring society. Achieving any of these would require extraordinary efforts on the social sector front starting with allocating additional resources for health, education, nutrition, employment guarantee, and social security schemes.

Given the current state of the economy, with decelerating growth, a slump in rural demand and stagnant real wages in rural areas, an expansionary budget with a focus on the social sector would have also made economic sense. It would have meant more money flowing into the rural areas, creating jobs as well as purchasing power, while at the same time making a dent on the poor outcomes in health, nutrition and education that continue to haunt India.

Unfortunately, the allocations for the social sector this year once again fail to deliver for the country’s poor and marginalised. And this is the situation across the board.

NREGA deserves a closer look

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the Public Distribution System (PDS) are two important lifelines for the rural poor: providing employment and food during times when the market fails them. The allocation in this Budget for MGNREGA is ₹61,500 crore which is ₹10,000 crore less than the revised estimate (RE) for the current year (₹71,000 crore for 2019-20) and, in real terms, even less than what was allocated last year (₹60,000 crore). It is obvious that in current times when the levels of unemployment are at their peak, the demand for employment will only increase. But MGNREGA is failing to fully play the role of filling the gap because of poor implementation and inadequate funds. There is also a need to revise the MGNREGA wages to bring them on a par with minimum wages. All of this would require much higher allocations for the scheme, which are entirely justified as the MGNREGA expenditure is also known to have high multiplier effects through boosting consumption demand in rural areas.

On the food front, excess food stocks to the tune of almost 60 million tonnes, high food inflation in recent months and reports of hunger from across the country warranted some announcement expanding the PDS. This could have been done by universalising ration entitlements in the poorest districts, increasing quantity given per individual, including pulses. However, what is seen in the Budget is an allocation which is not even enough to support the existing PDS under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). The food subsidy allocated for 2020-21 is only ₹1.11 lakh crore, which, once again, is slightly higher than the previous year’s RE of ₹1.08 lakh crore. This is much less than the budget estimate (BE) of last year, of ₹1.8 lakh crore, which is closer to the actual subsidy required for meeting the costs of the grain distributed through the PDS and other welfare schemes.

Over the last few years, the government has been funding the Food Corporation of India (FCI) for this gap in funding through loans from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF). As seen in the latest Economic Survey, in FY 2018-19, the total food subsidy released was ₹1.7 lakh crore which included an NSSF loan of ₹70,000 crore to FCI — it does not get reflected in the Budget documents. Once again, this is not prudent economics, as it only increases the interest burden in the long run; what it does in the short term is that it makes it possible to artificially show a lower expenditure, and hence smaller fiscal deficit. On the other hand, such mismanagement is then made an excuse to call for the dismantling of the PDS and FCI, which is entirely unwarranted.

Giving short shrift to health

Health and education also did not see any significant increases in allocations this year. The BE for the much publicised Ayushman Bharat Yojana/Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana stays at ₹6,400 crore, the same as last year (RE was 50% lower at ₹3,200 crore). The budget for the Prime Minister’s Overarching Scheme for Holistic Nutrition, or POSHAN Abhiyaan, another flagship scheme of this government, sees a meagre increase of ₹300 crore (from ₹3,400 crore to ₹3,700 crore).

The funds allocated for the maternity entitlement scheme, Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana remains the same as last year — ₹2,500 crore. There is an overall increase of ₹5,000 crore-₹6000 crore each in the overall education and health budgets which are hardly sufficient to cover for inflation.

As we look at the various schemes, including social security pensions, Anganwadi services, mid-day meals and those mentioned above, the same pattern emerges — first, we see a much reduced RE for 2019-20 compared to the BE of 2019-20, indicating underspending in the current year. This means people are being left out, coverage is low and benefits are irregular; field reports suggest all of this to be true.

Second, there are some increases as seen in the BE for 2020-21 which barely bring the allocations to the same level as the previous year’s Budget estimates in real terms. Considering that all these sectors are grossly underfunded in the first place, there is not much hope of seeing anything different in terms of what ultimately reaches people.

It is clear that the agenda of the present government for the social sector is for greater privatisation and withdrawal of the state. This is reflected not just in the low allocations but also policy pronouncements such as introducing the public-private partnership model for medical colleges and district hospitals or the push, in the Economic Survey, for narrowing the coverage under the PDS. This would be a worrying direction in the current context.

340,2020/02/03,Cognisant of constraints: On 15th Finance Commission’s interim report,"The interim report of the 15th Finance Commission, tabled in Parliament on Saturday, has largely preserved the devolution mathematics of its predecessor, belying concerns of a sizeable cut in States’ share. The commission has recommended a one percentage point reduction in the vertical split of the divisible pool of tax revenues accruing to States to 41%. This follows the reorganisation of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. While the former State’s notional share based on the parameters for horizontal devolution would have been about 0.85%, the commission has cited the security and other special needs of the two territories to enhance their aggregate share to 1%, which would be met by the Centre. As part of an effort to balance the principles of fiscal needs, equity and performance as well as the need to ensure stability and predictability in transfers, the criteria for the horizontal sharing of taxes among States have been rejigged. A crucial new parameter, demographic performance, has been added to the mix. Having been mandated to adopt the population data from the 2011 Census, the commission has incorporated the additional criterion to ensure that States that have done well on demographic management are not unfairly disadvantaged. And since the norm also indirectly evaluates performance on the human capital outcomes of education and health, it has been assigned a weight of 12.5%. This should address the concerns voiced by several States over the switch to the 2011 Census from the 1971 data.

Among the States, with the exception of Tamil Nadu, all the other four southern States see a reduction in the recommended share of taxes for the year 2020-21. Notably, the suggested devolution to Odisha and Uttar Pradesh have also shrunk in percentage terms. Crucially, the commission has flagged the issues dogging the GST, especially as indirect taxes constitute almost half the total tax revenues of the Union. From the sizeable shortfalls and volatility in collections, to serious cases of fraud, the new tax has yet to stabilise leaving a majority of the States dependent on compensation from the Centre. The commission’s effort to improve the granularity in devolution to local bodies has generated some interesting results. Urban local bodies, especially municipalities in cities with populations of more than one million, are set to get a larger share of the pie. However, the increase in the percentage of outcome-tied funds to 50%, from 10%, could prove vexing to the last mile providers of basic services in India’s federal and highly fragmented structure of governance. The commission has also been justifiably critical of the Union and State governments’ tendency to finance spending through off-budget borrowings and via parastatals. It has done well to ask that such extra-budgetary liabilities be clearly earmarked and eliminated in a time-bound manner.",editorial,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/cognisant-of-constraints/article30721001.ece
341,2020/02/03,Midday meal workers denied permission to protest,"Hundreds of midday meal workers from across the State, who were denied permission to stage a protest by the Bengaluru police, gathered outside KSR City Railway Station at Majestic on Monday where they staged a dharna demanding that they be allowed to march to Freedom Park.

This took place while the police were preventing others from joining the protest as Section 144 had been imposed on members of the Karnataka State Akshara Dasoha Employees’ Association for 20 days.

Over 1,000 workers were stopped at the railway station, and as many as 60 others who were heading to Freedom Park from north Karnataka were stopped at Soladevanahalli and taken into preventive custody. The Chikkaballapur police, too, detained senior members of the union.

Many union leaders alleged that they had been warned by the police not to gather workers for the protest.

“Some were not even allowed to leaves their homes,” said S. Varalakshmi, Honorary President of the association, who was detained on Mysuru Road. “Workers are merely asking for their rights. As the State is unable to fulfil our demands, it is using force to suppress our voice. We strongly condemn the move,” said Ms. Varalakshmi.

Protesters left the station on Monday evening, but association members said they will intensify the struggle if the Department of Primary and Secondary Education fails to give them some assurance.

Demands

Midday meal workers are paid an honorarium of around ₹2,700 per month. They want the amount to be raised.

Ms. Varalakshmi stated that the working hours have been increasing over the years, but their honorarium has remained the same.

Other demands include not to privatise the midday meal scheme, ESI and PF as well as accident and death relief.

The ban on the protest was criticised by activists and political leaders.

Former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy said, “Who has given the police commissioner the right to deny permission?”

Sharing a meal

Police Constable Sheela Kumari and her colleagues tried to defuse the tension by distributing sweets to the protesters. As many of the constables were from north Karnataka, they were able to bond with some of the protesters who shared their lunch with the police personnel.

343,2020/02/03,"Trees painted red, yellow and green for Jayamahal Road widening project","The Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has started the process of identifying trees on Jayamahal Road from Cantonment to Mehkri Circle and on Ballari Road from BDA flyover till Mehkri Circle, which will be axed for the road-widening project.

People employed by BBMP, on Monday, were seen painting red, yellow and green bands on trees to mark their fate. Those with the red bands will be chopped. Trees marked yellow will be transplanted while those with green bands will not be touched.

A total of 217 trees will be axed for the road-widening project. Another 266 trees will be transplanted.

“On Jayamahal Road, 122 trees will be axed and 205 will be transplanted. We are waiting for clearance from the State government to implement the project. The existing Jayamahal Road will be widened to three lanes on either side and service roads with two lanes each on both sides,” said a BBMP official.

Amidst criticism from citizens, civic officials defended the expansion project and said it was aimed at decongesting the road.

“During peak hours, there is severe congestion on both sides of the road. Motorists moving towards Kempegowda International Airport, Yelahanka and Tumakuru Road side will benefit,” the official added.

Delay in land acquisition

The BBMP has been proposing to widen the existing road for nearly 10 years. One of the reasons for the delay was acquisition of property owned by members of the erstwhile Mysuru royal family and issuing of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in lieu of compensation for portions of Palace Ground.

Nearly 15.98 acres of Palace Ground is needed to widen the 2.5 km stretch of Jayamahal Road between Mehkri Circle and the Cantonment underpass, and the 2-km stretch of Ballari Road between Mehkri Circle and BDA junction. Both roads are key to access the airport.

Area fenced off

Interestingly, adjacent to the Palace Ground compound facing Jayamahal Road, a stretch of road identified for widening has been fenced.

BBMP officials claim they are not aware who erected the fencing. Illegal dumping of and setting fire to garbage is rampant in the area.

Last year, the Karnataka Road Development Corporation Limited (KRDCL) had proposed to build an elevated corridor from Baptist Hospital to Silk Board via Jayamahal Road. The project got stalled when the BJP government came to power.

The area identified for widening on Ballari Road was also part of a steel flyover project (Basaveshwara Circle to Esteem Mall), which was shelved.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dnxc6v/article30728739.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGTREES,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/trees-painted-red-yellow-and-green-for-jayamahal-road-widening-project/article30728740.ece
344,2020/02/03,Site allottees see red as BDA pushes Kempegowda Layout end date to December 2021,"The long wait for allottees of the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout may have just gotten longer with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority - Karnataka (K-RERA) giving an extension to the Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) for the project.

The Forum for People’s Collective Efforts, which consists of home buyers, has objected, questioning the logic behind granting an extension of ‘four years’.

The forum has written to K-RERA pointing out that an earlier registration certificate, signed by interim chairman Kapil Mohan in May 2018, had mentioned that the registration was valid from September 2017 to March 2018. On January 14 this year, Chairman M.R. Kamble mentioned the validity of the registration as September 2017 to December 2021.

“We have observed that RERA registration number for the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout, Kengeri, has been issued with two registration certificates for the same project. It should have been extension of RERA registration under Section 6 (of the RERA Act), and Section 6 does not allow renewal for more than one year. We feel that the modification of end date, which is almost four years, would set the wrong precedent,” the forum has said in its letter.

The forum has appealed to K-RERA to issue suo motu directions to BDA to compensate allottees of the project, and get all other extended projects to file compliance reports with the authority. They want home buyers to be taken into confidence regarding the completion dates.

‘Error in end date’

But K-RERA said the extension was given after a hearing, which was preceded by an error in the end date mentioned in the registration certificate.

K.S. Latha Kumari, Secretary, K-RERA, told The Hindu that there cannot be two registration certificates for the same project as it is not a manual process. “When RERA was new, builders and promoters would apply and enter the end date of their choice without understanding the concept. When the BDA applied, they asked for three months. They then realised the mistake and approached us, asking for permission to enter the correct end date. But we told them that the authority has to to decide after a hearing,” she explained.

“With regard to the extension given, the authority has heard the case and based on the order, extension has been given,” she added.

The extension was given under the provision of Section 6. Asked about home buyers’ displeasure on giving more time to the BDA, she said, “It is in the interest of home buyers. We agree that home buyers should get possession within the stipulated time. But if you revoke registration, what happens to the home buyers who have made a purchase? We are not here to make the real estate sector suffer either. Both parties will suffer.”

The BDA Commissioner was not available for comment.

A BDA official said the underground drainage and water supply works were going on, following which asphalting would be done. “We have taken up work on a war-footing and we are confident of meeting the December 2021 deadline,” the official said.

Site allottees at wits’ end

The long wait and loan repayment have left allottees of sites in the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout at their wits’ end.

Suryakiran A.S, committee member, Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout Open Forum told The Hindu that the project was started in 2010, and applications for sites were called in 2015.

“The final allotment list came in 2016. RERA came into being in 2017, and BDA gave 2018 as the end date. In 2018, in tenders called for infrastructure works, they mentioned 2020 as the completion date,” he said, explaining the timeline of the layout.

He said around 2,000 people have paid between ₹10 lakh and ₹96 lakh (based on site dimension) for the sites, many after taking home loans. “Due to the lapse in the construction time stipulated by the banks, home loans have been converted into commercial loans and we are paying a higher rate of interest. Even now, not much is ready in the layout. Around 500 people have apparently surrendered their sites,” he said.

The forum said some of its questions remained unanswered during a hearing at RERA on Friday. These include whether BDA, which has been in the dock for delay in the Arkavathy and Kempegowda layouts, will take up new projects while the Kempegowda project is incomplete, and if there is any guarantee of the BDA meeting the new deadline.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/qdj9wc/article30728365.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGBDA,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/site-allottees-see-red-as-bda-pushes-kempegowda-layout-end-date-to-december-2021/article30728366.ece
345,2020/02/03,World Cancer Day: Bengaluru's Kidwai to have a block for those who can afford to pay more,"The State-run Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology will soon start a speciality block exclusively for patients who can afford to pay higher than the existing charges in the hospital. This is to create a revenue-generating model that will help in funding and improving treatment facilities for the poor.

The proposed block will have all diagnostic and treatment facilities under one roof. Services in this block will be provided at double the existing charges.

Institute Director C. Ramachandra told The Hindu on Monday that the institute’s Finance Committee and Governing Council had approved the proposal. “We are planning to start work by March. The ₹30-crore project will include air-conditioned deluxe wards and separate nursing stations,” he said.

“Most people find it difficult to afford cancer treatment in private hospitals. Although they want to avail treatment in our institute, the long queues and subsequent wait makes it inevitable for them to go to private hospitals. This new block will be for patients who are willing to pay higher than the existing government hospital charges. While treatment in this block will be on par with private hospitals and specialists will visit patients in the wards, the charges will be far less than what is charged in private hospitals,” the doctor said.

“There is an impression that government hospitals are meant for the poor. We have the best equipment and with a little facelift, our facilities will be on par with corporate hospitals,” he said.

Cancer incidence on the rise

While doctors are seeing an increase in incidence of cancer, the highest rise is in cases of breast cancer. The fact that more young women are being diagnosed with breast cancer is a worrisome trend, said Dr. Ramachandra, who is a breast cancer specialist.

“The incidence of breast cancer was 26 per one lakh people till a few years ago. Now it has gone up to 34 per one lakh people. This trend is more prevalent among younger women in urban areas,” he said.

“While hormonal imbalance is one of the causes, late marriages, late conception, early menarche and menopause are also contributing factors,” he added.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/dz00zk/article30728024.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGKIDWAIMEMORIALINSTITUTEOFONCOLOGYANDHOSPITAL,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/world-cancer-day-kidwai-to-have-a-block-for-those-who-can-afford-to-pay-more/article30728025.ece
346,2020/02/03,Software engineer stabs and bludgeons mother to death in K.R. Puram,"A 33-year-old software engineer allegedly stabbed her mother to death and then attacked her younger brother while they were sleeping in their house at K.R. Puram early Sunday morning.

The police are yet to arrest Amrutha Chandrashekhar, but her brother, Harish, 31, who survived the attack, told them that his sister mentioned being in some financial trouble before running out of the house.

Their mother Nirmala, 54, died on the spot. “She had multiple stab wounds and was also bludgeoned with an iron rod. Harish Chandrashekhar sustained deep cuts on his neck and hands,” said the police.

Amrutha is a software engineer working in an IT company in the city. She resided with her mother and Harish, who is also a software engineer. Their father had passed away a few years ago.

On Saturday, Amrutha told her family that she had been given a new role in Hyderabad, and was planning to relocate. She urged her family to accompany her to Hyderabad for a quick visit, which they agreed to. She booked their tickets on Saturday for a Sunday morning flight.

“They had dinner together on Saturday night and went to bed early as they had to get up early in the morning to catch their flight,” said a senior police officer.

Around 4 a.m., Mr. Harish was woken up by some noise. He saw Amrutha looking for something in his cupboard. When he asked if she needed anything, she said that she was busy packing for the trip and left the room.

Fifteen minutes later, she returned to the room with a knife and slashed his neck. “Harish jumped out of the bed and started calling his mother. Amrutha told him that she had killed their mother with the same knife. She told him that she had also used an iron rod, and was planning to kill him too,” the police officer added.

When Harish tried to stop her, Amrutha stabbed his hand and fled their house. “This is a rare case:a well-educated woman suddenly becomes so aggressive that she brutally murders her mother and tries to kill her younger brother. We are probing the reason for her actions,” said M.N. Anucheth, DCP, Whitefield division.

The brother, Harish Chandrashekhar, who survived the attack and is hospitalised, told the police that his sister, Amrutha, was crying while she tried to stab him. While fighting her off, he sustained injuries on his hand.

When he ran to his mother’s room to check on her, he saw her lying in a pool of blood. He was able to call his relatives who lived nearby. When his aunt and other relatives came over, they realised the severity of what had happened and alerted the police before taking Harish and his mother to a hospital.

Doctors declared his mother, Nirmala, as brought dead and admitted Harish into the Intensive Care Unit as he had lost a lot of blood.

“He claims that Amrutha was upset about repayment of a personal loan of ₹15 lakh and harassment by money-lenders. We suspect there is more to this. We have an idea where she could be and will arrest her soon,” the officer added.

The police are waiting for Harish to recover so that they can question him.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/software-engineer-bludgeons-mother-to-death/article30727938.ece
347,2020/02/03,Living in fear of the next raid,"As he prepares to leave for work at 6.30 a.m., Amzal Sheik looks around his one-room makeshift house in a slum near Kundalahalli. It has two cots and a small kitchen. It’s where he raised his daughters and sent them to school.

“I have lived here for over 15 years, but never before have I been so anxious or fearful about our future,” said Mr. Sheik, who works as a construction labourer. He said he was one of the first migrants from West Bengal to settle in Kundalahalli near Marathahalli, home to one of the many IT clusters in the city.

On January 19, authorities razed over 150 makeshift houses in Kariyammana Agrahara, just a few kilometres from where Mr. Sheik lives, claiming that illegal Bangladeshi immigrants were living there. Sheik and others living in Kundalahalli wonder if they will be next.

“My daughters were schooled in this city. They speak good Kannada, and can also read and write the language. We are Indians, but people keep telling us to go back to Bangladesh,” he added.

Residents at Kundalahalli allege that in the third week of January, the police visited their shanty and threatened to evict them in hours.

Shafiul Mujanabin, who hails from Murshidabad district in West Bengal, said that the authorities who came to evict them, especially the police, did not listen to their plight. “They painted everyone as a Bangladeshi. However, human rights activists rushed to the spot. After their intervention, our houses were spared,” he alleged.

Residents of Munnekolala slum near Kariyammana Agrahara recently hoisted the Indian tricolour on a pole. “It’s to show everyone that we are Indians,” they said. But it didn’t stop the police from knocking on their doors.

A day after the eviction drive at Kariyammana Agrahara, a police team visited Munnekolala slum and detained over 10 people.

“They claimed we were illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, and took us to the police station. They only released us after verifying our documents,” said a resident.

Senior officials with the Whitefield police confirmed the incident.

The same day, the police tracked down three illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in a neighbouring settlement.

‘We possess valid ID cards, but will they help’

These settlements are slowly emptying out. While many people hail from West Bengal and North Eastern States, others have come from north Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Fearing detention after frequent visits by the police, several families have left for their native towns. Some had no choice as their employers in apartment complexes and companies asked them to leave.

According to Mr. Mujanabin, several companies and apartment complexes are now demanding a No Objection Certificate (NoC) from the police if they want to continue to work there. “It is impossible for us to get NoCs as the authorities are highly sceptical of us. They are doubtful of our ID proof. Due to this, many are planning to relocate to other parts of the State,” he said.

In Kundalahalli, which is close to Bellandur lake, there are over 200 makeshift houses, but already over 75 are empty. Most of the residents living in the shanties in Kundalahalli have multiple identity cards, including voter ID, Aadhaar card, PAN card and driving licence. A few even have documents of land they own in their villages.

“But will these help? Perhaps, I should apply for a passport,” said a resident.

Amzal Sheik’s most important possession is his land deed. “I learnt from people that land records are important if CAA-NRC is implemented. I have a small patch of land in my native place in Murshidabad. I brought the land records with me after a recent visit home.”

Mr. Mujanabin wonders if the documents would actually help them. Recalling the threats from the police, he said, “At the beginning, they claim we do not have any ID proof. Once we show them the ID proof, they say it is not original and ask us to vacate,” he said.

Activists file RTI after police commissioner’s comments

Recently, Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao said that there are as many as three lakh illegal Bangladeshi migrants in the city.

Zia Nomani, Youth President of Swaraj India, said that they have filed an RTI. “The statement by the Commissioner is irresponsible and baseless. He has not backed it with any documents. If there were so many of them, why did they not identify and book them under the Foreigners Act?” he said.

According to residents and activists, it’s the Bengali-speaking immigrants who are being targeted.

Devi S. who hails from Vijayawada and resides in the Kundalahalli settlement, said that the police did not question them after getting to know that they are Telugu-speaking people. “They did not disturb us, and did not ask us to go back. They have been warning only those who speak Bengali, or other language,” she said and added that they have all been living together without any language, regional or religious barriers.

Kaleemullah R., an activist and a member of Swaraj Abhiyan, who has been working for the immigrant community here for over six years, said that the Bengali community is being targeted. “Such attempts to paint them as Bangladeshis is nothing but a culture of criminalisation and dehumanisation. We are all Indians,” he said.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/8st94l/article30727650.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/04BGIMMIGRANTSETTLEMENT2,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/living-in-fear-of-the-next-raid/article30727652.ece
348,2020/02/03,"Government will have to rehabilitate persons evicted from Bellandur land, tells HC","The Karnataka High Court on Monday said that prima facie it is of the view that the State government will have to provide rehabilitation or give some compensation to those who were evicted from their shanties put up on a private land in Bellandur, based on a notice issued by the jurisdictional police to the land owner.

The court also observed that prima facie it is not possible to accept that the occupants of the shanties had left on their own as claimed by the owners of the land, bearing survey number 35/2 of Kariyammana Agrahara, Bellandur, behind Mantri Espana apartments in Marathahalli police limits.

A division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Hemant Chandangoudar made these observation during the hearing of a PIL petition, filed by People’s Union for Civil Liberties - Karnataka, in which it was alleged that the police and the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) had carried out illegal eviction of poor people living in the shanties.

As both the police and the BBMP denied having evicted them, the land owners claimed that they came to know that some persons had illegally occupied their land by putting up shanties and the occupants left the land on their own following requests made by the land owners.

However, the bench declined to believe the claim that the occupants of shanties left on their own while observing that all actions began after the Marathahalli police inspector issued a notice asking one of the two owners of the land to remove illegal shanties put up on the land though the police have no such power in law.

Saying the action of the Marathahalli police inspector was nothing but ‘usurping the power of the civil court’, the bench asked how senior police officers, like Deputy Commissioner of Police (Whitefield division) and Assistant Commissioner of Police (Marathahalli sub-division), did not stop or act against the inspector as copies of the notice were sent to them.

Illegal immigrants

On the reference to the possibility of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh living in those shanties, the bench said there was no material in the official records to show that police made any enquiry on illegal immigrants staying in the shanties before issuing the notice.

However, the court found from the police records that a few complaints were filed by certain individuals alleging that illegal immigrants living in colonies and slums in the city are taking over the labour and household works from the locals. Also, the police records had copy of a letter, written in October 2019 by the Ministry of Home Affairs to the State government, to sensitise the police on identifying illegal immigrants.

While asking the State to respond whether it is prepared to help those who were evicted due to illegal action of the police, the bench adjourned further hearing till February 10.",bengaluru,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/bangalore/government-will-have-to-rehabilitate-persons-evicted-from-bellandur-land-tells-hc/article30727564.ece

350,2020/02/03,"Ayanavaram sexual abuse case: Four jailed till death, one handed life term","A special court on Monday sentenced five sexual offenders to life imprisonment after they were convicted on charges of grave offences, including aggravated penetrative sexual assault, on an 11-year-old girl with hearing impairment at an apartment complex in Ayanavaram in 2018.

Four of them — Ravikumar, 58, a lift operator; Suresh, 34, plumber; Abishek, 25; and Palani, 42, a secuirty staff — will have to undergo imprisonment for the remainder of their natural life, or until death, while Rajasekar, 42, a house-keeping staff, has been sentenced to life imprisonment. On Saturday, the special court convicted 15 of the 17 offenders. P.Gunasekaran was let off and another died during the trial. Amid tight security, the convicts were brought to the court complex located in the Madras High Court premises on Monday

R.N. Manjula, special judge for exclusive trial of cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act , held in camera proceedings and pronounced sentences on the convicts in the presence of the special public prosecutor and defence counsel.

Special Public Prosecutor N. Ramesh said, “Initially, the special judge observed that the convicts committed offences which attracted death sentence and added that after careful consideration of the circumstances, four of them were sentenced to imprisonment for the remainder of their life and one was sentenced to life imprisonement. They were all charged with committing penetrative sexual assault on the victim child.”

Of the remaining convicts, one was sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment and nine were handed five-year terms.

In July 2018, personnel from the All-Women Police Station, Ayanavaram, arrested 17 persons — all of them service staff at the apartment complex where the girl lived with her family. The accused had reportedly committed aggravated sexual assault and aggravated penetrative assault on several occasions, from January 15 to July 14, 2018.

“In this case, repeated penetrative sexual assault has been proved to have been committed on the victim child. Considering the physical and mental truama undergone by the victim and her family and other factors surrounding the occurrence, expenses incurred towards travel and for the immediate expenses, I feel that an interim compensation of ₹1.5 lakh should be awarded,” said the judge.

The court ordered the State government to grant the interim compensation from the Victim Compensation Fund or any other scheme or fund prescribed under Pocso rules.

“We have completed the trial of the case within a year, though the accused preferred appeals before the higher court at the time of trial and more than 50 such petitions were filed. We overcame all hurdles and the trial court delivered the judgment,” said Mr. Ramesh. Defence counsel Shaikh Mehrunisa said, “ Certainly, we will prefer an appeal before the High Court.”",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/h7yt0u/article30726169.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03FEBTH--Ayanavaramjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ayanavaram-sexual-abuse-case-four-jailed-till-death-one-handed-life-term/article30726170.ece

At the lobby of Hotel Ambica Empire, five persons were sitting on the couch and negotiating hard to sell the hotel, representing themselves as the owners and general managers of the hotel, to buyers from Kerala. The hotel staff who overheard their conversation and learnt that they were negotiating to sell the hotel. This soon reached the ears of the manager of the hotel.

The walls and concrete benches inside the female in-patient area of the IMH are now adorned with colourful artwork. Over the weekend, volunteers of an NGO came forward to give the area a makeover, turning the campus bright and colourful.

“IMH has been working along with Nizhal, an NGO, for a long time. Now, Nizhal involved Paint Box, another NGO, to paint the walls and concrete benches inside the female ward. The old paint on the walls had faded, and this initiative has helped to liven up the female ward,” P. Poorna Chandrika, director of IMH, said.

She added that a few residents also joined the volunteers to paint the structures. “The response from patients has been good. In fact, our staff said that one resident, who always stayed inside the ward, has started to come out and sit on one of the benches. The area has become vibrant, and patients find it pleasing,” she added.

Dr. Chandrika said they have requested the NGO to paint portions of the outpatient wing too. “A dull environment can be made pleasing with colours, for patients visiting the outpatient department,” she added.

IMH, along with Nizhal, had also initiated horticulture as a therapeutic tool for patients.

353,2020/02/03,Avadi Corporation aims to manage waste sustainably,"Avadi Municipal Corporation plans to reclaim its dump yard in Sekkadu and find a sustainable solution to the garbage issue in a year's time.

Like many local bodies, the Avadi Corporation too was fast running out of space to dump its waste in Sekkadu, located 10 km away from Avadi. In a bid to re-mediate the dumpsite, the civic body has accelerated initiatives and awareness campaign to turn Avadi into a zero-waste locality.

On an average, the Corporation generates 90.71 metric tonnes of garbage daily. The quantity of waste dumped in Sekkadu site has reduced by 60% in the past few months as the Corporation has implemented bio-mining project in the dump yard with the technical assistance of Anna University, officials said.

Officials of the Corporation said bio-mining is a process used for segregation of useful materials from mounds of garbage. Wet waste is composted in the 17 micro composting units set up across 48 wards. While the manure is provided to local farmers free of cost, recyclable waste is sold and revenue is shared by sanitary workers.

“We have removed 13,000 cubic metre of waste from the dump site since April through bio-mining process. Spread over nearly 10 acres, the yard has nearly 64,174 cubic metre of waste to be cleared for land reclamation,” said an official.

Besides composting waste, the materials with a thickness of above 6 mm is used for filling purpose. The Corporation has tied up with Dalmia cements to transport items such as old clothes, tyres and plastics as raw materials to produce refuse derived fuel.

Challenges remain

The Corporation continue to face challenges in source segregation and tackling dry and non-saleable plastic, which contributes to nearly 30% of the waste generated.

Residents of some areas complain that the Corporation also needs to focus on the issues at grassroots level for better solid waste management. Though the corporation was engaged in zero waste efforts, door to door garbage collection was still poor, they said.

K.Bhakthavatsalam, resident of Muthapudupet said that waste is collected once in three days and interior roads are not cleaned. Not many are aware of source segregation in the area, he adds.

While the Corporation wants to turn Avadi into a bin-free locality, residents note that the erratic door to door collection and absence of bins lead to throwing of waste in public spaces and stormwater drains.

T.Sadagopan, president, Tamil Nadu Progressive Consumer Centre, Pattabiram, said, ""Garbage is collected from residents once in two or three days. Vendors find it convenient to dump garbage in vacant sites in places such as Chatram and Kamarajpuram. Access roads to railway stations also act as makeshift dump sites.""

N.Ravichandran, Avadi Municipal Corporation Commissioner, said, “We have proposed to set up waste incinerator at a cost of Rs.1 crore to burn dry waste in safe way. Nearly 90% of the Corporation has been covered with door-to-door collection. Moreover, plogging initiative is being taken up every Saturday to encourage residents to keep their neighbourhood clean.”

On the challenges, Mr.Ravichandran said “We plan to instruct bulk waste generators to deal with their waste and link them to vendors for recycling waste. As a first step to encourage home composting and reduce wet waste generation, we are planning to give cycles as prizes to children who compost at home.”

The Corporation plans to use the land reclaimed for creating garden or creating forest using Japanese Miyawaki method of tree plantation, he added.",chennai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/7nhr07/article30722121.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH03City-mattercol,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/avadi-corporation-aims-to-manage-waste-sustainably/article30720576.ece

Walkers, especially senior citizens, complained that they have been facing this menace regularly.

According to police, around 1 a.m on Sunday, a group of youngsters gathered on the beach road and started performing stunts like wheelie and stoppie (a manoeuvre in which the rear wheel of the motorcycle comes off the ground) on the stretch and making noise.

One of the youngsters fell off his bike when he attempted a wheelie. Based on a video, the police are trying to trace the vehicle numbers and are searching for the youngsters. “We will either detain them or seize their vehicles. A warning has to be sent across that stunts that disturb the public will not be entertained,” said a police officer.

Meanwhile, some residents said that the youngsters sit on the beach pavement, with their bikes parked on the road. “Once the police patrol vehicle leaves the vicinity, they perform the stunts for sometime and speed away from the locality,” said a resident, on condition of anonymity.

V. Chandrasekar, president of a senior citizen association in Besant Nagar, said that the elderly residents are frightened to step out after 6 p.m. “The beach road has a pavement, but those on the adjoining roads are either damaged or encroached. Hence, people have to walk on the road and such bike racers endanger our lives,” he said.

355,2020/02/03,Substandard food served in eateries at Secretariat: customers,"With inadequate inspections and lack of monitoring, eateries in the Secretariat in the city are serving substandard food to over 5,000 government employees working on the campus and hundreds of visitors.

Staff from various departments, who frequent the eateries, allege that food items served are substandard. In the absence of competitors, they are forced to eat at the eateries. “Many a times, we realised food from the previous day is served the next day. Just because there are no major players on the campus, these eateries are taking us for a ride,” an official said.

The only relief is the cooperative canteen. “At least in the cooperative canteen, our feedback is taken seriously and they rectify if we make a complaint. The private eateries are not under anyone’s control. You can see people urinating near one of the eateries,” said a Section Officer from a department.

Banned 20 years ago

After a G.O. that banned private eateries on the campus 20 years ago, the eateries took refuge in the buildings under the control of the Army on the campus. “One of them got a stay from the court.

356,2020/02/03,Eight detained for hunting in forest area in Tiruvallur,"The police have detained eight persons in Tiruvallur district for hunting in a forest area in Tiruvallur district using guns. One rifle and three shotguns were seized from them. The meat they were cooking has been sent to the laboratory to ascertain the type of bird / animal they shot.

According to the police, Tiruvallur Superintendent of Police P. Aravindan received information about some people roaming around with guns in Valasaivettikadu village near Pollivakkam under Manavala Nagar police station limits.

A special team headed by sub-inspector Surendrakumar went to the spot and nabbed eight persons. They were found cooking meat of animals, which was reportedly hunted using the guns.

Police said that four guns are licensed weapons. “Three of them are claiming to be members of a rifle club and they had come to the village in a car. Here they roped in some villagers and went into the forest for hunting,” said a police officer.

There are some peacocks in the Valasaivettikadu village. “We also found search lights, knives, bullets and cartridges in their possession. We are checking if they have gone hunting elsewhere in the State too,” added the officer.

Meanwhile, during inquiry the eight told the police that they had hunted rabbits and fowl. “But we suspect that they have shot down a peacock. To ascertain this, we have sent the meat to the laboratory for testing. Once the result comes, we will decide upon the further course of action,” said a police officer.

Mr. Aravindan warned that hunting is banned in India and killing peacocks will invite serious consequences. “We will be producing them before the magistrate for further course of action. We have also informed the Forest Department about the incident.

Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash, who inaugurated the event, urged residents to contribute to solid waste management, through initiatives such as source segregation.

“The event has been organised to create awareness among residents on how to keep their neighbourhoods clean. Residents should take responsibility for handling their waste. Municipal waste management will not be successful without the cooperation of residents,” said an official.

361,2020/02/03,Falling short of aspirations,"There were many expectations from the Union Budget 2020: that it would reverse the falling growth rate, reduce unemployment and rekindle the animal spirits needed to revive private investment. Does the Budget really hold out the promise on these counts? To answer the question, the Budget can be judged in terms of its effect on rural demand, investment and private sentiments — all critical elements for recovery. While the Budget offers hope on the last count, it leaves much to be desired on several other parameters.

Skill development allocation

Of the Finance Minister’s own accord, there is a huge, unmet demand for teachers, paramedical staff and caregivers, and skilled workers. Well-paying jobs are created in the organised services and industry but require candidates with quality education and skills. Both elude India’s youth due to the poor quality of education and lack of opportunities to acquire practical skills. Still, the Finance Minister has allocated a paltry ₹3,000 crore for skill development. Skilling will require massive investment and concerted efforts. The Budget could have given tax incentives to companies to provide internships and on-site vocational training to unemployed youth. The country cannot afford to let the world’s largest workforce waste this way.

The government remains very determined to present itself as being fiscally prudent. Total expenditure is slated to go up marginally to 13.5% GDP from 13.2% of GDP for the current fiscal (revised estimates). The fiscal deficit is pegged at 3.5% of GDP. Going by the experience with the current fiscal, the deficit level is not paramount concern for the market. Due to the ‘slippage in tax collections this fiscal year combined with stepped up government expenditure, market borrowings by the government have gone up as much as 15%’. Still, yields on government securities have not gone up significantly. Neither inflation nor the current account deficit have set alarm bells ringing, as feared by the government.

On flagship welfare schemes

Indeed, there are plenty of private savings that the government can tap to boost growth and raising public investment. However, the Finance Minister has opted for a longer route. The Budget falls well short of expectations when it comes to boosting demand. Budgetary allocations for the Pradhan Mantri KIsan SAmman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) are disappointing. The MGNREGA is allocated ₹61,500 crore, which is less than ₹71,000 crore for the current fiscal year. Going by the last year, disbursement under the PM-KISAN will also be less than budgeted, unless the beneficiary base is expanded. This is unfortunate. These two schemes are good instruments for income transfers to small and marginal farmers, landless labour who spend most of their income and generate demand for a wide range of goods and services. Higher disbursement under these schemes would have benefited most sectors of the economy. Budgetary allocations for health and education are also well below what is needed.

Focus of schemes such as micro irrigation schemes for 100 water-stressed districts is welcome and so is a modest increase in allocations for agriculture and rural development schemes. Rural roads, cold storage, and logistical chains are crucial for the growth of income and employment in rural India, as the multiplier effects of rural infrastructure investment on growth and employment are large and extensive.

The allocation of ₹1.7 lakh crore for transportation infrastructure is also a welcome step. But a lot will depend on whether the money actually gets invested or remains unspent as it has happened in the current fiscal year. If the public investment infrastructure actually materialises, it will lend credence to the government’s stated commitment to revive the investment cycle — to spur job-creating growth. To pull in private investment, the public funding should be front-loaded in under-implementation projects. Small irrigation and rural road projects are also relatively easy to complete and deliver immense benefits to several sectors.

Getting private investment

The Budget’s main growth plank is the hope for a deluge of private infrastructure investment through public-private partnership (PPP) and external sovereign wealth funds that have been given 100% tax exceptions in the Budget. But private investment depends on the cost of capital along with the certainty of returns.

Many projects have been mired in contractual disputes with government departments and various regulatory hurdles. All these factors make infrastructure investment unnecessarily risky and render these projects unattractive for investors.

Bonds and startups

The fundamental problem of infrastructure finance is the asset-liability mismatch which can be addressed only by developing a vibrant ‘corporate bond market. However, the focus of the Budget is the multiple schemes for government bonds mainly through additional room for foreign portfolio investors and exchange traded funds in government bonds. These are welcome moves but are not enough’. A well-developed bond market should draw upon domestic insurance funds, pension funds and mutual funds which are capable of investing in corporate bonds across different schemes.

The other leg of the “aspirational” Budget is the startups. Some relief on the tax they have to pay and on taxation of the Employee Stock Option Plans is welcome but the reluctance to abolish the angel tax that results in harassment of start-ups and their investors is unfathomable. Another welcome feature is the scheme to allow the non-banking financial companies into the Trade Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) — an ecosystem that aims to facilitate the financing and settling of trade-related transactions of small entities with corporate and other buyers, including government departments and public sector undertakings.

To reduce the compliance burden on small retailers, traders and shopkeepers who comprise the Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) sector, the threshold for audit of the accounts has been increased from ₹1 crore to ₹5 crore for those entities that carry out less than 5% of their business transactions in cash. It is also good that the Finance Minister has extended the window for restructuring of loans for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises till March 31, 2021.

However, for many products produced by these enterprises, the tax rates are higher for inputs than the final goods. In addition, many SMEs suffer from high taxes on imports of raw material and exports of intermediary services by them.

It is good that the Finance Minister has recognised the need to revive the dying spirit of the private sector. Accordingly, she has assured decriminalisation of several civil offences by firms under the Companies Act. The abolition of dividend distribution tax, and the assurance that tax-related disputes will be considered with compassion might deliver the expected results provided these promises are fulfilled in letter and spirit. The same logic applies to ‘the scheme to reimburse to exporters assorted duties, such as excise duty on transport fuels and electricity’.

Everything considered, the future of the economy will turn on whether the government walks the talk in terms of public investment and the promises made to different sections of society including the taxpayer and companies. When it comes to reviving private sentiments, actions will speak much louder than the budgetary promises.

362,2020/02/03,Funding for MGNREGS,"The Food and Agriculture Organization says that 70% of India’s rural households still depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood and 82% of the farmers are small and marginal. Given the uncertainties associated with agriculture, it is imperative to put money in the hands of the small farmers and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) can be helpful to realise this objective. That being the case, a 13% cut in funding for the scheme compared to the revised estimates is inexplicable. The government should have demonstrated an intent to revive the rural economy by not cutting down allocation. (Social sector, “Allocation for MGNREGS slashed by ₹9,500 crore,” Feb. 02).

363,2020/02/03,Listing of LIC,"As a policyholder, I welcome the government’s move to get Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) listed in the stock exchange as this would make the company more answerable to the investors. As of now, the policyholders’ money is invested in companies without any concern for the business implications, as when LIC was made to buy shares of Coal India and ONGC. This often leads to low bonus to policyholders. Second, the policy portfolios offered are shrouded in secrecy, not revealing the large commissions paid to agents, which again impact the amount of bonus declared. It is reported that the commissions range up to 40% of the first premiums and 5% on subsequent premiums. Converting LIC into a public limited will hopefully change the work culture and provide better yields. Employees threatening to go on strike should spare a thought for the policyholders also (“Govt. to sell part of its stake in LIC via IPO,” Feb. 02).

The proposal to disinvest LIC came as a shocker. Senior citizens who have invested their hard-earned money in this prestigious public sector undertaking will surely brood over it. Privatisation may fill the government’s coffers but will shatter public confidence in the company. India’s status as a welfare state would be seriously compromised.

The new income tax rates, though they look attractive, will be applicable only after taxpayers agree to give up other conventional benefits like standard deductions. But adequate care has been taken to help companies by removing the DDT. The Budget more looks like one which supports big corporates and not the average taxpayer. Moreover, the taxpayer will now, for the first time, be compelled to seek the assistance of a professional to decide what is to be done by spending extra money.

366,2020/02/03,Reforming the economy,"Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s mega talkathon Budget did not unleash any big bang reform. It failed to address issues concerning GDP growth, private consumption, investments and manufacturing, all of which have hit record low levels. A reduction in Central funds for schemes concerning agriculture, health, education and welfare of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was disappointing. What is more shocking is the slashing of real allocation on MGNREGS, a vital instrument to fight rural poverty. However, moves like the allocation of ₹4,400 crore for clean air; and the announcement of linking one lakh gram panchayats through BharatNet are welcome (Front page, “Booster short,” Feb. 02).

Ms. Sitharaman has ‘peppered’ her marathon Union Budget speech with quotes from Thiruvalluvar(Tamil sage poet) , Aauvaiyar (Tamil saint poetess), Kalidas (Sanskrit poet) and Dinanath Koul (Kashmiri poet) and references to India’s ‘past glory’ as an economic power. But they do not act as a stimulus to growth in industry, manufacturing, agriculture and services. Platitudes and hackneyed phrases generously employed make little budgetary sense. Catchphrases like ‘aspirational India’; ‘economic development’; and ‘Caring India’ in themselves make no difference. The Budget is proof that the government is clueless about the economy in these stressed and unsettled times.

The Minister has spoken of ‘ease of living’ and ‘bringing happiness’ to people in her long-winding Budget speech. But the Budget lacks in concrete proposals to bolster the economy. It was a missed opportunity to lay down a roadmap on how to pull the economy out of the slump. The Minister has reiterated the goal of $5 trillion economy by 2024. But it looks unachievable simply because an average of no less than 9% growth rate now looks unachievable.

The Minister has not sketched out her plan for boosting consumption and private investment and creating jobs. The reduction in the allocation of funds for MGNREGS will only aggravate rural distress. Similarly, the cut in food subsidies will adversely impact on the impoverished people and their nutritional status. There is no significant measure in the Budget for the impoverished masses to cheer. The budget is by no means pro-poor or ‘populist’; still the Sensex has, somewhat inexplicably, slumped by nearly 1,000 points. Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s promise of jobs, unemployment, now an all-time high, has got only scant space in the budget. It is disappointing that health and education have not been prioritised for allocation of additional funds.

The planned partial disinvestment of government stake in LIC has come in for a lot of flak and rightly so. The promise of ‘doubling farmer income’ by 2022 becomes empty without a word on ‘minimum support price’ in the budget. The fiscal deficit target is 3.3% of the GDP; it has had to be increased to 3.8% for the current fiscal. It is also a moment to reflect on whether the social unrest due to divisive measures like CAA does not deter foreign investment. The income tax cut and abolition of dividend distribution tax are marginally beneficial, but disproportionately hyped up. The government is yet to acknowledge that the economic challenges are not just cyclical, but structural too. There is nothing substantial in the run-of-the-mill (and pedestrian) Budget to suggest that acche din is in the offing or anywhere in sight.

G. David Milton

The Sunday editorial, “No fireworks”, considers it premature to pronounce any verdict on the Budget, except linking its likely impact to the economy’s performance in the next four quarters. It is time we give up the notion that Budget proposals can command the economy and steer it in a predetermined direction. The economy has been evolving faster than before, with changing demographics driving the demand for goods and services in unpredictable ways. Many segments like the automobile industry are on the cusp of a major transformation in terms of changing customer preferences and the imminent switchover to electric vehicles. Global trade developments and world oil supplies and prices, often unforeseen and uncontrollable, wield considerable influence on the economy.

A Budget neither can be exceedingly good nor egregiously bad; it can at best be a mixed bag of good proposals, mixed opportunities, and questionable policies.

One expects the Opposition to criticise the Budget’s perceived omissions and flaws while mustering the honesty to welcome proposals that may help to revive the economy. Trashing the budget as irredeemably unproductive is immature.

367,2020/02/03,Differing trajectories of legacy and social media,"When the Finance Minister was presenting her second Budget, we were interacting with readers in Vijayawada at an open house session. These interactions not only provide valuable feedback to the editorial team, but also help readers understand how a newspaper works. During these interactions, we have been asked about the demands of a deadline, the changing nature of the information ecology, competitive pressures from other platforms such as social media and television, and this newspaper’s emphasis on secular values, which one reader felt was a sign of bias.

Legacy media and digital media

I explained that the legacy media developed and honed its skills from a deep desire for change. From the journalism of Thomas Paine — an Englishman whose writing inspired the American rebellion against the British, defended the cause of revolution in France, and challenged slavery — each century witnessed pioneers across continents who yearned for free and open societies.

One issue that was discussed was of freedom of expression versus accountability. The idea of journalism is to empower people and minimise harm rather than widen the divide and fan violence. The editorial decision to not carry inflammatory content is a manifestation of this desire and cannot be termed as censorship.

Students were keen to know about the transformations caused by digitalisation. They asked what changes are being made in newsrooms to cope with these challenges. The legacy media had 300 years to define its role and refine it for the needs of citizens. The years also saw political movements such the anti-colonial struggle, resistance to fascism, the movement for democracy, women’s suffrage, the anti-apartheid struggle and labour movements that demanded less exploitative working environments.

On the other hand, the digital media revolution is less than two decades old. It started as a huge democratising venture. However, the emergence of behemoths at Silicon Valley and the ability of the state to selectively switch on and switch off connectivity are disturbing. Journalists are trying to negotiate this reality through multiple means. The means include challenging state-imposed restrictions in the court of law, spreading media literacy, and engaging in dialogue with technology companies.

What happens when disinformation spreads fast in cyberspace? Readers will be reading this column a day before Facebook’s 16th birthday. Facebook was launched on February 4, 2004, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The consolidation of technology companies in controlling the information flow has taken place in less than a decade. After denying for nearly 15 years that they are in the profession of publishing, platform companies now acknowledge their role in the spread of misinformation and malicious propaganda. For instance, Facebook has unveiled its plan to create an independent ‘oversight’ board to make decisions on how the network should be moderated. It insists that the panel, which will hear its first ‘cases’ in 2020, will have the power to override decisions it makes over contentious material and influence new policy.

Deviousness of state institutions

In this dichotomy between the market and metrics-driven requirements of the digital platforms, and journalism driven by core values, citizens are becoming oblivious to the deviousness of various state institutions. Official documents are supposed to contain carefully collated data based on rigorous methodology. Earlier, there was trust in the credibility of official documents. Journalists would analyse the content of these documents rather than looking at the process of how these documents were produced. However, in the last few years, there seems to major erosion in the way official documents are produced. Rigorous methods have given way for rhetoric and grandiloquence. For instance, Chapter 7 of the latest Economic Survey is supposed to assess public sector banks. However, pages 150 and 151 are based on reports from Wikipedia. If the defining macroeconomic document of the country is going to be based on Wikipedia entries, it makes a journalist’s job much more difficult.

369,2020/02/03,"A day after confusion, Mumbai Bagh protest enters eighth day","A day after attempts were made by some groups to call off the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protest at Nagpada, the agitation, which has now come to be known as Mumbai Bagh, entered its eighth day on Sunday.

Confusion and high drama had prevailed on Saturday at the sit-in being held by women against the CAA on Morland Road after a section of the protesters decided to withdraw the protest as the police told the volunteers to vacate the area saying they did not have permission for it.

However, soon after the announcement was made that the protest was being called off, a huge crowd came to the site and started raising slogans. Following this, the plan was given up and the demonstration continued.

Talking to PTI on Sunday, Feroze Mithiborwala, one of the organisers of the protest, said, “Despite the attempts to sabotage the Mumbai Bagh protest by certain inside elements as well as by the police, the protest continues. We are now stronger and more resolute than before.”

“The all-women protest, which began on the night of January 26, entered the eighth day on Sunday. We request the Mumbai Police to cooperate with the organisers of this peaceful protest,” he said.

“Mumbai Bagh has become another Shaheen Bagh and it has successfully resisted all attempts to end the protest,” he said. Mr. Mithiborwala appealed to the citizens to join the agitation in large numbers and show solidarity with the protesters.

Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union president Aishe Ghosh, who visited the protest site at 10.30 p.m. on Saturday to give a speech, was stopped by the police from using a megaphone saying the use of loudspeaker or public address system was prohibited after 10 p.m.. Ms. Ghosh addressed the gathering without the megaphone.

“When Ms. Ghosh arrived there, the police told the organisers that they could not use loudspeakers or public address system as the 10 p.m. deadline had ended. They were asked to remove the sound boxes as well,” a police official said.

371,2020/02/03,Yechury calls for Gandhian civil disobedience to counter NPR,"Gandhian civil disobedience is the only way to counter the National Population Register (NPR), which is set to begin on April 1, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said on Sunday.

“The protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), NPR, and National Register of Citizens (NRC) is an issue of people’s unity. Tricolor is the symbol of these protests. The youth is leading the protest against the assault on our secular, democratic republic. As the NPR is to begin on April 1, the only protest could be to tell them ‘hum jawab nahi denge (we will not give the answer)’. Gandhian civil disobedience is the only way to counter the NPR,” Mr. Yechury said at the concluding session of the two-day Mumbai Collective at Y B Chavan Centre.

Slamming the Bharatiya Janata Party for blaming the Opposition, especially the Congress and the Left, for being the force behind the protests against the CAA and the NRC, particularly in Shaheen Bagh, Mr. Yechury said the unprecedented scenes have emerged where the agitations have been taken over by the youth and no political leader is required to lead it. “We all are walking behind them. These youngsters are the modern soldiers of modern India who will decide how India will be in future.”

Countering the Central government’s recent statements claiming that the NPR and the NRC are not interlinked, Mr. Yechury said it had been told over 10 times in parliament that the NPR would be the basis of the NRC. “Those who are marked D (=doubtful) in the NPR will not find their names in the NRC.”

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MP Supriya Sule, who was also among the panellists, said the government is diverting the attention to unnecessary controversies. “The CAA is not about Hindus and Muslims. It is an assault on the poor. It is an attack on tribals, nomadic tribes, and many who have no documents with them. It is time to say this loudly.”

Ms. Sule said irrespective of what is happening in different universities of the country, the Maharashtra government aspires to make Mumbai University a hub of modern, liberal, and democratic discourse.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/dm01zv/article30722418.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMSULE,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/yechury-calls-for-gandhian-civil-disobedience-to-counter-npr/article30722417.ece
372,2020/02/03,Objective is to push country towards civil war: activist,"Bombay High Court lawyer and author Abhinav Chandrachud on Sunday said a very compelling argument can be made in front of the court that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is unconstitutional.

“You have left out atheists from the CAA. Why have you left out Jews? Someone answered that they had Israel. Then there are countries for Christians as well. So this argument doesn’t hold. The CAA also excludes people fleeing racial prosecution and gender discrimination. Then the claim that the CAA gives citizenship to people on humanitarian grounds is also wrong,” Mr. Chandrachud said.

He was speaking at the concluding day of the two-day Mumbai Collective at Y B Chavan Centre. “As far as I can read into this, a very compelling argument can be made in front of the court that the Act is unconstitutional,” he said.

Harsh Mander, a social activist, termed the CAA and the NRC an unfinished agenda of the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh from the time of Partition.

“I think what we are seeing today in opposition to it is the unfinished business of our freedom struggle. I fear the situation may turn more communal in the coming four years of the government. The government is working with two objectives — to keep Indian Muslims in a constant state of fear and to create such a deep divide between the communities which will take the country to the brink of a civil war,” he alleged.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/objective-is-to-push-country-towards-civil-war-activist/article30722401.ece
373,2020/02/03,Poison will reach other places as well: Tarigami,"“Kashmir is expendable, but this is just the beginning. The poison will reach other places as well,” Mohammad Yousuf Tarigami, a four-time MLA from Kashmir’s Kulgam district and leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist), said in Mumbai on Sunday.

He tore into the Central government for claiming to have restored normalcy in Kashmir, but expressed faith in the youth. Mr. Tarigami was speaking with journalist and author Raghu Karnad at a session titled ‘What’s happening in Kashmir’ as part of Mumbai Collective.

The CPI (M) leader was the first political leader from Kashmir to hold a press conference after the removal of Article 370, and along with others, moved the Supreme Court against it.

Describing the run-up to Article 370 being scrapped, Mr. Tarigami said, “Suddenly, one day they shut down the Amarnath Yatra, told the tourists to leave. The BJP had called for a meeting of its senior leaders in Delhi and we knew something was wrong. All political leaders of Kashmir met on August 4. That same night, the phone lines were disconnected. After that, we did not know what happened in the outside world. But [the Narendra] Modi government has done something that brought our youth out of slumber and I thank him for that. I am a Kashmiri Muslim, my religion did not teach me to discriminate. ‘Mazhab nahi sikhata, apas me bair rakhna’.”

Speaking on the accession of Jammu and Kashmir to India, he said, “We rejected the appeal of Muslim Pakistan back then, chose Hindustan. The Hindu Maharaja was reluctant to go with India and Gandhiji also did not side with him. But when Pakistan sent militants, we said, ‘No, we will not go by force’.”

Mr. Tarigami said Kashmir was annexed to India after negotiations for five months, based on certain guarantees. “The Constituent Assembly argued and passed [Article] 370 for Kashmir, the [article] that was buried on August 5. On August 5, you broke the heart of every Kashmiri. Back then, we made a relationship with secular India. They are claiming normalcy in Kashmir and that not a single bullet has been fired. But look at the bullets fired in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. We will ask you for hisab (answers), you will have to give it. Kashmir is expendable, but this is just the beginning. The poison will reach other places as well,” the CPI (M) leader said.

He lauded the courage of the youth and women leading protests in the country.

Replying to a question from an audience member about Kashmiri Pandits, Mr. Tarigami said, “I have no hesitation to say Kashmiri Pandits were forced to leave their houses out of fear. Even then I told the Governor these people have been driven out. Kashmir is their own house. The day they return, it will be like Eid or Mahashivratri.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/qo38pi/article30722371.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMTARIGAMI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/poison-will-reach-other-places-as-well-tarigami/article30722372.ece
374,2020/02/03,"We are all migrants, we are all mixed, says author Tony Joseph","Journalist and author Tony Joseph on Sunday spoke about how contending versions of nationalism have converted history into a battleground.

Speaking at a Mumbai Collective session titled ‘Who are We? History and Hindutva’, Mr. Joseph said in one version, Taj Mahal is a symbol of national heritage, Mahtma Gandhi is a hero, and Nathuram Godse a villain, while in the other version, Taj Mahal is a symbol of national humiliation, Gandhi is a villain, and Godse a hero.

“One version is what we have grown up with, since the freedom struggle. But we also have a different conception of nationalism which has also been with us for a century, and which has become more dominant in recent years. That conception of nationalism, unlike the earlier one which is exclusive rather than inclusive, is more narrower than wider, and it considers people of an imagined monolithic majority community to be the only true nationals and citizens and the rest to be secondary or perhaps unnecessary,” Mr. Joseph said, adding it is in this narrow or an exclusive version of nationalism that Taj Mahal is a symbol of national humiliation since it was commissioned by those who came from outside, Gandhi is a villain for trying to create a common platform for all Indians, and Godse is a hero.

Mr. Joseph said this alternative version of nationalism is completely imported from 20th century Europe where the idea first took root that for nations to be nations, they need to have one language, one religion, one culture, one race, and one leader, to set it apart from every other nation. “This is the kind of vision that led to two world wars, unimaginable destruction, and of course the rise of Hitler and Mussolini. The world learned from that misery and what that kind of nationalism led to, and junked it in favour of liberal, democratic ideals,” he said.

According to Mr. Joseph, the kind of history that Hindutva wants to erase is the history that says we are not a monoculture, that we created a unique civilisation out of multiple streams of migrations, and that we brought very different groups of people to this land of ours.

He walked down a large audience through the various classes of migration, which bear a signature on all population groups today. “We are all migrants, we are all mixed,” Mr. Joseph said, concluding that the phrase ‘unity in diversity’ is not a cliche.

“It’s the most accurate description of India. Any attempt, to shape it, and to discipline it into a monoculture is prone to mishaps, because that’s not the way we have been or will be,” he said. The session was chaired by professor T. Jayaraman of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/society/o924t9/article30724214.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/27SMtony1jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/we-are-all-migrants-we-are-all-mixed-says-author-tony-joseph/article30722363.ece
375,2020/02/03,‘They actually tried to repeat Godhra’,"The stage when those who were against Prime Minister Narendra Modi were called jihadis and anti-nationalists has passed, and now the country has a ‘goli maaro’ culture, said Arfa Khanum Sherwani while speaking at Mumbai Collective on Sunday. Ms. Sherwani, who is a senior editor with The Wire, was part of a session titled ‘The clampdown on dissent’, chaired by Mumbai University professor Mrudul Nile. They were joined by senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Subhashini Ali, a former MP from Kanpur, and president of All India Democratic Women’s Association.

Describing the situation in Uttar Pradesh since the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) came into force, Ms. Ali said, “Post-CAA, people were killed only in BJP-ruled States, including 22 in U.P. They say it’s a police reaction to violence and provocation,” she said.

Ms. Ali spoke of the violence inflicted upon those who participated in the mass protests held in the State on December 19, the martyrdom day of (Ramprasad) Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan. “During one protest, Sadaf Jafar was filming and she pointed out to cops a few miscreants who were disturbing the protest. She was attacked and not the people she was complaining about. She was beaten brutally and abused by male policemen, kept for hours in the police station. This brought on her period and she was bleeding without anything for two days. Only after she was moved to jail did she get whatever she needed.”

Ms. Ali also said many young men were stripped and beaten in jail and The Hindu journalist Omar Rashid was taken in by the police and released after a lot of abuse and threats. “Tumhari dadhi ka ek ek baal noch denge (we will pull out every hair in your beard) — they said to him,” she said.

Speaking about the people who died in the violence in U.P., Ms Ali said families of only two had received post-mortem reports, hence their kin could not file FIRs.

“Meanwhile, recovery notices have been issued. One such person is so poor, he doesn’t have a wall to his house but has been issued a notice of ₹2 lakh. Videos have surfaced of police firing in cold blood. They actually tried to repeat Godhra,” Ms. Ali said.

She spoke of how a police officer had claimed on the news that a mob tried to burn 36 policemen alive by locking them in a room. “But when I went there, I found out people had actually locked them to protect them and there was no sign of arson,” Ms. Ali said. At a protest at Ghantaghar, she said, the women’s toilet was locked, lights shut, and cops went to steal their blankets and biscuits. “They may have killed people but have not been able to kill dissent,” Ms. Ali said.

Ms. Sherwani spoke of the two camps protesting at Shaheen Bagh — one pro-CAA and one anti-CAA — and the polarisation of the nation. “Between 2014 and 2019, we would be called anti-nationalist or jihadis. Anything you said against [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi became anti-India, Modi symbolised the nation, but that stage has also passed. Now there is a clear ‘goli maaro’ culture.”

The journalist spoke of how a speech she gave at Aligarh Muslim University was doctored and used against her. “Some students insisted that they wanted to protest as Muslims but I said no, let them be secular protests. Of my 24-minute speech, the BJP IT cell cropped 30-40 seconds and accused me of being an Islamist. But what is more serious is that these posts were re-tweeted from official BJP handles. They said I was trying to establish an Islamic state. This is a new low and a direct threat to journalists,” she said.

According to the journalist, the 2020s are going to be ‘do or die’ age. “They are very frustrated. They never thought there would be so many people out on streets.”

Speaking about the role of the media, Ms. Sherwani said, “Two senior editors went to Shaheen Bagh and it was called historic…They wanted to say Shaheen Bagh has become like Kashmir (in a lockdown…They wanted to come in through barricades but also bring in police. As a journalist, do we need the police? All you need is a pen or a mic. Otherwise, you were there to spread propaganda. Republic TV is trying to demonise the whole thing by calling them violent protesters.”

She also said there was at least a pretense of democracy between 2014 and 2019, but even that is gone now. “They are saying [indirectly] that this is clear dictatorship. For that they need to establish fear.” According to Ms. Sherwani, the base of the protests need to be widened to include all sections of society. “It is very easy for the ruling party to brand these protests as sectarian. Like any movement, there would be fatigue. Now they are polarising it because they can’t give us vikas (development), so are giving us polarisation, Islamophobia and repression.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/isy5ax/article30722356.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03BMSUBHASHINI,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/they-actually-tried-to-repeat-godhra/article30722357.ece
376,2020/02/03,"Flyers from Thailand, Singapore also screened","On instructions from the government, the Mumbai airport on Sunday extended the process of universal thermal screening for signs of coronavirus to cover passengers on flights coming from Thailand and Singapore, in addition to China and Hong Kong.

Doctors from the Airport Health Organisation screened 1,866 passengers over the weekend. From January 18, the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has been thermal screening passengers as a matter of precaution.

Officials said screening of flights coming from Thailand and Singapore was only being done as a matter of precaution. In an advisory on Sunday evening, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said Indians should refrain from travel to China. In case of travel, on return from China they could be quarantined. It said anyone with a travel history to China since January 15 and from now on could be quarantined.

Of the two airlines connecting Mumbai to the neighbouring country — Air China to Beijing and RwandAir to Guangzhou — the latter has temporarily discontinued its services in view of the outbreak. Singapore Airlines, Air India, IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir are some of the airlines that fly to Singapore and/or Thailand.

As per a commitment given by CSMIA, the airport has now expanded its existing passenger safety measures in compliance with the latest directive given by the World Health Organization in case any traveller is detected with the symptoms in question.

Such a passenger will immediately be shifted to Kasturba Hospital, the designated isolation hospital earmarked for CSMIA on advice of the Airport Health Organisation team. The airport also shares a daily report with the ministry on the scanning of passengers.

The Airport Health Organisation team in Mumbai has activated a health counter and thermal scanners at the pre-immigration area for the arriving passengers. Signages have also been put up asking passengers arriving from any place other than mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Thailand, but who might have travelled to any of these areas recently, to self-report to the doctors.",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/v0nexx/article30722345.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bmairport,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/flyers-from-thailand-singapore-also-screened/article30722346.ece

378,2020/02/03,Photo exhibition aims to create awareness of inclusivity,"A photo exhibition to create awareness about sustainable and inclusive urbanism was opened at the Kala Ghoda Art Festival this weekend. The exhibition, which also included a panel discussion and a heritage walk, will be on till February 9.

The exhibition has two sections, the first being ‘Unequal Scenes’ which includes aerial shots of Mumbai that capture the contrast in the cityscape. The photographs were taken by New York-based photographer Johnny Miller, who said the project aligns itself highly with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

“Mumbai is a city of contradictions, which is evident from the aerial scenes that exhibit exceedingly sharp contrasts between single-storey slums and developed areas in the city,” Mr. Miller said.

The second section, ‘AccessAbility’, features portraits and personal accounts of Indians and Swedes with disabilities. These include works by Indian and Swedish photographers Sunil Thakkar and Marcus Marcetic, respectively.

Mr. Thakkar said, “We have a habit of judging and discriminating between people based on one flaw or one undermining quality of theirs, while ignoring all the other aspects of a human being. It may take time, but if even one person changes their outlook towards the specially abled into a more positive and accepting one, I as a photographer will have succeeded.”

Anna Lekvall, Consul General of Sweden in Mumbai, expressed her support towards promoting the rights of every human to live with dignity, irrespective of economic background or physical challenges. She said art is different yet universal, whether it be in India or Sweden.

“The purpose of exhibitions is to sensitise people and raise questions about how to include people and how to build societies. I love urban spaces and I have lived in many of them. Sweden works with smart city programmes and we talk on innovative ideas to reform a city. The key is to not stop developing areas, but to develop them with a sustainable mind which welcomes people and nature,” said Ms. Lekvall.

Elsa Marie DSilva, founder and chief executive officer of Red Dot Foundation, said, “We wanted to bring to the collective consciousness of people in showing them how a city can leave people behind, whether it is in terms of economic backgrounds, inequality, even ability. It’s important to experience a city through these lenses.”

She added that a city should be planned in a way that it is easier for everyone to live in them and cited examples of infrastructure and public transport in India, which have room for improvement when it comes to facilities for disabled people.

Smita Gandhi, whose 25-year-old son Sean Gandhi was featured in the AccessAbility series, said, “As a mother, acceptance is very crucial. The society is slightly cruel. When it comes to weddings, he comes with me and enjoys himself, but not everybody present speaks to him. Sean is aware of everything, but what has helped him is his confidence. Including everyone is easier said than done.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/jh3zse/article30722314.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03bm-UnequalScenes,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/photo-exhibition-aims-to-create-awareness-of-inclusivity/article30722315.ece
379,2020/02/03,‘Every human is an artist’,"In an old building near Dahisar, a class of slum children is engaged in a discussion on film scripts that they have to shoot within a day. The all-child crew includes a director giving instructions to an actor, while another child with a smartphone is capturing the scene. Their classroom has transformed into the protagonist’s living room set with the help of an art director, also from their class.

“I did not know anything about films before, but now I have written a film and we are making it with the help of our friends at the centre,” says Poonam, a student at Touching Lives, a non-profit organisation that works largely on community development through education, healing and arts.

New skills

In addition to other activities, the organisation has started filmmaking workshops to instil storytelling abilities in children. They get acquainted with the fundamentals of cinema, its language and the required collaborative work with screenwriters, actors, camera operators and editors.

The 16-year-old organisation aims to use filmmaking as a therapeutic medium in classrooms and communities through screenings. The children are guided by subject experts from the film industry and former students of Prague Film School. The vision is to hold a Touching Lives Children Film Festival soon that would showcase films on children, and those made by children.

“With filmmaking, we tried to bring out aspects of life, including decision making, critical thinking, problem solving, and communication among the children,” says Sonia Mackwani, founder director, Touching Lives Welfare Trust. “We are showing films that encourage them to discuss the challenges and issues of their own lives and allow them to look within.”

Throughout the exercise s , the children came up with ideas ranging from personal stories told through documentaries to fictionalised versions of their aspirations, and films with universal messages.

A documentary produced during one such workshop follows the life of Sonam, a student-turned-trainer with the organisation who has overcome several hardships to become a role model for other girls from a similar background.

“Personalities of children changed in just the first two days as they were getting to know something beyond regular education,” says Ms. Mackwani. “They are not just able to express themselves, but also universal and serious themes like LGBTQI issues, social stigmas, rape and topics of self-image and kindness.” says Ms. Mackwani.

Finding themselves

According to Masa Hilcisin, co-founder of the organisation’s Media and Films Initiative, these workshops help in the children’s skill development as cinema is one of the strongest industries in Mumbai. But, of course, the larger idea is to inculcate healing through cinema. “The idea of sharing knowledge goes beyond teaching. From the very beginning, we wanted to introduce cinema as a healing tool. This is another level of the programme which complements the knowledge of the tools of film production,” says Ms. Hilcisin, who teaches filmmaking at the Prague Film School.

Through each workshop, the centre promotes the healing power of cinema and finding oneself through their own stories. These are then reflected in the short films which the children make. “The most significant part for me is the core value of educating young people,” says Ms. Hilcisin. “Every single human being is an artist. The whole idea was to give space for such creative exercise and grow together.”",mumbai,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/vuhxxy/article30722268.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/30BMFilm-workshop,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/every-human-is-an-artist/article30722269.ece

381,2020/02/03,India U-19 star makes second coming in cricket as U.S. captain,"Growing up in the Mumbai suburb of Malad, Saurabh Netravalkar always dreamt of playing cricket for India. He was good at academics, but cricket was his first love. The hours spent bowling at the nets finally paid off, with the tall left-arm seamer scalping 30 wickets in the Cooch Behar Trophy (2008-09) and breaking into the Indian team for the 2010 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup in New Zealand. K.L. Rahul and Mayank Agarwal, current internationals, were his teammates then.

Despite emerging as India’s leading wicket-taker at the World Cup, it took him three more years to earn a place in Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy team. A three-wicket haul in his first-class debut against Karnataka was not enough to cement his place in the side. By then, he had earned an engineering degree from Sardar Patel Institute of Technology in Andheri. In 2015, when a chance to pursue a Master’s degree in computer science at Cornell University, New York, came up, he decided to move on. He said, “I had to be a little practical, I wasn’t making it at the first-class level and you have to look for a Plan B.”

Netravalkar said he thought his cricketing ambitions were over. “I did not even carry my kits with me to the U.S. I always loved to study and was interested in computer science. So when I got the opportunity, I moved on.” Being a Mumbaikar, it was not easy to start afresh. In a country where cricket is still a niche sport, Netravalkar had to rely on the television or browse the Internet to keep tabs on cricketing affairs. He often called up his U-19 mates to chat, but never dreamt that he would be marking his bowling run-up one day.

Cut to 2020. On a bright, sunny morning at Sachin Tendulkar Gymkhana in Kandivali, 28-year-old Netravalkar is training with the members of the U.S. cricket team. The Americans are set to travel to Kathmandu for a tri-nation series, and the former Mumbai pacer is their captain. “I always tell them about Mumbai’s cricketing culture, which teaches you not to give up. I want our team to imbibe that spirit,” he said.

During his playing days, Netravalkar had shared the dressing room with Wasim Jaffer, Siddhesh Lad, Suryakumar Yadav and Shardul Thakur. “I would train with Shardul and Siddhesh. It’s so good to see them come so far,” he said. Though Jaffer switched to Vidarbha in the Ranji Trophy after the India and Mumbai stint, the other three are part of Mumbai’s Ranji squad this season and are known names on the international and IPL circuit. In between training sessions in Mumbai’s suburbs, the pacer is keeping tabs on the ongoing U-19 World Cup in South Africa and is happy to see the Indian colts making it count.

The Kandivali training facility is a familiar venue for Netravalkar, having practised here in his younger days, playing for Payyade Cricket Club. “It’s pretty nostalgic to be playing where I grew up playing cricket. And obviously to represent a nation is a pride in itself, a second chance life gave me,” he said. Netravalkar also fondly remembers training at Oval Maidan, Wankhede Stadium and the MCA Academy in BKC, and playing under coach Satish Sawant since his U-17 days and for the Air India team.

Netravalkar said, “When studying in college there [U.S.], I realised there is something called American College Cricket and inter-college tournaments are held. After my studies were over, I joined Oracle and moved to San Francisco. Sangram Sawant, my coach in Mumbai, hooked me up with a club there.”

By 2018, Netravalkar was eligible to represent the U.S. after the ICC lowered the minimum residency eligibility from four years to three. “That was a great opportunity,” he said. Now, as the U.S. captain, he wants to make his presence felt.

All eyes on the World Cup

When Saurabh Netravalkar travelled to New Zealand with the India U-19 team for the 2010 World Cup, he was excited. “It was the first time we were playing for the country. It was a big thing for all of us,” he said. Under the captaincy of Ashok Menaria, the team finished sixth.

For the team members, it turned out to be a learning experience. As the India U-19 team gears up for World Cup 2020 semifinal against Pakistan on February 4, Netravalkar is happy to see three city players — Yashasvi Jaiswal, Atharva Ankolekar and Divyaansh Saxena — in the squad. “I am following all the games and they are reminding me of my U-19 days. Hope they make it big.”

Over the years, Mumbai has produced quite a few cricketers who have gone on to represent India in the U-19 World Cup. Prithvi Shaw led the team to the title in 2018, Sarfaraz Khan and Arman Jaffer were part of the side that finished runners-up in 2016.

383,2020/02/03,Grandma goes to school - New start,"When my grandma Sarojini was young, people believed that girls did not need an education. All they needed to know was cooking and housework. Of course, the girls had other ideas. They wanted to go to school like their brothers, read books and keep up with them. But, there were just a few schools for girls in India.

Grandma lived in Krishnanagar, a flourishing town. Some missionaries from England had settled there and they knew that education was important. They set up a school for girls to teach skills. But the people were wary. They suspected it was a trap to convert the girls to Christianity. So no one sent the girls to school and it remained empty.

A voice of reason

Grandma had lost her father when she was a baby. Her father was studying in college when he died. Her mother remembered how much he loved his studies. She wanted Sarojini to go to school too. Sarojini’s grandpa was a flourishing lawyer and he agreed with her. He called his friends over and discussed the matter with them.

“What’s the harm if girls go to school? It will be good if they know to read and write,” he argued. “And, it’s a lady who will teach them.”

“What if she tries to convert her forcibly?” asked a friend.

“We’ll take the girls out if she does,” said grandma’s grandpa firmly.

“What if they ‘lose caste’? We won’t be able to find grooms for them!”

“Rubbish!” said grandma’s grandpa. “They can take a bath before getting into the house when they come from school. That should be enough.”

So word went round and a dozen little girls including grandma went to school. There was a bit of argument when people realised that the girls were not from the same social background. But grandma’s grandpa dismissed the objection saying it was true of all schools and colleges.

“But Phuli is going too and her dad sells oil!” objected grandma’s aunt.

“So what? I’ve seen the girls playing hide-and-seek with her,” said grandpa. “If you don’t mind the girls playing with her you shouldn’t mind her studying with them.”

“Whatever happens, the girls must have a bath before coming home. The maids can wait with their clothes by the riverside,” said grandma’s grandma firmly.

The girls jumped for joy. The Khore river near their school had been out of bounds for them, till now.

And so grandma started going to school!",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/w3iy9c/article30726681.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07YTSERIALjpg,https://www.thehindu.com/children/grandma-goes-to-school-new-start/article30726682.ece
384,2020/02/03,Josh’s Nightmare,"“I’m so sleepy,” nine-year-old Josh said, stifling a yawn. Closing the story book he was reading, he kept it on the dresser and snuggled under the bed covers, completely forgetting his promise to his mother that he would never sleep without brushing his teeth.

In his sleep he saw himself in a strange place. He was being chased by fairies holding tubes of toothpastes and tooth brushes.

He ran and ran until he left the fairies far behind. Panting heavily, he stopped for a moment, staring at the distant sky, thick black smoke was curling out of a chimney. He slowly crept towards the house.

“Don’t go near that house,” a small girl in white clothes, appeared beside him, taking him by surprise.

“Why?” Josh asked.

“That is Bacteria Bungalow,” the girl pointed to the poky little house. “It is owned by witch Tricky Tartar and her husband the wizard Painful Plaque. They live here with their children Germs.”

“Oh no,” Josh said, moving back.

Over the years

“Earlier that house was spotlessly white, but the witch and wizard forcefully occupied the house and now due to their dirty deeds, it is covered with black stains. It’s doors and windows have crevices and cavities in them and its walls are stained by dark marks,” the girl explained.

As Josh looked closely at the house, he realized that the girl was right, there were just one or two small white patches on the exterior of the black bungalow, revealing the fact that the bungalow had been white earlier.

“Hide behind that tree,” the girl dragged Josh behind a tall tree, as a witch and a wizard dressed in black robes, wearing long black peaked caps, emerged out of the house. Lighting a bonfire, they danced around it.

“They always celebrate when they claim a new victim. Somebody’s tooth must have got infected with germs,” the girl said.

Josh clapped his hand to his mouth, hoping fervently that the witch and wizard weren’t celebrating his tooth getting infected.

“I was feeling lazy to brush tonight before sleeping,” he said to the small girl.

“Oh no,” the girl looked at him in dismay.

Soon the witch and wizard were joined by many other witches and wizards all dressed in black. Many baby wizards and witches, dressed in black T-shirts and black Bermudas also joined them.

The witch Tricky Tartar had climbed onto a stool and was saying in her loud and booming voice, while waving her broom in the air - “Witches, wizards and Germs, lend me thy pointed ears. I swear upon your bad breath, upon your decaying teeth, that I will infect every person who forgets to brush their teeth.”

Josh started crying.

“Right now my Foul Factory is currently making small, twin-forked spears which will make our work of infecting the human teeth much easier,” Tricky Tartar said.

“Yay,” the baby witches and wizards danced. “Mama is super.”

“We will make Bacteria Bungalow strong,” Tricky Tartar said.

“What can I do so that Bacteria Bungalow disappears from the world and the witches and wizards and germs have no home to plan their attacks on our teeth?” Josh asked the small girl.

“First you must destroy the baby witches and wizards called Germs by brushing your teeth well and gargling after every meal. Once the germs are destroyed, Tricky Tartar and Painful Plaque won’t be able to harm you. And don’t forget to eat healthy food that doesn’t harm the teeth.”

“That’s easy peasy,” Josh smiled. “I’ll never forget to brush my teeth at night, no matter how tired I am. I promise that every time I eat chocolate and junk food, I’ll be extra careful and I’ll also tell all my friends to brush their teeth twice a day and eat healthy food.”

“If you all do that, then soon Bacteria Bungalow will disappear from the world,” the girl smiled, revealing pearly white teeth.",children,https://www.thehindu.com/children/oth2dz/article30726405.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/07ytNightmare1,https://www.thehindu.com/children/joshs-nightmare/article30726406.ece

The Chatans attack the beautiful land of Taamara. And their target is the language. Sure enough, the people wake up one November morning to find that the letter ‘e’ has disappeared! Will they survive this?

The fumes of hatred threaten to submerge the town of Hasmukh, as no one is allowed to laugh. “The ashes of hate had settled on every leaf and flower.” How will Muskan, who cannot control her laughter, manage?

In Mabel’s Magnificent Mansion, Sundays were special days. For, that was when 39 cookers went on the stove and came off at the exact same time. All except one!

388,2020/02/03,Pondicherry Heritage Festival amix of eclectic performances,"Adishakti’s artistes stepped out of their forte of theatre to perform music in a surprise package at the ongoing Pondicherry Heritage Festival 2020.

The eclectic concert that featured an array of instruments and genres as far apart as ghazal and kathakali in what turned out to be a madcap evening of musical experimentation at the exquisitely old-world mansion, the Kariappa House.

Heritage is multi-dimensional, a lived experience and not just buildings... and to appreciate it, one has to be open-minded, inclusive and have a hybrid sensibility, said Vinay Kumar, Adishakti’s artistic director in his introduction.

The evening began with a whiff of All India Radio’s signature tune, which incidentally is the composition of Walter Kaufmann, a Czech Jewish refugee, who also worked at AIR in the 1930s.

Though they kept changing positions, the basic formation had Vinay (sax), Nimmy Raphel (drums), Abhay Dev Praful (cello/bass/vocal), Arvind Rane (timpany/drums), Apoorva Arthur (mizhavu, percussion used in Kerala’s traditional art form of koothu and koodiyattam), Anand Satheendran (harmonium), Sooraj (djembe, a rope-tuned goblet drum played with bare hands) and Meedhu Miriyam (bells).

Unique setlist

If, a rendition of ‘Khuda ka noor’, the version cast for posterity by Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan set the tone, ‘Viduthalai’ by Bharatiyar was all fire and brimstone, while ‘Beypore’, an MS Baburaj composition, also said to be a favourite of the legendary litteratuer Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, made for a unique setlist.

The evening concluded with Vinay’s rendition of a Kathakali padam from Nalacharitham (fourth day).",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/1ljgut/article30729386.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04PONDYLEADPIC,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/pondicherry-heritage-festival-a-mix-of-eclectic-performances/article30729387.ece

Speaking after inaugurating the alumni meet of the college, he said the draft Bill for upgrading the college into a university had been prepared and it would be introduced on the floor of the House in the forthcoming session of the Legislative Assembly.

Mr. Narayanasamy said the upgrade of the college would help bring in several significant steps in legal education. A Bench of the High Court in Puducherry on the lines of the one set up in Madurai was a felt need in the Union Territory.

393,2020/02/03,Puducherry medical college launches sleep laboratory,"The Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Research Institute (MGMCRI) has launched a sleep laboratory for furthering research into the relatively new area of study.

The “Christian Guilleminault Centre for Sleep Diagnostics and Research”, a sleep lab equipped with level 1 polysomnography offers comprehensive management of sleep disorders with multi-disciplinary services involving the departments of Pulmonary Medicine, ENT and Psychiatry.

The department of pulmonary medicine, MGMCRI, which is a constituent college of Sri Balaji Vidyapeeth also organised a one-day continuing medical education programme and workshop on “Sleep Apnoeas” on the occasion.

Inaugurating the lab, Subhash Chandra Parija, Vice-Chancellor of SBV in the presence of Prof. Hrudananda Mallick, Professor, Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi and President of Indian Society of Sleep Research, said, “Awareness about sleep disorders is less among people and inadequate sleep may result in multiple disorders. In our country, the diagnosis of sleep disorders goes unnoticed because of scant expertise as few centres available for sleep analysis.”

Personalised care

The sleep lab has a comfortable environment with personalised patient care by a team of experts, and will cater to the needs of the patients and play a major role in the management and diagnosing insomnia and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA).

Ravishankar, Dean MGMCRI, Nirmal Coumare, Medical Superintendent MGMCRI, Pajanivel, Head, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, MGMCRI, heads of various departments, faculty and staff were present during the inauguration.

395,2020/02/03,Surveillance cameras on the blink in many locations in Puducherry,"The closed-circuit TV camera (CCTV) surveillance system installed in several locations to enhance security and monitor traffic and law and order, have been non-operational for several months. For want of maintenance and other technical glitches, a number of CCTVs have become show pieces and are gathering dust.

According to an official, the police installed a little over 103 CCTVs at a cost of ₹2 crore under the Police Modernisation Fund of the Union Government in 2012. Of the 103 cameras, 63 had automatic night vision. The cameras were linked through Wi-Fi mode with the police control room in Gorimedu. The intention was to keep track of criminals and law breakers wherever instances of crime occurred.

In addition, the police had advised traders to install cameras in their establishments. But what is mind boggling is that most CCTVs have not been functional for the last few months, leaving the police and the traders in dilemma. There is lack of clarity on who should pay for the maintenance of CCTVs. The police now depend on footages recorded in surveillance cameras installed by resident welfare associations and private individuals to crack cases of crime such as murders.

“The CCTVs have not been functioning for long and we don’t know how to make them operational. None of the officials even bothered to rectify them. The visuals gathered from the surveillance cameras are a major source of information. The cameras have to be rectified immediately,” said a trader.

The CCTV cameras at the arterial Mahatm Gandhi Road have not been operational because of lack of maintenance.

According to S. Balou, general secretary of Puducherry Traders Federation, “the police have been insisting that traders install cameras in important thoroughfares to ensure fool proof security. But lack of maintenance by the police has been the major constraint. The system is not working on Mahatma Gandhi Road and on the stretch from Hotel Atithi to Muthialpet. Over 25 CCTVs installed in the new bus stand are not working and traders are removing the cameras.”

The cost of maintenance of the CCTVs was high and the police were not ready to give any assistance. If the police installed the surveillance cameras, the traders would take care of the annual maintenance and vice versa, he said.

“Puducherry, which was once a calm and tranquil town, is now becoming a busy location thanks to growth in various sectors and heavy inflow of tourists. It is the duty of the police to keep vigil either by deploying manpower or resorting to installation of latest gadgets. With most of the street lights non-functional, the residents face a constant fear and hence the surveillance cameras should be made functional immediately,” says V. Rajalakshmi, a resident.",puducherry,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/8jqil4/article30721769.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THPONDYCCTV,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/puducherry/surveillance-cameras-on-the-blink-in-many-locations/article30721771.ece
396,2020/02/03,‘Reading newspapers crucial to quizzing’,"Reading newspapers is most crucial to staying updated on current happenings, says Sourav S.S. of Government Higher Secondary School, Venjaramoodu, who teamed up with schoolmate Aswin V.J. to bag the first prize in the senior category in The Hindu Young World quiz here on Saturday.

Aswin too swears by newspapers. In fact, he notes down whatever he finds interesting in them during the half hour he devotes to his passion — quizzing — each day. Second prize winner in this year’s science quiz organised by the State government, Aswin says they get The Hindu at their school and read that invariably, besides other materials to stay ahead of the game.

Their win sends across the message that government schools are no less than private schools when it came to education, he says.

The first prize, Sourav says, was totally unexpected as the competition was tough, but their hard work and the support of their teachers and parents saw them through. It helped that Aswin and he had been a team for some six years now.

First appearance

A government school won top laurels in the junior category too. Sreehari S. of Government Boys Higher Secondary School, Mithirmala, is no stranger to first prizes but bagging the top spot in in his first appearance in the quiz is something special. It was almost touch and go. Sreehari and his partner Athreyon A.S. got the last question on the buzzer wrong and this trimmed their 10-point lead but only by five points, ensuring they lifted the championship.

The quiz was presented by Life Insurance Corporation of India. The regional sponsor was State Bank of India, and education partner, Amrita School of Engineering, Kollam.

397,2020/02/03,CAA-NRC combo a deadly weapon: Yogendra Yadav,"Calling the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) as black laws that can lead to the disenfranchisement of a large section of the Indian population, Swaraj Abhiyan president Yogendra Yadav said these laws would do to society what demonetisation did to the economy.

Speaking to press persons here on Sunday, he gave a call to people’s organisations across the country to be part of the united struggle against the CAA.

“The main purpose of the CAA is not to give citizenship to persecuted people, as the government tells us. This is meant for signalling purpose, to introduce two categories of citizens and to put Muslims in the second class. The CAA, along with the NRC, is a deadly weapon. The National Population Register is the NRC itself. Government officials will never visit any household for NRC. They will only come for NPR. The only way to oppose NRC is by stopping NPR itself,” said Mr. Yadav.

Revived spirit

He said that there was now an extraordinary movement in the country against these laws, which had revived the spirit of the national movement and the national symbols. A group of activists and personalities from across the country will meet in Mumbai on February 4, under the banner of ‘We the people of India’ to chart out the future course of the anti-CAA movement.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/caa-nrc-combo-a-deadly-weapon-yogendra-yadav/article30721798.ece
398,2020/02/03,District forest nurseries across Kerala,"Bolstering its production of seedlings to cater to the growing demand for indigenous plant species, the Forest and Wildlife Department is set to establish district forest nurseries across the State.

The proposed centres have been envisaged to ensure availability of seedlings all through the year.

While the department currently operates central forest nurseries at Kulathupuzha (in Kollam), Chettikulam (in Chalakudy, Thrissur), Karimpuzha (in Nilambur, Malappuram) and Kannavam (in Kannur), the district forest nurseries have been proposed to be set up in the other districts to enhance coverage of plant distribution.

Initially, the facilities will be established at Smrithivanam in Kasaragod; Kalpetta in Wayanad; the Vanasree forestry complex in Kozhikode; Muttikulangara in Palakkad; Idukki; Aruvappulam, near Konni in Pathanamthitta; and at the Central Prison in Poojappura, Thiruvananthapuram. Sales outlets will be attached to the nurseries. Similar plantations will come up in the remaining districts at a later stage.

Increasing interest

According to Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (Social Forestry) E. Pradeep Kumar, several initiatives of the government, including the mass afforestation drive (organised every year to mark World Environment Day) have generated interest among the public to plant trees wherever possible.

“We have been witnessing a marked change in the mindset of the public. Many people have begun to present saplings at wedding receptions and other functions. The increased awareness, coupled with the growing demand for pesticide-free farm produce, has spurred the move,” he said.

The district nurseries will be established using funds sanctioned by the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planting Authority (CAMPA). The State had received compensatory afforestation fund amounting to ₹81.59 crore last year.

399,2020/02/03,Additional 10-mld water for city,"The Kerala Water Authority (KWA) has said that it can now supply the capital city with an additional ten million litres of drinking water daily with the renovation of water treatment plants at Aruvikkara getting completed on Sunday.

The KWA had undertaken the renovation in four phases. The final phase was completed on Sunday morning and pumping was restarted from the 74-mld (million litres per day) and 86-mld plants that were shut down for 16 hours.

Water supply to the city is expected to be restored in full by Monday.

Requirement

The capital city requires 270-280 mld at present. In the second-phase work carried out on January 2, the KWA had equipped the raw water and clear water units of the 86-mld plant with 631-HP and 770-HP pumps.

In the fourth phase carried out over Saturday and early Sunday, the units were equipped with stand-by pumps of the same capacity.

The electrical substation at the KWA facility also was modernised as part of the renovation.

The KWA undertook the renovation to replace old pump sets and electrical equipment at its Aruvikkara facility.

400,2020/02/03,Poultry waste collection project faces resistance,"The city Corporation’s pilot project to collect and transport poultry waste is facing resistance from groups that were earlier involved in the illegal collection and dumping of such waste in various parts of the city. The health wing is now looking at ways to thwart the attempts to derail the collection mechanism.

According to an official of the Corporation’s health wing, the groups earlier involved in illegal collection of poultry waste are now employing various methods, including blocking of the collection vehicles.

“The Corporation has made an arrangement with a rendering plant based in Ernakulam for collection of poultry waste. The pilot has been on for the past three months. The waste has to reach there before 1.30 a.m. So, if the vehicles are delayed, it cannot be processed. Storage is also an issue as once it goes rotten, it is hard to render them. These groups are now using their vehicles to block our collection vehicles at various points to create delays, and ensure that it will not reach the plant on time. At one point, they got the local people to block the vehicle after telling them that the waste was to be dumped in the locality. We have now approached the police,” said the official.

The pilot project, which began initially in three health circles, is now active in 21 out of the city’s 25 health circles. Around 7 tonnes of poultry waste are now collected daily from these 21 circles, with the amount becoming as much as 10 tonnes in weekends.

More agencies

“These groups earlier used to collect poultry waste from one ward and dump in another ward, because they do not have a rendering facility of their own. With most of the shops and farms in these areas signing up with their Corporation, they have realised that their business will not run for long, which is why they are trying to scuttle this project,” said the official.

The Corporation, which is now depending on a single agency, plans to call for more agencies to collect poultry waste. The formal launch of the project is expected next month.",thiruvananthapuram,https://www.thehindu.com/static/theme/default/base/img/og-image.jpg,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/poultry-waste-collection-project-faces-resistance/article30721623.ece
401,2020/02/03,Super Bowl | Mahomes sparks Chiefs’ triumph,"Patrick Mahomes led a thrilling late comeback as the Kansas City Chiefs ended a 50-year wait for a Super Bowl crown with a 31-20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

The Chiefs quarterback Mahomes, later voted MVP, shrugged off an error-strewn start to the game to overturn a 20-10 fourth quarter deficit in a nail-biting contest at Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium.

The Super Bowl win was Kansas’ first NFL Championship since the triumph over the Minnesota Vikings in 1970.

And it owed everything to the nerve of Mahomes, who for the third straight game led the Chiefs back from a double-digit deficit to seal victory. “We never lost faith. Everybody on this team, no one had their head down and we found a way to win in the end,” said Mahomes.

He had looked out of sorts through the first three quarters, throwing two interceptions in the face of fierce pressure from the magnificent San Francisco defence.

But with the game on the line in the fourth quarter, Mahomes led his team on two long drives to set up touchdowns for tight end Travis Kelce and running back Damien Williams. Those scores put the Chiefs into a 24-20 lead and City made the game safe when Williams danced up the sideline for a 38-yard rushing score with 1min 12sec remaining.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/5j3vm/article30729069.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TH04BOWL,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/super-bowl-mahomes-sparks-chiefs-triumph/article30729070.ece
402,2020/02/03,Clifford Miranda named FC Goa interim coach,"Former India international Clifford Miranda has been named the interim coach of FC Goa and will work under Derrick Pereira, who has been appointed as the technical director for the remainder of the Indian Super League season.

Pereira has been with the club for the last three seasons, serving as the assistant coach in 2017-18 before taking up the role of the technical director last season.

In this role, he headed FC Goa’s Youth Development, with three of his teams finishing as champions. He was also in charge of the India U-23 team last year. He has previously managed Mahindra United, winning the National Football League in his maiden season. That established him as one of the premier coaches of the country as he went on to manage Pune FC, Salgaocar, DSK Shivajians and Churchill Brothers.

Miranda has been the assistant coach this season and was in charge of the Developmental Team till last season. Under his charge, the young Gaurs won the Goa Pro League and impressed in the second division league and the Durand Cup.

Miranda has been one of the mainstays of the Indian national team midfield, winning the SAFF Championships twice along with the AFC Challenge Cup. He has been equally successful at the club level with five league titles under his belt with Dempo SC.

Spaniard Roma Cullinera, meanwhile, has been appointed as the strength and conditioning Coach.

Speaking about the appointments, FC Goa president Akshay Tandon said: “We are confident in the abilities of our coaching staff to lead the team to a successful finish to the 2019-20 campaign. Derrick and Clifford have been with FC Goa for a few years and possess a deep understanding of the club and our philosophy.

404,2020/02/03,Indian Super League | Krishna’s twin strike floors Jamshedpur,"A brilliant Roy Krishna struck twice as ATK blanked an ineffective Jamshedpur FC 3-0 in a Hero Indian Super League clash at the JRD Tata Sports Complex in Jamshedpur on Sunday.

Krishna (2nd, 75th) and Edu Garcia (59th) were the goal-scorer for ATK as the visitors secured their ninth win of the season. ATK are now level on points (30) at the top of the table with Goa after 15 matches. Jamshedpur have seen their play-off hopes virtually end and are now seventh with 16 points.

ATK came out all-guns-blazing and broke the deadlock just two minutes into the game. The visitors’ high-voltage start was rewarded when an under-pressure Sandip Mandi played a weak pass to Memo Moura. Krishna was alert and the Fijian striker intercepted, charged towards the goal and slotted past Subrata Paul with ease.

Paul was next in line to err while trying to play out from the back. The goalkeeper tried to take a touch and kick the ball after collecting a back-pass from Memo but hit straight to Krishna. This time though, the striker sent his effort straight back at the keeper.

It was one-way traffic in the first half as ATK continued to threaten Jamshedpur’s goal. In the 26th minute, Edu outfoxed his marker and got into a one-on-one against Paul but the veteran custodian charged off his line and produced a crucial save.

After the half an hour mark, Paul’s desire to build-up play from the back went awry again. His pass, which was easily cut off, landed at the feet of Krishna who squared it to Edu. The Spaniard shifted his feet and shot but was denied by Joyner Lourenco at the goal line.

Jamshedpur’s fortunes went from bad to worse at the start of the second half when the referee ordered an early bath for Jitendra Singh. The defender failed to get the ball in a sliding challenge that halted Jayesh Rane’s counter-attack and received his second yellow card.

Edu, who was ATK’s creative source throughout the first half, turned up at the end of a fine counter-attacking move to double his team’s lead close to the hour-mark. The Spanish midfielder initiated the counter by finding Krishna ahead of him, then charged into the box to receive the striker’s cushioned return and finished into the net with aplomb.

With 15 minutes left in the game, Krishna sealed three points for his team. Prabir Das forwarded a pass to Edu Garcia who released a terrific through ball for Krishna who gave Paul no chance to make a save.

Jamshedpur had no response to ATK’s relentlessness all over the pitch and succumbed to their second consecutive defeat by a three-goal margin.",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/7cbl0q/article30723990.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/ISL-FOOTBALL-AKT-JAMFC,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/indian-super-league-krishnas-twin-strike-floors-jamshedpur/article30723991.ece
405,2020/02/03,Ansu Fati back among the goals as Barca see off Levante,"Barcelona teenager Ansu Fati scored twice to lead his side to a 2-1 win at home to Levante on Sunday, finding the net in a league game for the first time in more than four months and becoming the youngest player to net a La Liga double.

Fati, 17, latched on to a superb crossfield ball from Lionel Messi and fired between the legs of Levante goalkeeper Aitor Fernandez to give Barca a deserved lead on the half-hour mark.

The Guinea-Bissau-born forward promptly linked up with Messi again to double Barca's lead two minutes later, getting some good fortune as the ball bobbled through the legs of Fernandez and into the net.

Levante, who beat Barca 3-1 at home earlier this campaign, got a consolation goal in added time through Ruben Rochina and the forward had a chance to snatch an unlikely equaliser moments later but could not keep his shot under the bar.

The victory took second-placed Barcelona to within three points of leaders Real Madrid and ever so slightly eased the pressure on coach Quique Setien after last week's 2-0 defeat away to Valencia.

“This is all a dream, I dreamed of moments like this and I want to thank my team mates and my coach for giving me another opportunity,” Fati told reporters.

“It's not easy to come into a team like this as a young boy but I'm very grateful for the support I've had. I've still got a lot more to come, I like playing with Messi it's a dream to play alongside him, but I want to continue fighting for my place.”

Fati wrote himself into Barca's history books last August by becoming the club's youngest ever league scorer with a goal against Osasuna while still aged 16, making the most of a spate of injuries afflicting the team's forward line.

He struck against Valencia a month later before drifting out of the team, although he made history again last December with a goal against Inter Milan which made him the youngest player to score in the Champions League.

Injuries to Luis Suarez and Ousmane Dembele have given the youngster another run in the team and this was his fourth start under Setien, who pledged to give young academy players a chance when he succeeded Ernesto Valverde as coach last month.

Fati certainly made the most of this opportunity, dovetailing superbly with Messi and showing confidence in front of goal in contrast to fellow forward Antoine Griezmann, who squandered two clear chances to score in the first half.

He was not far from scoring a hat-trick, attempting an audacious bicycle kick late in the game which fizzed narrowly wide of goal.

406,2020/02/03,"Manchester City must do better next season, says Guardiola","Pep Guardiola refused to criticise his players but said they must do better next season after Manchester City wasted numerous chances, missed a penalty and had Oleksandr Zinchenko sent off in a 2-0 Premier League loss at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday.

The Spaniard took close to an hour to appear for his post-match news conference, prompting talk of a dressing down for his players after a sixth league loss of the season which left them 22 points behind leaders Liverpool.

But Guardiola was giving little away, bemoaning an unusually bad day at the office for his feared strike force that has helped City rack up more than 100 goals in all competitions this season.

“They (Liverpool) are unstoppable with a lot of points...now is the target for the (other) competitions and quality for the Champions League next season,” Guardiola said.

“The distance is so big and next season we have to do better.”

City had 18 goal attempts compared to Tottenham's three, the hosts taking the lead in the 63rd minute when debutant Steven Bergwijn volleyed home with Jose Mourinho's side's first attempt on target.

Despite playing the last 30 minutes with 10 men after Zinchenko's red card, City enjoyed nearly 70 percent possession overall but Sergio Aguero wasted several good chances and Ilkay Gundogan had a penalty saved by Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris before missing a sitter.

“We are there in the six-yard box and we are not able to score,” said Guardiola, whose side have failed to score in consecutive matches for the first time in his reign.

“One day it will click.”

With their hopes of a third successive Premier League title all over bar the shouting, Guardiola said motivation was not a problem for his side. The Champions League, however, is not their priority.

“We played well, but we lost the game. (Spurs) arrived in (the box) twice and scored two goals. I don't have too many things to say about our performance,” he said.

“We have to accept it and work on that. We need to analyse that. Football is to create chances and concede few. We played to win the game. I didn't see a lack of desire to win or that we're far away.”",football,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/3mza4b/article30722450.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03THGUARDIOLA,https://www.thehindu.com/sport/football/manchester-city-must-do-better-next-season-says-guardiola/article30722451.ece

Both sides created several chances but could not convert. The best chance fell to BUFC in the 83rd minute when Paromita Sit missed a sitter in a one-on-one situation.

Bangalore United defender Jagriti Nirmalkar suffered an injury to her shoulder after a collision. Jagriti was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was treated and discharged. Jagriti escaped major injury, but is set to miss at least one match.

409,2020/02/03,Farmers from Meghalaya undergo training at NRCB,"A group of about 15 farmers and prospective entrepreneurs from Meghalaya underwent an entrepreneurship training on value addition and marketing of banana at the National Research Centre for Banana in Tiruchi last week.

The training, sponsored by the Meghalaya Basin Development Authority (MBDA), provided a hands-on exposure to the participants, focussing on cultivation, production and marketing of value added products from green unripe and ripe bananas as well as from other parts of banana trees. They were oriented to other entrepreneurial issues such as getting licence from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India also.

Speaking at the valediction on Saturday, S. Uma, Director, NRCB, appreciated the trainees for selecting banana value addition as their business option as the fruit was an important commercial crop of the North Eastern state.

Fairborn Gathphoh, Business Development Officer, MBDA, thanked NRCB for hosting the training for the benefit of farming community, entrepreneurs and officials of Meghalaya.

V. Kumar, K. N. Shiva, and P. Suresh Kumar, course coordinators, observed that the trainees had learnt new skills on cultivation and value addition in banana and marketing of more than 30 different value added products such as banana fig, jam, RTS fruit juice, sweet chutney from ripened fruits; chips, sauce, flour, baby food, health drink, soup mix and bakery products from unripe fruits; pickle from flowers and candy from central core stem and fibre from pseudostem sheath.

410,2020/02/03,Isolation wards come up at Pudukottai GH,"Two isolation wards, one each for men and women, have been set up at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Pudukottai on Monday.

The facility was opened after the number of passengers who travelled to the city from China increased over the last few days.

“Although none turned up with symptoms of coronavirus, we are keeping a regular check,” said A.L. Meenakshi Sundaram, Dean. “There are a total of four beds in each of the two wards, and the numbers will be increased if necessary,” he added. The isolation ward is fully equipped with emergency drugs, dedicated ventilators and personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves.

A six-member team, consisting of a microbiologist, a physician, an anaesthetist, a thoracic physician and a nursing superintendent led by the Resident Medical Officer are on standby at all times, Mr. Sundaram said.

Prior to the establishment of the isolation wards, the doctors organised awareness programmes on hand washing techniques and maintaining hygiene at schools and colleges.

“One needs to regularly wash their hands, even if they believe they have not touched anything. They have to especially remember to wash their hands after sneezing or coughing. Many do not do that and it causes the spread of infections,” Mr. Sundaram said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/m08t2c/article30728616.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04ISOLATIONTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/isolation-wards-come-up-at-pudukottai-gh/article30728617.ece
411,2020/02/03,An eco-friendly sanitary napkin made out of plant-based fibre,"Students of a city college have manufactured an all-natural, biodegradable sanitary napkins using fibres from indigenous plants and plan to sell it at a low cost for the benefit of women.

Students of the Department of Botany, St. Joseph's College, have developed sanitary pads out of a succulent plant which grows widely in the hilly areas around Tiruchi. T. Francis Xavier, Assistant Professor, said that the idea came when the students visited Koli Hills for a college project. “We spent time with the villagers there and found that they were using these raw fibres wrapped with a cloth during menstruation. Drawing inspiration from their usage and struggle, four students from the third year batch attempted making pads using the material for their final-year project,” he said.

The four students, Bharanitharan. L., Vairavan. S., Samroy Terrance and V. Bhuvaneshwari sourced the plants, manually removed the fibres and processed them with antibacterial light-chemicals. After processing, they lined the fibres on both sides with organic cotton and covered the cotton layer with soft paper. The students also assembled a pad compressor to standardise the size and thickness of the sanitary napkin. “We set up an in vitro sterilisation chamber and also ensured that each pad is individually sterilized using UV light,” said Mr. Terrance. The students learned that this fibre naturally absorbs liquid and stores it in a gel form. This was why women were using it in the villages, they said. “The gel in factory-made sanitary napkins are made out of petroleum-by products and may cause rashes. They also take several years to decompose,” Mr. Xavier said. The entire manufacturing process, including the machinery cost ₹15,000. The students plan to sell the pads at ₹2 each.

Rev. M. Arockiasamy Xavier, Principal, said that the students were eager to breathe life into their idea and had approached him. “They have now applied for a patent. Several companies have also approached us to buy it. We are considering the offers as we want the product to benefit the poor too,” he said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/xftlfw/article30728586.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04NAPKINTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/an-eco-friendly-sanitary-napkin-made-out-of-plant-based-fibre/article30728587.ece
412,2020/02/03,Thanjavur Brahadeeswarar Temple: Why scaffoldings when latest technology is at hand?,"The use of scaffoldings to reach the top of the tower of the Sri Brahadeeswarar Temple in Thanjavur for carrying out renovation works, rather than using the latest machines available, has raised eyebrows among a section of devotees, especially in the wake of the deployment of a Bronto Skylift vehicle at the temple by the Fire and Rescue Service in view of the consecration ceremony.

Devotees such as S. Sankaran of Srinivasapuram, Thanjavur were unaware of the availability of such technologically advanced rescue vehicle until it arrived and a testing exercise was carried out by the Fire Service at the temple. He and many others wondered why the technology was not put into use by the organisers of the consecration related works instead of positioning this vehicle near the tower just for “rescue operations”, if any, to arise during the consecration.

The organisers have put up a massive iron scaffolding alongside the 216 feet high tower during the last week of December last year to dismantle and bring down the 12-feet high `kalasam’ from the top of the tower for gold plating work. Subsequently, additional platforms were put up atop the tower for re-installation and for the conduct of the `kumbabishekam’ on February 5.

As this additional structure remained for more than a month, devotees as well as some of the atheists have expressed concern that such a massive iron structure might cause some damage to the more than 1000-year-old granite temple tower.

Former Vice-Chancellor, Periyar Maniammai Institute of Science and Technology, Vallam, N. Ramachandran observed that the iron scaffoldings which might hardly be of around 5 tonnes in weight could not have any impact on the granite structure which is around 70,000 tonnes in weight. But when latest technology was available it could have been opted by the organisers of the event, he added.

Expressing similar view, an educationalist, R. Satyanarayana, said though the focus should be on spiritual practices there should not be any compromise in protecting even a very small piece of the edifice. Being a UNESCO declared World Heritage Site, utmost care should have been taken by the organisers whose action had left the edifice bear the weight of the iron scaffoldings for nearly a month.

Referring to the incident that had taken place during the dismantling of the `kalasam’ from the tower, where a policeman was pulled up by the Archaeological Survey of India and the District Police for capturing close view of the tower in his mobile and circulating it in the social messaging platform with comments about the possible causes for the damages on the structure, such incidents could also been avoided had the ASI and the `kumbabishekam’ organisers thought of availing the services of Fire and Rescue Service and requisitioned the Sky Lift at the beginning itself.

Responding to a query in this regard, retired soil mechanics professor of Anna University, A.Sargunan said when latest technology was available it could have been tried.

But, the organisers might have considered that erection of scaffolding with steps would be the easiest way, he added.

When contacted the organisers claimed that the scaffolding was erected as per the guidance from the ASI only and had left the issue of number persons to accompany the priest who is going to perform the consecration rituals at the top of the tower on February 5 and other matters to the Police.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/c78udp/article30728572.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04TEMPLETAN,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/why-scaffoldings-when-latest-technology-is-at-hand/article30728573.ece
413,2020/02/03,Karaikal - Peralam railway line work to commence this month,"With the Railway Board, New Delhi, sanctioning funds for laying a new line from Karaikal to Peralam falling under the Tiruchi Railway Division limits, the Southern Railway Construction Organisation (SRCO) has proposed to commence the work soon.

The work is expected to commence in the fourth week of this month, a senior railway officer told The Hindu. The SRCO has been carrying out soil test for a couple of months now on the 23-km stretch for laying foundation and to find out if the soil requires any treatment ahead of commencing the work.

The Railway Board, New Delhi, had sanctioned ₹177.69 crore last year for laying the new line from Karaikal to Peralam as material modification to the gauge conversion of Tiruchi - Nagore – Karaikal broad gauge section and specified the department-wise break up of the estimated project cost for its implementation.

Substantial portion of the funds is to be used for civil engineering works. A metre gauge line laid years ago from Karaikal to Peralam and which remained in existence till the 1980s was dismantled leading to suspension of train services in the section. Amid repeated demands from travellers and general public of Karaikal and those in its vicinity for revival of the rail link, the project of laying a new line was given nod and funds sanctioned by the Railway Board.

As part of the project, the SRCO would construct new railway stations along the stretch including one at Tirunallar where the famous shrine for Lord Saneeswarar is situated, attracting thousands of devotees from various parts of the country. The SRCO would require about three hectares of additional land at Peralam for the new alignment for laying the line, the official further said.

The stretch would have one major bridge which would be constructed across the 'Vanjiyaar' and about 77 minor bridges. The section would have three manned level crossing gates en route and subways. Once the new line is laid and commissioned for operation of train services, Peralam railway station which is in between Mayiladuthurai and Tiruvarur would become a junction.

The project is expected to take one year for completion, the official said adding that the new line from Karaikal to Peralam would substantially reduce time for freight trains proceeding from Karaikal to other destinations via Mayiladuthurai as they need not take a detour via Nagore, Nagapattinam and Tiruvarur to reach Mayiladuthurai which is the case at present. The new line would also lead to cut in fuel usage in diesel locomotives in both directions, the official further said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/4dgmr3/article30728554.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY04PERALAMTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/karaikal-peralam-railway-line-work-to-commence-this-month/article30728555.ece
414,2020/02/03,‘Double standards’ in dealing with malpractices in TRB and TNPSC exams flayed,"The Tamil Nadu Private Colleges Employees Union (TNPCEU) has flayed what it termed as “double standards” adopted by the State Government in dealing with malpractices in examinations conducted by the Teachers’ Recruitment Board (TRB) and the Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission (TNPSC).​

​The TNPCEU on Monday sought to know why the TRB was allowed by the government to issue a fresh notification after the detection of malpractices by 196 candidates in the exam conducted during 2017 for 1.33 lakh candidates (out of 1.7 lakh applicants), while permitting the TNPSC to go ahead with the process of recruitment for the rest of the applicants after imposing a life ban on the 99 candidates who had indulged in malpractices.​

​Also, the TRB was allowed to conduct its own enquiry while in the case of the malpractices detected in the TNPSC Group IV 2 A exam, the CB CID was entrusted with the task of investigation. In both cases, the malpractices had been committed through tampering of the OMR sheets, K.N. Karthick, founder of TNPCEU said.​

​Talking to mediapersons in Tiruchi, he said it was is only proper that the issue was resolved by TRB through a similar approach of banning the 196 candidates and conducting certificate verification for the others who had cleared the exam through proper means to fill the 1,058 vacancies.​

Citing information sourced through the Right to Information Act, Mr. Karthik said there were a total of 1,450 vacancies to be filled and that the fresh process of recruitment could be confined to the remaining vacancies.​

Ignoring the interests of those who had passed the TRB exam already through just means and necessitating their fresh application for the recruitment process was unreasonable. The TRB, he said, had even “flouted” an undertaking it had given in the Madras High Court that no money will be collected again from applicants who had already written the exam.​

​The requirement specified in the fresh notification for mandatory submission of experience and conduct certificates was impractical. “Those who source and submit fake certificates will have their way while others who are in the employment of private institutions will be at a great disadvantage to get the certificates at short notice,” he said, adding that, instead, the experience certificate and conduct certificate could be allowed to be produced at the time of certificate verification.​

​Moreover, the TRB has to prove its trustworthiness by determining the cause for the malpractice before embarking on a new method of recruitment process through the online application process and seeking to conduct computer-based exams in multiple sessions. “There are apprehensions about ambiguity in the concept of normalisation of scores,” Mr. Karthik said.​

The police team, who were posted for duty at the New Bus Stand area on the Tiruchi Road in connection with the Big Temple consecration bandobust duty, found two persons pasting the posters near the bus stand at around 6 p.m.

The posters said that the consecration of the Peruvudaiyar temple (Sri Brahadeeswarar Temple)should be conducted only in Tamil and there was no place for Sanskrit in the temple built by a Tamil Emperor for Tamilians.

Subsequently, the police team seized the posters carrying the name of Makkal Adhikaram from them and took the duo, identified as Deva and Balaji, to the police station. Deva claimed that he was the Thanjavur Town Secretary of the outfit.

Addressing the students on Saturday District Collector T. Rathna said that academic performance is bound to be high when the subjects are learnt with the same kind of enthusiasm shown in sports and other entertainment activities. A good performance in exam is linked to attentiveness in classroom, she said.

Kavignar Nandalala cited the example of late President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam to emphasise that students from government schools could scale great heights in life, to transform into good humans with a helping tendency.

Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax Department S. Jhanshi Elizabeth Rani urged students to mould their mindsets for excelling in competitive exams in future.

Addressing students on Friday, Superintendent of Police V. R. Srinivasan said sustained efforts would fetch results, and urged the students to shed the complex about studying in government schools. Success is all about hard work and confidence, he said.

417,2020/02/03,‘New business models need less investment’,"Convergence of multiple disruptive technologies has spawned a new business model where companies can grow without owning or investing much by way of capital, Shankar Venugopal, vice president, Mahindra and Mahindra, Technology innovation and knowledge management, and dean, Mahindra Technical Academy, Chennai, said on Saturday.

Preparing for a world that is exponential, non-linear and not easy to predict in terms of growth, needs creative thinking and the use of technologies like 3-D printing, artificial intelligence, robotics, automated vehicles, solar energy, solid state batteries and advanced materials and so on, Dr. Venugopal, an expert in heavy engineering, said, addressing members of the Tiruchi chapter of Young Indians (YI), Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), as part of their Annual Day programme.

Almost all existing industries are facing the prospect of being drowned by the wave of change caused by automation and digitisation, but “we have to redefine and rebuild the ecosystem of every industry that is facing change. The wave is there, and it is coming to us eventually, but is there a way for us to train ourselves to ride it? With exponential growth, we can make the disruptions caused by technology an enjoyable learning experience,” said Dr. Venugopal, while delivering a lecture on the topic ‘Learning how to grow exponentially and innovatively in a world governed by ‘VUCA’ (volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity)’.

Dr. Venugopal observed that business leaders needed direction in retraining workers to deal with the new scenario. Foreseeing a future where anyone can solve anyone’s problems, through the democratisation of knowledge, the speaker added that companies often miscalculated the potential of new ideas because they look so radically different from the existing ones. “Innovation is creating value from an insightful idea and bringing it successfully to the market,” said Dr. Venugopal.

418,2020/02/03,The long wait for a bus terminus,"Almost 10 years have passed since the Tiruchi Corporation came up with a proposal to set up a bus terminus at Srirangam. The problems faced by people and pilgrims visiting Srirangam have seen manifold increase since then. But, the terminus is yet to become a reality.

Setting up of a bus stand has been a long-pending demand of residents of Srirangam. When late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was elected to the Assembly from Srirangam constituency in 2011, the electorate had sought her intervention to set up a terminus to solve the frequent traffic jams and haphazard parking of vehicles on streets in the absence of a proper parking lots and bus terminus. The corporation subsequently unveiled a plan to build a bus stand in Srirangam in 2012-13 and earmarked ₹9 crore for the project and identified a 6.6 acre site near the Yatri Nivas on Panchakarai on the banks of the Kollidam.

But, the project was put in the back-burner after the disqualification of Jayalalithaa as MLA in 2014. After a gap of about seven years, the Corporation revived the proposal about a year ago and prepared a new Detailed Project Report for setting up the bus terminus at a cost of ₹ 23 crore for building the terminus. According to highly placed sources, the new proposal too ran into trouble with the Tamil Nadu Urban Finance and Infrastructure Development Corporation (TUFIDCO), which extends financial assistance to various infrastructural projects, raising queries over the suitability of the bus stand specially when it is aimed at handling buses playing between Srirangam and Central Bus Stand on a single route.

Following this, the civic body recently mooted an idea to convert the proposed bus terminus as multi-route terminus by accommodating buses on several routes, including Ariyalur, Jayankondam, Perambalur, Lalgudi, Pullambadi, Anbil and Mannachanallur. But, the delay in formalising the proposal with additional changes does not augur well for the residents of Srirangam.

“We have heard the proposal for long. But, I do not see anything tangible regarding the new bus stand. It seems that the proposal is only on paper. It is disappointing,” says S. Viswanathan, president, Thanneer, a resident of Srirangam.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/ni5vzz/article30722456.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY03BUSESTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/the-long-wait-for-a-bus-terminus/article30722458.ece
419,2020/02/03,CSR initiative empowers rural women,"Over 200 beneficiaries of the tailoring project launched during 2016 under BH Kothari Women Empowerment Scheme in Lalgudi area are now able to find regular source of income.

The Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative undertaken by Kothari Sugars and Chemicals with the support of Rotary Club of Kattur covered women living in villages surrounding Lalgudi. The project envisaged identifying women living below poverty line and empowering them with economic independence, thereby paving way for leading a secure life, D. Gopi, Assistant General Manager, Kothari Sugars and Chemicals Limited, said.

Basic tailoring skill has enabled women to work from home and earn a modest income for their independent survival. The beneficiaries of the training programme were able to source a huge order from M/s Vijay Garments , Tiruchi, for an appreciable volume, he said.

Arjun B. Kothari , Managing Director of M/s Kothari Sugars and Chemicals, who launched the training institute made sure that the manual sewing machines were retrofitted to operate with electrical power for reducing the work load and improve the productivity, to harness the advantages of generating higher revenue and exploring the possibility for undertaking job works from nearby towns and cities.

420,2020/02/03,Vendors on Nandhi Kovil Street play spoilsport,"The plan to construct a parking lot-cum-commercial complex on Nandhi Kovil Street is yet to kick off as street vendors have been resisting eviction by the city corporation.

The Tiruchi Corporation had drawn a plan to set up a parking lot for two-wheelers on Nandhi Kovil Street, to address the problem of haphazard parking in the crowded bazaar area, and to keep a check on street vendors.

Although the plan for the ₹97 lakh project, envisaged to be spent from the civic body's general fund, was drawn up early last year, the vendors have not been cooperative, corporation officials say. While the ground floor will be meant for a parking lot, the civic body is contemplating construction of a party hall or a commercial complex on the upper floors.

""We are yet to decide on it. The vendors are demanding space there, but there has been no concrete decision so far, especially due to interference from these vendor associations,” an official said.

There has been an ongoing issue with the vendors in the area.

The civic body recently resorted to erecting grills along the south end of the Theppakulam to avoid vendors in the area.

There are about 3,900 street vendors who have been identified in the city, and of them, about half the number of vendors possess identity cards. The ones who do not have the cards are refusing to cooperate, and are demanding that the civic body notify the places where they can set up shop. Although the civic body identified places in both Srirangam and Ariyamangalam zone years ago, the locations could not be finalised due to the dysfunctional state of the Town Vending Committee, sources said.

“On their part, the vendors are not allowing the elections to be held and are blaming the civic body for lack of cooperation”, the corporation official said. Vendors have moved the court several times and until the issue is sorted, the civic body can take no action, an official said.",tiruchirapalli,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/wlm2es/article30722452.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/TY03VENDORTRY,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Tiruchirapalli/vendors-on-nandhi-kovil-street-play-spoilsport/article30722453.ece
421,2020/02/03,Navy veteran for stronger Eastern Seaboard,"Admiral (retd.) Arun Prakash, former Chief of Naval Staff, has underlined the need for strengthening the Andaman and Nicobar Island Command and the Eastern Seaboard.

“It is time the Eastern Seaboard was strengthened to neutralise China which is seeing India as a potential adversary and partnering with Pakistan,” he said after releasing a compendium of articles titled ‘India’s Strategic and Security Concerns’ written by Commodore C. Uday Bhaskar at a programme organised by the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) and Visakhapatnam Public Library, here on Sunday.

“Traditionally, India is a non-aligned nation. We (the country) undertake overseas missions as per the guidelines of the United Nations (UN). We had allied with the erstwhile U.S.S.R. in the past and we can do the same in future. There is, however, no immediate need for it,” he observed.

Regional rivalry

He said that the Andaman and Nicobar Command remained a skeletal command and it should be strengthened in view of the “Malacca dilemma”. “All nations except the U.S. are wary of China. The rivalry between the U.S. and China interlocks with regional rivalry. India must draft its own security policy and strengthen the Eastern Seaboard and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands Command,” he said.

The former CNS spoke on his association with CPS, and commended the good work being done by the centre by organising debates and discussions on contemporary issues.

Speaking on the occasion, Commodore Uday Bhaskar said Visakhapatnam can become the fulcrum for the Eastern Seaboard. “If Vizag has to realise its full potential, the contribution of organisations like CPS has to be taken forward,” he said.

Agreeing with Commodore Uday Bhaskar’s observations, CPS Director A. Prasanna Kumar said that Visakhapatnam city had not witnessed even a single major communal conflict or other disturbances.

422,2020/02/03,Autobiography of former DGP H.J. Dora released,"Legislative Assembly Speaker Thammineni Seetharam released the autobiography of former Director General of Police of undivided Andhra Pradesh H.J. Dora, titled “Journey Through Turbulent Times” at YVS Murthy auditorium of Andhra University here on Sunday.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Seetharam described Mr. Dora as his role model. “Mr. Dora’s calm nature, decision making, the way he deals issues have been remarkable,” he said.

‘Trendsetter’

Participating in the programme, DGP D. Gautam Sawang said AP Police is considered as one of foremost police force in the country and Mr. Dora had set the trend.

“There was a time when police personnel used to have their guns by their bedside even while sleeping. Now, there is no such threats and violence in the State and Mr. Dora had played a key role achieving this. His contribution is known more outside the States than in A.P.,” said Mr. Sawang.

The DGP said the IPS officers who joined the department a decade ago would not know what type of struggles the police had faced in the past. “Mr. Dora has compiled his experiences in tackling a variety of challenges and situations as the DGP of undivided A.P. I recommend the book to all young IPS officers,” he said.

Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Dora said that the book was not just his story, but of all brave people who had marched along with him. “Some might have dropped down and some others were martyred. But at the end, we had achieved success,” he said.

Mr. Dora said this book could not be written without the support of his family members. He also recalled his student days in Andhra University and his association with the city.

Family members of Mr. Dora said that the book was released in Hyderabad last month. But, Mr. Dora, an alumnus of AU, has planned to release the book again in his alma mater.

Acharya Nagarjuna University former V-C V. Balamohan Das said that Mr. Dora was instrumental in eradicating a part of Left Wing Extremism (LWE) in the undivided A.P.

The deceased has been identified as Pangi Sintro (45), a farmer.

424,2020/02/03,Fishworkers demand harbour at Bhimili,"The National Fishworkers’ Forum has asked the government to expedite work on construction of a fishing harbour at Bheemunipatnam.

After a two-day executive meeting of NFF and a conference of the women’s wing held here recently, all-India chairperson Narendra R. Patil and general secretary T. Peter and district unit president Lakshmi told the media that fishermen were facing hardships as the development of a fishing harbour was being delayed due to procedural wrangles.

Mr. Patil said that by spending ₹50 crore to ₹100 crore, a modern fishing harbour with all modern facilities would become a reality in less than a year. He also said that the area was an ideal fish landing centre.

Demanding allotment of house-site pattas instead of assigned lands, Mr. Patil said that they also wanted guaranteeing of right to fish for all small and medium fishermen. He said they had decided to launch a vehicle yatra in May from Kutch in Gujarat to Kolkata via Kanyakumari, covering a distance of 6,000 km, to highlight the plight of fishworkers and create awareness on policies promoted in the context of Blue Revolution and Sagarmala.

Mr. Patil said the NFF had resolved to protect the coasts and livelihood and would push for a Coastal rights bill that could ensure the rights of fish-workers. He also demanded the withdrawal of notification issued by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change exempting the oil and gas firms from seeking environmental clearance.

‘Threat to livelihood’

“This is definitely a violation of basic tenets by not paying heed to the fishworkers’ voices in the path of development. The mariculture policy launched by the Central Government to encourage culture of fish also poses a threat to the livelihood of traditional fishermen,” he said, demanding its withdrawal.

The NFF also declared its resolve to fight for withdrawal of Marine Fisheries Regulation and Management Bill, claiming that it would jeopardise the interests of traditional fishermen, and sought uniform enforcement of the annual fishing ban to ensure conservation.",visakhapatnam,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/o5h4bl/article30721988.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03VZ3FISHWORKERS,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/fishworkers-demand-harbour-at-bhimili/article30721989.ece

In the run-up to the polling day, Delhi’s law and order has come under scrutiny after two incidents of firing took place in three days at the Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests in Jamia and Shaheen Bagh last week.

The ECI reviewed the preparations, including the law and order, with Delhi Chief Secretary, Police Commissioner and police officials of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

“Observers assured the Commission that preparations are on schedule and gaining momentum with respect to all requisite polling day arrangements. Adequate deployment of police forces and Central armed police force companies is being done and protest sites are under watch to ensure that no obstructions for polling personnel or voters would hamper movement on Saturday,” the statement said.

426,2020/02/03,"Delhi Assembly polls: Anti-CAA protests not a matter of chance, but an experiment, says Modi","In a veiled reference to the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh and elsewhere in the capital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday called them “experiments” based on a “design to dent the nationalistic heritage” of the country.

Speaking at the first of his two rallies to campaign for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in east Delhi days before the Assembly election, he accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress of engaging in a “political game” through such protests, which were also going on at Seelampur and in the vicinity of Jamia Milia Islamia.

“Are these protests and demonstrations just a matter of chance? No, they are not. They are not a matter of chance — they are experiments. Behind them is an intended political design aimed at denting the country’s nationalistic heritage,” he said.

“If this was a reaction against a law, after all the attempts the government has made to dispel fears about it, it would have ended. But the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress are playing a political game [through these protests],” he further said, naming the ruling AAP for the first time at a public event in Delhi.

The Constitution and the tricolour, Mr. Modi alleged, were being used as shields from behind which “wisdom” was being “distributed”, while efforts were being made to divert attention from “the real conspiracy” at play behind the scenes.

The Constitution, he argued, was the basis of the country’s jurisprudence which, in turn, formed the basis of courts that functioned as per the provisions of the Constitution and provided “justice to the people”. “Many cases and judgments, including those delivered by the Supreme Court, have held that protests and demonstrations must not lead to the disruption of life of the citizen, that public property must not be destroyed,” he said.

“The violence, damage to public property and arson which has occurred during these protests have been frowned upon by courts...but those engaged in these [protests] don’t listen to courts, don’t respect their verdicts...and are teaching the Constitution to the world,” Mr. Modi said. These, he argued, were causing inconvenience to the average citizen of Delhi who was “silent” but “angry.” The people of Delhi, he said, were aware of these being a symptom of “vote-bank politics”.

The “mentality” behind such protests, he added, needed to be checked “right now” before such protests occurred somewhere else again; Delhi, he said, could not be “left in this state of anarchy”.

“The sheer inconvenience the people of Delhi travelling to Noida are facing...the citizens of Delhi are watching all this. They may be silent but they understand the vote-bank politics behind it and are angry,” he said.

“It is imperative to stall this mentality right here. If the conspirator gain more strength, tomorrow they will block any other road, any other by-lane. We can’t leave Delhi in this state of anarchy. Only the people of Delhi can stop this. Every vote to the BJP has the strength to do that,” he said. Efforts to speed up the development of the capital would be made immediately after the formation of a BJP government, he said.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/news/4es4t4/article30726691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/vbk-Modi-SKP,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/bjp-will-provide-pucca-houses-to-all-poor-families-by-2022-pm-at-delhi-rally/article30726655.ece

429,2020/02/03,Delhi CEO urges youth to exercise their franchise on February 8,"Delhi Chief Electoral Officer Ranbir Singh on Sunday asked the youth of the city to exercise their franchise in the State Assembly elections, scheduled on February 8.

Speaking at a voter awareness event in Connaught Place’s Central Park, Mr. Singh said: “It is our right to vote and it is useless if we don’t exercise when the time comes. We live in a democracy and it will have no meaning if we don’t cast our vote in elections — whether it is parliamentary or Assembly.”

He added: “A democracy means that the key to power is in hands of the people. Your vote represents that key. So you must use this key to elect the most suitable person as your leader.”

Mr. Singh said people should try to research about candidates before casting their votes.

‘Choose carefully’

“You have to be careful in choosing your leader. When we go to the market, we compare two products before buying. But when it comes to voting, people don’t adopt a similar tactic. They randomly vote. So you must think carefully before voting,” he added.

The Delhi CEO added that many people must have planned to go on vacations a day before the voting and asked them to reconsider their plans.

“There will be no holiday without voting because the holiday has been given for this purpose. So you can celebrate your holiday only after voting,” he added.

The event also saw a group of artistes performing over a dozen songs composed by music maestro A.R. Rahman. The group sang and danced to Mr. Rahman’s tracks likes “Kehna Hi Kya”, “Tu Hi Re”, “Jai Ho”, “Dil Se”, “Jiya Jiya” and others.",delhi 2020,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/smeyy9/article30723899.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/DE02CEO,https://www.thehindu.com/elections/delhi-assembly/delhi-ceo-urges-youth-to-exercise-their-franchise-on-february-8/article30723900.ece
430,2020/02/03,The sky as your companion,"It is past 7 pm and the winter sky has turned dark. Meena S zips in her two wheeler to the Reserve Line Police ground. Her six-year-old daughter in tow, both walk into the newly-opened fitness centre under the sky.

Meena takes her place at the shoulder wheels as her daughter prances around the equipment reciting and revising Tamil poems she learnt at school. The little girl is well within her mother’s visible gaze and audible range and it helps Meena to relax and focus on her exercises for the next one hour.

“I have been a little out of shape for some time. This gym is a precious gift,” she says and adds, “Even though I wished to go for morning walks, the daily rush hours made it impossible. We stay in the Police staff quarters here and now it is convenient for me to get some exercise done on my way back home.”

Barely a fortnight into the routine, Meena says she already feels the difference in her body and mood. On days she finishes work early, she also brings along her neighbours, who are wives of her colleagues in the department. While Meena has enrolled herself as a member at a nominal fee of ₹100 a month, those who drop by randomly are required to pay ₹10 for an hour. And few days ago, some domestic tourists walked in as well.

Women talk and laugh their way to fitness using the 14 different equipment installed that help relieve neck, back and shoulder pain, reduce abdominal fat, strengthen nerves and build muscles and relax the body. Amudha Valli, who is with the Special Police Battalion, is in charge of the gym. She keeps a hawk’s eye on every member, checking their postures, increasing their reps, timing their rest periods and usage of equipment.

In a short time, the 2,100 sq.ft rectangular space fenced on the sides and roofed with asbestos, has turned into a happy space for close to 100 regular members and many occasional users. Chandra Jeyaseelan has been a regular walker at the ground for the past 10 years. “The gym was inaugurated before Pongal and every evening, I watched the number of women grow and got inspired to join,” she says. Four days ago Chandra enrolled herself for a month and says, this is the best thing that happened to her. “I could never afford the hefty fee at private gyms and this fulfils my work-out needs perfectly.”

The idea to have the huge parade ground — that has been a hub for thousands of morning and evening walkers and joggers — double up as an open air gym came from the Madurai Police Commissioner S Davidson Devasirvatham and now the users can’t thank him enough. “I mooted the idea based on a pending request from women police personnel,” he says. In the Reserve Line area, there is a 1600 sq.ft modern gym with latest hydraulic equipment but exclusively for men.

“Women are caught up with their jobs and family and forget to think about themselves. I felt this was a good way to encourage them to take care of themselves as the location would suit our staff and members of public as well who are already frequenting the ground,” says Davidson.

After his transfer to Madurai 18 months ago, he says, he occasionally went for his walks to the Sundaram Park which has a Walker’s Club run by the residents of Lake Area and the Corporation-maintained Eco Park. “I was impressed by the outdoor gyms installed at both these parks and worked out a Self-Sufficiency Scheme with funds from the Corporation and the Collectorate and we got the gym ready at a cost of ₹5 lakh.”

“The fee is collected for maintenance but more importantly to encourage and enthuse the users to keep coming,” says ACP (Intelligence Service) Siva Kumar, who is the overall in charge of both the gyms installed by the police. The open gym is open to only senior citizens (55 years to 70 years) from 5.30 am to 9.30 am and exclusively for women in the evenings.

“We hope more people will join and nobody will stop exercising regularly now,” says Amudha Valli. She says working women who come late from work especially, tell her that they feel energised now and are relieved that they can bring their children who can play around. “There is a right attitude and positive energy among all here. Whether it rains or shines, I feel motivated to work out for as little or as long as I like,” says Chandra.

Apart from burning calories with the outdoor workout that mixes a variety of cardio, polymetric and strength-based exercises with the press-ups, squats, rowing, cycling, twisting and cross-training, it is the feeling of achievement among members that is so satisfying, says Amudha. “When people feel comfortable in a space, they participate more. Visit us after three months and you will surely see the difference in all our members.” she smiles.",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/vecz2k/article30726923.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/1a,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/what-is-the-usp-of-an-open-air-gym-affordability-and-easy-simple-access-say-the-members-of-the-recently-opened-facility-on-reserve-line-police-ground/article30726927.ece
431,2020/02/03,Hemis in Hyderabad promotes sustainable luxury in the form of hemp,"Hemis, an unexplored town in the Leh district of Jammu and Kashmir left an indelible impression on Prashansa Shahani. So much that when the 28 year old started her own store in Banjara Hills, she named it after her own personal Shangri-La. “It’s the most amazing place I’ve ever been to. It has an art festival and all the culture and colour one can hope to see. So, the name of our store takes inspiration from one of the most beautiful places on earth.” she reveals.

Started along with Varun Gupta and Karthik Aysola, the store is the first one in India to manufacture couture and lifestyle products from legalized industrial hemp. The trio have been working in making fabric from industrial hemp for a couple of years and now have decided to enter the retail space through Hemis. The 1200 sqft store has a range of products from chic clothing for both the sexes, to shoes and juttis from hemp fabric and vegan leather to accessories, wellness and nutrition products, stationery and a minimalistic décor range.

With almost five years of research, the entrepreneurs were well versed with the moods and the magic of industrial hemp. Varun reels off its benefits: “It’s eight times stronger than cotton, gets softer with usage, uses less water and is made without any insecticide or pesticide. Its breathable, anti-bacterial and ideal for a tropical country like ours..” Prashansa explains that hemp blends well with materials as diverse as bamboo, silk and organic cotton. “Hemp is naturally good for the skin as its rich in moisture.”

Something Green A Eco-Collective curated for those conscious about environment, the one-day pop-up has 8 to 10 eco-friendly labels like Swaas, Studio 123, Love Handles & Co and Tree House amongst others from Bengaluru and Cuttack, apart from city-based ones, participating. Labels pertaining to skincare, wellness, stationary, food, apparel and accessories to home furnishings will be present at the event on February 9, 11 am to 7 pm @ Hemis, Road Number 12, Banjara Hills

Versatility all around

The array of products showcased at the store is testimony to the facts Varun shares. From clothes in solid colours which are sleekly tailored to body lotions and balms apart from lifestyle products like laptop sleeves, scarves and bags show the versatility of the fabric. The notebooks made from hundred percent hemp paper make for ideal gifts while the wellness range with hemp hearts are ideal source of vegan protein. The range start from ₹100.

Prashansa adds, “When it comes to its use as a fabric, we’ve blended it to unique results. We’ve developed ikat fabric and hand-made kalamkari options as well.”

The challenges enroute the opening of the store have been many. Varun smiles and recalls, “A lot of trial and error went in. Also, zeroing in on the right people took time.” Another challenge is the high pricing (their shirts for men start at ₹2500) which they gradually hope to bring down.

They have partnered with September Shoes to create an exclusive line of footwear showcasing hemp and vegan fabric, and with social ventures like Safa to create accessories. Their future plans include expanding their range of wellness products, a clothing range for children and a range of saris.

Is Hyderabad ready to wear hemp on the sleeve? “More than ready,” they smile and add, “There is a lot of curiosity. And the initial response has been exciting.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/aorh5i/article30726881.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/HYM03HEMIS-1,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/hemp-store-hemis-hyderabad-eco-collective-event/article30726885.ece
432,2020/02/03,Talents transformed: Meet the members of trans women band Spicy Girls,"The year: 2011. The stage: People’s Plaza on Necklace Road. A group of 10 dancers dressed in black performed a medley of Bollywood item numbers. As they sizzled to the song ‘Mayya Mayya’ (from Guru), and the crowd called it a hot, spicy performance. Olga B Aaron, member of the Transgender Welfare Board suggested the name Spicy Girls to the group. That name stuck to the eight-member trans women band in city that had formed in 2006.

In these nine years, the group has been able to break free of society’s prejudices and create a platform to raise community-related issues, perform skits, musical shows, all geared to send out message against being stigmatised for their identity and show that their talent is much more than grooving to item numbers. One of the band’s recent accomplishments was that three of its members — Muvvala Chandramukhi, Priya Murthy and Rachana Mudraboina — sang a number in Rajinikanth’s Darbar.

Spunky statements

The band’s eight members sing and dance at their community events, Pride parades, gender rights seminars and conferences. In Swabhimaan Yatra, the traditional Bathukamma number highlighted their issues — Udyogaalu ledu uyyalo, undadaniki illu ledu uyyalo, prabhutvan pattichikovatam ledu uyyalo, mamalni choodandi uyyalo...

M Chandramukhi | Photo Credit: By arrangement

Chandramukhi had initiated the idea of creating a band. An extrovert thriving on social life, she was born as Rajesh M Kumar and faced emotional and physical abuse. Her new life as a woman unleashed her talent. With a microphone in hand, she transforms into a different person — singing, acting, anchoring shows and analysing issues. “Though my family didn’t support me, it gave me freedom to be on my own. My aunt helped me. My mother couldn’t come out of societal boundaries, but now she proudly says that she has two daughters, one son and a transgender.” She recollects, “As a transgender I didn’t want to only beg and sleep on the roads. I was a graduate and wanted to take up a job to have my own identity.” Chandramukhi got an employment with Pehchaan — India HIV AIDS Alliance and became a transgender manager for unified Andhra Pradesh. From reading news on 99TV, analysing issues and doing YouTube videos, she got an opportunity to work in the film Nenu Raja Nene Mantri directed by Teja.

Priya who is a post-graduate, trained in Kuchipudi and is now a Bollywood dancer, theatre artiste, anchor and singer. Her show Gadasari Atta Sogasari Kodalu with Chandramukhi are loaded with witty banter. “We make sure our spectators do not get bored,” she smiles. As a freelance consultant, researcher and activist, she works for HIV/AIDS prevention, human rights sensitisation programmes and trains volunteers in the field. She says, “We transgenders have many hidden talents but struggle for opportunities. When I listen to Radio FM channels, I feel I can perform better than them; I want to be an RJ.” Her determination to forge an identity stems from her anger and pain. “One lecturer said, ‘You are a kojja (eunuch) and will live like this only’. Deeply hurt, I challenged him that I will work on a laptop sitting along with him. It took me eight years to rise to the challenge.”

A native of Bheemavaram, Jasmine (born Venkata Satyanarayana) has been living in Hyderabad for 25 years. “I love to dance,” she says. “We freelance and hence are able to give out time and money. Talented transpersons can join the band but they have to be committed. This is a talent platform to showcase our skills. We are not dependent on anyone, from costumes to make-up, we plan everything on our own.”

Reaching out

Besides Hyderabad, the Spicy Girls have performed in Chennai and Delhi too, and out up around 10 performances (mostly gender-based skits) in a year.

Rachana, one of the band’s founders is happy with the response to nine episodes of her YouTube channel Trans Vision. Their videos in Telugu, Urdu and Kannada have English subtitles. She says, “The fact that there were no negative comments and brought visibility to trans issues is an achievement. In Karnataka, our videos were used for gender sensitisation. Our own struggle and survival has brought us here.”

The channel’s new series, anchored by Chandramukhi, will educate children and adults on how to address trans people. One of the episodes asks people why they laugh on seeing transgenders. “When we talk of inculcating gender sensitisation education from childhood, we should also speak about transgenders, then they will seen as normal people, without bias.”

Though the band shot into limelight with Darbar, its members are not rapidly rising. The onus is on the community to create a path for others to follow. “We encouraged the spark of talent in Chandramukhi, Jasmine and Nithya and made them realise life is not for begging and prostitution. More girls have to come forward to bring changes. They could anchor, dance, run beauty parlours or design dresses for celebrities,” says Priya adding success is still a distant dream. “ We cannot show different job opportunities, as we too are struggling. It is a slow process; nothing can be achieved unless society changes.”",life & style,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/xnpahu/article30724691.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/hym03trans5,https://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/spicy-girls-is-hyderabad-based-trans-women-music-band/article30724700.ece
433,2020/02/03,This hidden trail leads to a once-dying lake restored by the community in Chennai,"In 2016, bird watchers had enthusiastically reported sightings of 100 greater flamingos at Perumbakkam lake. “August is not the migratory season, yet the birds have come,” KVRK Thirunaranan of Nature Trust had said, crediting water levels and abundance of fish to the flamingoes’ choice of destination. The black-tailed godwit, a near-threatened bird species had also arrived at the lake, as had more than 30 ruff birds.

Eventually, however, garbage, construction rubble and water extraction through wells took over and the birds stayed away. For the first time in remembered history, the lake had more mud patches than water. Around that time, an alarmed group of residents got cracking to save their beloved lake. Stop sewage/garbage dumping, prevent private suppliers drawing water from the farm wells, they had appealed. Desilt, mark the boundary, plant trees and raise an embankment!

Their prayer was heard. In October last year, the lake got a makeover — centuries of mud deposit was scooped out and collected into a high bund along the open side of the lake. With the generous rainfall that followed, the lake basin filled up and plants grew on the sides as the water body waited for fish and birds to re-discover it. The 2-kilometre causeway is now a beautiful trail, whether you walk it for work or leisure.

We went exploring. On the Sholinganallur – Perumbakkam Main Road we took the second left after the Advent church, and drove till we reached the bifurcation point. Into the Subhash Chandra Bose Road, with Chittalapakkam at our end, we turned right. And stopped. In the Perumbakkam Reserve forest to the left, we spotted a mysterious board that said “ASI Monument Protected.” The “monument” was nowhere, probably hidden in the thick overgrowth. A hundred metres ahead we stopped again to click the blooming Senkanthal, our state flower, and a huge 10-foot-high termite hill. Then we drove into Indira Nagar Masudi Street and parked near a gentle slope to the right.

The lovely check dam that stores Okkiyam canal water welcomed us. The roaring waterfall it creates during monsoons is now a trickle, but no matter, it makes crossing and climbing the bund at its far end easier. We hoisted ourselves up a slippery slope, and voilà! We were on the heavenly trail, flanked by water on one side and foliage on the other. It was a long, beautiful walk, at the end of which we found the bund branching out to Veerabhadra Nagar on the left and New Perumbakkam on the right.

From here, the track to Perumbakkam carves a mini lake of sorts to the left. It receives the run-off water coursing through a sluice gate, making the trail scenic all the way to the town.

This trek was more about flora than fauna. On the dry side along the trail, you can list out a forest of different trees. We identified odhiyam, panai palmyra, nuna (Indian mulberry), aamanaku (castor), usilai, nochi (white- chaste shrub), nerinjil (puncture vine) and the martynia annua plant with beautiful bulb-like white flowers with a violet tinge. Call it cat’s claw as it resembles feline paws.

If you are into medicinal plants, you could spend all morning identifying keezhanelli, mudakathan, nerinjal, thoodarvalai and a host of others. And in the water, don’t miss hyacinth, hydrilla and lily. And yes, the birds were there – drongos and a flock of egrets – and others can’t be far behind.

For cleaners N Malathi and S Shanthi, the bund is a short-cut to work in the New Perumbakkam households — “The walkway isn’t popular,” they said. Near the check dam we caught men collecting live food for their fish tanks.

For the residents though, this is a dawn of restoration. “Clean up, and the place will remain so,” said an optimistic Parthi Nagarajan, who with friends had “embarked on a journey with Environmentalists Foundation of India [EFI]” to protect the lake with crowd-sourced funding. “We want a walkway built, trees planted and the industries opposite punished for letting effluents under the road. Sewage dumping must go and we need an entire eco-system built around the bund.”

“Precious resource,” said Dr. TD Babu, Marine Biologist. “Let’s help it flourish by preventing open defecation and plastic and rubble dumping.”

434,2020/02/03,The coronavirus: Are your pets safe?,"The World Health Organization has declared an international public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak. But leading pulmonologist and director of Chest Research Foundation, Pune, Dr Sundeep Salvi, says there is no need to panic. At the time of publishing this story, India has so far confirmed three positive cases of Novel Coronavirus. However, precaution and self-protection is in the interest of all. “It is important to understand how the disease spreads, contain fear through awareness and strengthen our body’s defence against the infection,” he says.

With all attention focussed on human transmission now, the fact that coronavirus is zoonotic (meaning the disease starts in animals first before spreading to humans) cannot be overlooked. Veterinarians say there are no epidemiological (spread) signs to alert them yet, but taking care of your pets is equally important.

Dr Chiro Priyo Mitra, the founder of Gurgaon Pet Clinic and Dr Suresh Christopher, the Joint Director (Animal Husbandry) in Madurai, clear a few doubts.

Surveys carried out so far, have shown high prevalences of coronaviruses in animals. How vulnerable are my pet dogs and cats?

It’s important to know that while there have been feline and canine CoVs reported, they were not in India. “When people bring in animals from other countries, they are compulsorily quarantined in ports and airports here first,” says Dr Christopher. When pets fall ill, Dr Mitra says they do not spread the infection, because they’re mostly indoors.

Can my pet dog be a carrier?

Technically speaking, yes, though again, since there’s no reported case, there’s no need to worry. Dr Mitra says that CoV infections spread not only via the air and the respiratory tract, but also if contaminated faecal matter comes in contact with another creature’s mouth. And if your pet is on the road for a walk, at dog farms or kennels or even inside condominiums for a poop, there is the risk of infection, but again, since the virus has not been seen as yet in animals in India, there is no reason to panic. Also, Dr Christopher says CoV infections in dogs and cats are less severe.

Can I get it from my pet?

The Wuhan crisis is suspected to have started from the seafood market there. While human beings are not the hosts for the CoV, the intermediary host is yet to be known, says Dr Christopher. He explains that, “The Corona group of viruses requires a lot of hard work to go through passages of one primate to the other. However, the simplicity of their structure makes them strong. They evolve, and after genetic mutation, they change strains and the primary host may or may not survive.”

If I am harbouring the CoV infection, can my dog or cat get it from me?

Dr Christopher says there has been no reported case of reverse transmission.

How can I keep my pet safe?

Dr Mitra recommends getting the vaccination. So far, a prophylactic vaccine is available to prevent CoV infection only in dogs and it has been used since the outbreak of SARS in 2003. “Like polio drops given to children before the age of five, the CCV (Canine Coronavirus Vaccine) can be administered in dogs as per their age, breed and health in a schedule suggested by the vet. It can also be included in combination vaccines to protect dogs from other viruses,” he says.

Are the zoos safe for a visit?

Yes. “Even in animals in the zoo, we look for new or unusual clinical signs or deaths. There is no input on animal sickness so far and zoos are not declared high-risk places for a visit,” says Dr Christopher.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/5teexf/article30725140.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03mppet1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/the-coronavirus-are-your-pets-safe/article30725142.ece
435,2020/02/03,Living in a time of noise,"Lohri, the festival of the winter solstice, was last month. Traditionally, it sees cold-weather-weary people gather around a fire to say goodbye to temperatures nearing freezing point. People gather informally around a fire, singing songs, throwing fistfuls of revri and groundnuts into a fire. There’s fun and laughter, and some food and drink. Mostly, a way to connect with friends, neighbours and Nature.

Thinking of the times she had celebrated it at home, a friend who had just moved to a flat in Gurugram said she was planning to go down to her colony celebration. When the time came, she couldn’t bear to go, because of the very-loud music that played, halting communication with even the person standing next to you, and getting you to grab and OD on the nearest food and drink. It was all headache-inducing and quite avoidable, she felt.

Noise pollution aside, that loudness is a reflection of the times we live in. The person who shouts wins the argument, the biggest horn on the Delhi roads makes people move (not the siren of an ambulance), the most extravagant advertising campaign sells the goods and even gathers goodwill. If you’re not seen and heard, you might as well not exist. We have collectively become the me-me-me generation.

Blank Noise, an organisation that encourages women to be present in public spaces, in an effort to say these belonged to all, encourages a silent being. You don’t shout or make a speech, or even a statement — you simply show up and occupy a space. Today, even though sloganeering is a part of the anti-CAA/NRC movement, it is the many who don’t say too much who make up the crowd. They stand silently in support, paint pictures, hand out food. Deepika Padukone said nothing at JNU — she came. Unfortunately, we value such people little.

When I was a child, I was a bit of a wallflower — always considered bad. “Speak up,” I was often told, while I quailed in the corner, hoping no one would ask me to. As a society that has now suddenly found value for silent retreats (everyone wants to do a 10-day Vipassana course), we don’t do so well appreciating people who don’t say much, brands that work quietly without the PR amplification, NGOs at the grassroots who don’t do media sound bites.

As the noise pollution rises, at many levels, we get more and more stressed, feeling the need to cry out louder than the next person, organisation, community. Perhaps if we all just did our work quietly, we’d feel at peace with ourselves and the world, less in competition with other people, and more in tune with our own bodies — minds, heart, and soul.",health,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/2w5grj/article30724959.ece/ALTERNATES/LANDSCAPE_615/03mphorn1,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/health/living-in-a-time-of-noise/article30724960.ece
436,2020/02/03,Meet Ladakh’s first gynaecologist Dr Tsering Landol,"Over the phone from her house in Changspa, Leh, Dr Tsering Landol’s voice is tender, almost frail. It is difficult to imagine that she has delivered babies in freezing temperatures, fought cultural myths surrounding menstruation, and pioneered advancements in women’s health in the icy region. For her efforts, the 75-year-old was recently awarded the Padma Bhushan.

Back in 1979, when she joined Leh’s SN Memorial Hospital, she was the first and only practising gynaecologist from the region. SN Memorial was the only major district hospital then, and Dr Landol soon rose to become the head obstetrician until she quit in 2003. Three years later, the Government recognised her efforts and she received the Padma Shri.

Today, every Thursday, she conducts a voluntary clinic with the Ladakh Heart Foundation. “I may have retired, but I’m still physically and mentally fit. So even though I’m too old for emergency cases, I still want to offer whatever I can to my patients. It is very much needed in this region,” she says.

There is evident pride in Dr Landol’s voice as she lists the extensive department of SN Memorial Hospital: “We now have pathologists, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, psychiatrists…”

This is vastly different from the time she practised (“asman aur zameen ka farak,” as she puts it). To get even central heating for the hospital was a challenge. “It is essential for us to keep an optimal temperature of 30 degrees while delivering the baby. We would improvise and use the Kashmiri hammam system (that involves dry hot air baths) to keep the mother warm,” she says.

The lack of oxygen at birth was another major problem: “There would not always be enough stock of oxygen cylinders, which could be dangerous in cases of prolonged labour or asphyxiated babies. Transporting these cylinders was also not easy.”

Her field emergencies, in case of irregular deliveries, and medical camps would take her to remote areas, where she would meet women, interact with them, and advise them about their diets and hygiene.

Here she observes another change, other than technological progress. “There used to be so many myths regarding women’s reproductive health,” she says, adding that there is better awareness now.

As a child, she remembers noticing how her mother was treated as an untouchable after her delivery, and given food in separate vessels. “I innately felt there was something wrong with that, but couldn’t say anything. As I grew up, I understood things better,” she says.

While in college, she decided that having a woman doctor, who could understand women’s problems, with whom women could put aside their shyness and speak freely, was the need of the hour. “Around me, I would see issues like mothers who died while giving birth, abortions, UTIs, anaemia, and so on.”

At 13, she met doctors at a school function, and it only strengthened this desire to be one. “With their stethoscopes around their necks, they were always so impressive!” she says, her voice rising slightly.

Train local

To bring about these changes required having honest and dedicated conversations with women. In her four decades of experience, Dr Landol has found communication with patients the most important part of the job.

Ladakh, now a union territory, spans over 59,000 square kilometres and is yet very sparsely populated. “The population is scattered and you have to understand the background of each person you are speaking to: their family situation, their economic class…”

Which is why she believes that it is very important to have dedicated local doctors. “It is because I am a Ladakhi that I was able to identify with the issues the women were facing, speak to them in Ladakhi, encourage them to open up about their problems and convince them about the solutions.”

Dr Landol herself graduated from Srinagar, and went on to train, for four months in the UK, sponsored by the British Council, and in Delhi. Two of her friends from the UK are currently volunteering to bring cervical screening to SN Memorial Hospital, and have donated equipment for this.

While she is thankful for the work foreign and national NGOs have done so far — for doctors from abroad, like the UK and Singapore, conducting camps in areas that are difficult to access — she emphasises that the need to train local doctors is more important.

This idea of self-sustainability was instilled in her at quite a young age. Having grown up in an agrarian family, she says, “We don’t belong to a big city… So we were taught everything about how to sustain yourself — gardening, farming, sewing, knitting, everything.”

She carries this philosophy into her personal life as well.
